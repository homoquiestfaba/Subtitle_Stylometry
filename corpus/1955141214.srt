00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,460
RUSSIAN GANG WARS

2
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,602
UKRAINE, September, 1993.

3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,607
Was it Babai?

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,965
Rasp's work.

5
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,367
<i>Time to bring the old man in.</i>

6
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,002
Birulya got killed during the arrest.

7
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,964
The moron went for his gun

8
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,810
and got three bullets.

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,610
He's now to blame.

10
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,121
You were just helping out.

11
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,130
He shot those guys with Kalashnikovs.

12
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,563
Then you finished them off with a Luger.
But they were already dead.

13
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,728
You get

14
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,002
what I'm offering you?

15
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,850
Life!

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,322
Think fast or it'll be too late.

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,723
<i>0therwise</i>

18
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,362
<i>it's death sentence.</i>

19
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,408
<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,365
<i>Testify against Rasp.</i>

21
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,406
<i>Then we'll bury him</i>

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,001
<i>like the dog he is.</i>

23
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,405
Hey.

24
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,686
Hey, Kid.

25
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,166
Hi.

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,361
Are your guys with you?

27
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,971
Yeah.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,242
Lucky them, they got nothing to worry about.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,682
They call her "Alien."

30
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,360
She's now in the Czech Republic.

31
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,924
You know her, don't you?

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,325
Yeah, she's Babai's sister.

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,045
Exactly.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,720
She is

35
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,049
his only kin.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,561
They grew up in an orphanage together.

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,907
Now she is in the Czech Republic.

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,168
I already told you that, didn't I?

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,728
Find her and bring her back.

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,849
You were stationed there
for three years, right?

41
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,930
Still remember the language? Anyway...

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,566
Here's ten grand.

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,284
Find Karasik in Prague.
He'll get you the guns.

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,323
Bring her back.

45
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,524
Babai will keep his mouth shut
and the cops will be screwed.

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,841
Here's a photo,

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,929
so you can show it around.

48
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,380
Crack empties your head.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,844
It's like Torricelli's vacuum.

50
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,300
I trust you, Kid.

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,126
<i>The Ukraine used to be a part of Russia.</i>

52
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,767
<i>All former Russian territories
are subject to the laws of Russia.</i>

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,770
<i>We never invaded other territories
and do not plan to do so.</i>

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm leaving.

55
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,809
I hope you never come back!

56
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
Want some sunflower seeds?

57
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Yeah.

58
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,883
<i>Soon the Russian flag</i>

59
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,209
<i>will be raised again</i>

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,121
<i>in all the neighboring territories...</i>

61
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,880
What do you want me to write on the wreath?

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,448
You only write in Russian?

63
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,325
I write in many languages.

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
Can you write in Czech?

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,327
I can write in Russian and Ukrainian.

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,409
Fine, then write in Ukrainian

67
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,331
but use Czech letters.

68
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,249
Get it?

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,287
Put a tick above the letter C.

70
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,404
What do you want me to write?

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
You didn't get it?

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,406
"See you soon."

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,489
Shut up, smart ass.

74
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,963
Write the following:

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,569
"To beloved."

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,247
"Jacob Toporchek"

77
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,249
"from friends."

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,084
Put it in the trunk. Push the button.

79
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,408
What the fuck is this?

80
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,126
Hands off, you hear me?

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,487
Hey! What the fuck? Are you nuts?

82
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,087
What the hell?

83
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,089
That fucker flipped us off.

84
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
Bad luck.

85
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,651
So this fucker in the front seat goes nuts.

86
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,162
Says, "if I'm wrong, kill me, kill me!"

87
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,011
So the guy in the back with the bitch

88
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,407
whips out his gun. Bang!

89
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,329
Shoots him straight between the eyes.

90
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,002
The guy drops under the seat!
The bitch squeals,

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,601
"Let me go! I don't know nothing."

92
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,086
"I've seen nothing!"

93
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,681
Then the other one crawls
from under the seat,

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,405
all bloody and shit,

95
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,046
holds his head like this,

96
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,483
screams, "Fucking animals!"

97
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,963
Everyone stares at him,
the bitch is out cold!

98
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,525
Did he use a revolver?

99
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,563
Yeah! The gunpowder

100
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,966
got wet.

101
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,845
The moron ended up with
like a horn on his head.

102
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,327
Happened to me once.

103
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,807
The bullet was too soft, made of lead.

104
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,128
Flattened against his forehead.

105
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,561
Time to say goodbye to our buddy here.

106
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
Go!

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,485
Come on, guys,
you aren't really gonna kill me?

108
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,444
For what? For this?

109
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,205
On your knees!

110
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

111
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,927
I said, on your knees!

112
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,920
Come on.

113
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,882
Stop here at the sign.

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,007
Booger, get the wreath from the trunk.

115
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,725
Got it.

116
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,442
Whiz, you're with me.

117
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,526
I don't get it.

118
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,449
Who's in charge here?

119
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,165
The beasts!

120
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,089
They control the crossing.

121
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,725
You want something?

122
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,888
Yeah, I want something.

123
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,280
What do you want?

124
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,611
To cross the border fast.

125
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,042
Three hundred bucks.

126
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,128
We'll sort it out ourselves.

127
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,927
I don't get it.

128
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,884
They're going to the funeral.

129
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,605
Can't say no.

130
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,040
Fuck, what's going on?

131
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,846
Wake up. You're missing Prague.

132
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,244
I thought someone flipped you off again.

133
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,684
<i>There's some synka...</i>

134
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,689
<i>- ls there</i> a <i>vynka?
- Hey,</i>

135
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,610
<i>there' s akurka!</i>

136
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,370
That's molded cheese.

137
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,288
Get some. If you don't like it,
take off the mold.

138
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,522
Hello, boys.

139
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,650
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

140
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,888
You'll be rich.

141
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,605
We've never met before.

142
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
Trying to be cute?

143
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm kidding.

144
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,769
I'm laughing.

145
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,649
Is everything clear?

146
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,569
They're all fags here!

147
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,604
Local girls prefer these kinds of men,

148
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,280
dancers with long hair and shit.

149
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,529
The language sounds gay, too.

150
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,484
The language is funny.

151
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,011
They call soap mydla.

152
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,401
<i>A plane is litadla.</i>

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,045
A car is vazidlo.

154
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,924
<i>How about povidlo?</i>

155
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,085
Russian scum!

156
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,044
You'd better get used to it, buddy.

157
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,964
Thanks'idlo!

158
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,926
Enough!

159
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,329
First,

160
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,411
lose your jackets,

161
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,740
go shopping and buy something normal.

162
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,367
Got to blend in.

163
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,530
Just dress up like
the dummies in the window.

164
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,920
What for?

165
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,126
So it's not so obvious who you are
and where you are from.

166
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,929
You got guns?

167
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,240
We're clean.

168
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,761
I'll get you some tomorrow.

169
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
We want service today.

170
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,481
Ask your girlfriend to service you today.

171
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,648
I said tomorrow.

172
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Now go to the apartment,

173
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,768
get some sleep.

174
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,646
Leave the car in a parking lot.

175
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,569
That's all.

176
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,969
<i>Povidlo.</i>

177
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,724
I don't like it here without guns.

178
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,766
This is not our territory.

179
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,169
Some time ago, Mongol's boys came over,

180
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,166
just like us.

181
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,688
They were tired,

182
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,569
drank some vodka,

183
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,960
fell asleep.

184
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,006
And got killed.

185
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,601
No one woke up.

186
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,689
Who killed them?

187
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,969
The Chechens.

188
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,727
No one heard them breaking in?

189
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,922
They didn't break in.

190
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,218
The door was opened with a key.

191
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,448
They just walked in.

192
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,246
What's up, boys?

193
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,482
Fuck, why didn't you call, Karasik?

194
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,650
Oh, crap! I forgot to call.

195
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,166
Forgot?

196
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,522
I'm old!

197
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,687
I have sclerosis!

198
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,207
Then retire!

199
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,260
I spent 20 years in jail.

200
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,409
I live here now.

201
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,251
And you know where you're gonna live

202
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,809
if you don't shut up?

203
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,241
Where?

204
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,249
Nowhere!

205
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,250
Get it? Moron!

206
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,444
Is that all?

207
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,731
I got this knife.

208
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,649
What about another gun?

209
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,727
Didn't get it.

210
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,120
The Czechs let us down.

211
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,285
That's all I got.

212
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,970
So one of us doesn't get a gun?

213
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,280
Shut up!

214
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,362
And the wheels?

215
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,608
The car is parked outside.

216
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a Volkswagen.

217
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,882
Here's the registration.

218
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,411
What's wrong with our car?

219
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,568
It will be waiting for you.

220
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,489
You'll pick it up afterwards.

221
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,842
Where do we find Alien?

222
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,522
She used to work

223
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,647
in the Tunnel.

224
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,604
What tunnel?

225
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,885
It's a pedestrian tunnel, shaped like a pipe.

226
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,766
You'll know when you see it.

227
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,849
Here's the address.

228
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,486
Who's in charge there?

229
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,808
The pimps are Russians.

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,163
They hang around scratching themselves,

231
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,886
probably high on heroin.

232
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,204
Shouldn't have brought
the blonde guy with you.

233
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,004
Why?

234
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,123
He's too cocky.

235
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,129
He's a whiz.

236
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,611
It's up to you.

237
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,007
Where are the hookers?

238
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,804
What?

239
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,764
Hookers!

240
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,440
What the fuck are you looking at?

241
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,241
Oh, yeah, baby, there she goes.

242
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,530
I'm done

243
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,008
looking for your veins!

244
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,009
Gotta use the groin next time.

245
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,761
No, I'm not doing that. I'll end up dead.

246
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,169
Then do it yourself next time.

247
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,808
Who the fuck needs you?

248
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,890
The whores will do it.

249
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,527
Check out who's there.

250
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Are you alone?

251
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,684
Yes.

252
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,449
Down!

253
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,088
What the fuck?

254
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,890
Bitch!

255
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,884
Get out!

256
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,321
On your feet!

257
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,490
Move! Move, I said!

258
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
Go! Move!

259
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,926
Air gun. Piece of crap.

260
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,448
You fuckers don't even have real guns.

261
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,484
Whoever talks gets to live.

262
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Which one of you wants to live more?

263
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,682
Why are you shouting?

264
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,366
Where is she?

265
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,005
How the fuck do I know?

266
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,441
Damn junkie, he's high!

267
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,844
All right, you got it, fucker.

268
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,168
You'll die first.

269
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,008
Take him to the bathroom.

270
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,650
Do you know her?

271
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,123
You want to make a bet?

272
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,970
Fifty hits and he'll talk.

273
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,725
I don't know. He's high.

274
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,164
Maybe even forty.

275
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,205
You're on.

276
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,931
- Where is she?
- Talk!

277
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
I don't know her address.

278
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,570
Shut up!

279
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,960
Shut your trap!

280
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,890
- Where is she?
- Bitch!

281
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
I don't know.

282
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,169
Think about it,

283
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,169
if he talks, you die.

284
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,860
We are not alone. You're gonna pay for this.

285
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,890
Done.

286
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,971
Well, buddy.

287
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,527
We told you, whoever talks gets to live.

288
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,449
You lose!

289
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,445
What the fuck are you doing?

290
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,168
Let's go!

291
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,609
Hey, man,

292
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,689
who's in charge here?

293
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,486
What for?

294
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,010
I'm looking for something.

295
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,534
Come on, take me to your boss.

296
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,125
I am the boss.

297
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,850
Quit fucking around.

298
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,042
I'm looking for Robo.

299
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,929
<i>You know Robe?</i>

300
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,240
I do.

301
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,002
Then come on in.

302
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,171
What do you want, Russian?

303
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,931
You got a Russian whore here.

304
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,011
I want to buy her.

305
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,123
We don't have anybody here.

306
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,411
How much?

307
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,009
How much do you want?

308
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,527
Fifteen grand.

309
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,291
- Crowns?
- Crowns? Dollars, of course!

310
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,686
I don't have that much.

311
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,486
No money, no whore.

312
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,762
I'll give you five.

313
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,205
- You got it with you?
- Yes.

314
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,520
Show me!

315
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
Show me the whore.

316
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,041
Show me the cash.

317
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,169
Zabar,

318
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,089
bring the whore,

319
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,850
show it to him,

320
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,203
then take his money.

321
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,840
They don't get away alive.

322
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,805
Wait,

323
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,889
I'll bring her.

324
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,804
You're a decent guy, Robo.

325
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,929
You are clearly very wise, like a serpent.

326
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
A serpent?

327
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,411
You mean a snake?

328
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,530
They say.

329
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,960
Wise as a serpent.

330
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,166
It's in Bible, you know, Adam and Eve.

331
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,722
What the fuck do you want?

332
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,922
Get your clothes on.

333
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,368
Someone's here to see you.

334
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
Why don't you leave me alone?

335
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,606
Maybe it's a visit from my relatives.

336
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,925
Is this your brother?

337
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
Yeah.

338
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,925
Doesn't look like it.

339
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,485
We're all brothers.

340
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,045
That's right,

341
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,765
we all came from Adam.

342
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,249
Some are from the Serpent.

343
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,207
Kid.

344
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,930
Hi.

345
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,680
Having fun?

346
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,881
I'm having a blast!

347
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,280
Cut the crap.

348
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,010
Where's the cash?

349
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,363
Let her come here first.
Then you get the money.

350
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,760
Don't bullshit me.

351
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,410
No cash, no bitch.

352
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,845
She's gotta go get her shit.

353
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,684
I don't have anything.

354
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,531
Shut up.

355
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,688
All right, chill.

356
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,882
Here's the cash.

357
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,722
Take out that shooter!

358
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,810
Move! Move! Move!

359
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
Move! Move! Move!

360
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,251
Kid, you're like Rambo.

361
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,169
Move!

362
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,770
Beef. go!

363
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,931
Move!

364
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,202
I'm coming.

365
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,642
Go! Go!

366
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,848
It hurts. Fuck, it hurts.

367
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,725
I'm thirsty.

368
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,284
Listen up, fuckers!

369
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,041
Booger, we got to drop you off

370
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,402
at a pharmacy or you're dead.

371
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,329
Don't say a word for three days.

372
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,002
No matter what. They won't torture you here.

373
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,248
Then tell them whatever you want.

374
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,747
Blame everything on us.
You'll get five years, tops.

375
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,366
Karasik will help you.

376
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,130
Got it?

377
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,924
I got it. Fucking hurts!

378
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,565
Hold on, bro!

379
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,562
- Whiz, make sure he's clean!
- Okay.

380
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,807
Get her out of here. Got matches?

381
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,120
Take a cab downtown,

382
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,009
then walk a block and take another cab.

383
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,770
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

384
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,365
What are you looking at?

385
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,929
What's all this? Fucking laundry day?

386
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,208
What if we have to leave?

387
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,923
Then I'll put on wet clothes.

388
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,122
I had to wash off the stink.

389
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,687
Haven't showered for a month.

390
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,246
How did you work like this?

391
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,204
Without washing yourself?

392
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,730
The clients didn't mind?

393
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,922
I didn't work.

394
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,487
What clients?

395
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,450
What's your name?

396
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,210
Whiz.

397
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,087
What's your real name?

398
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,404
Eugene.

399
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Mine's Angela.

400
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,968
Nice to meet you.

401
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,445
Why "Alien"?

402
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,483
I really don't know.

403
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,364
It just stuck to me.

404
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,087
My brother and I grew up without parents,

405
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,521
like aliens.

406
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,924
Why are you "Whiz"?

407
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,481
When I was a kid

408
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,124
I got in a major fight with
the "beasts" in the market.

409
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,721
Stealing tangerines, oranges and shit.

410
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,288
Sol stole their hats too.

411
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,050
Came back

412
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,890
all bloody and shit,

413
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,369
but with three of their hats.

414
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,885
Rasp laughed his ass off,

415
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,640
and gave me that nickname.

416
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,206
You are funny, Whiz.

417
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,842
So Rasp sent you here?

418
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,566
What's the difference?

419
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,166
Well, you kind of

420
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,767
saved me.

421
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,931
Those Gypsy fuckers

422
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,531
would have skinned me alive.

423
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,442
Yeah, Rasp sent us.

424
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,970
To bring me back?

425
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,004
Well, yeah. To rescue you.

426
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,280
Why is the old man
so interested in me all of sudden?

427
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,367
First he shipped me here,

428
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,520
but now

429
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,562
he wants me back.

430
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,331
What do you mean?

431
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,524
Kid said you came here to work. As a whore.

432
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,324
Bullshit!

433
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,528
Kid knows better than that.

434
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,083
I am no whore.

435
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,967
Where is Kid?

436
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,209
'I don't know.
Nobody wanted to give me a lift.

437
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,209
Drove off as soon
as they figured I'm Russian.

438
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,243
Had to walk all the way.

439
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,407
Having fun here?

440
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,125
Fucked her yet?

441
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,731
No time for that.

442
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,888
Let's have a quickie

443
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,050
before Kid gets back.

444
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,163
Go ahead!

445
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,083
Got any food?

446
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,328
Go and look.

447
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,522
Whiz.

448
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,884
- Got what we need?
- Yep.

449
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,201
Whoa. A blank passport!

450
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,684
No more Booger. Whiz, give this to Alien,

451
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,325
and go check on our car.
You remember where it is?

452
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,924
Kid!

453
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,326
Come look! You're on TV!

454
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,487
So?

455
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,285
The car's there, but so are the cops.

456
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,287
You sure?

457
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,210
All the other cars are gone.

458
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,971
The guard is new, looks like a cop.

459
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,130
The dog is not chained.

460
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,606
Fucking bastard!

461
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,290
You think it's Karasik?

462
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,881
Maybe it's the license plate.

463
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,890
Okay, we'll dye her hair,

464
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,680
then we'll need to take her picture.

465
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,203
How are things back at home?

466
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,983
I was stuck here for two months,
seems like a year.

467
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,882
Fine. We fought.

468
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,762
With whom?

469
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,489
Why? Do you know everyone?

470
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,880
I know some.

471
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,920
How is Babai?

472
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,963
He's locked up.

473
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,162
Shit! Fuck!

474
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,091
Why didn't you tell me?

475
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,046
Shut up

476
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,686
or I'll cut your throat

477
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,245
in front of all these Czechs.

478
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,920
Sorry, hon.

479
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,088
Fuck.

480
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,522
Why is he locked up?

481
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,768
They pinned three murders on him.

482
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,321
Like I said, we fought.

483
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,289
Is he the only one?

484
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,326
Yes. Birulya was killed by the cops.

485
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,723
And how's Rasp?

486
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,161
Okay, I guess.

487
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,761
I've only seen him twice.

488
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,721
Got it.

489
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,242
Kid, there's something I want to ask you.

490
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,965
Yeah?

491
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,044
What does Rasp want from me?

492
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,288
No idea.

493
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
Ask him.

494
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,762
I am still alive

495
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,129
because I don't ask questions.

496
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,886
You're a good guy, Andrei.

497
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,410
You've been around this shit for years,

498
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,002
but you're still a bad liar.

499
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,687
No one compares to you

500
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,009
when it comes to lying.

501
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,568
Kid, let's get out.

502
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,764
Go to a normal country,

503
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,689
like France.

504
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,803
I'll work till we figure stuff out.

505
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,368
Yeah. I can join the Legion.

506
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,729
Get my citizenship in seven years.

507
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,005
I'm serious.

508
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,328
Let's go.

509
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,445
Yeah, right. Wake up, bitch!

510
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,649
Bastard!

511
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,328
Here's the deal, boys.

512
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,043
We can't stay here any longer.
We'll split up and meet in Bratislava.

513
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,050
- Where?
- Take a look.

514
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,971
There's a motel 20 kilometers out.

515
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,072
You won't miss it, it's the only one there.

516
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,610
Take the train to Bratislava.

517
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,131
What about the cops?

518
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,367
She's unrecognizable. And no one's seen you.

519
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,971
Everything clear so far?

520
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,520
Beef, you'll go with Alien. Whiz goes alone.

521
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,961
But keep an eye on each other.

522
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,083
- Got it?
- What about you?

523
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,089
I'll go alone.

524
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,761
It's easier that way.

525
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,645
I know these truckers.

526
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,525
They smuggle illegals into Europe,

527
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,564
the Vietnamese, Afghans, all that scum.

528
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,410
Truckers?

529
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,207
I thought illegals walked across the border.

530
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,004
There's a false bottom in the truck.

531
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,205
They fit 30 people at a time,
the trucks return empty.

532
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,448
Any questions?

533
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,051
What about the money?

534
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,968
We'll split it.

535
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,045
That's all you think about.

536
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,686
Grab as much as you can.

537
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,803
What the fuck?

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,287
What are you saying, bitch?

539
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,164
I saw you take the gold.

540
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,284
What gold?

541
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,088
The gold chain you took off the dead gypsy!

542
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,088
Fucking bitch!

543
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,725
Shut up, fuckers!

544
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,531
Kid, what the fuck?

545
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,605
Listen up, dogs!

546
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,808
If you're gonna do this on the road,

547
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,205
I might as well shoot you now
so I don't get caught.

548
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,889
Beef! Put the chain on the table!

549
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,201
I said, on the table!

550
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,488
- Moron!
- Shut up!

551
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,451
Sit down,

552
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,122
we aren't done yet.

553
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,529
You're going with her.

554
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,603
Remember what I said.

555
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,411
Alien, don't fuck this up!

556
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,049
I don't want to go to Rasp.

557
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,449
Nobody gives a shit what you want.

558
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,291
I said no fucking around, got it?

559
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,890
Got it.

560
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,528
Eugene, get the entire compartment.

561
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,803
We don't need company.

562
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,210
Compartment to Bratislava!

563
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,050
400 crowns.

564
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,484
Cut it out!

565
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,404
- Good afternoon!
- Hello.

566
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,284
Tickets, please!

567
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,005
- What?
- Show him the tickets.

568
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,920
Thank you.

569
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,840
PRAGUE to BRATISLAVA

570
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,808
I don't think so.

571
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,000
You need more?

572
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,723
We'll make sure you travel in comfort.

573
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,366
No need. Just make sure I get there.

574
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,970
Let's have a drink.

575
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,364
I get motion sickness.

576
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,763
All right.

577
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,123
Just don't tell Kid,
or he'll start shouting again.

578
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,164
By "shouting," you mean "laughing"?

579
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,886
By "shouting," I mean "yelling."

580
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,246
By "Yelling" you mean "cursing"?

581
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,481
You could raise the dead with that mouth.

582
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,286
I don't need dead people. I like them alive.

583
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,809
Angela, is something wrong?

584
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,241
Everything is fine.

585
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,446
If I did something wrong, tell me.

586
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,840
Don't be a moron!

587
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,405
You don't understand.

588
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,165
You're taking me to my death.

589
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,560
Bullshit.

590
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,361
Have you heard about the Kazakhs?

591
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,760
No.

592
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,245
<i>Rasp found out</i>

593
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,123
<i>that some Kazakhs</i>

594
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,082
<i>had gold</i>

595
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,689
<i>and some snake poison for sale.</i>

596
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,962
<i>He wanted his cut.</i>

597
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,124
<i>Brought me there.</i>

598
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,921
<i>I was to take them to their room,</i>

599
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,930
<i>spike their drinks...</i>

600
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,767
I'll be right back.

601
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,160
<i>And when they fall asleep,</i>

602
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,363
<i>take their shit and go.</i>

603
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,687
<i>I did everything.</i>

604
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,364
<i>Rasp told me.</i>

605
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,642
<i>But they never woke up.</i>

606
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,560
<i>They died!</i>

607
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,247
<i>Only they weren't just ordinary criminals.</i>

608
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,081
<i>They were cops from Kazakhstan.</i>

609
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,045
<i>That's when shit started to go down.</i>

610
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,562
Rasp gave me three grand,

611
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,649
sent me off to Czech Republic, to Karasik,

612
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,446
so I could stay there
till everything settled down.

613
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,485
He wanted to get rid of me,
but didn't dare kill me.

614
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,522
Babai was climbing up the ranks.

615
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,645
So I was sent away, and that bastard
Karasik started hitting on me.

616
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,650
When he saw he wasn't getting anywhere,

617
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,128
he sent me off to stay
with some "cool guys."

618
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,045
That's how I ended up with the junky pimps.

619
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,368
When I refused to turn tricks,

620
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,404
they sold me to the Gypsies.

621
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,887
That's fucked up! Let's talk to Kid.

622
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,730
Pointless.

623
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,482
Kid won't go against Rasp.

624
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,520
How do you know?

625
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,480
I know a lot.

626
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,681
That's why I'm in this shit.

627
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,769
- I'm dead either way.
- What do you mean?

628
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,246
Let's say I get there.
Babai keeps his mouth shut.

629
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,410
He gets the death sentence.
Then Rasp kills me.

630
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,800
Why would he?

631
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,160
Are you stupid?

632
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,529
The cops are after me because of the
Kazakhs. Rasp can't let me get caught.

633
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,602
Not till Babai is dead.

634
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,081
After that he'll kill me himself.

635
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,681
There's gotta be a way out.

636
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,484
Eugene, listen...

637
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,610
Let's run away.

638
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,844
Let's go to France.

639
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,609
France? Are you serious?

640
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,970
Yeah.

641
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,565
It's so nice there!

642
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,410
<i>Did you read The Three Musketeers?</i>

643
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,965
I saw the movie.

644
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,128
- I'll turn tricks.
- What?

645
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,568
You won't turn tricks!

646
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,047
Okay, it was just

647
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,722
a last-resort thing.

648
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,650
We'll see.

649
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,691
How do we get to France
from the Czech Republic?

650
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,320
We have to go home first,

651
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,091
get money, visas and real passports.

652
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,845
We gotta lose Kid and Beef here,

653
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,849
or they'll take you to Rasp.

654
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,088
Then it'll be too late.

655
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,048
Smart boy.

656
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,928
Smarter than Kid.

657
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,334
You'll see. I'm smarter than you think.

658
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,761
I will, soon.

659
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,689
There's stuff to do.

660
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,087
What are we gonna do?

661
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,964
We'll talk to them

662
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,401
at the motel, take our passports and cash.

663
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,931
Then figure out the rest

664
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,987
while we're waiting for the new passports.

665
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,567
Passport control. Kindly take your seats.

666
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,049
Those morons didn't speak Russian.

667
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,289
Started asking questions,
I didn't understand shit.

668
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,924
I pretended to be German.

669
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,845
- For real?
- Yeah.

670
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,163
<i>What did you</i> tell <i>them?
Das ist Fantastisch?</i>

671
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,967
Did you fuck her?

672
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,360
What's it to you?

673
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,528
Why do you ask?

674
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,484
Fuck, Whiz!

675
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,365
Can't do shit,

676
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,961
but the bitches are still crazy for you.

677
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,527
Oh, don't you worry.

678
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,931
You can't fuck me,

679
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,971
but at least you'll be able
to jerk off at the motel.

680
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,640
Hey.

681
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

682
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,842
Make yourself comfortable.

683
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,721
What's wrong with you?

684
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,048
Got to pee.

685
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,571
Yet you never said a word.

686
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,207
Holding it all in like a Polack!

687
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,410
I need to go too.

688
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,371
Stay cool.

689
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,449
We're gonna do it now.

690
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,288
Let's eat, get some rest

691
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,331
and then get going.

692
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,845
I'm so tired.

693
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,090
Kid, let's sleep a bit.

694
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,004
Wait till tonight.

695
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,089
We'll be in Hungary by evening.

696
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,482
It's not that simple, Andrei.

697
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,209
I got other plans.

698
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,971
What fucking plans?

699
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,088
What the fuck are you talking about?

700
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,244
We don't want to go with you.

701
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,800
We?

702
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,447
Who's we?

703
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,090
Shut up! Sit!

704
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,884
What the hell is this?

705
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,960
Hands up!

706
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,120
Hands up!

707
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,571
Put away the gun, you idiot.

708
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,444
Shut up, fucker!

709
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,050
Anyone moves, I shoot!

710
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,411
Whiz,

711
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,841
think about what you are doing!

712
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,801
Did this bitch get to you?

713
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,729
Are you totally nuts?

714
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,120
She's fucked up.

715
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,361
You're going to get yourself killed.

716
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,891
It's none of your business.

717
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,644
It's up to me to decide.

718
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,365
You don't know her, brother!

719
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,006
She is an animal.

720
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,847
She should be locked in a cage.
Away from people.

721
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,769
Shut up, Kid!

722
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,128
Did she tell you how she ended up here?

723
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,520
She did.

724
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,165
Rasp set her up.

725
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,441
Did she tell you
how those Kazakhs ended up dead?

726
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,449
All the shit started because of her,

727
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,807
she started the war, did she tell you that?

728
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,729
Shut up, Kid!

729
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,644
Okay. Show is over.

730
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,885
'Put it down,
and we'll forget the whole thing.

731
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,242
She got you drunk last night.
Time to sober up.

732
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,640
Shut up!

733
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,410
Kid, let's talk business.

734
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,250
We'll take the guns and the passports

735
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,327
and then we'll go.

736
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,046
Tell Rasp the cops got me.
He won't kill you.

737
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,924
Shut up, you slut!

738
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,360
Your gun.

739
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,891
Do it!

740
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,406
All right!

741
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,240
Slowly!

742
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,200
Watch out!

743
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,960
Here,

744
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,680
finish him.

745
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,806
Fuck!

746
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,686
Go wash your face.

747
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,564
We have to go.

748
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,560
Eugene, it's all right.

749
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,120
Hurry UP-

750
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,967
Stop drinking, go to bed.

751
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,605
I can’t!

752
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,969
As soon as I close my eyes,

753
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,164
I see them.

754
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,964
Who?

755
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,205
Kid, Beef,

756
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,408
Yakov Toporchek.

757
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,720
It'll pass.

758
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,004
They always haunt you at first,
as if they're still alive.

759
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,760
But then

760
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,282
they become transparent.

761
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,642
You can just wade through them

762
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,204
as if they were dirty water.

763
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,326
Rasp, it's for you.

764
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,441
Speak. Hi, Karasik!

765
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,760
I see.

766
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,131
I see. And where's the bitch now?

767
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,443
Fuck, who knows then?

768
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,085
Listen, Karasik,

769
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,171
you gonna read me the paper?

770
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,531
What good are you?

771
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,846
You son of a bitch!
Find out and call me back!

772
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,960
That's it!

773
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,324
Vasya, next time

774
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,124
don't connect me with anybody.

775
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,765
I am not a fucking helpline.

776
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,089
Hey, Rasp, I am not your fucking secretary.

777
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,167
What did you say?

778
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,044
All right, calm down.

779
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,005
Call China-man and Fedor.
Find out where they are.

780
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,402
Okay, I'll call them now.

781
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,370
Eugene, you know what?

782
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,840
What?

783
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,651
We can ransom Arthur.

784
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,520
Who?

785
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,324
My brother!

786
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,326
Do you know how much that'll cost?

787
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,680
What about France?

788
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,121
While we wait

789
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,448
for passports and visas,

790
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,846
we can steal Rasp's stash.

791
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,922
You'll get your visa stamped, all right.

792
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,280
On a headstone.

793
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,524
I'm serious.

794
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,076
Do you know what they would do to us
for Rasp's stash?

795
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,566
You think Rasp will forget

796
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,768
that you killed Kid and Beef?

797
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,331
Listen up,

798
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,443
Rasp has this guy.

799
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,251
They call him the Jew.

800
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,922
He keeps the stash.

801
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,049
How do you know?

802
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,811
I've spent time in the sauna
with him and the boys.

803
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,764
I figured it out.

804
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,366
<i>They'll turn up soon.</i>

805
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,571
It's pointless to look for her.

806
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,842
She's got no one.

807
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,929
But the kid

808
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,168
has a mom and dad.

809
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,726
Kids love their mothers.

810
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,605
They keep their money there.

811
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,243
Don't know exactly what happened,

812
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,088
but the bitch somehow talked him into

813
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,607
killing Kid and the other guy.

814
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,526
Kid was too trusting.

815
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,364
He got that from the army.

816
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,881
Insiders, outsiders.

817
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,209
Get a team of three or four together.

818
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,446
We need a strong pack
who will work well together.

819
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,011
Fully armed.

820
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,522
As soon as they turn up,

821
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,328
<i>they can kill the idiot,</i>

822
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,887
<i>but I need the bitch alive.</i>

823
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,650
We're going to need a car

824
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,370
not a stolen one.

825
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,844
Do you know anyone?
Someone who's never worked with Rasp?

826
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,729
I know a guy.

827
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,248
I don't remember his number.

828
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,643
I'll stop by my parents'.
I got it there somewhere.

829
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,167
What fucking parents?

830
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,004
Are you nuts?

831
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,771
You have no parents!

832
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,970
You'll be killed.

833
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,488
HEY. Angela!

834
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,762
What's with the attitude?

835
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,640
Who are you to talk to me like that?

836
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,850
I thought you were smart,

837
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,610
so think!

838
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,005
They'll be waiting for us there.

839
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,725
Who's waiting?

840
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,887
Whoever!

841
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,850
Cops, Rasp's boys, anyone.

842
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,689
If you need a number,
look it up the phone book.

843
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,486
Do you know his last name?

844
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,570
Yes. We used to box together.

845
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,808
That's great.

846
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,850
This place is full of boxers.

847
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,247
We can organize a tournament.

848
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,770
Did you talk to Bubble?

849
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,405
Talk about what?

850
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,683
You forgot? About the job.

851
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,010
Shit, I forgot. Family problems.

852
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,770
Fucking moron.

853
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,371
What's the matter with you?

854
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,166
Whiz! Tell your chick to shut up!

855
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,887
Why is she even here?

856
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,560
She's right. We asked you

857
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,451
to talk to Bubble!

858
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,005
All right, so I forgot!

859
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,400
I'll talk to him today.

860
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,363
There! See that yellow Opel?

861
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,051
What a piece of crap.

862
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,522
I don't get it. If that's what he drives,
how can he be rich?

863
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,210
That's it.

864
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,890
Let's get the fuck out of here.

865
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,405
He is at home.

866
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,284
He didn't get nowhere.

867
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,602
You really going to kill him?

868
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,525
It's not about me.

869
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,010
He stands in the way.

870
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,242
He's gone mad: He gets high,
makes decisions,

871
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,727
then men get killed.

872
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,849
Got a point there.

873
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,202
I'm not suggesting you kill him.

874
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,449
All you have to do is

875
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,489
tell me when and where he'll be.

876
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,210
What's in it for me?

877
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,930
How many bodyguards has he had?

878
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,087
What do you mean?

879
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,974
How many guards did he have before you?

880
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,247
Well, I know of two.

881
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,085
I know of three. And where are they now?

882
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,170
All kinds of places.

883
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,485
All kinds of places?

884
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,965
They're all dead. You want to join them?

885
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,531
I'll give you twenty grand.

886
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,370
You really have that kind of cash?

887
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,445
I will in a couple of days.

888
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,527
Yeah, right.

889
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,007
Trying to cheat me,

890
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,686
but we got nothing to talk about.

891
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,406
When you get the cash, we'll talk.

892
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,250
Till then, no offense,

893
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,920
but we got nothing to talk about.

894
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,882
No offense taken.

895
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,286
Do you know what happens
to those who do offend me, Kolya?

896
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,528
I don't know. Is this a stupid joke?

897
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,290
No joke.

898
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,969
They burn in hell!

899
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,126
How's Babai doing?

900
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,447
Still in jail.

901
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,808
Otherwise, no idea.

902
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,205
Been busy with other things.

903
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,565
Hey, buddy.

904
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,531
Couldn't find a better place?

905
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,728
Shit, bolts are too tight.

906
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,165
Moron, you got to jack it up

907
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,081
before taking the wheel off.

908
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,247
Are you dumb?

909
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,925
Shut the fuck up.

910
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,845
I don't want some old fart
telling me what to do.

911
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,331
What did you say?

912
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,048
Do you know who I am?

913
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,760
Do you have a fucking clue?

914
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,770
Take him inside.

915
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,044
Move the car.

916
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,203
Where's the stash?

917
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,249
I don't have it.

918
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,970
It's all invested!

919
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,286
Take my cash and go.

920
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,205
Anything?

921
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,445
I won't

922
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,248
say a word.

923
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,090
Take it all,

924
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,522
just leave me alone.

925
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,290
Don't you get it?

926
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,371
I spent

927
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,444
seven years in the slammer.

928
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,129
I'm protected.

929
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,640
It's ready!

930
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,444
Take him in.

931
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,323
You fucking animal.

932
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,446
Come on!

933
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,925
Open the door!

934
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,369
I don't want to die.

935
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,923
You won't find it without me!

936
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,488
Open the door, you little bitches!

937
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,570
I got the stash.

938
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,647
Let me out of here!

939
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,922
You, stay cool.

940
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,886
Let me out, you bitches!

941
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,521
I wanna live! I wanna live!

942
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,920
Let me out, you bitches!

943
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,844
Did you make a deal with the cops?

944
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,885
No.

945
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,530
You know how much they wanted?

946
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,920
How much?

947
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,000
A million.

948
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,283
Nobody has that much.

949
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,281
Even Rasp only had three hundred grand.

950
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,728
Some people do, Eugene.

951
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,571
Prosecutors, cops...

952
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,960
Fat pigs!

953
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,967
Who is Rasp, anyway.

954
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,924
No one.

955
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,607
What are we going to do now?

956
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,804
There is a way.

957
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,970
What way?

958
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,570
Why did Rasp need me?

959
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,645
- To shut up Babai.
- That's right.

960
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,210
Why did he want to shut him up?

961
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,640
What do you mean?

962
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,769
'Cause it's wrong to rat people out.

963
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,610
That's it.

964
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,882
Now, imagine that there is no Rasp.

965
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,289
What do you mean?

966
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,680
Could happen to anybody.

967
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,444
Then Babai can confess.

968
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,778
"I was following the orders
of Rasp, the deceased,"

969
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,406
"together with Birulya, the deceased.
I've seen the light."

970
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,971
"I repent."

971
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,009
He'd get ten years, tops.

972
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,383
We'd have to pay, of course,
to get him out faster.

973
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,124
Pay what?

974
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,287
Pay off the courts.

975
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,600
But less than a million.

976
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,046
How much, then?

977
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,282
Hundred grand, tops!

978
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,603
Then we'll split the rest

979
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,081
and go to Europe.
Live there like normal people.

980
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,928
I still see them in my dreams.

981
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,206
Kid and Beef.

982
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,489
If you hadn't been smart,

983
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,165
they'd be dreaming of us now.

984
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,327
Of you and me.

985
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,682
We'd be dancing in a corps-de-ballet.

986
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,087
Huh?

987
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,167
Dancing on stage,

988
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,802
except they would see through us.

989
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,680
Fuck!

990
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,725
They're becoming transparent.

991
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,450
Not as scary anymore.

992
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,645
What do you say?

993
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,726
Let's finish off the old man.

994
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,364
You already decided, anyway.

995
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,682
Here's twenty, like I promised.

996
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,965
Right on time.

997
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,889
Rasp's gone mad.

998
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,764
Did he switch from crack to heroin?

999
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,163
Very funny.

1000
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,885
Yesterday, someone stole the stash
from the Jew.

1001
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,243
- Who did it?
- I don't know,

1002
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,205
but Rasp turned black when he heard.
He won't speak to anyone.

1003
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,603
Watch out,
he may replace you before the war.

1004
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,685
That's the only reason I'm dealing with you.

1005
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,494
There's going to be a meeting tomorrow.

1006
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,290
Captains only.

1007
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,444
Rasp will go through the back.

1008
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,561
And his car?

1009
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,330
Parked downstairs.

1010
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,207
I'll be walking him out.

1011
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,600
All right.

1012
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,885
When it starts, fall down.
They won't hit you.

1013
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,880
No need.

1014
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,890
I'll have my vest on.

1015
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,503
Just don't shoot me in the head.

1016
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,850
Deal.

1017
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,531
We need you alive.

1018
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,280
Good luck.

1019
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,807
Good luck and good fortune.

1020
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,411
The guard's not going to shoot?

1021
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,800
He won't.

1022
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,611
He's with us.

1023
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,290
I'll take the TT pistol.

1024
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,244
In case they're wearing vests.

1025
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,965
Can it shoot through a vest?

1026
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,360
Yes.

1027
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,243
A Beretta can't do shit against a vest,
but a TT will cut right through.

1028
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,409
Then shoot them both.

1029
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,206
Dead don't talk.

1030
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,170
You'll drive.

1031
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,800
We'll go together.

1032
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,682
Just us?

1033
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,284
We don't need anyone else.

1034
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,080
Whatever you say.

1035
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,811
You're the Whiz.

1036
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,886
She fooled

1037
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,969
one of the Kid's boys,

1038
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,209
nicknamed the Whiz.

1039
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,845
Then they killed Kid and the other guy.

1040
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,484
I don't know

1041
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,206
who else this bitch is working with.

1042
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,407
Maybe the Chechens.

1043
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,762
Maybe the cops.

1044
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,846
Either way, they stole our stash!

1045
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,280
What do you mean, stole?

1046
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,680
Fucking shit!

1047
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,727
What about the Jew?

1048
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,362
Barely alive. The money means shit now.

1049
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,120
We'll find ways to help our boys in jail.

1050
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,887
But we've got to punish these fuckers.

1051
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,169
For Kid.

1052
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,322
For our boys.

1053
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,725
For that dumb-ass Jew.

1054
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,288
But right now, we can't do anything.

1055
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,723
That's what the cops are waiting for.
They think they can trick us.

1056
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,161
They are wrong!

1057
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,409
We'll make them respect us!

1058
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,410
Seek and you shall find,

1059
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,242
as the wise book says.

1060
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,247
That's it.

1061
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,600
Hurry UP!

1062
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,091
I'm coming.

1063
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,005
Bitch!

1064
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,200
Whiz!

1065
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,130
Are you hurt?

1066
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,890
Motherfucker!

1067
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,809
Come on!

1068
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,604
Move!

1069
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,444
Shit!

1070
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,331
Come on!

1071
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,120
Come on!

1072
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,605
Come on!

1073
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,320
Whiz!

1074
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,406
Whiz!

1075
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,564
Eugene!

1076
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,100
UKRAINE, October, 1998.

1077
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,563
<i>He makes a sharp pass,</i>

1078
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,888
<i>the ball hits the cross-bar...</i>

1079
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,004
- What's going on?
- They're done.

1080
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,167
We scored?

1081
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,169
<i>Booger's coming.</i>

1082
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,930
Welcome, my friend.

1083
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,409
How did the Czechs treat you?

1084
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,690
So-so.

1085
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:36,847
We had no bread,

1086
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,729
so we put butter right on the sausage.

1087
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,040
Let's go!

1088
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,808
- Smirnov!
- Ivan Fyodorovitch.

1089
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,604
- Sentence?
- Chapter 144.

1090
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,687
Jail term?

1091
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,087
Five years. End of term...

1092
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,681
May 1, 2000.

1093
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,211
Boyko!

1094
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,930
Evgeniy Viktorovich!

1095
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,087
Sentence?

1096
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,647
Chapter 93 and 223.

1097
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,767
Term?

1098
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,850
Death penalty, changed
to 20 years of solitary confinement.

1099
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,891
End of term, February 23, 2013.

1100
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,690
Alien is doing fine.

1101
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,723
She has two nightclubs, a restaurant,

1102
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,082
<i>even a factory.</i>

1103
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,765
<i>Why is she still alive?</i>

1104
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,727
<i>She scared the shit</i>

1105
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,406
out of those who wanted to avenge Rasp.

1106
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,967
She had people decapitated.

1107
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,640
People were strangled and burned alive.

1108
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,242
She got in with generals, deputies,

1109
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,408
and left the mob.

1110
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,691
Can you get me a gun?

1111
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,085
Luda!

1112
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,405
Who are you?

1113
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,806
Walk!

1114
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,290
Face the wall.

1115
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,405
Move.

1116
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,885
Whiz! You there?

1117
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,364
Yes, Babai!

1118
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,130
Hey. Sniper!

1119
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,366
Looks like our happy days are over.

1120
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,010
When did you get
that last package from Angela?

1121
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,529
It's been a while.

1122
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,921
She was supposed to come

1123
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,521
last week, but didn't.

1124
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,045
Maybe your parents know something?

1125
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,282
I'll ask.

1126
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,843
Or maybe she just
doesn't love you anymore, huh?

1127
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,526
What do you know about love?

1128
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,203
Just kidding.

1129
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,523
- Babai!
- Huh?

1130
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,160
I meant to ask you...

1131
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,810
Why do they call her.

1132
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,530
Alien?

1133
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,483
It's from a movie!

1134
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,762
The one about the spaceship?

1135
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,969
There was a monster, with acid for blood!

1136
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,411
It laid eggs in people!

1137
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,442
You seen it?

1138
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,964
No.

1139
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,008
How did it end?

1140
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,250
I can't remember.

1141
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,805
They tried to catch it.

1142
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,570
I guess they killed it in the end.

1143
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,960
Quiet there!

1144
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,563
All right, talk to you later then.

1145
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,566
Talk to you later.
