1
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,486
BASED ON REAL EVENTS

2
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,824
IN A WAY

3
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,834
Have I shown you my new invention?

4
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,548
- The edible shaving cream?
- This is something else.

5
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:18,138
- What is it?
- A condom with elastic.

6
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,685
We must find solutions to problems.
That's what inventions is.

7
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,898
- What is the problem?
- Slipping.

8
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:33,278
That you designer condoms are
to a vegan make meatballs.

9
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,950
Do not worry.
It's all in the marketing.

10
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:42,371
Ben Banks. Yes, I will.

11
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:51,380
- I have to go to the office.
- You just got here. Have good causes.

12
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,132
I need my points.

13
00:02:54,258 --> 00:03:00,681
Guys can wear it under his shirt.
It is practical.

14
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,393
You're right in. We'll see.

15
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,610
- Would you talk to me?
- It's about your film review.

16
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:20,784
Or whatever you want to call it.
"See it" is not a review.

17
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:27,499
- That says it all.
- It says almost nothing.

18
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,398
Okay.

19
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:33,172
Film Criticism must
maintain a certain standard.

20
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:39,261
It should never be printed.
I can not give you approved.

21
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:44,474
- Stop it.
- I do not understand you.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,147
- What do you want me to say?
- You never completes anything.

23
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,566
I'm here.

24
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:58,530
- You say that you want your exam.
- Yes.

25
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,035
Then you must do something.
Carol is away.

26
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,289
- Do you know that we have a hotline?
- Yes.

27
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,126

28
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,670
I want you to answer
phones between the hours.

00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,089
20 and midnight throughout the week.

30
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:21,845
If you get a tip
you can write the article.

31
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,642
- Do you get many tips?

00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,035
Big tits

35
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,960
Shit.

36
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,047
Dogline.
Your tips are our news.

37
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:02,553
Glenn Ambers is him I should check up on.

38
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:07,391
- He who sells motorhomes?
- He's up to something.

39
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,686
- Like what?
- Water pipe line, idiot.

40
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,649
"Water pipe line, idiot."

41
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:20,821
Idiot? Well, it did you call me.

42
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,366
You've got a story.
Follow the money.

43
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,162
It was Glenn Ambers
who set it all in motion.

44
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,791
- He pulled the trigger.
- As a gun?

45
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,588
It's getting "misty" here.
Tell him.

46
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:42,718
- What does it mean?
- Find out. Tight lines.

47
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:48,557
"Tight lines."
Who talks like that?

48
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,109
REALLY big tits

49
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,096
Black coffee medium.

50
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,562
Here you are.

51
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,489
Additional cream, four pieces of sugar.

52
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,122
Thank you. See you tomorrow?

53
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,391
Vacation World RV Center. It is us.

54
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:17,896
Hope to see you soon.
Have a nice day.

55
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,774
- Can I help?
- I'm looking for mr. Ambers.

56
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,320
- Maybe I can help.
- I do not want a trailer...

57
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,282
Motorhome.

58
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:35,747
We do not sell trailers.
We sell mobile homes.

59
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,459
Fair enough.

60
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:44,256
I am a journalist at Sundog Times
and will talk to mr. Ambers.

61
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,759
I'll see if he's there.

62
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,890
What is it about?

63
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,184
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,352
I'm writing an article
about people in the city.

65
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:03,692
He will be happy.
Mention his charity work.

66
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,906
He accepts you. Follow me.

67
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,460
- Welcome.
- I work for...

68
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,714
I know who you are.
You work for the school newspaper.

69
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,801
Do you get training in Ambers building?

70
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:35,724
- The bears my name.
- Is not your father's name?

71
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,019
We have dammit same name.

72
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:45,984
- Come with your questions.
- You're doing much charity work?

73
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,195
You bet on.

74
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,243
I support children, poor
and gay-all.

75
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,725
Do you support the water project?

76
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:59,081
Children in Kazakhstan
get food because of me.

77
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,585
- Seriously? It's good.
- I know.

78
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,631
It feels good to know
that children can eat their fill...

79
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,969
Only because I allow.

80
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,890
Do you write notes, take pictures
or record?

81
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,894
- I remember it.
- Remember it!

82
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,023
- Have you seen deer mate?
- No, I have not.

83
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:30,487
One must go further
long before the season begins.

84
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,533
You sit still and stare.

85
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,495
When males are ready to go.
Started...

86
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,125
They have an extremely focused
laser sight.

87
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:49,131
- I filmed them.
- What?

88
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,802
When deer mate.

89
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,182
Do you see that?

90
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,648
It arrived after mating Act.
But do not write about it.

91
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:12,905
I felt that I had to do it.
I owed the wild.

92
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,117
- Have more questions?
- It was shown everything.

93
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:23,832
Was that all? Will not you ask
about my amazing stuffed animals?

94
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,212
They are fine,
but it will be a short article.

95
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:34,801
Okay. Ambers with B was the name.

96
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:39,556
Well, says "it starts
be 'misty' here 'you something?

97
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,936
Misty?

98
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,273
Misty? No.

99
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:53,403
- Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome.

100
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,168
Piss and shit.

101
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:42,744
I wonder if people in fifth World...

102
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,458
- ...Ever do it.
- They have children.

103
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,962
It makes everyone, even the Amish...

104
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:56,466
But do you think that they have time
to run solo numbers?

105
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:00,679
- They're not porn?
- How would they look at it?

106
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,806
Yes, they do not have
televisions or computers.

107
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,476
- They have magazines.
- They probably have a common Playboy.

108
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:10,898
As the leg cut Playboy
Suzanne Summers nipples out.

109
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,110
He walked around with them in his pocket.
It was almost a full year.

110
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,655
And Foster said
you had nipples in his pocket.

111
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,451
- He was not happy.
- No.

112
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,454
- It was fun.
- Suzanne Summers.

113
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:31,502
The guys in Zimbabwe hunt all day.
They have no free time.

114
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,422
Do you think that they have
some private places without lions?

115
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:42,346
You say nothing that is fact-based.

116
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:49,770
- All guys do it as often as you.
- Exciting. For them, I think.

117
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:54,233
- You're a crazy bastard, Gunner.
- No matter.

118
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:59,905
- Fifth World countries? What is it?
- There are many of them.

119
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,367
Do away from Soweto and live.

120
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:07,996
I'll give you Weto.

121
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,677
It's getting "misty" here

122
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:39,194
Will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

123
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:45,117
I would ask you the same question.
You must solve this.

124
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:51,498
It's on your conscience.
That shit is going to cost you.

125
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:59,840
Do you think it scares me?
Do you think that money is a problem?

126
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:04,261
I do not know, Glenn.
Apparently not.

127
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,056
It's going to cost you...

128
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:15,606
I do not know. $ 8000... at least.

129
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,947
A friend saw you up on the rock.

130
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:29,578
What are you doing there? Do you smoke?
Marijuana, I mean.

131
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:36,376
Or are you looking at the church as you
used to do with your father?

132
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:42,508
Do you see the irony of being biased
and looking at the church?

133
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:46,428
- Have you been back to church?
- Have you?

134
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,349
I do not need
to know that it is good for you.

135
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,727
They said that they would not have me.

136
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,856
They said that you could not proselytize.
It is not the same.

137
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:04,988
- You should date.
- I do my best.

138
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:11,161
- What about the girl at the coffee shop?
- I buy coffee. We are not together.

139
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:15,457
- Invite her out.
- Maybe.

140
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:22,923
I have ordered your robe
to the end. Extra large.

141
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,468
I'm not as great as you think.

142
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,807
You have the same size as your father.

143
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:36,645
He would be proud
to see you get your exam.

144
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:46,572
- You're probably your exam in the spring?
- Yes, I do.

145
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,996
The first in the family.

146
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,216
DELICIOUS blondes

147
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,116
Cross the hut.

148
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:24,002
Here you are. Thank you.

149
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,257
A coffee.

150
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:39,101
Medium coffee, additional cream,
four pieces of sugar.

151
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,783
Coming soon.

152
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,875
- Why ignored me, Ben?
- I bought just coffee.

153
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,381
Lately you have
always bought coffee for me.

154
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:20,642
You have seen something, right?
On the net.

155
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:25,898
How did you find it? It is well
not up under my name?

156
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:33,113
- It was an accident.
- Slipped you over your computer?

157
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:38,202
So you're just like everyone else
Mormon guys in this town.

158
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:44,291
Wait, I'm not like that.

159
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:51,423
You are so beautiful
and I tried to talk to you.

160
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:59,181
- I do not know...
- I do not.

161
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,060
What did you mean by Mormon guys?

162
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,688
I have been dating a few.
I'm a Mormon.

163
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,567
I guess I'm a Mormon who you are.
I do not go to church.

164
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:16,365
- Treated the you bad?
- They could not handle my past.

165
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,120
- What you saw.
- Were they gay?

166
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:28,710
It is out there for all eternity.
I can not change it.

167
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:33,674
I have nightmares about
that my future children will find it.

168
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,887
- You do not go down on his knees.
- What?

169
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:43,559
Invite me out, Ben.

170
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:48,105
Shall we go together?

171
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,777
If you do not call
I am inclined arsenic in your coffee.

172
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,988
I'm calling.

173
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,576
I promise.

174
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:30,814
- What can I do for you, Benjamin?
- Jeep sounds strange.

175
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,197
Your brake hose is cut.

176
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:43,952
- Maybe I have run on a stone.
- You have used a knife.

177
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:49,625
- Can you fix it?
- Yes, but find out who is behind them.

178
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:56,131
If it was a joke, burn the lawn of.
If it was for real, burn the house.

179
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:04,056
- I can help you if you want.
- You mean it. Maybe later.

180
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,268
I support you if you need me.

181
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,992
- Where are you going?
- I do not know. Cafe Rio?

182
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:29,540
Find a place with table service.

183
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:34,419
- Chili's?
- Find a slightly better place.

184
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,726
Hey.

185
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,938
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

186
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:58,443
- I've never been here.
- I have not.

187
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:03,574
- Do you live not in St. George?
- Everyone takes their baldates with here.

188
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:07,536
But I was never to prom.

189
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:13,250
- What have you done?
- It was something with art teacher.

190
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,049
Welcome to Painted Pony.
Will you hear about today's special menus?

191
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:23,969
Can we get a little more time?

192
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:49,328
What the hell...

193
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,635
- Do you like it here?
- I do not know much about art.

194
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,140
Surprisingly, when you busted
arts teacher.

195
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:17,648
I do not know much about art,
but it reminds me of my hometown.

196
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,037
I must get some sleep.

197
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:36,875
- I drop you.
- Clear.

198
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,421
- You do not follow me to the door.
- It should I do.

199
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,675
As you will.

200
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,142
Good night.

201
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,562
Ben.

202
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:03,026
- See you tomorrow? I have coffee ready.
- Absolutely.

203
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,281
Hello?

204
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:58,790
Ben Banks, you will be taken care of
à la Timmons.

205
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,920
Now I have fun.

206
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,507
It smells heavily here.

207
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:10,719
The show is over, friends.

208
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:17,643
It was crazy.

209
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:25,734
Sweet. "I love beaver".

210
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,612
Hello, mr. Bong.

211
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,407
What is this?

212
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:38,455
What is it? It is a condom.

213
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:46,713
Who wants to celebrate with Greg?
Grabber all.

214
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,843
Then there is the celebration.

215
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:54,555
The mission fuldf...

216
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,644
Stone Temple Pilots. Seriously.
A collection of idiots.

217
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:12,948
- Are you working on a story?
- Glenn Ambers.

218
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:17,369
- Got a tip?
- Something about the water pipe lines.

219
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:22,833
- Did you ask him about it?
- In a way.

220
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:28,714
In a way? How can you ask
about something in a way?

221
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,553
Do you eat a sandwich in a way?
Or are you virgin in a way?

222
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,141
Are you a man in a way?

223
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:43,729
How can you ask in a way?

224
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:48,358
I interviewed him and he
talked about his charity...

225
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:53,030
And weird things he does with deer.

226
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:57,743
I asked some questions.

227
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:02,372
You may get a little backstory...

228
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:08,003
From environmentalists on pipelines
and then pressing the Amber.

229
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:13,717
You need to ask him questions.
Right questions.

230
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:19,973
If you do, you get the point
although it is not an article.

231
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,644
- Seriously?
- In a way.

232
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:34,655
- How do you know all the girls from?
- From school.

233
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,180
Did you go all the way
with her the delicious?

234
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,703
She is different.

235
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,956
That's what you said
about the previous one.

236
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,083
It was expected.

237
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,918
What do you think?

238
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:52,798
His ex-girlfriend's favorite movie was
"Bridges of Madison County".

239
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:57,594
When one says something like that you show
who you are.

240
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:01,390
His girl loved the movie.

241
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:06,895
What is your favorite movie?
"Schindler's List". And you?

242
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,566
- "Pulp Fiction".
- "Lebowski".

243
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:14,903
What's wrong with "The bridges
in Madison County? "It's good.

244
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:20,409
The entire film, as his ex
thought was so romantic...

245
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:24,705
Is about a married woman
as fuck with a stranger.

246
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,875
He's onto something.

247
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,547
It's about a housewife
whose husband wears like a horse...

248
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,341
To support the family.

249
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:43,182
He is tired, but believe that the wife
take care of everything while he works.

250
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:49,438
The only thing she orders
is Clint Eastwood in the bathtub.

251
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,860
She loved the movie.

252
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:58,363
Who do you think you were?

253
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:04,495
- You were the husband.
- And she was unfaithful.

254
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,706
No more to say.

255
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,960
- Shit.
- What is it?

256
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,255
It's my boyfriend's favorite movie.

257
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,178
- Stop.
- I'm sorry.

258
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,266
I can not help that she likes something.

259
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,658
I go to bed.

260
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:46,203
You can not. We have more incense...

261
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:52,376
And to see "There Will Be Blood".
We have not seen milkshake scene yet.

262
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,794
Shit.

263
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:43,135
No, Grandma.

264
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,430
What did you say?

265
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:53,061
- Where is my sock?
- I do not know.

266
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,990
Sorry I did not come this morning.

267
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:10,162
I was out late with my friends
and slept over me. That's it.

268
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,998
Do you have a hangover?

269
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:18,420
I act like a slut
from "High School Musical".

270
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,132
- Are you busy now?
- No.

271
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,306
It is said that you smoking up on the rock
every night. Is it true?

272
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:35,229
I'm free in an hour.
Will you show me?

273
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:40,067
Like. I'll pick you up in an hour.

274
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:57,292
- What is your favorite movie?
- It is clear "Say anything".

275
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:01,839
- Cool.
- Okay.

276
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:08,428
I like the streets are as in a grid.

277
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:14,643
I'm from Boston. The streets are made for
horses or by drunken soldiers.

278
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:23,527
- From Boston? Dad loved the Celtics.
- If he came from Massachusetts?

279
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:28,490
No, but he loved Dave Cawlings
and all other Mormons in the Celtics.

280
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:35,873
Players like Danny Inks.
Is he still crazy about them?

281
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:42,296
- He died when I was 18 years old.
- I'm sorry, Ben.

282
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:47,885
It's okay.
It's been a while ago.

283
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,140
Drill your mother here?
I would like to meet her.

284
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:58,061
We can arrange.
What about your parents?

285
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:02,149
We're not talking so much together.

286
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:06,487
I rebelled against the family.

287
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:10,866
I moved to Vegas with a friend to...

288
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:15,204
I do not know what the plan was.

289
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:22,252
- How did you end up here?
- I did not like myself in Vegas.

290
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:30,093
I figured with a lower risk of
people would recognize me from the net.

291
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,098
People say that I take up here and will
high.

292
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:39,478
- Is that your thing?
- No.

293
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,940
What will you be doing?

294
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:47,152
I want to be a journalist
and writing articles.

295
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,614
- Can you give marijuana for it?
- I think so.

296
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:55,702
Are not you afraid of being caught?
Someone could see you.

297
00:33:55,828 --> 00:34:03,335
No one sees me.
I see 100 meters in all directions.

298
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,340
- What if someone climbs up?
- It does not happen.

299
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:14,638
- I have made it even worse.
- I'm not super worried.

300
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:20,686
- So you will continue to smoke here?
- Does it bother you?

301
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:27,234
I'm just saying what I've heard.
People say that you're a pothead.

302
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,656
- I say they do not know you.
- Do you?

303
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:36,076
Not yet.

304
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:41,790
But I've seen you at the café.
You are a good person.

305
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,502
Do you sense it in the way
I order coffee on?

306
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:50,716
No, I see it in your eyes.

307
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:12,779
I'm working on an article and should
check something. I'll be back.

308
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:20,454
Mother always said that I have hair
and soul like a lion.

309
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:27,169
Shit, look who's here.

310
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:30,172
Mr. Ambers recorded.

311
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:35,135
- More questions about charity?
- He does not want to meet you.

312
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,264
- Is not he busy?
- He does not want to meet you.

313
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,684
Remember when environmentalists
demonstrated here?

314
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,314
- The vile people.
- Created the problems of Ambers?

315
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:51,443
Is it a crime
to mr. Amber likes to hunt?

316
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:56,031
- Or think everyone should have enough water?
- It does not sound like a crime.

317
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:01,787
Have you heard him say
"It starts to get 'misty' here '?

318
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:08,460
- Misty? No. Well, maybe. No.
- What would you say?

319
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:13,632
I think that one of the traits under
called a girl for Misty.

320
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:19,847
- Nickname for Melissa.
- Thank you. You were a great help.

321
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:24,476
- Okay, asshole. Tight lines.
- What did you say?

322
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:29,189
I said:
"Okay, asshole. Tight lines."

323
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,568
Clear.

324
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:42,578
Cross the shed.

325
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,873
Saved you feel all the time?

326
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:53,297
It seems to miss the cat out of the bag.

327
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:59,845
Why put you a cat in a sack?
Damn, Ambers.

328
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,974
I've never heard
someone put a cat in a sack.

329
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:09,438
- I like cats.
- I'm in! And you put them in bags.

330
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:14,610
- It's a figure of speech.
- I should have got it.

331
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:18,947
Clear you put cats in bags.
I'm taking the rest of the day.

332
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:27,247
- I have a clue.
- As in the movie?

333
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:32,252
Just like in the movies.

334
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:39,301
Melissa... Melissa Brady. She is part
of an environmental activist group.

335
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,471
- Dixie Green.
- Could it be her?

336
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:47,434
- Call her.
- How do I get her number?

337
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,898
Are you kidding? You can do anything
online than to check girls out.

338
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:59,988
- Seriously? Like what?
- Fucking fun.

339
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:04,159
Here it is.

340
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:15,671
I'm looking for Melissa Brady.

341
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:21,218
Is it true? What?

342
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:27,975
No, I did not. Thank you.

343
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:33,522
Bofællen said that she has been away for
more than one month.

344
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,359
- It sounds sinister.
- Yes.

345
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,283
- Can it wait until tomorrow?
- I think so.

346
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:15,606
- It was not meant to be.
- Slid you? It's leather.

347
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,983
Sorry.

348
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:21,820
Do you always fast forward
or is it because of my movies?

349
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,948
- What do you film?
- Very funny.

350
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:28,869
- Seriously.
- What you saw.

351
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:33,749
I saw pictures of you.

352
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:39,796
- I thought...
- Which film?

353
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:43,050
- I thought you knew.
- Which film?

354
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:49,932
- You know what movie I mean.
- With other guys?

355
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:56,813
- Do not look at me like that.
- I did not know...

356
00:39:56,939 --> 00:40:01,443
I thought you knew.

357
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:05,072
- We seen enough any more.
- Wait.

358
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,992
- I've seen that look before.
- You do not know what I was thinking.

359
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:12,913
Yes, I do.
I see it in your eyes.

360
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:45,070
- Benny Banks.
- Are you good?

361
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:51,034
- Hank mushrooms. Are you with me?
- Yes.

362
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:58,417
- My legs feel happy.
- Cool.

363
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:03,422
- I have the world's happiest legs.
- Lykkeben.

364
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:12,181
- Can you really run now?
- I am prof

365
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:23,066
Where is your girlfriend, Gunner? Does she
"Bridges of Madison County"?

366
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:28,322
- Give her a honk.
- Okay.

367
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,075
Honk.

368
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:50,052
- Gunner said to have grass.
- When we arrive.

369
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,180
Where are we going?

370
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,934
What the hell.

371
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:02,314
- What are you doing?
- I saw a guy.

372
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,859
What's wrong with you?

373
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:19,081
What are you doing?

374
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:23,877
There have kept a car very long
with the lights on.

375
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,631
Benny!

376
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,073
Where is the driver?

377
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:14,178
Shit.

378
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:22,144
A guy has shot himself.

379
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:27,691
I want to go home, Gunner.

380
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:32,070
- How could I ports in this?
- I'm calling the police.

381
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:37,743
- I just wanted to smoke a little grass.
- Eternity never ends.

382
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,957
- Eternity never ends.
- What the hell are you talking about?

383
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:49,171
You must come back to reality.

384
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:55,093
- The police are on their way.
- We must get away from here.

385
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:59,473
- We are affected.
- There is a dead body over there.

386
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:03,227
We must away. We are affected.

387
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:08,524
We're not going anywhere. They turn not
back to something. Relax.

388
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,283
There is a dead body over there.

389
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:22,162
There is a dead body over there.

390
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:28,544
There is a man who and he is dead.

391
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:34,550
- I stopped him.
- Is there really a corpse?

392
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:39,388
There is a dead body there.

393
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,849
Oh god.

394
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:46,854
- An equal.
- Pull yourself together.

395
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:52,568
I need to see your ID
and ye shall be here.

396
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:58,282
- I want to go home.
- Wrong place, wrong time.

397
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:02,202
I need reinforcement.

398
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,913
Ben?

399
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:34,044
What is it? Sit.

400
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:42,678
- We found a dead guy.
- What?

401
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:47,224
- He had shot himself.
- Oh, my goodness.

402
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:54,857
Why did he do it?

403
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:48,035
- Going it, Benny?
- Yes.

404
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:13,810
Thank you.

405
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:22,653
You do not know me,
but I knew your father.

406
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:28,242
He bought it for your tenth anniversary.
I can save it for a few months...

407
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:32,788
And then you can buy it back
for the same sum.

408
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:38,043
- I can not...
- Your father was a good man.

409
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:44,466
Thank you.

410
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:59,898
- Do not touch the works.
- I will buy it.

411
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:04,236
It is a very expensive work.

412
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,864
Can you pack it in?

413
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,086
Yes?

414
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:25,299
- Is Amy home?
- She had to close her bank accounts.

415
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:32,598
- Who are you?
- Her sponsor... girlfriend.

416
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:38,562
Will you give her this?

417
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:43,650
- Who is it from?
- Tell Ben came up with it.

418
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:47,237
I make sure that she gets it.

419
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:04,171
"Dear Mom and Dad.
I did it because of you."

420
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:09,676
"You do not love me and I can
not live with. This is your fault."

421
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:18,769
Never take mushrooms again. I stared at
myself in the mirror for an hour yesterday.

422
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:22,731
No, grandma! Nice beard.

423
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,234
I feel you there. Get out.

424
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,488
I tried to smoke a little,
but it was not good either.

425
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:34,618
Have you thought about
why the guy shot himself?

426
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:40,624
- Stop, I get headaches.
- Forget it.

427
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:46,338
- Are we smoking on?
- No, I must continue.

428
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:52,719
- Think that I found him.
- You knew him?

429
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:56,557
I will not speak ill of the dead,
but he was a pig.

430
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,936
- How were his parents?
- They were saints.

431
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:05,691
They accepted just all the shit
as their son came up.

432
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:12,239
- Was he frequently in trouble?
- He took all the drugs he could.

433
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:17,244
He tried to make amphetamine
in a broom closet.

434
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:21,081
If he claims that he did it
because of the parents...

435
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:25,419
- I heard that there was no letter.
- No letter.

436
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:31,300
Pigs. Who kill themselves without
explain why the parents?

437
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,652
What is she doing here?

438
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:04,666
What the hell.

439
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,075
Damn, man!

440
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:12,151
- May I come in?
- I do not understand you bought it for me.

441
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:20,242
I felt like shit.

442
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:28,292
- Are you moving?
- Everyone has a past.

443
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:34,548
They have something they want to forget,
but it is not as well documented as mine.

444
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:40,012
I was so naive.

445
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:44,725
I knew nothing about drugs,
alcohol or something.

446
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,729
My parents had not told me something.

447
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:55,652
You have to just try one more time.
Do you have that way about marijuana?

448
00:53:55,777 --> 00:54:00,324
That's why I asked so much.

449
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:05,120
- I just can not with something.
- I understand.

450
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:10,709
I was addicted...

451
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:15,422
And a guy said that he knew
how I could make a quick buck.

452
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:19,218
It was four weeks of my life.

453
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:23,722
Four weeks that I will never forget.

454
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:29,686
- It does not bother me anymore.
- Do not lie to me.

455
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:36,443
I can reconcile myself with it. All
conditions have something in their luggage.

456
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:42,699
It's out there forever.
It will always be there.

457
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:48,288
It's not something that you just have
heard of. You can see it.

458
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:52,042
- You might have already.
- I would not do.

459
00:54:54,336 --> 00:55:00,342
Both you and I know that it's there.
I just pretended like it was not there.

460
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:05,848
Should not we try to let it go?

461
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:11,145
I do not want
you to reconcile you with anything.

462
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:20,445
- I will not go.
- I'm asking you.

463
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:48,891
I saw you with him.
With him there Timmons.

464
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:53,604
I think you have problems.

465
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:58,317
Was it blackmail with Melissa Brady?
I would say "misty" to Ambers.

466
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:02,237
He thought of Melissa Brady
and was afraid.

467
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:07,367
I do not have the whole story,
but sufficient to Spectrum.

468
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:11,371
"School Sheet blackmailed
local businessman."

469
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:17,044
You chose the loser without ambition,
but you chose wrong.

470
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:21,840
- I've seen tons of movies.
- You can not go to the Spectrum.

471
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:26,637
- Maybe I contact the police also.
- Please do not leave it.

472
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:29,806
Tell what happened.

473
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:36,730
Misty... Melissa gave Ambers headache
with its protests.

474
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:43,237
He asked Greg to fix it.
He would scare her.

475
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:47,324
Greg pretended that it went very wrong.

476
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:53,288
He told Ambers
he buried her in the desert.

477
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:59,336
- And I blackmailed him?
- Not my idea. I love him.

478
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:04,341
- Timmons? Are we talking about the same guy?
- Judge me not.

479
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:09,721
Okay, but I will still contact Spectrum.

480
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:15,853
It will destroy me.

481
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:19,898
It's sad, but you may end here.

482
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:25,028
It's your own fault. I'll try
to keep the police out.

483
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:27,573
What should I do?

484
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:33,954
Where is Misty?

485
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:54,516
- A person?
- Hold it.

486
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:58,020
What is it?

487
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:01,482
How.

488
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:05,903
No,.

489
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,908
Keep it. It is the daily newspaper.

490
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:24,213
A story that attack a competitor
even a school magazine, must be waterproof.

491
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:28,800
- It is waterproof.
- You may get a response from Ambers.

492
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:31,387
He must be given the
opportunity to comment.

493
00:58:31,388 --> 00:58:33,847
He probably will not talk to me now.

494
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:38,185
It does not he. It is probably
If he says "no comment".

495
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,564
- Can I write this article?
- Brings we get points.

496
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,901
I'll get a response from Ambers.

497
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,370
I knew you were here.

498
00:58:56,495 --> 00:59:02,668
The police will ask more questions
the guy who killed himself.

499
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:09,550
- Now?
- Yes. Hank and Gunner is already there.

500
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:17,891
I believe that we must agree
to keep our rights.

501
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:43,167
- What's with him?
- Gone with the girl, she made porn.

502
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:48,130
- Something of a turn.
- What is the problem?

503
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:53,093
The thought of all the guys...

504
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:57,055
- Holy crap.
- What?

505
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,309
You look at a lot of porn.

506
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:04,313
She would not do it
if there were guys like you.

507
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:09,359
We buy it all together.

508
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:12,905
- It's not the same.
- Yes.

509
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:19,578
Although it does not bother me,
is it her that it is online.

510
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:22,831
I know you hate it
when I become religious.

511
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:28,462
You have never been religious
to us or anyone else.

512
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:34,092
You know the story in the Bible about the men
Taking the incredible girl to Jesus...

513
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:37,846
Because they want to smash her head
with stones.

514
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:44,269
A loose minutes. You believe that, as is
without guilt should throw the first stone.

515
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:50,692
It's cool that one should not judge,
because we all have done shit.

516
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:54,696
- That's not the point.
- I do not know if I want to hear it.

517
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:59,535
After Jesus said it
Yesterday the men home...

518
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:04,998
Because they've all stolen
bread at a time.

519
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:11,797
Jesus asks the girl where guys
which would shatter her went.

520
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:14,550
She then says that they went home.

521
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:19,137
He says that she must live on
and not do it again.

522
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:24,226
- I'm with. He forgives her.
- No, you're not.

523
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,397
It's not just a guy which forgives a girl.

524
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:33,402
It was Jesus. He dies on the cross
the girl's sins.

525
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:38,657
It is no matter.
He will suffer for her sake.

526
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:44,454
What does he do? He judges her? No.

527
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,834
He's getting it.

528
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:54,298
If he can get it, you can also do it.

529
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:57,551
I've never thought about it that way.

530
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:07,728
We do not go to church anymore
but I just wanted to say it.

531
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,694
I assume that the problem is
it is available.

532
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:19,740
The films can be found on the net.

533
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:23,952
Find out who owns it
and ask them to remove it.

534
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,164
- Can I do it?
- I do not know.

535
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:33,420
But she is not a big star.
Maybe you can.

536
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:37,424
I must go.
Tell the police that I'll call you later.

537
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:45,224
What? I know the Bible.

538
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:54,191
Okay. Thank you.

539
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:57,277
- Damn.
- What happens?

540
01:02:57,402 --> 01:03:02,074
I have found the company behind the website,
but not who owns it.

541
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:07,246
- You know that Mary Andrews live here?
- Who is it?

542
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:12,918
Ex-porn star. "Your Kissin '
Cousin 3 "and" Leave It In, Beaver."

543
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:18,549
Remember when Ronnie tried to
sell them to you at school?

544
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:23,220
- Does she live in St. George?
- I saw her on HARMAND's.

545
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:29,184
She was one of the first who had
its own website.

546
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:34,982
She won some awards for the page.
Maybe she can help you.

547
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:40,237
- How do we find her?
- I actually know where she lives.

548
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:46,368
- How do you know?
- I googled and followed her.

549
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,998
Okay.

550
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:58,672
- Yes?
- Mary Andrews?

551
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:03,260
Not anymore.
Now my name is Mary Shepard.

552
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:07,389
What is it about?

553
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:13,312
It is about a girl I'm happy
order. I need your help.

554
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:20,194
We were just about to eat breakfast.

555
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:32,122
- The Gilded Unicorn.
- Do you know who owns the company?

556
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:36,043
Yes, and I understand your girlfriend.

557
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:41,924
I tried to get some of my
material from them.

558
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:46,720
- It's not nice people.
- I will make an attempt.

559
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:52,976
The chief executive of living in Vegas.

560
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:58,273
I see if I can find the address.
Is enough in our legal documents.

561
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,359
Thank you.

562
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:05,364
What's wrong with you?

563
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:09,243
I looked at her naked body since I was 16

564
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:12,496
Pull yourself together.

565
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:28,011
Here it is. Do not expect too much,
if you get to meet him.

566
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,265
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

567
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,977
I show them off.

568
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:44,987
- Do you love the girl?
- Yes.

569
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:51,243
Then you must do what it takes.
Give the bastard what he deserves.

570
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:03,046
- Does the car as it should?
- Yes, but I need your help.

571
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:06,425
- Trays me up?
- Is it about time?

572
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,886
It's time now.

573
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:08,487
- Yes?
- Where's Phil Macy? We next meeting.

574
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:13,867
Stay there, fatty.

575
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:18,330
I thought you kept an eye on the door.

576
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:25,254
Are you in the right place?
What's with this guy?

577
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:29,049
You want something to drink?

578
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:34,012
My name is Ben Banks and want
Amy Warner films.

579
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:38,725
Hi, Ben Banks.
I know of no Amy Warner.

580
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:45,607
- He thinks Cherry Thighs.
- It was sad that she stopped.

581
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:50,237
Can we find a solution?
Can I buy them from you?

582
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:54,449
Is this your wife?
I'm with you love her.

583
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:59,246
You do not guys look when she
fucks with other guys...

584
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:04,835
And girls too, I think.
I know what you're thinking.

585
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,424
What I do makes a difference
and saves lives.

586
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:16,680
Men need.
Strong pulsed needs.

587
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:19,057
Enough is enough!

588
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:30,402
For me to have my freedom, must
I accept what you do with yours.

589
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:35,199
But do not pretend that you do
is good. What you're doing is miserable.

590
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:38,368
If you do not give my friend
what he asks for...

591
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:44,500
I come back and get seriously hurt.

592
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:55,761
Thank you. I do not know if it helped,
but I owe you one.

593
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:00,516
- Tell if he does not give you that.
- You have done enough.

594
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:05,604
Benjamin, you must tell.

595
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,625
Bank.

596
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:32,798
I knew I'd find you
here. What are you doing?

597
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:37,469
- I want to talk to Amber.
- You're an idiot.

598
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:40,764
Now you are suddenly motivated.

599
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:45,018
Why were you not when I cut
brake hose on your car?

600
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:48,814
Or when I searched your apartment?

601
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:53,068
Yes, it was me.
I found this little number.

602
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:58,490
I've already used two.
I wish I had snatched five.

603
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:05,622
The meat pie in your fridge is old.
Throw it out.

604
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,542
It's no use.

605
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:12,254
I have a question for you.

606
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:18,802
Do you think you can take my ass,
Ben Banks?

607
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:38,447
How dare you interfere with my
Breakfast? How did you get in?

608
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:41,783
Timmons, you're fired.
What is it?

609
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:45,662
Melissa Brady. Your right hand
Timmons blackmailing you.

610
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:50,000
She lives. She was not killed.

611
01:10:52,336 --> 01:10:56,673
- Misty was in it.
- Are you sure?

612
01:10:56,798 --> 01:11:03,847
Check the date. I met her
two days ago in Salt Lake.

613
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:08,143
I owe you one.
What can I do for you?

614
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,774
I am a journalist and to write this story.

615
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:20,405
Needless.
She lives so that no damage is done.

616
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:24,493
You were willing to pay
to cover up a murder.

617
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:29,081
Would you like to comment on what I have
told?

618
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:34,461
I was not willing to do anything.
Timmons was behind it all.

619
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:40,884
He has wool in the mouth
and trying to fool us.

620
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:47,224
And I'm allergic to sheep.
I would like to comment.

621
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,602
The second I said was unofficially.

622
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:56,024
My response is: No comments.

623
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:02,906
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. No comments.

624
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:44,198
- Well, it just needs freshening up.
- That's fine.

625
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:48,327
- I have a request.
- What?

626
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:52,664
I want a job.

627
01:12:54,249 --> 01:13:00,088
Come back in a week.
I think that we can find a solution.

628
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:16,688
- Work Amy Warner still here?
- She has moved.

629
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:22,444
- Do you know where she is moved?
- I do not know you.

630
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:26,865
I could not tell it to anyone.

631
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:55,329
How do you want it?

632
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,711
Adult.

633
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:21,104
I will talk to you alone.

634
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:28,278
- How did you find me?
- Really?

635
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:32,199
I'm with, I have contacts.

636
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:39,373
It's all your shit.

637
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:43,293
All films, negatives, photos
and master tapes.

638
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:48,048
- Everything you did for Phil is here.
- What are you talking about?

639
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:51,468
Everything on the internet is gone.
Tell that to your friend.

640
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:58,016
- My friend?
- Ben Banks.

641
01:15:58,142 --> 01:16:01,937
Ben stands behind this?

642
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:05,566
Everything removed from the site?

643
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:55,365
NO RESULTS AT CHERRY Thighs

644
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:34,655
SCHOOL SHEET blackmailed
LOCAL BUSINESS MAN

645
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,907
It's great.

646
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:04,536
I get points for the and that means...

647
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,956
- That you take the exam?
- Yes.

648
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:14,922
I am proud of you and I love
with your hair. Although.

649
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:18,717
- I'm starting to church again.
- Is it true?

650
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:25,224
- Gunner said some things.
- Gunner get you to go there again?

651
01:19:25,349 --> 01:19:28,644
Yes.

652
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:33,607
- What about the girl?
- I do not know.

653
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:38,111
- Do you love her?
- Yes.

654
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:43,200
Then you must find her.

655
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,785
Let me see your eyes.
