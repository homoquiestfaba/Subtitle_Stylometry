7
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,930
Come out here!

8
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,730
Why are you crapping here
when the next stall is empty?

9
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,190
Why don't you use the empty stall?

10
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,260
Hmm.

11
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,330
You're not from
around here, are you?

12
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,740
I'm Park Changsu.

13
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,900
Don't you know me?

14
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,410
Never been to this
neighborhood before?

15
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,770
This stall belongs to me,
pal.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,380
Take your business elsewhere.
Come out, okay?

17
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,850
Hey, hurry up and get out.

18
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm counting to ten.
If you don't come out,

19
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,260
you'll get wet,
dirt bag.

20
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,660
One, two, three, four.
Jeez.

21
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,170
Hey, you didn't flush.

22
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,630
What great manners,
you freak.

23
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,110
Who is this?
The world's greatest waitress.

24
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,210
It's been a while.

25
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,590
Hey, Changsu.
I guess you've been busy.

26
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,750
I haven't seen you around.

27
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,520
I've been busy preparing
for my business.

28
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,130
Come by sometime.

29
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,240
I have a delivery to get to.
See you.

30
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,770
Bye.

31
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,260
That fox.

32
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,350
Wake up.

33
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,910
Don't you get
that I'm a total bachelor?

34
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,410
She's five years older than me.

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,720
Even she has a kid in high school...

36
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,790
What do you take this
Park Changsu for? Jeez.

37
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,460
Why are you hitting my head?

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
Who am I? Who am I?

39
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,350
When you came into this world
with a runny nose,

40
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,260
who took you in and fed you? Who?

41
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,300
I don't know.
I got here on my own, damn it.

42
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,340
Why'd you hit my head...

43
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,100
Damn it!
It really hurts.

44
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,000
Changsu.

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,110
I thought you were
getting out on Thursday.

46
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,740
What day is today?

47
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,320
It's... Thursday.

48
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,850
You little shit,
I can't believe you.

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,230
All caught up in that girl, you son of a...

50
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,390
What do you think you're doing?

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,060
Need another hit and bang?

52
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,120
Wait, lady.

54
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,400
Can you bring some tofu?

55
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,440
- Okay.
- Tofu?

56
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,340
Are you freaking crazy?

57
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,740
If I have tofu, I'll lose all my jobs, you moron.

58
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,840
Oh, right.

59
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,110
Anyway, finish your food.

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:02,720
You are like the wind

61
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,000
You left me in tears
You are like the wind

62
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,800
Shoot. This is embarrassing.
Never seen someone taking a piss?

63
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,810
Move along.

64
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,740
Freaking embarrassing.
Making me feel like crap.

65
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,110
No sense of manners.

66
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,110
Hey, motherfucker!

67
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,120
Shit.

68
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,990
Fine, I'm crazy.
You jerk!

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,060
Wait and see what I do to you.

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,430
Well, she's great.

71
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,070
Killer body.
Shit, she has a man.

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,200
Get in.

73
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,610
You think I'll believe you?

74
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,240
Watching a couple fight
is always a great show.

75
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,580
So you'll tell everyone?

76
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,520
What? You don't think I can?

77
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,690
It'll be the end of both of us.

78
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,560
I'll tell the chairman everything.

79
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,790
Tell him what?

80
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,190
All I've done is slept
with you a few times.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,870
Do you love me?

82
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,370
Don't touch me, you jerk!

83
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,840
Shit!

84
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,680
What's that scumbag doing?

85
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,520
Crazy jerk!
How dare you touch me?

86
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,990
Is there a guy yet
who hit woman?

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,720
That's it.
Go ahead and get revenge.

88
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,130
Who's this scumbag?

89
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,630
Hey, look here.

90
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,900
Aren't you going overboard?

91
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,770
She's a woman.

92
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,710
Mind your own business.

93
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,380
You're not such a nice guy, are you?

94
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,350
By the looks of your outfit,
you must be some kind of crook.

95
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,990
Do crooks beat up a woman
these days?

96
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,460
Huh?

97
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,730
Don't get into trouble away
from home.

98
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,700
Help her up and get out of here.

99
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,700
Huh?
So what if you stare at me.

100
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,500
This little scumbag...

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,810
Ah!

102
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,390
We can't let both of us die.

103
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,020
You should rest at home.

104
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,680
How dare you hit me
when my guard is down!

105
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,010
That scumbag got away, did he?

106
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,950
This is so embarrassing.

107
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,890
I've been had by some loser
who isn't even a real gangster.

108
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,990
Hold on.

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,830
Doesn't this belong to you?

110
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,870
Lady, this is worth $1,000!

111
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,870
My neck freaking hurts,
and this is embarrassing.

112
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,410
Whatever!
I'm leaving this here.

113
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,890
I'm not going
to be responsible for this.

114
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,710
I didn't take it,

115
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,380
okay?

116
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,470
Where am I, anyway?

117
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,340
Here you go.

118
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,800
Please get some water.Oh,
yes.

119
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,540
Here you are.

120
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,420
That little sucker
is such a wimp.

121
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,070
Who are you?

122
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,640
Pardon?

123
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,600
Who the heck are you?

124
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,110
I've been...

125
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,210
Go away.

126
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,840
What?

127
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,520
I said go away.

128
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,380
I think you've drunk too much.

129
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,610
How much?

130
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,570
How much is the bill?

131
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,380
32 bucks.

132
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,540
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
- Huh?

133
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,180
- I'll pay tomorrow.
- Okay then.

134
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,380
Jeez.

135
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,570
She's gone.

136
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,600
Who?

137
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,600
The girl sitting here.

138
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,400
Yeah, she left.

139
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,580
She left her lighter.

140
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,880
Did she leave right after I did?

141
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,410
She left with the guys
at the other table.

142
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,850
What?

143
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,790
How could you let her
leave with losers like them?

144
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,290
Don't you know how
dangerous it is here?

145
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,270
She didn't come here.

146
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,970
Not here?

147
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,310
Fine.

148
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,530
So you did it?

149
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,830
Why'd you bring her to your home,

150
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,710
not a motel?

151
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,050
Girls never put out the day
they break up.

152
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,510
Who are you?

153
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,020
You piece of dust.
Shut up and clean the place.

154
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,420
So you did it?
Wow.

155
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,460
What?

156
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,130
So you've finally become a real man?

157
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,670
The real thing is so much better, isn't it?

158
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,340
Park Changsu, you've finally done it?

159
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,110
Oh, I don't know. It's just...
Well, it was just...

160
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,710
No, they never do it
on the day they broke up.

161
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,880
Hey, Miss Jang,Come here.
Oh, hi there.

162
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,390
Let me tell you something funny.

163
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,050
Hey, you jerk. Stop it.

164
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,890
Let me tell you a joke
that goes like this...

165
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,390
Hello, boss.

166
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,120
Hi. Changsu is here.

167
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,640
I already took a 10% commission.

168
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,360
Okay.

169
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,840
Aren't you going to count it?

170
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,940
I'm sure it's all here.

171
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,410
Okay then.

172
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,850
Don't lose all of that money
on a single poker game, you hear?

173
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,020
You're not young anymore.
It's time you came to your senses.

174
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,080
You can't spend your entire life
living in jail for other people.

175
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,450
I got it.

176
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,890
Hey, come here

177
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,060
I have a great deal waiting for us.

178
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,570
There's nothing for you to do

179
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,190
but let me borrow your name.

180
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,100
The guys are checking out the market.

181
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,330
After three months of operation,
they'll disappear.

182
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,400
Then the victims will sue,

183
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,880
and that buys us five months.

184
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,540
So you can get some rest,

185
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,510
and then two years of prison time.

186
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,810
Two years is too long.

187
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,090
Is it?

188
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,250
It's better to do a few
six-month sentences.

189
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,720
But you'll get a lump sum.

190
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,130
- Okay, I'll think about it.

191
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,400
- Good.
- Come out later.

192
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,030
- Okay.
- I'll buy you dinner.

193
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,400
- Sangtae, let's go.

194
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,910
She's pretty, too.

195
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,110
She's much prettier than her.

196
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,410
That's impossible.

197
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,350
No one is more beautiful
than my Natasha.

198
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,120
Do her boobs bounce
up and down?

199
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,090
Don't call them boobs.

200
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,520
You crazy kid.

201
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,990
Try some of this.

202
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,160
You're the crazy kid.

203
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,030
Why don't you
just give me instead?

204
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,700
No?
- Right. No.

205
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,170
- Give it.

206
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Go and get me two Red bulls.

207
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,710
What will I do with him?
He's just clueless.

208
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,210
- Is it drugged?
- Shoot.

209
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,680
Sangtae, actually,
I couldn't do it last night.

210
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,850
Really?

211
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,530
I told you not to ask me twice
when I tell you something.

212
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,330
No, I couldn't.

213
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,230
You retard. You took her home,
but you couldn't do anything?

214
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,500
It's not like that.

215
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,350
She's too good for me.

216
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,550
I don't know why you had such
a useless moment of self-realization.

217
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,090
In the end, she's just a woman.

218
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,450
It's because you didn't see her.

219
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,320
Hey, when I first saw her,

220
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,860
I thought it was a freaking dream.

221
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,670
You should've had that dream
for your own last night.

222
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,070
Retard.

223
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,100
What would you know?

224
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,970
I was just happy for
sleeping in the same room.

225
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,040
That's a pathetic excuse, you dork.

226
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,180
What?

227
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,180
What did you say?

228
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,490
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,750
Since I've been away,
you think you got this town?

230
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,260
- I'm sorry.
- You little twerp.

231
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,900
Did you leave the lights on?

232
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,130
Someone is in there.

233
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,050
Hello.

234
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,360
This isn't a home fit for
a human being.

235
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,190
I've been cleaning all day
with no end in sight.

236
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,320
Goodbye.

237
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,160
What kind of a guy are you?

238
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,100
You're pretty shameless.

239
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,070
After making me clean all day long,

240
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,240
the least you can do is thank me.

241
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,910
Oh, yes. Thank you.

242
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,420
But why are you cleaning
when it'll just get dirty again?

243
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,060
Well, where are you?

244
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,230
If you knew where I was,
would you rush over here?

245
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,240
If you can find me,
come to get me, sucker.

246
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,710
Where are you?

247
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,810
Well, where are you?

248
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,210
What a crazy jerk.

249
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,190
I'm hungry.

250
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,060
The call earlier was from
the guy yesterday, right?

251
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,890
The guy who punched me
and ran away.

252
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,970
If he came after me with a knife,

253
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,600
would you be able to protect me?

254
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,210
Who?

255
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,110
The guy from yesterday?

256
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,550
Tell him to come.

257
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,550
Do you have his number?

258
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,620
Call him now and tell him

259
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,590
to try his luck here.

260
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,420
I'll show him.

261
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,690
Mister, who are you exactly?

262
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,260
The refrigerator is totally empty
with no water to drink.

263
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,470
The dishes look like
they haven't been used.

264
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,810
Mister, are you a spy?

265
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,720
Huh?

266
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,360
That's a false accusation.

267
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,950
Don't you know how serious that is?

268
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,190
It's 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.

269
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,070
That's a big crime, calumny.

270
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,830
I've studied a bit of law.

271
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,240
So you're a con man.

272
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,870
Why would you say that of all things?

273
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,490
This town is so trashy.

274
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,350
but I like it,
because it's human.

275
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,910
Be careful!
It's not that wide you think.

276
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,110
Living in the world is harder than we think.

277
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,890
I don't know how you
met a guy like him.

278
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,260
Everyone, regardless of
how they look,

279
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,050
has worries on their mind.

280
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,790
And that's life, isn't it?

281
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,870
Are you patronizing me?

282
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,610
I'm not that pathetic woman

283
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,670
who needs someone like you
to feel sorry.

284
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm fine now.

285
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
Do something funny.

286
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,480
What?

287
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,590
Just amuse me.

288
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,560
Shall I tell you a funny story?

289
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,630
Show me with your body.

290
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,210
Meow.

291
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,030
You're surrounded now.
Surrender!

292
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,670
Shrimp chips.

293
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,140
Shrimp.

294
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,260
You are so poor at...

295
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,040
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock.Rock.

296
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,650
Rock.

297
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,050
Scissors.

298
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,110
Rock, paper, scissors.

299
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,020
Scissors.

300
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,920
Move your hand to your mouth.

301
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,580
I have no family name.

302
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,650
Well, I do have one.

303
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,620
Park Changsu.

304
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,020
The director of the orphanage
gave me his family name.

305
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,090
It's not my real one.

306
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,430
I'm just Changsu.
Changsu.

307
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,530
This kid has no family name, either.

308
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,700
Who is it?

309
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,970
Then, is that kid's birthday
May 5, too?

310
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,750
Isn't there a hotel
around here?

311
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,520
No, there isn't.

312
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,770
Then, I'll have to sleep here
another night.

313
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,610
Come and sleep over here.

314
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,590
You can sleep up here.
It's cold.

315
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,470
What?
Are you scared of me?

316
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,240
You've been talking
down to me.

317
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,600
But I'm quite old.

318
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,600
Then talk down to me, too.

319
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,180
I won't eat you up.

320
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,710
If we're together,
we'll both be warm.

321
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,860
I should go.

322
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,090
No, no. I'll go up.

323
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,910
Changsu,

324
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,590
you're very nice.

325
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,650
You want to hold me, right?

326
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,840
You can hold me if you want.

327
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,540
I'm just kidding.
Why are you shaking?

328
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,840
I don't think this is...
I'll get on top of you
if you keep this up.

329
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,880
Shall we run far away
and live together?

330
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,400
She left.

331
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,390
What are you doing there?

332
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,030
Morning exercise.

333
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,570
You thought I'd left?

334
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,130
Didn't you see my bag inside?

335
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,580
If it's inside,
I haven't left.

336
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,080
What are you doing?
Breakfast is ready.

337
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,410
Yes, I'm coming.

338
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,360
Let's go eat.

339
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,560
Aren't you eating with me?

340
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,330
I'll eat later.

341
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,990
Thanks for the food.

342
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,970
What's your relationship
with him?

343
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,640
Who?

344
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:11,380
The guy who hit
you yesterday.

345
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,150
He's no one.

346
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,290
Want me to get rid of him?

347
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,860
Where are you going?

348
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,480
I'm not going anywhere.

349
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,300
Get your papers ready
so that we can begin.

350
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,730
I'm not doing it.
What?

351
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,100
I'm not doing it anymore.

352
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,180
Did you take drugs or
something last night?

353
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,220
What's wrong with you?

354
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,510
Why are you grinning
and acting crazy?

355
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,410
Don't grin.

356
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,880
Hey, you can go straight
to the place.

357
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,190
Okay.

358
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,890
Wrap it well.

359
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,430
The woman receiving this
is really classy.

360
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,520
How much is this?

361
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,100
This diamond?

362
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,700
It's a bit expensive.

363
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,030
More than this?

364
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,270
Yes, twice more...

365
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,640
Then give this to me.

366
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,130
Don't worry about the money.

367
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,910
Okay. This one?

368
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,140
This isn't right.
What's the ring for?

369
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,250
You had to rot in jail for six months
to afford a single ring.

370
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,910
For a woman you just
spent one night with.

371
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,260
If I'd known this, I should've
been born as a hot woman.

372
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,890
Don't talk crap.

373
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,790
You'll give it to her in the bag?

374
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
Why not?

375
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,110
Are you crazy?
No one gives a present like that.

376
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,610
Oh, brother.

377
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,170
You take the ring out of there
and put it on her finger,
while you're kneeling.

378
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,070
I know that, you dork.
It's obvious.

379
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,080
Everyone knows that.

380
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,810
Crazy jerk.

381
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,420
You should present it in the box.

382
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,730
I'm only giving her
the ring, you idiot.

383
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,930
Stop acting like you know everything.
I already thought it out.

384
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,400
I'll suddenly take the ring out and
put it on her finger,

385
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,870
and it'll move her heart.

386
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,630
Then she'll be very surprised.

387
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,770
I'd be very surprised
if I were a woman.

388
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,280
I put in a whole lot of liver.

389
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,870
Thank you.

390
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,150
Changsu, why do you
look so good today?

391
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,350
Did you eat something good?

392
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,620
I think I'm going to get married.

393
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,430
What? What did you just say?

394
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,740
And I don't have a mother, so...

395
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,930
Who is it? Who's the girl?

396
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,040
Oh, my Changsu is getting married.

397
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,980
It's not going to be a wedding,
just more like a dinner.

398
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,250
Hey, hey, hey. You're going
to be a human being now.

399
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,750
Changsu, I never thought
you would meet a nice girl.

400
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,760
I guess you've gotten lucky after all.

401
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,130
Miyeon.

402
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,500
Miyeon,

403
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,890
I have some warm sausage.

404
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,910
It has intestines and liver inside.

405
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,200
I brought everything you like.

406
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,240
Come out, Miyeon!

407
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,610
You can't be sleeping when
you're the one who asked for food.

408
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,120
Miyeon.

409
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,060
What's this?

410
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,970
This is blood.

411
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,670
What's with this?

412
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,980
What is this?

413
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,320
What's going on?

414
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,420
Miyeon.

415
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,360
You can't be like this.

416
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,890
No, this can't be true.

417
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,270
Oh, Miyeon, Miyeon. Miyeon!

418
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,070
You did the right thing.

419
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,210
Congratulations, sir.

420
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,990
Good work.

421
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,040
Are you staking out or something?

422
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,620
Eat something.

423
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,020
Huh?

424
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Inspector Kim came to the office
during the day.

425
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,330
He asked about you.

426
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,910
Why didn't you tell him
I was here?

427
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,010
You could've gotten prize money
for telling on me.

428
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,220
How can you say that to me?

429
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,500
Well, shit. You and I aren't
blood relatives, and if I want,

430
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,870
we can live like strangers.

431
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,390
Maybe I should just
make money off you.

432
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,110
Let's go to the police station.

433
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,700
Go where?

434
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,010
I'm going to tell them
what I saw.

435
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,710
Why should I hide here
when I didn't kill her?

436
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,080
What will you tell them?
What are you going to say?

437
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,550
You're about to be blamed
for everything.

438
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,530
You have a long criminal record,

439
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,190
and your house is full of evidence.

440
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,820
If you go to the police station,
the cops will only thank you.

441
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,140
If you go now, you'll never
enjoy your freedom ever again.

442
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,940
I can just tell them that
I didn't freaking kill her!

443
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,540
I'm going crazy.

444
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,290
Why did that girl have to die
at my house?

445
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,170
Who is it?

446
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,850
He's a neighborhood thug
from Incheon's Chinatown.

447
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,490
Why did she die at his house?

448
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,560
Bring him to me.
Don't kill him.

449
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,100
I want him alive.

450
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,850
I lost my bankbook.

451
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,850
Yes, this is your ID card.

452
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,150
Sir, can you wait a moment?

453
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,870
Damn it!
I'm dead. Shit!

454
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,310
Shit!

455
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,710
Do you know the Jiseong clan?

456
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,250
You know, the gang that's
sweeping the nation?

457
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,360
They're going nuts to find you.

458
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,050
They've even asked some losers
about you.

459
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,890
There's a bounty for anyone
who gets their hands on you.

460
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,560
What do I have to do with them?

461
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,300
You know the answer to that.

462
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,200
It's about the girl.

463
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,470
She was the boss' girlfriend.
Is this a freaking surprise?

464
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,950
And I heard that
the boss is ruthless.

465
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
We're here.
You can get out.

466
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,610
You'll be safe here
for the time being.

467
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,490
How did you know
about this place?

468
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,920
I know some girls
who don't like motel.

469
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,120
Fucking here is awesome.

470
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,000
Let's have a cup of coffee.

471
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,780
Are you still playing
with cigarettes?

472
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,510
This is quite profitable.

473
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,850
The unit price has gone up.
This is the way to go.

474
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,550
Hello?

475
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,810
Did you ask for me?

476
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,780
What happened to the casino
at Bando Hotel?

477
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,310
I sold the shares.

478
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,020
On your own?

479
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,490
You were at the institution.

480
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,420
So I had no other choice.

481
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,760
Really?

482
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,060
Fine, you did well.

483
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,230
You can leave.
I'm sure you're busy.

484
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,720
What is wrong with you?

485
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,230
Is it that hard to catch some thug?

486
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,230
I'm sorry.

487
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,400
Try harder.

488
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,690
Have you been checking up on me?

489
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,070
Make a wise choice.

490
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,930
Ending up dead
only takes a moment.

491
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,650
You know him, don't you?

492
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,620
I really don't know him.

493
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,630
Don't lie to me.
He came here all the time.

494
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,360
How do you expect me to remember
all the people that come here?

495
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,250
I think it'll be okay.

496
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,920
And above?

497
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,350
I checked the opposite side.
There's no one.

498
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,170
Yes, sir.

499
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,470
We're tracking him down.

500
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,010
Yes, yes.

501
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,560
I was surprised
seeing those jerks go in.

502
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,590
They were like undercover cops.
Those guys...

503
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,100
I was just blown away.

504
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,030
- Sangtae, if you were a woman...
- Yeah.

505
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,740
What would be your password?

506
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,740
0000?

507
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,410
I've tried it already.

508
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,390
4040.

509
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,890
Whose phone is that?

510
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,390
It's her phone, isn't it?

511
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,330
Why did you take
a dead woman's phone?

512
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,830
Throw it away.

513
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,110
It's just that...

514
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,370
I'm worried
about your safety.

515
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,580
Hey, let's stop the search.

516
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,690
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

517
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,360
It's been an hour already.

518
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,400
Changsu, is her name
Kim Seonhee?

519
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,130
She's really pretty.

520
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,870
Hey. Hey, man.

521
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,940
Oh, it's her!

522
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,020
Shit, she's hot.

523
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,190
Wow

524
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,850
Was the password right?

525
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,350
No.

526
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,800
Let's go, then.

527
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,500
What are you staring at?

528
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,410
She won't come back to life.

529
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,710
Just be yourself.

530
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,380
Remember your motto in life?

531
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,510
You wanted to live a cowardly life
to survive a very long time.

532
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,950
That's true.

533
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,820
But I came to think...

534
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,030
I never wanted to be born,

535
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,400
and I've never done anything
what I wanted in my own life.

536
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,100
It's always been
for everyone else.

537
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:39,200
I should freaking die the way I want.

538
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,110
That's what I've been thinking.

539
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,620
I don't know who the hell

540
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,080
ruined my life,

541
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,920
but I want to die
on my own terms.

542
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,120
I don't care if I regret it later,

543
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:04,360
but once, just this once.

544
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,000
Let me do
what I want to do.

545
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,190
It's your favorite drink.

546
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,540
Take your hands off
the Mapo development project.

547
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,470
What?

548
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,840
Jeonghak is on the case.

549
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,850
Was that your own decision again?

550
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,080
I'm sorry.

551
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,180
If it's not final,
let Mr. Kim take over.

552
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,770
Do you think
he can handle it?

553
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,600
Are you upset?

554
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,370
No, I think it's
the right decision.

555
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,910
This guy's been working
for me for 10 years.

556
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,150
He's really good with his job.

557
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,150
- Drink up.
- Yes.

558
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,110
To Dongin Primary School.

559
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,310
Cheers!

560
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,250
Have a seat.

561
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,750
We should've kept in touch.

562
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,620
Did you cut all ties
now that you're a cop?

563
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,830
I don't remember your face.

564
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,330
Who remembers everything
from primary school?

565
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,990
That's what it's supposed to be like.

566
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,940
Do you remember everything
from primary school?

567
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,640
No.

568
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,200
Do you remember anything?

569
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,440
I remember.

570
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,440
See? There's nothing.
She's just joking around.

571
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,340
This is the phone number
that reported me?

572
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,610
Call the number.
Wait a second.

573
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,550
Give it to me.

574
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,250
You have to be grateful to me.

575
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,730
Do you know how much
I spent to get this...

576
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,790
Wait a second.

577
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,430
Hello and thank you very much
- for calling Ocean Nightclub.

578
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,420
- Hello?

579
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,250
Why haven't you been around?

580
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,880
Busy with business?

581
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,590
Do you know me?

582
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,860
Sure. Last time you came,
I brought you a lot of girls.

583
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,730
Don't you remember?

584
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,020
It's my first time here.

585
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,870
Huh? Why are you saying that?

586
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,940
I remember
all the good-looking guys.

587
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,570
- Yongpil.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,110
Where do you live?

589
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,050
What are you doing?

590
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,250
Shit, what's up?
What's wrong with me?

591
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,610
Who are you?

592
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,020
Don't you know me?

593
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,720
Who the heck are you?

594
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,130
Are you crazy?
Why are you tying me up?

595
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,160
Let me go, you jerks!

596
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,860
Who the heck are you guys?
What are you doing?

597
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,400
What's up?
What's going on?
Let me go...

598
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,470
Hey! You.

599
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,980
Did you report a murder recently?

600
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,540
What?

601
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,880
I know.
I'm working right now!

602
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,580
That boss is making me do crap.

603
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,920
Even if I get fired, I can
just get a different job.

604
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,620
Hey, I have to hang up.
I'm hanging up.

605
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,430
Hello?

606
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,370
Yes, hello?
Is this the police station?

607
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,080
What is this?

608
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:26,750
What a freaking...

609
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,100
You make me surprised.

610
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,770
Who are you?

611
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,710
Get up, jerk.

612
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,700
Hey. Hey.
What is this thing?

613
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,440
Who sent you?

614
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:50,570
Hey. Do you know me?
Huh?

615
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,040
You rat.

616
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,350
Hey, do you know me?

617
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,580
Who sent you?

618
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,330
Hello?
Who's out there?

619
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,890
What is it?

620
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,530
Get in now!

621
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:09,960
Stop!
You stop!

622
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:56,280
The Mercedes Benz.
It's him, it's that guy.

623
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,380
The guy who hit me before.
It's him. It's him.

624
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,730
You should've looked for it.

625
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,790
I couldn't find it.

626
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,390
I looked everywhere,
even your clothes and the closet.

627
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:16,660
It could've fallen on the floor.
I'll look for it.

628
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,600
The ring doesn't
have an owner now.

629
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,560
Why do you want to find it?

630
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,310
What is it?
Someone was here.

631
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,510
Let's go.
Why?

632
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,240
Run!

633
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,890
Hey!

634
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,780
Get away from me!

635
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,720
Okay now, you son of a...

636
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,060
Get away from me!

637
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,730
Shit!

638
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,860
- You, fucking...
- You come here.

639
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,410
Snap out of it. Hurry!

640
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,860
Move.
Hey, where's my bag?

641
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,900
- Bag?
- Yeah.

642
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,490
I moved it to the back storage.

643
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,060
Hey, why'd you take it all the
way there? You little son of a...

644
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,570
That's all for today.

645
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,200
Wrap it up now. If anyone
mentions wiping this place out...

646
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,210
Move.

647
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,650
Hey, just...
Jeez.

648
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,850
Jeez.

649
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,860
- How have you been?
- Hello.

650
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,870
Will you put this
on here?

651
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,870
Yes, sir.

652
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,240
- I'm going. See you.
- Bye.

653
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,710
That's $3.

654
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,680
I see.

655
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,960
Hey, have a drink.
Sangtae.

656
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,940
Let's just go to the guy
who can get you on a stowaway boat.

657
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,270
I don't think there's
any other way out.

658
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:20,440
The kimchi is great.
There must be a secret recipe.

659
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,450
The kimchi that lady makes
is so good.

660
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,950
It's not like other kimchi.

661
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,290
She is worried about you.

662
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,560
How's she doing?

663
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,510
I'm having a really
hard time, too.

664
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,240
Guys are roaming the streets
to try and catch you.

665
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,340
Your photo is all over the place.

666
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,980
I feel like people are following me.

667
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,610
How long will you be living like this?

668
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,980
Hey, you jerk.
I'm just going to...

669
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,400
It's really delicious.

670
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,850
With your cooking, you should open
a big restaurant in downtown.

671
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,250
I guess he doesn't
eat here anymore.

672
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,150
Changsu.
He's my friend.

673
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,430
I haven't seen him lately.

674
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,890
What is it?

675
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Where were you?

676
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,450
I forgot something.

677
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,720
Where are you going?

678
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,550
I'll go get some more soju.

679
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,280
Forget about soju.
I don't want to drink.

680
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,160
What's with your face?

681
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,620
Were you in another fight?

682
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,360
You're too old to be
getting into fistfights.

683
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,960
Little rascal.

684
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,060
I'm going to visit Jaewuk.

685
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,940
Who's Jaewuk?
The son of the old geezer?

686
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,850
He went to the police station.

687
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:06,020
Since he has no guardian,
I have to go instead.

688
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,110
I'm his parent.

689
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,390
Is he an orphan?
Yes.

690
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,410
Fine.

691
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,560
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

692
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,690
I'll be right back.

693
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,400
This kid has no last name, either.

694
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,440
Does his birthday fall on May 5th, too?

695
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,940
Got it.

696
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,390
He's like a sleeping baby.

697
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,130
I wonder if he knows how
he looks when he sleeps.

698
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,170
Playing around...

699
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,740
There's nothing useful around here.

700
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,710
Just look at the dust on the window.

701
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,180
What is this basket?

702
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,880
He has so many lighters.
He's selling them?

703
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,430
Hee Coffeehouse, Sook Coffeehouse
Min, Young, Gom Coffeehouse...

704
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,530
Huh, he's living in Coffeehouse? Um...

705
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,210
I still like him somehow.

706
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,240
Sit down, you.

707
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,510
Yes.

708
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,350
I don't think you need
to worry about him.

709
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,390
Yes.

710
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,460
Yes?

711
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,500
Yes, we're still tracking him down.

712
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,570
I think we'll catch him soon.

713
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,310
Yes, sir.

714
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,040
Why did you kill
such a nice, pretty girl?

715
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,000
I didn't kill her.
Please believe me.

716
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,770
I told you already.
Please call the cops.

717
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,010
This is going to hurt a bit.

718
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,230
You should've known who
she was before you killed her.

719
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,080
You'll need two fingers to eat.
The choice is yours.

720
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,710
What will it be?

721
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,390
I'll save your thumb
and index finger.

722
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:40,560
Just kill me.
Why don't you just kill me?

723
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:44,100
I didn't kill her!
Just kill me instead!

724
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,100
I'll do it step by step.

725
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,440
You must have 200 bones.

726
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:57,280
Just hang in there
and you'll win.

727
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,000
Save me. I killed her!

728
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,960
I did it. I killed her.

729
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,020
I did it. I killed her.

730
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,860
Why did you kill her?

731
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:26,970
I choked her
with my own two hands.

732
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,810
You stabbed her.

733
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,680
Right, I stabbed her neck
with a knife.

734
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,350
I killed her,
so please save me.

735
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,470
You must be very hungry, Changsu.

736
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,180
The kids should've fed you.

737
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:13,720
If you keep denying it,
your neck is next.

738
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,390
Just think of it as bad luck.

739
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,540
I stabbed her with my knife
because I got mad.

740
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:50,050
Who messed him up?
What's going on?

741
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,020
I beat him a few times
because I got angry.

742
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,300
Everyone, outside.

743
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,220
It's just the two of us here.
No one else is listening.

744
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,200
If you tell me the truth,
you can live.

745
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:39,740
In fact, I...

746
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,580
I want to live.

747
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,080
I'm sure you do.

748
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,750
Did you kill her?

749
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,620
I just...

750
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,520
Take him.

751
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,970
Are you Park Changsu?

752
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,130
You're under arrest for murder.

753
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,470
You have the right
to remain silent,

754
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,670
and you have the
right to an attorney.

755
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,480
Are you a cop?

756
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,670
Get up.

757
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,480
Do you know
that I killed someone?
Be quiet.

758
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,180
Am I going to the police station?

759
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,090
If you beat up the suspect like that,
it makes trouble for us.

760
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,850
I killed her.

761
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,220
Am I heading
to the police station now?

762
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,100
I killed her, you jerks!

763
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,460
I killed her!
All of you, I killed her!

764
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,030
I'm going to kill you all!

765
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,570
Do you want to die?
I'm going to the police station.

766
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,840
I killed her!
I killed her!

767
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,420
Why did you do that?

768
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,920
Do you think I got to where I am
without knowing what I know?

769
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,950
Your leg...

770
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:49,030
Is this what you called
we're brother?

771
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,930
Do you think
you're still my brother?

772
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,580
I freaking missed you.

773
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,210
Why did it take so long
to come to see me?

774
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,680
You jerk.
I thought you'd changed.

775
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,850
If you had been a day later,
I was going to sever ties with you.

776
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,090
How's it going?

777
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,000
This is my home ground.

778
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,270
The guy with the biggest crime
is the leader here.

779
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,840
It's really cool.

780
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,100
I can't forget my roots.

781
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,050
That's a relief.

782
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,380
I'm sorry.

783
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,250
About what?

784
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,920
Deokhee came in a week ago.

785
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,460
I heard about your wedding date.

786
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:54,160
I don't think I can go
to your freaking wedding.

787
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,890
Even if I can't make it,
I'll give you the most cash.

788
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,470
Just so you know.

789
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,700
That's not necessary.

790
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,340
Are you looking down on me
just because I'm in jail?

791
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:14,820
Did you know that a cigarette
costs more than gold here?

792
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:21,120
I'm selling cigarettes wholesale.

793
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,490
In a year, I'll be able to buy a house.

794
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,690
It's nothing.

795
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,100
I'll get a new house

796
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,900
for you and your wife,
so just you wait.

797
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:38,010
Huh?
You little rascal.

798
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,600
It's not an empty promise.

799
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,350
Did you ever see me
break a promise?

800
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,650
Time's almost up.
Say your goodbyes.

801
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,250
Bye.

802
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,660
Changsu.

803
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:06,470
I did it. I told on you.

804
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,230
Forget it. Just leave.
Don't talk about it.

805
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:15,540
Hold on.
I want to say I'm sorry.

806
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,710
I was too scared.

807
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,480
I know I was shameless, but...

808
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,100
Changsu, I'm sorry.

809
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,420
I'm really sorry.

810
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:57,520
So sorry.

811
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,100
Did you get permission
to do business?

812
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,580
What?

813
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,110
Sangtae.

814
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,750
I have a good news.

815
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:40,990
What is it?

816
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:50,620
I think I can buy you a house.

817
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,910
I don't need a house.
Just worry about yourself.

818
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,880
Hey, I'm talking here.

819
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:07,280
As a man, you have to
hit the jackpot in your life, jerk.

820
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:12,050
Maybe you saved your manhood
at the bank.

821
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,550
Let me see. Huh?

822
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,790
Let me see
if you're still man enough.

823
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:19,490
Let me take a look.

824
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,360
Changsu, you haven't changed a bit.
Have a drink.

825
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,670
Sangtae.

826
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:45,550
I won't be living my life
the same way.

827
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,930
A man should
freaking do something.

828
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,660
<i>Boss of Jiseong clan</i>
<i>goes missing</i>

829
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,990
<i>Jiseong clan's successor</i>
<i>Kim Doseok takes control</i>

830
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,400
<i>Kim Doseok booked on charges</i>
<i>of corruption in casino management</i>

831
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:13,530
<i>Kim Doseok released</i>
<i>from prison after just four years</i>

832
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,000
Is this Chairman Kim Doseok's room?

833
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,240
Chairman Kim

834
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,900
I'm a very close friend
of Chairman. Ask him.

835
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,540
Chairman Kim,
you know me, right?

836
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,410
Chairman Kim, don't you know me?
Chairman Kim.

837
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,750
Don't you know Miyeon?
You know Miyeon.

838
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,850
- Take him out.
- You jerk. You know Miyeon.

839
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,430
It's sweet.

840
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,640
You've become quite a great person.

841
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:57,380
I really didn't find my leg's
inconvenient when I was in prison.

842
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:02,680
But now that I'm out,
it's a bother to be outside without this.

843
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,220
The world has gotten
so much better.

844
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,850
Can I have a cigarette?

845
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,540
I don't want anything much.

846
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:26,500
I did have my rates.

847
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:34,920
And if you can pay me well,
I'll disappear nice and clean.

848
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:46,930
I know you're a busy person.
I've taken up too much of your time.

849
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:04,300
It's just one case.
You can't have two culprits, can you?

850
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,880
I've taken the punishment,
so it's time to pay me.

851
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:26,930
Play this.

852
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:39,150
If you do this, do you think
you'll win against the chairman?

853
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,860
You should go home early.

854
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:39,100
This must be your summer home.

855
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,910
It's quite the palace.

856
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,510
Thank you for inviting me here.

857
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:47,110
I really am humbled, sir.

858
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,750
You got ahold of something good.

859
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:00,060
There's one motto I have in life.

860
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,330
It's to live a cowardly life.

861
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,330
But after living my life,

862
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:12,610
I became a coward to myself.

863
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,750
And that really was embarrassing.

864
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:25,980
You're such a great man.

865
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,320
You may not
understand a guy like me.

866
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:31,590
Where is it?

867
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:36,860
Why are you in such a hurry?

868
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,940
Give me a million dollars.

869
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,790
And you do realize
this isn't the original.

870
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,490
If something happens to me,
all the world will hear the recording.

871
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:16,340
You've learned a bit
about the world, I see.

872
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,480
I know how to make a deal.

873
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,880
I don't think it's such a big request.

874
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:34,990
I know it's not
such a big deal to you.

875
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,620
Is this the original
what you said?

876
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,560
It was sent by delivery.

877
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:52,610
Also, here's a letter
to the police detective.

878
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:59,880
Do you think I got to where I am
without much?

879
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,550
What will it be?

880
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,160
Do you think

881
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,700
I came here
without thinking of death?

882
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,870
Hello?

883
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:59,030
Forget about
the funds in China.

884
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,700
You know my investment
in the South American mine?

885
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,140
Withdraw ten million dollars.

886
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,280
I heard that gold prices are high
in Hong Kong.

887
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,050
Invest all of it in gold.

888
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,590
Do what you want
with the merchandise from Japan.

889
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,190
Something shorter than 16cm
won't reach the heart.

890
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:20,590
Do you see what's in the safe?

891
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:29,030
Drink this, and it's all yours.

892
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,730
Did you ever see a mouse
hold a grudge against a cat?

893
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:41,200
You have to try to escape.

894
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:46,410
If you take on the cat,
it'll only benefit the cat.

895
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,850
I think you lost this time.

896
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,820
If you drink,
I'll let you go in peace.

897
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:32,720
Thank you.

898
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,480
Thank you for keeping
my dignity.

899
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:32,650
Jerk, hit me more.

900
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:50,260
Is that your best punch?

901
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,970
Hit me some more.

902
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,000
Hit me more.
You son of a...

903
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,080
How dare you try to fight me?

904
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,680
More, more!
Why is your punch so weak?

905
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,180
You're such a pussy.

906
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,620
More, more.
Son of a bitch!

907
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,230
More, more.

908
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,060
You're nothing to me.

909
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:34,290
How dare you,
son of a bitch!

910
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,510
Jeez.

911
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,580
You can only protect
your pride if you're strong.

912
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,780
Do you jerks know
what that is?

913
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,290
How dare a guy without a leg
try to take me on?

914
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:11,100
Such a clueless jerk.

915
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,380
It's already started.

916
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,390
You smoke fancy cigarettes, sir.

917
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:28,350
You should've known that
your cigarette was poisoned.

918
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:40,190
I told you not to hit women.

919
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:51,730
Now you're getting punished,
you son of a bitch.

920
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,210
The cigarette tastes nice.

921
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:13,010
Here!
It's yours.

922
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,660
I've...

923
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:33,470
I've gotten rid of everyone
who's been bullying you.

924
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,750
Aren't you happy I'm here?

925
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,860
I'm happy
you're next to me.

926
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:15,650
Let's run far away now.

927
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:53,580
Miyeon. Miyeon.

928
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:03,430
Miyeon, I took down everyone
who had bothered you.

929
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:14,900
<i>Lee Miyeon didn't have any connection</i>
<i>so it was taken out.</i>

930
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,910
Where did you go
after calling me here?

931
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,210
You don't even have a mobile.

932
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:56,880
I felt rushed.

933
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:58,820
Why are you so happy suddenly?

934
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:01,220
Let's go somewhere
to get a cool drink.

935
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,690
That sounds great.

936
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,990
I know a bar with hot girls.

937
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:08,620
I don't go to bars anymore.
That's so tacky. Don't do that.

938
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:11,960
Why are you so happy?
Did you take drugs? Uh?
