00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,367
EW, IS THAT WOMAN
BEING CRAPPED ON?

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,834
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
IT'S FUCKING GERMAN SCHIZER PORN.

170
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,033
ALL RIGHT, DUDE?
IT'S FUCKING HOT, RIGHT, YO?

171
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,667
NO, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU, YO?

172
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,267
NOTHING.

173
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,801
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF
YOU LIVED IN EUROPE.

174
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,133
I MEAN, THESE EUROPEANS ARE
MUCH MORE BROADMINDED THAN
THESE UPTIGHT AMERICANS.

175
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,968
SHIT'S HUGE IN GERMANY.

176
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,901
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT IN EUROPE
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF.

177
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,167
YEAH, I KNOW,
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE A FAG.

178
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,000
DUDE, IT'S GROSS.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
I'D DO IT...

180
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,801
DO SOMEONE.

181
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,501
- OH.
- I WOULD.

182
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,701
I'D CHILI-DOG HER.

183
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:28,567
HI, JENNIFER.

184
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,801
COME ON, BABY, THAT PUSSY'S
NOT GONNA EAT ITSELF.

185
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,834
WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

186
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,234
UH, NOTHING.

187
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,767
YOU'RE A FUCKING PIG.

188
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,801
WOW, OKAY.

189
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,667
HOLD THAT.

190
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,100

191
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,701
<i>( crowd reacting )</i>

192
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,067
- ( grunting )
- GET OFF ME, YOU DUMB JOCK!

193
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,300
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T EVEN PLAY SPORTS.

194
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,901
- YOU--
- HEY!

195
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:03,033
COME ON, GUYS,
KNOCK IT OFF. KNOCK IT OFF.

196
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,567
YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.

197
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,300
OH, YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME UP?

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,100
- COME ON.
- CAN'T YOU CONTROL THAT ANIMAL?

199
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,767
NOW COME ON, TOUGH GUY,
LET'S GO.

200
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,567
LET'S GO, GUYS.
COME ON.

201
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,901
Principal:
<i>KYLE,</i>

202
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,567
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO JENNIFER?

203
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,601
NOTHING.

204
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,901
HE SAID THAT HER PUSSY
IS NOT GOING TO EAT ITSELF.

205
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,601
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

206
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,534
YOU ARE--
THAT IS RUDE.

207
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,367
- AND YOU'RE A PERVERT.
- BE QUIET.

208
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,200
KYLE, IS THAT
WHAT YOU SAID?

209
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,767
NO.

210
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,100
JENNIFER, CHRIS,
GET BACK TO CLASS.

211
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,734
<i>KYLE, I NEED TO SPEAK</i>
<i>WITH YOU AND YOUR FATHER.</i>

212
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,534
<i>KYLE,</i>

213
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,567
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE
ON ACADEMIC PROBATION

214
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,901
AND YOUR GRADES SHOW NO
SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT.

215
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,501
<i>IF YOU DON'T</i>
<i>STRAIGHTEN UP,</i>

216
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,701
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
EXPEL YOU.

217
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:08,033
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YES, MR. ANDERSON.

218
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,367
I DO UNDERSTAND.

219
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,734
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
AND NO MORE TROUBLE.

220
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:16,000
WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.

221
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,267
LANCE,

222
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,267
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME.

223
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,133
<i>WHAT ISN'T EASY,</i>
<i>MR. ANDERSON?</i>

224
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,868
HOW'S KYLE BEEN ACTING
AT HOME?

225
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:34,000
I MEAN, DOES HE SEEM
NORMAL TO YOU?

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OH, YEAH.

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,634
OH.YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT SOMETIMES

228
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,200
THESE THINGS TAKE
A LONG TIME TO SURFACE.

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
WHAT THINGS?

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,667
WELL, I THINK THAT KYLE'S
POOR GRADES AND ACTING OUT

231
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,801
SHOW SIGNS OF A SERIOUS
DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM.

232
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,868
HE BELONGS IN
A SPECIAL-NEEDS SCHOOL

233
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,601
<i>WHERE HE CAN GET THE PROPER</i>
<i>ATTENTION AND CARE THAT HE REQUIRES.</i>

234
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,267
- WHAT?
- THAT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

235
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:58,267
SIR, HE'S--
HE'S NOT SLOW.

236
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,834
HE'S JUST BEING A PAIN.

237
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,367
<i>GIVE HIM</i>
<i>ANOTHER CHANCE.</i>

238
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,133
WELL, I HAVE.
I'VE GIVEN HIM MANY CHANCES.

239
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,400
THAT'S TRUE.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,767
( sighs )

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,667
ALL RIGHT.

242
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,734
ALL RIGHT, BUT HE'D BETTER START
SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT

243
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:25,100
AND QUICKLY. AND HE'S GOT TO STOP
DISTURBING THE OTHER STUDENTS.

244
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,434
THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.

245
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,133
THANK YOU.

246
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:33,000
- YOU'RE GROUNDED.
- I'LL RUN AWAY.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,634
OH, AND LIVE
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

248
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,334
AND HER BOY-TOY TODD?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

249
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,033
- I'LL TAKE AWAY YOUR COMPUTER.
- NO, YOU WON'T.

250
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,300
YES, I WILL.
JESUS CHRIST, KYLE,

251
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,434
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

252
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,367
I DIDN'T ASK TO
BE BORN.

253
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,133
NEITHER DID I.

254
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,834
BOO HOO.

- WHAT'S THAT?
- OH, GOD, YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

260
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,334

NO, IT IS SERIOUSLY
SO GOOD.

YEAH, LIKE "I, ROBOT."

MIKE, WOULD YOU READ IT
AT THE ASSEMBLY?

289
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,734

IT'S NOT A NATIONAL,

- NO.

300
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,501
ACTUALLY, IT IS
A NATIONAL MAGAZINE.

GREAT.

00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,634
RAISING A SON
IS SO HARD.

307
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,667
DON'T GET ME WRONG, MY HUNTER IS THE
BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

308

OH, GOD.

311
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,968
THE KID'S A PLAYER.

312
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,601
WELL, I WONDER WHERE
HE GETS THAT FROM.

313
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:53,534
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- ( laughs )

314
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,801

THE SEPARATION?

315
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,701
REAL WELL.

316
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,200
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SEPARATED.

317
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,267
YEAH.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH,

318
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,934
BUT HIS MOTHER AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO MAKE A BABY TOGETHER.

319
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,234
WE JUST WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

320
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,400
- THAT'S SO SAD.
- YEAH.

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,634
THANKS.

322
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,300
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SEE HIM?

323
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,167
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

324
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:20,267
THEY'RE NOT KIDDING WHEN
THEY SAY THAT RAISING A CHILD

325
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,000
IS THE TOUGHEST JOB
YOU'LL EVER LOVE.

326
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,667
MMM. WELL, YOU SOUND
LIKE A GREAT DAD.

327
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,067
AH, WELL,

00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:05,200
JESUS CHRIST,
HOW ABOUT A "THANK YOU"?

679
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,767
ARE YOU ON YOUR PERIOD
OR SOMETHING?

680
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>CAN I NOT SAY ANYTHING?</i>

681
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,968
HEY, ISN'T THAT-- ISN'T THAT
MIKE WITH MISS REED?

682
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,400
YEAH, IT IS.

683
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,968
DUDE, I WOULDN'T LET
MY BITCH TREAT ME THAT WAY.

684
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,634
- YOU DON'T HAVE A "BITCH."
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

685
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,501
- HI, KYLE.
- HEY.

686
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,400
- MR. CLAYTON.
- HELLO, ANDREW.

687
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,267
OH, WOW, SO HE
GOT IT FOR YOU.

688
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,901
- SWEET. - NOT THAT SWEET.
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST ONE.

689
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,267
WHAT-- DAD, WE'RE GONNA
GO HOME AND HOOK THIS UP.

690
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,634
WHAT ABOUT GOING TO
THE MOVIES?

691
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,968
DAD, WE'LL GO
TO DINNER LATER!

692
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,801
OKAY, FINE.

693
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,200
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, MR. CLAYTON?

694
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,734
OH, PROBABLY GO TO THE MOVIES
BY MYSELF, ANDREW.

695
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,601
ANDREW!

696
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

697
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,601
<i>YOU'RE CARRYING THAT</i>
<i>THE REST OF THE WAY.</i>

698
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,400
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

699
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,901
FUCKING PUSSY.

700
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,467
GOD DAMN IT.

701
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,701
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

702
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,667
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S ME.

703
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,267
WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?

704
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:20,734
<i>I was with Mike.</i>
<i>He was having a breakdown about his divorce.</i>

705
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:23,167
HE WAS DEPRESSED 'CAUSE
HE HAD TO GO TO THIS WEDDING,

706
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,734
SO I WENT WITH HIM TO THE MALL AND
HELPED HIM PICK UP A SUIT TO WEAR.

707
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,767
I KNOW,
I SAW YOU TWO THERE.

708
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,234
YOU DID?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

709
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:34,667
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMED WEIRD.

710
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,834
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I HAVE MALE FRIENDS?

711
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,734
NO, IT BOTHERS ME YOU KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET

712
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,601
AND YOU'RE OUT
IN PUBLIC WITH HIM.

713
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,767
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT, HMM?

714
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,501
LET'S GO OUT.
WE'LL GO OUT SOMEPLACE FANCY,

715
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,434
SOMEPLACE THE WORLD
CAN SEE US.

716
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:52,467
HOW ABOUT
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE?

717
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,767
OH.

718
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,734
ANYONE WHO'S ANYBODY
WILL BE THERE.

719
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,667
YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE
AUSSIETIZERS...

720
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:02,033
YOU KNOW, WAIT, I CAN'T.
I PROMISED KYLE I'D TAKE HIM OUT.

721
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,601
LET ME TAKE
BOTH OF YOU OUT.

722
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,601
- IT'LL BE MY TREAT.
- <i>Really?</i>

723
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:09,167
OH.
THAT'S SO NICE.

724
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,467
- HEY, KYLE.
- <i>I'M IN HERE.</i>

725
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,300
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TIP OVER THIS PHOTO?

726
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,968
<i>'CAUSE I HATE IT.</i>
<i>I LOOK INBRED.</i>

727
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,267
I THINK YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

728
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,334
WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER
TONIGHT WITH CLAIRE.

729
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,200
WHAT? NO.

730
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,667
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
- OH, COME ON.

731
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,601
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SEEING MR. LANE.

732
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:33,300
NO NO, THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS
AND SHE'S TRYING TO HELP HIM
OUT THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

733
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,901
WHY AM I EXPLAINING
THIS TO YOU, KYLE?

734
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,467
DAD, OKAY, LOOK,

735
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:39,000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH BEING SEEING
WITH A TEACHER AS A DAD,

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,234
BUT BEING SEEN WITH
TWO TEACHERS IS AIDS.

737
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,801
OKAY, GET DRESSED.
PUT ON SOMETHING NICE.

738
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,334
IF YOU DON'T ACT RIGHT AT DINNER,
I'LL STAB YOU IN THE FACE.

739
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,067
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO, KYLE?

740
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,501
NOTHING.

741
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,601
NOTHING?
YOU MUST LIKE TO DO SOMETHING.

742
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,634
NO.

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,934
KYLE JUST GOT A NEW MONITOR
FOR HIS COMPUTER.

744
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:04,567
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO ON THE COMPUTER?

745
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,267
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY YOU ASK.

746
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,067
- <i>I LIKE--</i>
- GAMES, MOSTLY.

747
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,801
- KYLE, WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?
- ANDREW.

748
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,000
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A BREAK
WHILE WE'RE EATING, SON?

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,367
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

750
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,167
PUT IT AWAY.

751
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,200
( chuckles )

752
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,501
SO, KYLE,

753
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,734
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

754
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:34,334
I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS.

755
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,934
- OKAY.
- OOH.

756
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,200
WATCH OUT.

757
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,167
ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IT?

758
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,400
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.
NON-STOP.

759
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,434
I'M HURTING RIGHT NOW.

760
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,167
( laughs )

761
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,334
LET'S NOT MAKE ME
THROW UP.

762
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,667
SO DO YOU PLAY SPORTS?

763
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,567
NO NO. I'M A BIG SPAZ LIKE MY DAD.

764
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,701
WELL, I WAS ON THE DIVE TEAM
IN COLLEGE.

765
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:08,100
DIVING IS NOT REALLY
A SPORT, IT'S FALLING.

766
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,734
I'M SORRY.

767
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:16,133
<i>NO OFFENSE.</i>
<i>IT'S JUST FUNNY.</i>

768
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,567
HEY, WHY DON'T WE RENT
A MOVIE AFTER DINNER?

769
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,367
SURE, AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT HORROR.

770
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,534
- REALLY?
- I DO NOT LIKE HORROR.

771
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,801
ZOMBIES? ARE YOU
OKAY WITH ZOMBIES?

772
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,667
- NO.
- OH.

773
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,934
DO YOU LIKE MUSICALS?
I LOVE MUSICALS.

774
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,367
BOB FOSSE WAS A GREAT
DIRECTOR.

775
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:37,634
HE DID "SWEET CHARITY"
AND "ALL THAT JAZZ."

776
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:40,767
- "CABARET." - ONE OF THE GREAT
NAZI MUSICALS OF ALL TIME.

777
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,634
BESIDES "THE SOUND
OF MUSIC," YOU KNOW?

778
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,267
THEN HE DID "STAR 80."
THAT WAS NOT A MUSICAL, BUT...

779
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:48,033
- I ONLY LIKE THE MUSICALS.
- OH, WELL.

780
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,968
- ME TOO.
- "WILLY WONKA."

781
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,634
WHICH ONE?

782
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:54,300
- Lance: <i>WELL, GENE WILDER.</i>
- ( beeping )

783
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,901
- I LIKE JOHNNY DEPP.
- OH.

784
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,501
- YEAH.
- MM-HM.

785
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,467
- BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE GENE WILDER... - <i>( beeps )</i>

786
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:04,200
- ...IN "YOUNG...
- Both: FRANKENSTEIN."

787
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,033
<i>"WHAT HUMP?"</i>

788
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:09,133
DID YOU SEE IT?

789
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,267
- NO.
- OH, YOU SHOULD.

790
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,701
- IT'S AMAZING.
- REALLY WONDERFUL.

791
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,267
YEAH.
EVERYBODY'S SEEN IT.

792
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,701
- I'M SURE.
- <i>YEAH.</i>

793
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:20,467
- NIGHT, MISS REED.
- GOOD NIGHT, KYLE.

794
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:23,033
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HIT THAT SHIT TONIGHT?

795
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:26,200
- SHUT UP! - COME ON, DUDE.
THAT SHIT'S TIGHT, DUDE.

796
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,734
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU
DON'T NAIL HER--

797
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,567
HEY HEY,
IF YOU DON'T NAIL HER, DUDE, YOU'RE--

798
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,300
- YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

799
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
<i>DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T THINK</i>
<i>ABOUT PUSSY ALL THE TIME TOO.</i>

800
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,834
- <i>I KNOW YOU DO.</i>
- <i>KYLE.</i>

801
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,934
<i>YOU'RE DROPPING ME</i>
<i>OFF FIRST, I GET IT.</i>

802
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:39,334
- <i>YOU WANT ME TO GO.</i> - I JUST WANNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT TO HER ALONE.

803
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,133
- OKAY?
- WITH YOUR COCK.

804
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,868
KYLE,
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.

805
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,801
WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT THE FUCK UP?

806
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:48,100
JESUS, MAN. YOU FUCKING NEED
TO GET LAID. GO OVER THERE.

807
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,901
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

808
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,100
ALL RIGHT. DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO, OKAY?

809
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,834
SHORT OF KILLING HER,
THAT LEAVES ME A LOT OF ROOM.

810
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,033
HEY, BABY.

811
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,801
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
KYLE.

812
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,801
NIGHT, WHORE.

813
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:09,200
HEY.

814
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,100
- THAT WAS FUN.
- THE KISS?

815
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,734
- MM-HMM.
- I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING, COME ON.

816
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,534
- NOT TONIGHT.
- WOW.

817
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,133
ARE YOU SHOOTING
ME DOWN?

818
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,567
LISTEN, I'D LOVE TO STAY,
BUT I PROMISED KYLE I'D BE RIGHT BACK.

819
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,934
KYLE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

820
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,801
OH NO.
HE LIKES YOU A LOT.

821
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,300
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

822
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,567
HE TOLD ME THAT
WHEN I DROPPED HIM OFF.

823
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,300
- HE DID?
- YEAH.

824
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,033
HE SAID I WAS
A LUCKY GUY.

825
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:31,834
NO, I'M THE LUCKY GUY.

826
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,634
I GOTTA GO.

827
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,901
OH, COME ON.
HE'S ALMOST AN ADULT.

828
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,868
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

829
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:42,033
WHOA.

830
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,300
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE
HOME WITH THAT BONER, HUH?

831
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,934
I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A STICK-SHIFT
JOKE THERE SOMEWHERE

832
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,400
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT 'CAUSE ALL
THE BLOOD'S LEAVING MY BRAIN.

833
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:55,267
- SLEEP WELL.
- HEY.

834
00:35:56,534 --> 00:36:00,267
OH, THAT'S SWEET.
MMM.

835
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:03,667
- <i>I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.</i>
- OH.BOO.

836
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,133
- YOU'RE MEAN.
- GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PEA.

837
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,501
GOOD NIGHT,
CREAM CHEESE.

838
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,267
YOU KNOW I--
OH!

839
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:15,701
- HMM?
- <i>DAMN YOU.</i>

840
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:16,701
YOU SURE?

841
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,467
I'M BACK.

842
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,601

- 'CAUSE SHE THREW UP IN YOUR PLANTER

HE JUST--

IT'S JUST, HE DIDN'T
SEEM THAT SAD.

904

ANDREW, KYLE WAS
A COMPLEX GUY.

905

DR. PENTOLA

WE CALLED HIM IN

00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:36,934
BECAUSE I-- I DON'T WANNA
GET THROWN OUT OF HERE.

1020
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:39,300
- OH, I PROMISE.
- THANKS.

1021
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,801
I-I KNOW
IT'S A FIRE HAZARD

1022
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:44,934
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
RATIONAL, BUT...

1023
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:49,167
I FEEL THAT IF I
THROW ANYTHING OUT,

1024
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,367
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WILL HAPPEN.

1025
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,100
- NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- GOOD.

1026
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,100
WHAT'S WRONG, SWEETIE?

1027
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,901
I KNOW MY SON WAS
A JERK, BUT I MISS HIM.

1028
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:13,100
HEY.

1029
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,200
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
- MMM.

1030
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,968
IT'LL GET BETTER.

1031
00:50:16,968 --> 00:50:20,567
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT
RIGHT NOW.

1032
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:22,267
DO YOU KNOW THAT

1033
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:25,467
I HAVE READ EVERY ONE
OF YOUR BOOKS?

1034
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:26,934
HOW?

1035
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:28,534
HOW?

1036
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:30,234
YOU THREW 'EM OUT.

1037
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:32,000
OH, YEAH.

1038
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,901
YOU ARE VERY TALENTED.

1039
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:36,200
REALLY?

1040
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,701
HONEST.
YOU HAVE A GIFT.

1041
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:41,701
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

1042
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:43,200
I WON'T.

1043
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,601
LISTEN,

1044
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:47,934
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A ZOMBIE
MARATHON ON TELEVISION

1045
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:51,067
AND I CORDIALLY

1046
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:52,634
INVITE YOU, SIR.

1047
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,501
OH, WELL, BLESS YOU,
MADAM.

1048
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,300
- UH-HUH.
- IT'S A DATE.

1049
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,501
GOOD.

1050
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,634
DON'T FORGET THE BROWNIES.

1051
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,667
- I WON'T FORGET.
- NO.

1052
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,267
YOUR DOG'S STARING
AT ME.

1053
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:09,901
WHAT DOG?

1054
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,000
( laughs )

1055
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,367
I GOT YA.

1056
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:19,467
- LANCE!
- OH.

1057
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,667
- I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
- WHAT'S UP?

1058
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:25,534
YOU KNOW THAT WHILE WE
RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY,

1059
00:51:25,534 --> 00:51:28,801
WE ALSO RESPECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND EXPRESSION HERE AT SCHOOL?

1060
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,267
- YEAH.
- WELL, ONE OF THE KIDS ON THE PAPER

1061
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,067
WENT ONLINE AND THEY FOUND
KYLE'S POLICE REPORT--

1062
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:37,767
THE REPORT OF HIS DEATH.
AND NOW THEY'VE GONE AND
PUBLISHED HIS SUICIDE NOTE.

1063
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,567
- OH MY GOD.
- YEAH.I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

1064
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:43,033
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
IT'S ALL OVER CAMPUS.

1065
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,467
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1066
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,734
YOU-- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

1067
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:49,767
SURE.

1068
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:52,033
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, LANCE.

1069
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:54,300
IT'S THAT GODDAMN
FIRST AMENDMENT, HUH?

1070
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,701
YEAH.

HAS ANYONE SEEN
CARL OR STEVEN?

1108
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,000
MM-HMM.

1109
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,567
OH, YOU HAVE?
SO THEY'RE IN SCHOOL?

1110
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,868
YEAH, I SAW 'EM
THIS MORNING.

1111
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:10,067
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE,

1112
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,934
<i>ESPECIALLY THE NEWCOMERS.</i>

1113
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,100
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

1114
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,601
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
WITH WRITING POETRY?

1115
00:55:16,601 --> 00:55:19,267
- YES, HEATHER.
- CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

1116
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,634
SURE.

1117
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:23,601
WHAT WAS KYLE'S
FAVORITE BAND?

1118
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:24,801
UH...

1119
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:27,100
HE LIKED
BRUCE HORNSBY.

1120
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,300
<i>YES, RAY?</i>

1121
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,067
DID HE LISTEN
TO ANY METAL?

1122
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,701
- A LITTLE OZZY.
- I KNEW IT.

1123
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:37,067
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT POETRY OR...

1124
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,100
<i>YES, JASON?</i>

1125
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,968
DID THE BOY KNOW JESUS
BEFORE HE WENT?

1126
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:42,734
WELL, I WOULD SAY
HE WAS AN AGNOSTIC.

1127
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:45,234
BUT I THINK HE WAS
SPIRITUAL IN HIS OWN WAY.

1128
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:46,834
YEAH-- YES, HEATHER?

1129
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,067
WHAT'S HIS SIGN?

1130
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:50,868
OH, HE WAS BORN
APRIL 18TH, SO--

1131
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:52,901
ARIES.

1132
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,601
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1133
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:58,634
YOU KNOW, ANYBODY KNOW
EZRA POUND?

1134
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:00,901
<i>LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI?</i>

1135
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:06,501
YOU KNOW
WHAT KYLE REALLY LIKED?

1136
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,033
EMILY DICKINSON.

1137
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,801
WHAT BAND IS THAT?

1138
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:11,868
IT WASN'T A BAND.
SHE WAS A POET.

1139
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,133
- SHE HOT?
- <i>UM, SHE WAS A VICTORIAN.</i>

1140
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:18,200
IF YOU LIKE YOUR BUTTONED-DOWN GIRL,
SHE WAS ONE OF 'EM.

1141
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,667
- NICE.
- <i>( bell ringing )</i>

1142
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:22,133
- <i>MR. CLAYTON.</i>
- <i>PETER.</i>

1143
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:25,501
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?
- <i>SURE.</i>

1144
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:27,167
IT'S ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE.

1145
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,167
IT-- IT AFFECTED ME
A LOT.

1146
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:33,200
WELL, IT SEEMED TO AFFECT
A LOT OF STUDENTS.

1147
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,467
- I'M NOT HAPPY, MR. CLAYTON. - MM-HMM.

1148
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:38,501
I'M LIVING A LIE.
I'M GAY.

1149
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,501
AND KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE,

1150
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:43,534
IT'S HELPED ME GET THE
COURAGE TO COME OUT FINALLY.

1151
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,767
WELL, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

1152
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,934
I'M MISUNDERSTOOD TOO,
JUST LIKE HE WAS.

1153
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:50,000
I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY.

1154
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,968
GOOD FOR YOU, PETER.
I-I WISH YOU THE BEST.

1155
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:54,667
THANK YOU.

1156
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:01,968
HEY, MR. CLAYTON.

1157
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:03,434
- MR. CLAYTON.
- GINGER.

1158
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:05,634
KYLE WAS RIGHT.
EMILY DICKINSON'S GREAT.

1159
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,534
ISN'T SHE?

1160
00:57:07,534 --> 00:57:09,167
- MR. CLAYTON?
- YES.

1161
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:12,601
- I WROTE ANOTHER POEM.
- CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT, HEATHER.

1162
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:15,701
- JOHN.DOCTOR.
- HEY.

1163
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:17,400
CLAIRE.

1164
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,133
MR. C., WHAT'S UP?

1165
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:26,601
"MILKY WHITE SKIN
AND HAIR SO BROWN

1166
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:29,534
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
HOW BAD YOU HURT

1167
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:32,200
I COULD HAVE HELD YOU
WHILE YOU CRIED

1168
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
YOU WERE TOO SWEET
TO STAY

1169
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,167
IN THIS HARSH WORLD

1170
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,534
BUT I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU CLOSE TO MY HEART

1171
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:43,300
- MY ANGEL IN CARGO PANTS"
- Boy: <i>OH, WOW.</i>

1172
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,534
<i>( applauding )</i>

1173
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,334
HE WAS SUCH
A SWEET KID.

1174
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:04,534
AND KIND.

1175
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,334
OH, PLEASE.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

1176
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:11,334
( sighs )
AS A FATHER,

1177
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:14,467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF
HUNTER DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1178
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,400
MY HEART REALLY GOES
OUT TO YOU, LANCE.

1179
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,067
THANKS.

1180
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:20,601
IT'S SO SAD. I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS SUCH A GOOD WRITER.

1181
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,367
<i>DID HE WRITE</i>
<i>ANYTHING ELSE?</i>

1182
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,067
YEAH, HE DID.

1183
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:31,467
I KNOW IT'S REALLY PERSONAL,
BUT DO YOU THINK I COULD READ IT?

1184
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:34,300
WELL, IF YOU CAME OVER
TO MY APARTMENT.

1185
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,234
I JUST DON'T WANT HIS STUFF OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW, FLOATING AROUND.

1186
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,567
SURE.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

1187
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:40,834
GREAT.

1188
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:47,534
MY PLAYOFF GAME'S
TONIGHT.

1189
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:52,434
ALL RIGHT.
NOT THE LIP.

1190
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:54,000
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TAKE THE LIP.

1191
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,701
OH, THANKS, MIKE.

1192
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,133
WHAT TIME?

1193
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,634
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE TIME BECAUSE
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T CLEANED.

1194
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,434
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1195
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:08,601
- WELL, 8:00?
- THAT'S GREAT.

1196
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:17,567
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.

1197
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,133
THANKS.

1198
00:59:21,734 --> 00:59:23,400
IF YOU THINK THIS
IS A BAD IDEA--

1199
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,601
NO NO NO.
NOT AT ALL.

1200
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:28,100
I FOUND SOMETHING
KYLE WROTE

1201
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,601
AND I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.

1202
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,567
OKAY.

1203
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:50,300
THIS IS FROM HIS JOURNAL.

1204
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,200
"I WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH
MY DAD AND CLAIRE TONIGHT.

1205
00:59:55,901 --> 00:59:57,701
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM,

1206
00:59:57,701 --> 01:00:00,501
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SEEING THEM TOGETHER

1207
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,334
ONLY PROVES THAT I'LL
NEVER BE HAPPY.

1208
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:07,167
I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND
A WOMAN LIKE HER--

1209
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:10,801
<i>SO PRETTY,</i>
<i>SO PERFECT.</i>

1210
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:14,300
SHE SEEMS TO COMPLETE HIM.

1211
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:20,667
I HOPE THEY MAKE IT.

1212
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,934
I HOPE THEY LAST.

1213
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,934
I HOPE I'M LEAVING
MY DAD IN GOOD HANDS.

1214
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,334
NO ONE COULD EVER GET ME.

1215
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,467
I DON'T EVEN GET ME."

1216
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,868
OH.

1217
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,167
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
COULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

1218
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,534
HE DID LIKE ME.
HE REALLY DID.

1219
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:46,200
<i>HE DID.</i>
<i>HE REALLY DID.</i>

1220
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,467
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

1221
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:51,100
NO.
I'D NEVER DO THAT.

1222
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,334
- <i>REALLY?</i>
- REALLY.

1223
01:01:03,501 --> 01:01:05,701
( moaning )

1224
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:19,701
MR. CLAYTON.

1225
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,901
- GOOD MORNING, HEATHER.
- YES.

1226
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,601
GOOD MORNING.

1227
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:26,701
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
OF KYLE'S?

1228
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:27,901
WHAT?

1229
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,534
THAT I COULD HAVE?

1230
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:32,467
- NO.
- OH.

1231
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:35,367
WAIT A SECOND.

1232
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:41,234
HERE YOU GO.

1233
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:42,734
BRUCE HORNSBY?

1234
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:46,334
THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE.

1235
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,033
THANK YOU.

1236
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:08,901
I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1237
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:11,100
YEAH, I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT TOO.

1238
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,701
- YEAH.
- ( sighs )

1239
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:16,634
I'M TIRED OF HIDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

1240
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:26,200
MMM.

1241
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,767
- DAN.
- LANCE.

1242
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,868
- GINGER.
- MR. CLAYTON, LOOK AT THIS.

1243
01:02:52,868 --> 01:02:54,601
OH.

1244
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,367
HEATHER.

1245
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:02,067
HEY, MR. C.

1246
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:05,100
OH, PETER.

1247
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,367
- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.
- OH.

1248
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,601
I DON'T KNOW IF KYLE
EVER TOLD YOU,

1249
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,267
BUT HE AND I WERE
KINDA BROS.

1250
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,267
I'M GONNA WIN THIS GAME
TONIGHT IN HIS HONOR.

1251
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,100
GREAT, PETER.

1252
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:30,767
Andrew:
<i>MR. CLAYTON?</i>

1253
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:31,968
ANDREW.

1254
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:34,400
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,
DOES IT?

1255
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,234
WHAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT?

1256
01:03:36,234 --> 01:03:38,033
HOW EVERYONE IS ACTING.

1257
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:39,968
<i>LIKE THEY LIKED KYLE.</i>

1258
01:03:39,968 --> 01:03:42,100
NO, IT DOESN'T.

1259
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,234
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>IS WEIRD?</i>

1260
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:47,767
- WHAT?
- KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE.

1261
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,634
IN WHAT WAY?

1262
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:52,133
THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING
AN INSIGNIFICANT MOLECULE

1263
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:54,901
BOUNCING AROUND IN A
MEANINGLESS GODLESS UNIVERSE.

1264
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:58,534
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
BUT KYLE WAS...

1265
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,567
WHAT?

1266
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,601
KINDA DUMB.

1267
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:04,801
HA.NO.

1268
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:07,901
KYLE WAS ACTUALLY
SMART, ANDREW.

1269
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:11,100
YOU KNOW, HE JUST PRETENDED
TO BE DUMB, EVEN AROUND YOU

1270
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,033
SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WOULDN'T PICK ON HIM.

1271
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,100
YEAH, MAYBE.

1272
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,000
- Heather: <i>IT'S MINE!</i>
- Ginger: <i>LET GO, YOU CRAZY--</i>

1273
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,501
HEY!

1274
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:22,067
OH! GET OFF!

1275
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,601
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LIKE KYLE!

1276
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,133
YOU DIDN'T LIKE KYLE!

1277
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:27,067
SHUT UP, WHORE!

1278
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:39,634
BRUCE HORNSBY?

1279
01:04:39,634 --> 01:04:41,868
Lance:
<i>I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.</i>

1280
01:04:41,868 --> 01:04:43,334
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1281
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:46,234
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

1282
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:48,234
SUICIDE LEAVES
MANY VICTIMS.

1283
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:50,400
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

1284
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,767
KYLE MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING
FROM A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.

1285
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:55,467
AND I KNOW THAT THE NOTE
BEING PUBLISHED

1286
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:57,534
HAS CAUSED YOU SOME
DISTRESS,

1287
01:04:57,534 --> 01:05:01,133
BUT IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN
A VERY POSITIVE THING.

1288
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:03,200
<i>STUDENTS ARE</i>
<i>COMING TO SEE ME.</i>

1289
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,167
<i>IT'S THE BREAKTHROUGH</i>
<i>I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.</i>

1290
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,501
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OF THESE KIDS

1291
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:10,601
I CAN HELP BECAUSE THEY'RE
REACHING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME?

1292
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:14,100
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE PART WHERE KYLE WRITES:

1293
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,167
"I LOVE YOU, DAD."

1294
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:19,901
BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T
REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?

1295
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,067
BUT HE DID.

1296
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:25,501
LANCE, SUICIDE

1297
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:28,033
IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

1298
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:30,334
TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

1299
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,367
AND WHO KNOWS

1300
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:35,133
HOW MANY KIDS WE WON'T LOSE
BECAUSE OF THAT NOTE?

1301
01:05:36,234 --> 01:05:38,133
<i>KEEP YOUR CHIN UP KNOWING</i>

1302
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:41,400
<i>THAT KYLE MAY HAVE NOT</i>
<i>DIED IN VAIN.</i>

1303
01:05:43,567 --> 01:05:47,234
<i>* IN LIGHT OF ALL</i>
<i>I'VE LEARNED SO FAR *</i>

1304
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,000
<i>* I DON'T BELIEVE</i>
<i>I'M SO STRANGE *</i>

1305
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,100
<i>* IN SPITE OF ALL</i>
<i>THIS TIME I SPEND *</i>

1306
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,734
<i>* CALLING THE AIR</i>
<i>BY A NAME *</i>

1307
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:58,767
<i>* WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT</i>
<i>GOES OVER THE TREES *</i>

1308
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:01,300
<i>* HE WILL BE</i>
<i>SINGING WITH ME *</i>

1309
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,467
<i>* AND IF I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>SINGING ALONE *</i>

1310
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:07,300
<i>* HE ALWAYS</i>
<i>LEAVES ME BE *</i>

1311
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,067
<i>* I'M SHAKING</i>
<i>MY SHADOW HAND *</i>

1312
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,934
<i>* AS THE SUN MOVES</i>

1313
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:15,834

1315
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:24,767

1316
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:32,501
Lance:
<i>DR. PENTOLA.</i>

1317
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:34,234
LANCE, YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD.

1318
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:36,167
WELL, I HAD KIND OF
A ROUGH WEEKEND.

1319
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,868
I DID A LOT OF SOUL
SEARCHING

1320
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,367
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE

1321
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,133
AND THE EFFECT
ON THE OTHER KIDS,

1322
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,467
AND...

1323
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,467
THIS IS KYLE'S JOURNAL.

1324
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,434
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU
TO READ.

1325
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:51,534
I WANT YOU TO READ IT, AND IF YOU THINK
IT'LL BE OF VALUE TO THE OTHER KIDS,

1326
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,868
I WANNA PUBLISH IT
AND HAND IT OUT TO THEM.

1327
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:58,968
- I'LL SEE IF I CAN'T GIVE IT A LOOK.
- OH, THANKS.

1328
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,634
Lance:
WELL?

1329
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:06,934
( sighs )

1330
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,901
IT'S SO SAD.

1331
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:11,267
YEAH.

1332
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:13,501
I MEAN, KYLE WAS SUCH

1333
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,300
A STRONG POWERFUL WRITER.

1334
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,167
SO TORTURED.

1335
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,868
YES, HE WAS.

1336
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA CALL IT?

1337
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,267
I WAS THINKING
"I AM WHAT I HATE."

1338
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:30,667
WHAT?

1339
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:35,067
"I AM WHAT I HATE."
KYLE WROTE THAT IN CHAPTER SIX.

1340
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,634
OH.

1341
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:39,000
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1342
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I DON'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.

1343
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,300
WHY?

1344
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:47,334
- TO ME, A BETTER TITLE...
- MM-HMM.

1345
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:50,534
...WOULD BE
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

1346
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,901
- OH.
- YOU KNOW?

1347
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,901
BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

1348
01:07:57,267 --> 01:07:59,400
BUT HE DIDN'T WRITE
THAT THOUGH, I MEAN...

1349
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,534
YEAH, BUT
HE FELT THAT.

1350
01:08:01,534 --> 01:08:03,868
- YOU'RE INFERRING THAT FROM HIM.
- <i>YES.</i>

1351
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:06,000
OH.

1352
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,968
"I AM WHAT I HATE" DOESN'T

01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,601
ARE YOU READY FOR
OUR UNDEAD MARATHON?

1403
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:03,834
Lance: <i>Well, that's the thing.</i>
<i>Something came up.</i>

1404
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,000
<i>KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.</i>
<i>I CAN'T MAKE IT.</i>

1405
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,033

- OH.NO, IT'S OKAY.

- OH YEAH, DEAR.GOOD.

1407
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:13,434
YEAH, LISTEN I--
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

1408
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:15,234
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>It's just a small emergency.</i>

1409
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:19,200
- OKAY.SEE YOU.
- SORRY.BYE.

1410
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
Mike: <i>EVERYTHING OKAYTHERE, PAL?</i>

1411
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,601
YEAH, GREAT.

1412
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:25,067
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

1413
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:27,100
YOU KNOW WHAT LINE
REALLY BLEW ME AWAY,

1414
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,901
IS WHEN KYLE WROTE:

1415
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:32,367
"AMERICA IS ONE OF THE FINEST
COUNTRIES ANYONE EVER STOLE."

1416
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:34,534
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

1417
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:36,901
HE REMINDS ME
OF MY HUNTER.

1418
01:11:38,534 --> 01:11:40,367
LANCE, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

1419
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:43,000
I LURED YOU OUT HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

1420
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,334
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

1421
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:48,567
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
IF WE RENAMED THE LIBRARY

1422
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:51,300
THE KYLE CLAYTON
MEMORIAL LIBRARY?

1423
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,667
BUT YOU WERE GONNA PUT HIM
IN A SPECIAL-NEEDS CLASS.

1424
01:11:54,868 --> 01:11:56,501
YEAH.

1425
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:58,767
YEAH, AND I FEEL
REALLY BAD ABOUT THAT.

1426
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:01,033
- OH.
- HE WASN'T SLOW.

1427
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:03,033
OBVIOUSLY
HE WAS BRILLIANT.

1428
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:05,634
HE WAS JUST BORED.

1429
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:07,734
YOU KNOW, WE HAD HIM
TOTALLY WRONG.

1430
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:11,567
I JUST HOPE TO GOD THAT OUR MISTAKE
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH--

1431
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:13,667
WELL, WITH
WHAT HAPPENED.

1432
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:15,100
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT DIDN'T.

1433
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,267
THANKS, LANCE.

1434
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:18,367
<i>YOUR SAYING THAT</i>
<i>MEANS A LOT.</i>

1435
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,467
<i>THIS TRIBUTE WILL BE AN</i>
<i>INSPIRATION TO OTHER STUDENTS</i>

1436
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,434
<i>AND IT'LL HELP KEEP</i>
<i>KYLE'S MEMORY ALIVE.</i>

1437
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:27,000
SURE, SIR.
WYATT.

1438
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,501
THANKS, LANCE.
THANKS.

1439
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:35,934
OH!

1440
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,334
JUST LIKE MY PROM NIGHT,
NOTHING WENT IN THE HOLE.

1441
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:43,868
NO, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE A TASTEFUL DEDICATION.

1442
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:45,334
VERY TASTEFUL.

1443
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:49,400
- <i>( cell phone ringing )</i>
- <i>( beeps )</i>

1444
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,133
HELLO?

1445
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:56,701
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

1446
01:12:56,701 --> 01:12:58,601
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1447
01:12:58,601 --> 01:13:01,400
- WOW.
- WHAT?

1448
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,534
PENTOLA-- HE SENT
KYLE'S JOURNAL TO DR. DANA.

1449
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,367
SHE LOVES IT. SHE WANTS ME
TO BE ON THE SHOW.

1450
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,901
SHE'S GONNA FLY ME
TO L.A.

1451
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:10,601
- WHAT'S DR. DANA?
- SHE'S LIKE OPRAH.

1452
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,133
WELL, SHE'S NOT
AS BIG AS OPRAH.

1453
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:18,167
I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD SHOW,
YOU KNOW?

1454
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,067
WOMEN SEEM TO
REALLY LIKE IT.

1455
01:13:22,934 --> 01:13:24,868
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

1456
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,534
- ANDREW.
- <i>ARE YOU BUSY, MR. CLAYTON?</i>

1457
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,968
OH, NO NO.
JUST PACKING FOR MY TRIP.

1458
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:38,267
YEAH, THAT TV SHOW.

1459
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:40,467
"DR. DANA."

1460
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,634
WHAT'S UP?

1461
01:13:43,634 --> 01:13:45,033
I FEEL BAD.

1462
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,834
I WISH I KNEW
HE WAS THAT DEPRESSED.

1463
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:49,701
YOU AND ME BOTH.

1464
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:52,033
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE
ABOUT THE BOOK?

1465
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,234
WHAT?

1466
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:56,667
KYLE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT VAGINAS, ANAL SEX,

1467
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:59,067
FISTING, FELCHING
OR RIM JOBS.

1468
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,434
IT IS A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE
FELCHING AREA, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1469
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:06,200
BUT I THINK IT'S THERE,
ANDREW, IN ITS OWN WAY.

1470
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,000
I WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
THE BOOK IS SO SMART AND SAD.

1471
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,133
HE NEVER TALKED
WITH ME LIKE THAT.

1472
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:15,367
<i>I WISH HE DID. MAYBE HE WOULDN'T</i>
<i>HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID.</i>

1473
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,534
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,
ANDREW.

1474
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:19,834
ONE THING I KNOW,
HE LIKED YOU.

1475
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:21,467
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
TALK TO ME?

1476
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:23,067
<i>WHAT DO YOU WANT ME</i>
<i>TO TELL YOU, ANDREW?</i>

1477
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,634
MAYBE IT'S LIKE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

1478
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,634
HE WAS SUPER SMART.
HE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

1479
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:28,434
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
OF BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY.

1480
01:14:28,434 --> 01:14:31,033
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE WAS ALREADY TREATED LIKE A FREAK.

1481
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,601
IF HE WAS THAT SMART HE WOULD
HAVE LOVED TO RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT.

1482
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:36,200
OH, JESUS CHRIST, ANDREW.
WHY CAN'T YOU LET IT GO, OKAY?

1483
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,634
NO WONDER
YOUR MOTHER DRINKS.

1484
01:14:38,634 --> 01:14:41,601
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LAST
THINGS KYLE SAID TO ME?

1485
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:44,601
HE SAID THAT YOU'RE
A STUPID FUCKING IDIOT.

1486
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,634
<i>HAVE A GOOD TIME</i>
<i>ON YOUR TV SHOW.</i>

1487
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:48,501
KYLE'S STILL DEAD.

1488
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:50,067
ANDREW.

1489
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:55,234
ARE YOU ALMOST READY?
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.

1490
01:14:55,234 --> 01:14:57,300
Claire: <i>I THINK YOU SHOULD
KEEPYOUR PANTS ON.</i>

1491
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,133
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR PANTS ON.

1492
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,834
<i>I'M NOT GOING</i>
<i>TO WEAR PANTS.</i>

1493
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:03,367
OH.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

1494
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:04,767
<i>YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.</i>

1495
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:06,467
MMM.
THANKS.

1496
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,601
I'M USING BACKWARD
PSYCHOLOGY.

1497
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:11,367
IT'S NOT WORKING.
I HAVE TO PEE AGAIN.

1498
01:15:11,367 --> 01:15:13,334
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

1499
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,033
- HELLO.
- MR. CLAYTON,

1500
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:21,901
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE
BUT THE SHOW CALLED AGAIN

1501
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:24,734
- AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE LEAVING.
- OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1502
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,667
BABY, THAT WAS THE DRIVER.
HE SAID THE SHOW CALLED.

1503
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,534
WE GOTTA GET GOING,
OKAY?

1504
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:32,968
- ( sighs ) - OH, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
LET'S GET GOING, COME ON.

1505
01:15:32,968 --> 01:15:35,501
- DOES THIS MAKE MY ASS LOOK BIG?
- NO NO. NOT AT ALL.

1506
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:37,734
- YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR ASS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1507
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:40,567
- I MEAN--
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T HAVE AN ASS?

1508
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:43,601
I'M SAYING YOUR ASS IS THERE,
BUT IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.

1509
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:45,567
- I'M CHANGING AGAIN.
- NO.

1510
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:49,367
YOU KNOW,
SWEETHEART,

1511
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:51,868
I REALLY SHOULD GET OVER THERE SO
I COULD SIT DOWN WITH THE PRODUCER

1512
01:15:51,868 --> 01:15:53,367
AND GO OVER WITH WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY.

1513
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:54,901
THAT WOULD

IS SHE GONNA BE HOLDING
UP THE BACK OF THE BOOK?

1540
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,767
THAT'S A DIRECTOR QUESTION.
I'M A SEGMENT PRODUCER.

1541

01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:03,601
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF
ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH LANCE.

1546
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,801

- OH, THANK YOU. - HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO PUBLISHERS?

1565
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:42,467
- NO. - BECAUSE I HONESTLY

01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:43,901
THE BIGGEST POSTHUMOUS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY

1567
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:45,434
SINCE "THE DIARY

YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,

1613
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,534
I DIDN'T KNOW-- I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.

1674
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:13,901
- GOOD.
- OKAY?

1675
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:18,501
AND THEY ALSO WANT
A BOOK OF YOURS TOO.

1676
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:22,067
- THAT'S AMAZING.

1677
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:24,200

BRUCE HORNSBY.

1682
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:45,601
WE WROTE MR. HORNSBY
AND HE CAME.

1683
01:23:45,601 --> 01:23:47,601
HEY, MAN, WHEN I HEARD
WHAT A FAN KYLE WAS

1684
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:49,634
I THOUGHT,
HOW CAN I SAY NO?

1685
01:23:49,634 --> 01:23:50,868
All:
<i>AW.</i>

1686
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:52,934

<i>BRUCE HORNSBY.</i>

1688
01:24:09,968 --> 01:24:12,934

<i>* ANOTHER SONG</i>
<i>CAME AND WENT *</i>

1692
01:24:34,734 --> 01:24:37,868
<i>* LIKE THE TIMES</i>
<i>THAT WE SPENT *</i>

1693
01:24:37,868 --> 01:24:40,934
* HIDING OUT
FROM THE RAIN *

1694
01:24:40,934 --> 01:24:44,300
* UNDER THE CARNIVAL TENT

1695
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:48,033
* I LAUGHED
AND SHE'D SMILE *

1696
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:50,968
* IT WOULD LAST
FOR A WHILE *

1697
01:24:50,968 --> 01:24:53,300
* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GOT *

1698
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:57,334
<i>* TILL YOU LOSE IT</i>
<i>ALL AGAIN *</i>

1699
01:24:57,334 --> 01:25:00,167
<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>THE MANDOLIN RAIN *</i>

1700
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:03,234
<i>* LISTEN TO THE MUSIC</i>
<i>ON THE LAKE *</i>

1701
01:25:03,234 --> 01:25:06,701
<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>MY HEART BREAK *</i>

1702
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,934
<i>* EVERY TIME</i>
<i>SHE RUNS AWAY *</i>

1703
01:25:09,934 --> 01:25:13,200
<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>THE BANJO WIND *</i>

1704
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,834
* A SAD SONG
DRIFTING LOW *

1705
01:25:16,834 --> 01:25:19,167
* LISTEN TO
THE TEARS ROLL *

1706
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:23,467
<i>* DOWN MY FACE</i>
<i>AS SHE TURNS TO GO *</i>

1707
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:26,534
<i>* LISTEN TO THE TEARS</i>
<i>AS THEY ROLL *</i>

1708
01:25:26,534 --> 01:25:30,000
<i>* DOWN MY FACE</i>
<i>AS SHE TURNS TO GO. *</i>

1709
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:43,267
MR. CLAYTON,

1710
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:46,334
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

1711
01:25:46,334 --> 01:25:49,634
I'VE ALWAYS FELT
NOT ENOUGH.

1712
01:25:49,634 --> 01:25:51,634
MY DAD

1713
01:25:51,634 --> 01:25:54,567
RIDES ME
ALL THE TIME.

1714
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,234
HE CALLS ME A LOSER.

1715
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,834
I ALMOST KILLED MYSELF

1716
01:26:00,834 --> 01:26:03,133
UNTIL KYLE'S NOTE
AND BOOK CAME OUT.

1717
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:07,133
IT SAVED MY LIFE.

1718
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,167
I KNOW HE'S LOOKING
DOWN ON YOU SO PROUD.

1719
01:26:15,934 --> 01:26:17,734
THANKS, PETE.

1720
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,901
<i>( applause )</i>

1721
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:29,100
THANK YOU,

1722
01:26:30,567 --> 01:26:33,534
<i>WELCOME STUDENTS,</i>
<i>FACULTY</i>

1723
01:26:33,534 --> 01:26:35,834
<i>AND GUESTS.</i>

1724
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:37,834
TODAY

1725
01:26:37,834 --> 01:26:40,601
WE CELEBRATE KYLE.

1726
01:26:42,567 --> 01:26:45,067
KYLE HAS SHOWN US
SO MANY THINGS;

1727
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:47,267
HOW FLEETING THE TIME

1728
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,467
WE SPEND ON THIS EARTH
REALLY IS.

1729
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:52,934
<i>KYLE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.</i>

1730
01:26:52,934 --> 01:26:54,200
<i>THROUGH HIS BOOK</i>

1731
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,467
<i>AND THROUGH OUR HEARTS</i>
<i>HE WILL LIVE ON.</i>

1732
01:26:59,267 --> 01:27:02,334
TODAY WE DEDICATE
THIS LIBRARY

1733
01:27:02,334 --> 01:27:04,868
IN HIS SPIRIT.

1734
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:07,801
A TRIBUTE TO HIS DEEP
INTELLIGENCE

1735
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:11,934
<i>AND TO THE PROFOUND IMPACT</i>
<i>HE MADE ON ALL OF US</i>

1736
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:15,133
<i>IN THE BRIEF TIME WE WERE</i>
<i>FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW HIM.</i>

1737
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:20,300
AND NOW TO ACCEPT
THIS HONOR ON HIS BEHALF,

1738
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,534
I GIVE YOU HIS FATHER

1739
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,634
<i>MR. LANCE CLAYTON.</i>

1740
01:27:24,634 --> 01:27:26,367
( crowd cheering )

1741
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,734
YOU GUYS
DIDN'T LIKE KYLE.

1742
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:23,734
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
I DIDN'T EITHER.

1743
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:28,133
I LOVED HIM.

1744
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:30,567
HE WAS MY SON,

1745
01:28:32,033 --> 01:28:34,000
BUT HE WAS ALSO
A DOUCHE BAG.

1746
01:28:38,534 --> 01:28:42,167
HE WASN'T VERY SMART

1747
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:44,400
AND HE DIDN'T KILL
HIMSELF.

1748
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,200
KYLE DIED ACCIDENTALLY
WHILE MASTURBATING.

1749
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,667
<i>I MADE IT LOOK LIKE</i>
<i>A SUICIDE</i>

1750
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,667
AND I WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE.

1751
01:29:06,567 --> 01:29:09,801
I ALSO WROTE HIS JOURNAL.
THANK YOU.

1752
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,133
THANKS.

1753
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:30,634
YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.

1754
01:29:30,634 --> 01:29:32,334
YEAH.

1755
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:34,534
Lance's voice:
<i>I USED TO THINK THE WORSTTHING IN LIFE</i>

1756
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,667
<i>WAS TO END UP ALL ALONE.</i>

1757
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:39,067
<i>IT'S NOT.</i>

1758
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:41,501
<i>THE WORST THING IN LIFE</i>
<i>IS ENDING UP WITH PEOPLE</i>

1759
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,968
<i>WHO MAKE YOU FEEL</i>

DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT?

I'D LIKE THAT

<i>* INSIDE I'M DYING *</i>

1840
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:09,467
- <i>* WHEN WE BREAK</i>
- <i>* WHEN WE WILL BREAK</i>

1841
01:35:09,467 --> 01:35:11,534
- <i>* APART</i>
- <i>* APART</i>

1842
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:13,634
- <i>* THEN YOU TAKE</i>
- <i>* THEN YOU TAKE</i>

1843
01:35:13,634 --> 01:35:15,801

1850
01:35:46,534 --> 01:35:50,834

1859
01:36:24,467 --> 01:36:28,868
<i>* I WAS DROWNING</i>

1860
01:36:28,868 --> 01:36:33,701

1862
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:45,367

<i>* FLYING IN THE SKY</i>

1867
01:36:55,901 --> 01:36:58,601
<i>* I FLOAT AWAY</i>

1868
01:36:58,601 --> 01:37:01,400

<i>HIGH HIGH *</i>

1869
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,567
<i>* FOLKS TOSS AND TURN</i>

1870
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:06,167
<i>* AND WALK THE FLOOR</i>

1871
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:09,033
<i>* WHEN THAT OLD WOLF</i>
<i>AOOH AOOH AOOH! *</i>

1872
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,501

01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:43,200
<i>I DON'T CARE</i>
<i>ABOUT ANYTHING.</i>

1884
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,734
<i>* WHEN THINGS ARE TOUGH</i>

1885

1890
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,634
<i>* I JUST LOOK DOWN</i>
<i>LAUGHING *</i>

1891
01:38:01,634 --> 01:38:04,467
<i>* WHEN I GET HIGH</i>
