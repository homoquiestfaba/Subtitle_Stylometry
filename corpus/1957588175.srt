355
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,583
It was stupid.

356
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,458
Fucking stupid.

357
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,000
And Martin was my friend...
and I miss him.

358
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,625
(voice breaks):
That is…

359
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,166
That's not something you joke about.

360
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,333
It was a bad idea and I knew it
right when it came out of my mouth.

361
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,041
- You...
- I'm really sorry.

362
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,958
You are not just going to apologize to me.

363
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,833
You're going to apologize to Joel.

364
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,666
(sighs)
I already spoke to him.

365
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,041
He's leaving on Saturday,

366
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,625
so I invited him over for dinner
on Friday.

367
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,875

Joel, good to see you.

369
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,958
Dinner's almost ready.

370
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,250
Melinda wanted to cook,

371
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,583
but, uh, Trixie banned her from the stove
for two weeks.

372
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,916
It's a long story.

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,875
Is Melinda here?

374
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,041
Melinda? No.

375
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,916
Just you and me.

376
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,083
Why, is that awkward?

377
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,166
I'm just fucking with you.
(laughing)

378
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,875
Yeah, come on in.

379
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,166
So, uh, come on in.

380
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,500
Get you a drink?

381
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,208
Vodka soda?

382
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,583
- Uh, yeah.
- Make yourself at home.

383
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,458
Have a seat.

384
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,875
Thanks.

385
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,375

386
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,541
That is Joel Dash.

387
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,833
He's a friend of your mom's.

388
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,541
Kind of like Martin McRae.

389
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,583

390
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,583
Dry your hands and take this out to Joel.

391

So, you're leaving tomorrow?

396
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,708
JOEL:
Uh, yeah.

397
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,458
You know, I got a job in New Mexico.

398
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,041

400
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,375

401
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,166

402
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,416
Well, Last Supper it is.

403
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,833
Making an old family recipe,
lobster bisque.

404
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,583
Hint of tang, not too creamy.

405
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,375
I think you're gonna love it.

406
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,833
I'm actually allergic to shellfish.

407
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,458
What?

408
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,208
- Yeah, I can't eat it.
- You're kidding me.

409
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,791
All… any shellfish?

410
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,583
No.

411
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,000
MELINDA:
I've always wanted to visit New Mexico.

412
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,666
Yeah.

413
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,166
I mean, I'm going to be working
in Albuquerque,

414
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,833
- which is a little bit different from Santa Fe.
- VIC: Hmm.

415
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:33,250
Santa Fe is probably
more charming, I think.

416
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,000
I definitely want to visit Santa Fe

417
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,916
'cause I heard the same thing,
it's beautiful.

418
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,166
MELINDA:
Yeah.

419
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,833
Well, maybe we'll come visit.

420
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:47,250
Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I don't know
how big my place is going to be, so...

421
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,500
- Joel, I think if we came and visited,
- (laughs)

422
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,000
we'd probably stay in a hotel.

423
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,791
Oh, right, right.

424
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,541
How's the grilled cheese?

425
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,333
Actually, it's amazing.

426
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,750
- Oh, good.
- MELINDA: Can I have some?

427
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,583
- Yeah.
- A bite?

428
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,500
I don't like lobster bisque.

429
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,416

430
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,291

432
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,000
This is amazing.

433
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,083
Melinda kind of has the palate
of a 12-year-old.

434
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,458
Our first date, I took her
to the best restaurant in the city

435
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,083
- and she ordered mac and cheese.
- MELINDA: Yeah.

436
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,750
It's like he was ashamed to be with me.

437
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,541
No, I just realized you were ordering
off the children's menu

438
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,750
to save room for alcohol.

439
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,041
You see, Vic never drinks.

440
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,833
I drink sometimes.

441
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,750
Sometimes I think he's not normal.

442
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,625
'Cause normal people can let go.

443
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,083
You wish that I were normal, Melinda?

444
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,583
- My God, all the time.
- 'Cause if I were normal,

445
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,750
I don't think Joel would be over here
having dinner with us.

446

You don't have to be rude.

447
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,916
I'm not being rude.

448
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,375

474

What for?

1271
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,250
To follow me.

1272
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,333
This is ridiculous.

1273
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:37,291
- How could you do that, Don?
- I made him a week ago.

1274
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,208
I ran into him at a diner with Melinda.

1275
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,958
Go outside, I see a telephoto lens
in the back of his car.

Oh, my God.

1277
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,250
Guy tried to tell me
he was a psychotherapist.

1278
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:46,875
Where'd you find this guy?

1279
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:50,333
You can't just walk into my house
and accuse me, in front of my family...

1280
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:53,333
Apparently, anybody can accuse
anyone of anything.

1281
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:56,250
Unlike you, however, Don, I have proof.

1282
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:59,666
This is a bank record of a wire
from my wife

1283
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:04,208
