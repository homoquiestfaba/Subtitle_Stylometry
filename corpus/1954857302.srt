1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,670
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,074
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:11,277
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:14,113
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,484
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega! Omega...</i>

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,593
Just as much of a dump as it
was when I went to Hamilton.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,999
How do you live here?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,097
How do you live here?

9
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:33,366
You know, they're
actually cool guys.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,601
Cool guys?
Let me get this straight:

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,672
I'm paying 40 grand a year for my
son to be a creative writing major

12
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,641
and live with a bunch
of cool guys?

13
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,976
Dad, you don't have
to be sarcastic.

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,379
What was your g.P.A.
Last semester?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,416
- It was a 3.4.
- When I went to Hamilton, I got nothing but 4.0s.

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,519
How do you expect to get into a
decent law school with a 3.4?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,488
Dad-- - are you even
looking into law school?

18
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,558
Dad, I'm only a freshman! I'm not
even sure if I want to be a lawyer.

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,999
Pledge!

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,526
Pledge!

21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,764
How was your Christmas?
Look what Santa brought me.

22
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,035
- Oh god, rich.
- No more rash.

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,405
You must be pledge's dad.
How are you?

24
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,045
I'll see you
at parents' weekend.

25
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,615
He's not gonna stay
for the party?

26
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,999
- Pledge, don't miss anything.
- All right.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,424
- Pledge, don't miss anything.
- All right.

28
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,427
Pick it all up now.

29
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,166
<i>Aw, come on!</i>

30
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,105
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!

31
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,041
Hey-o! What do we got over here?
What do we got?

32
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,677
Hold that for a second. It's okay,
don't worry about it. Hold that.

33
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,146
Are you writing about the party?

34
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,549
Pledge, all right, look at this, okay?
This is a party.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,384
- That's my journal!
- It's a party.

36
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,999
- Let's go! Come on!
- Attention, Hamilton.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,620
- Let's go! Come on!
- Attention, Hamilton.

38
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,557
Four score and many beers ago

39
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,259
our forefathers--

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,462
- You're doing a shot.
- I can't do a shot tonight.

41
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,031
Dude, you're fresh out
of a two-year relationship.

42
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,466
You're doing a shot. Let's go.

43
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,334
I'm the keymaster.
Merkhaus, it's really--

44
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,036
I shouldn't. It's inappropriate.

45
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,372
Hey, who wants t-brow
to do a shot?

46
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,507
Come on. Come on, t-brow.

47
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,344
All right, just one. This is the
only shot I'm taking tonight.

48
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,081
Whooooaaa!

49
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:29,999
T-brow! T-brow! T-brow!

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,217
T-brow! T-brow! T-brow!

51
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,420
T-brow! T-brow! T-brow! T-brow!

52
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,189
What's your major?

53
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,728
Women's studies.

54
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,365
Yeah. Studying women,
I understand.

55
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,467
So, um,

56
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,971
do you want to go to the back room
and show me how you swab a deck?

57
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,242
All right.

58
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,478
Let's go.

59
00:02:59,479 --> 00:02:59,999
What's the next stop
for the "night train"?

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,647
What's the next stop
for the "night train"?

61
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,351
- <i>The pros?</i>
- Actually, my fraternity's throwing a party tonight.

62
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,752
You got it.

63
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,754
Down the hatch. Down the hatch.
Down the hatch!

64
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,624
There you go! Animal!

65
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,562
Oooh.

66
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,265
Mmm, yeah!

67
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,202
Keymaster!

68
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,999
T-brow! T-brow! T-brow! T-brow!

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
T-brow! T-brow! T-brow! T-brow!

70
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,247
Yo, Richie.
What are you doing, man?

71
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,284
I'm not doing anybody right
now, I'll tell you that.

72
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,020
I hung out with sailor.
She took me to sea.

73
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,556
She wrapped her net around me,

74
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,194
and I saw something bigger
than I've ever seen before.

75
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,503
So why is your omega name
<i>"El nino"?</i>

76
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,999
Because I come at you like a
storm, you know what I'm saying?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,506
Because I come at you like a
storm, you know what I'm saying?

78
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,109
Like torrential downpour
and shit.

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,312
- So what's your omega name?
- Um...

80
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,981
Shut up, pledge!

81
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,117
He doesn't have one yet, okay?

82
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,154
Omega! Omega! Omega! Omega...

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,401
Whoa.

84
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,104
What a night, huh?

85
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,207
- Shut up, pledge.
- Ow.

86
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,583
Oh hey, what time is it?

87
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,286
Uh, it's 2:30?

88
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,720
- P.M.?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

89
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,624
Damn it, pledge, why are
you waking us up so early?

90
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,738
You sure the meeting was
supposed to start at 2:00?

91
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,508
No, giles, I decided to take
half an hour out of our day

92
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,146
to come sit here in the Greek board room.
Of course I'm sure!

93
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,384
Rico! Rico!

94
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,355
- <i>Rico!</i>
- What are you doing here, Max?

95
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,424
The omegas...

96
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,999
- <i>Canceled the Greek board meeting.</i>
- Canceled?!

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,880
- <i>Canceled the Greek board meeting.</i>
- Canceled?!

98
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,264
- <i>I</i> never got a memo.
- Um, well,

99
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,633
they had a huge party
last night,

100
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,470
and because of that-- I mean,
they control the board.

101
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,673
That's it!
I've had it up to here--

102
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,444
With these omegas.

103
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,046
It's the first meeting
of spring semester

104
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,382
and they can't make it because
they're too busy partying?

105
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,186
Remember last year during finals when
they went streaking to the library?

106
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,421
Naked Christmas caroling
fundraiser, sir.

107
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:29,999
How about the time when they used the
science lab for a beer pong tournament?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,392
How about the time when they used the
science lab for a beer pong tournament?

109
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,161
All those beakers.

110
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,430
Or the time when they
canceled <i>our</i> quiz show

111
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,966
because night train wanted
to call a press conference

112
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,335
about his favorite food!

113
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,304
Corn dogs with teriyaki sauce.

114
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,641
And there was that time
a few years ago at their rush.

115
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,409
Ohhh.

116
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,346
Things are going to change
around here this semester.

117
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,484
The omegas' days of doing whatever
they want are about to end

118
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,999
and the rico Larsen era in charge
of Greek board is about to begin.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,640
And the rico Larsen era in charge
of Greek board is about to begin.

120
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,159
I'm running
for Greek board president.

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,629
Rico, you did that last year and
you lost by 99% of the vote.

122
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,699
That was last year!

123
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,335
This year things are
going to change.

124
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,204
The omegas have an 88-year
streak controlling the board.

125
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,140
It doesn't matter
who runs against them.

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,444
- They always win.
- Then we need a new strategy, don't we?

127
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,081
Instead of trying
to beat the omegas,

128
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:29,999
it's time to break them.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,718
It's time to break them.

130
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,130
So last night's total

131
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,534
was an estimated
1,054 party attendees.

132
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,570
Only a thousand? I thought we had,
like, close to 1500 last year.

133
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,073
That's true, but this year
we actually eclipsed

134
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,175
last year's two-to-one
girl-to-guy ratio

135
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,410
and jacked it up
to three to one.

136
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,999
So we may have had
less guests overall,

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,546
so we may have had
less guests overall,

138
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,215
but we had more chicks,
hence a better party,

139
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,986
which enhances the probability
that our next party will be epic.

140
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,754
Nice. Good man, 39.

141
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:12,024
Did you get around to making the
assignments for this semester's rush?

142
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,592
- Mm-hmm.
- I like.

143
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,394
- Hodges.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,731
- Richie Sambora.
- Thank you.

145
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,267
Where's t-brow?

146
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,403
Oh, he's passed out
in the other room.

147
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,705
Whatever, pledge. More for you.
Merkhaus.

148
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,208
- Stick that up your ass.
- Real nice, dude.

149
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:29,999
- Pledge.
- What?

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,610
- Pledge.
- What?

151
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,579
- Thames.
- Mmm.

152
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,615
Now before you see your assignment,
it's important to note

153
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,085
that this semester omega's
looking for a different breed.

154
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,489
We don't really have too much room
in the frat considering it's spring,

155
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,526
so we need to be extra careful
in choosing any new pledges.

156
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,397
Maybe it's chicks.

157
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,365
What are you
waiting for, pledge?

158
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,601
- Broads. The door. Go!
- What? Stop!

159
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,237
Get the door!

160
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,999
- <i>What's wrong with you?</i>
- All right, I'm going.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,073
- <i>What's wrong with you?</i>
- All right, I'm going.

162
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,976
He's been very disrespectful.

163
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,511
<i>Man, I want waffles.</i>

164
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,547
You gotta go a little easy
on the mustard there, night.

165
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,516
Um, guys?

166
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,118
You might want to take
a look at this.

167
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,653
Just send the girls in, dude.

168
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,156
No seriously, guys.

169
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,059
You <i>need</i> to come see this.

170
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,033
All right. Jeez.
This better be good.

171
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,337
It's a baby.

172
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,006
Does he belong
to one of you guys?

173
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,142
Yo, maybe someone left him here
after the party last night.

174
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,046
They sent out a message, and so we found
him here. Hey, man, what's your name?

175
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,450
Look, he's got a note.

176
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,190
"The baby is yours"?

177
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,029
Don't that thing have
batteries we can take out?

178
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,565
All right, so I Wikipedia-ed
"babies" over here,

179
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,000
and it says that "babies cry as a
form of instinctive communication."

180
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:04,136
And it says that "babies cry as a
form of instinctive communication."

181
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,172
- So the baby's trying to talk to us?
- Tell him to speak English!

182
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,041
Yeah, what is he,
some sort of immigrant baby?

183
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,111
- It's a male.
- Maybe he's crying because he's hungry.

184
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,546
All right, if you were
a baby what would you eat?

185
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,281
I know I could go
for a bagel right now.

186
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,484
Man, you go for a bagel
because you're a Jew.

187
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,219
Oh, so you're gonna
be prejudiced now?

188
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,221
What if I said you want a
burrito because you're Mexican?

189
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,157
I cut you!

190
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,999
Wait, whoa whoa whoa.
El nino, doesn't your name

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,330
wait, whoa whoa whoa.
El nino, doesn't your name

192
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,365
- mean "baby boy" in Mexican?
- Hey, man, you calling me a baby?

193
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
Pull the knife. Think about it.

194
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,537
El nino means "the
baby boy." Right?

195
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,405
- <i>Si.</i>
- You're the key to what we should fee--

196
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,307
You gonna try to take my keys?

197
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,210
- <i>Ese,</i> I take the bus.
<i>- I understand.</i>

198
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,578
<i>All right, class.</i>

199
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,148
<i>First day and all.
I am very excited.</i>

200
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,016
I am professor street

201
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,052
and this is the history
of Hamilton university.

202
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,321
I see some supple

203
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,999
supple young--
Young minds.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,126
Supple young--
Young minds.

205
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,061
Why don't we go around
and introduce ourselves?

206
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,533
Starting with the young lady
in the yellow dress.

207
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,436
What should I say?

208
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,172
I don't know. Start with...

209
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,973
Your major, your name.

210
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,309
Okay, um,

211
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,711
my name's Caitlin Greene

212
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,748
and I don't actually have

213
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,716
a major yet.

214
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,252
All right, all right,
how about, uh...

215
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,721
You with the sanitizer

216
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>and the glasses.</i>

217
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,658
<i>And the glasses.</i>

218
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,527
'Kay.

219
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,497
Okay, my name is Rex moonberry.

220
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,766
I am a western Asian

221
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,468
anthropology major.

222
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,039
But my true passion is
the language of dolphins.

223
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,308
<i>You see, when dolphins say,</i>

224
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,443
"ee ee ee ee ee!"

225
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,513
That means
they're hungry for fish.

226
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,249
When they say, "ee eee ee ee,"

227
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,518
that means they're
hungry for love.

228
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,000
<i>And when they say-- Fair enough, Rex.
Let's go...</i>

229
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:03,722
<i>And when they say-- Fair enough, Rex.
Let's go...</i>

230
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,392
How about the sexy gentleman
with the green water bottle

231
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,329
<i>on his desk.</i>

232
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,532
Oh, uh, me?

233
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,238
Hi. Um, my name is pledge.

234
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,673
I mean, Kyle.

235
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,644
My name is Kyle. And I'm a...

236
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,446
- Creative writing--
- Sit down, nerd!

237
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,999
I could see this is
going nowhere.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,016
I could see this is
going nowhere.

239
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,018
<i>How about we talk about</i>

240
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,155
steak mungro, the greatest
Greek board president

241
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,157
ever to live. Ever.

242
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,660
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey! Hey, guys, yo.

243
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,629
- It's none of your business.
- What's up?

244
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,298
I just got out of class.

245
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,034
- So who's baby do you think it is?
- Yours.

246
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,336
- What? Really?
- I don't know, 39.

247
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,373
- Okay? I'm not Columbo.
- I don't think it's mine.

248
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,441
- How do you know that?
- I don't know.

249
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,144
- I think it's yours.
- I think you should blow me.

250
00:12:59,145 --> 00:12:59,999
- Wow, intelligent. Nice.
- Thanks for giving me fair warning

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,647
- wow, intelligent. Nice.
- Thanks for giving me fair warning

252
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,182
<i>on the cancellation of the Greek
board meeting today, collison.</i>

253
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,152
- You're welcome.
- Well, I'll have you know

254
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,155
that I declared my candidacy
for Greek board president today.

255
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,524
<i>Since Hodges is a senior,
I take it one of you two dopes</i>

256
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,726
- will probably run against me.
- Didn't you

257
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,461
learn your lesson last year?

258
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,563
The better question would be

259
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,133
what lessons have you
learned since last year?

260
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,702
Okay, that doesn't make sense.

261
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,439
- Think about it.
- I just did. That doesn't make sense.

262
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:29,999
- See you around!
- I hope not.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
- See you around!
- I hope not.

264
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,181
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, do that.

265
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,551
Here comes spider-man!
<i>That's not gonna work, dude.</i>

266
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,554
Babies don't like spider-man.
They like...

267
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,525
I don't know. Here comes babar!

268
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:50,228
I don't think
anybody likes babar.

269
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,731
Here comes a keg!

270
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,334
Yo, that baby likes beer.

271
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,235
Yo, that could be his name.

272
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,171
Yo?

273
00:13:59,172 --> 00:13:59,999
No no no, beer.

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,673
No no no, beer.

275
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,975
I don't think that's
the best idea, dude.

276
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,345
Hell, you're right.
We can't name the kid beer.

277
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,449
That's a white boy's name. We need
something cool, something black.

278
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,085
<i>Like d.M.X.</i>

279
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,054
- President dumervile!
- Hello, rico.

280
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,590
I'm sure you're really busy. I'd like
to bring something to your attention.

281
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,459
- I am busy, I am.
- Yeah okay, this won't take a moment.

282
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,027
I've just come
from the first meeting

283
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,428
of the spring semester
Greek board.

284
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,197
Oh, I didn't know
you were on that.

285
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,065
Yes. We raised money.
Remember last year?

286
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,201
- I forgot.
- To help finish the science project?

287
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:29,999
- Yeah, of course, uh-huh.
- Yeah, anyway, the omegas

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,470
- yeah, of course, uh-huh.
- Yeah, anyway, the omegas

289
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,572
again failed to notify
anyone and didn't turn up.

290
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,640
Oh no, really?
Oh, bad them, bad them!

291
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,677
- Okay well, I'm sure it's fine. Don't worry about it.
- Excuse me?

292
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,380
I said it was fine. Don't worry about it.
Don't make a big deal about it.

293
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,149
- Have another meeting.
- I don't like your sarcastic attitude.

294
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,284
Oh, come on. Hey, somebody's
blood pressure is up.

295
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,487
- You need to eat.
- Excuse me. Who do you think--

296
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,089
You're not a doctor. You're
president of this college,

297
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,525
and you should be setting an
example by teaching these idiots

298
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:57,397
that it is not acceptable-- - first of all,
we do not have to use those words, okay?

299
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,101
So today may not have been
exactly what we thought

300
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,638
we were getting into when we decided
to begin this semester's rush.

301
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,608
Nevertheless, I present
to you our newest omega.

302
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,111
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce

303
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,715
<i>kegston omega!</i>

304
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,453
It was my idea to name him
something beer-related.

305
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,321
Wait, hang on.
If he's gonna be an omega,

306
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,123
doesn't that mean
he has to pledge first?

307
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,526
- Can he be my pledge?
- No way, man. I saw him first.

308
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,027
Um, no, I saw him first.

309
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,999
Remember the whole get-the-door-
it's-chicks thing?

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,663
Remember the whole get-the-door-
it's-chicks thing?

311
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,033
If kegston's going to be an omega,
he's going to be all of our pledge.

312
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,336
This morning we were bros,
members of a brotherhood.

313
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,739
Tonight,

314
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,674
we're dads.

315
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,210
Members of a fraternal
fatherhood.

316
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,579
Okay, I agree we should
pledge kegston,

317
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,681
but we shouldn't we all take

318
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,585
a paternity test to see
who the real father is?

319
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,357
You know, truth be told, that paternity
test was actually fairly easy.

320
00:15:59,358 --> 00:15:59,999
At first I was like,
"screw that, bro.

321
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,326
At first I was like,
"screw that, bro.

322
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,728
I got enough 'tests' as it is,"

323
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,264
but that one wasn't so bad.

324
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,700
I can't believe that girls
are so into babies.

325
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,435
You would think they'd
like us less

326
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,572
considering that we'd had a child
out of wedlock or something.

327
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,607
You are so gay!

328
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,610
- How'd everything go?
- Good, man.

329
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,612
I tell you, this baby's
like a magnet.

330
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,681
Chicks can't get enough
of him, you know.

331
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,250
I got three numbers,
and he got a flower.

332
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,487
- Did he eat?
- No, man, I guess he wasn't hungry.

333
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,999
We took him to taco world
and everything.

334
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,022
We took him to taco world
and everything.

335
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,525
But I got three combos, didn't I?
I ate them for you.

336
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,161
- Yes, he did.
- Don't touch him.

337
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,065
Don't babies drink milk?
Like from tits?

338
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,070
Yeah. You know what?

339
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,472
I know where we can get
plenty of those.

340
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,041
Breast milk over here!
Breast milk donations!

341
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,043
Come over here,
put your jug in the cup.

342
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,979
<i>Donate your breast milk
for kegston!</i>

343
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,215
Wow, you guys are really
horny or really dumb.

344
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,750
You wanna donate some
breast milk over here?

345
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,999
What, you guys run
a train or something?

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,019
What, you guys run
a train or something?

347
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,989
Nah nah. Actually, he was
left on our doorstep.

348
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,525
- <i>We just thought we'd take him in.</i>
- Kinda like Moses.

349
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,493
<i>All right, I don't know
what to say to that,</i>

350
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,396
but you guys do know that

351
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,200
you had to have been pregnant
to lactate for breast milk?

352
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,668
Mmmm.

353
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,437
So you're saying we can't
get breast milk from hos?

354
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,473
No.

355
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,410
Then where are we
supposed to get some?

356
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,078
- The abortion clinic!
- Yeah.

357
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,047
- That's a good idea.
- You guys are really dumb.

358
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,999
All right, look.
There's a thing called formula.

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
All right, look.
There's a thing called formula.

360
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,023
You know?
You get it at a drugstore?

361
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,758
Yeah yeah yeah.
Like at big Vic's house.

362
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,627
- Oh.
- No no no, not "drug dealer."

363
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,263
Drugstore. All right, look.

364
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,532
You three guys get in the car,
go to the supermarket.

365
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,201
Look for baby supplies.
Get everything on the shelf.

366
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,337
<i>And, thames, uh,</i>

367
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,739
you do what you do.

368
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,409
<i>Good luck.</i>

369
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,999
- Hodges?
- Yeah?

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,079
- Hodges?
- Yeah?

371
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,415
We should get this--
This tape over here.

372
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,550
- What is it?
- We should get it for kegston,

373
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,086
- but we should get two of them.
- <i>"Pokey dokey"?</i>

374
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,488
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

375
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,258
- How much do you think this is gonna cost?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

376
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,194
- But we're gonna need it all.
- Hi guys.

377
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,430
Hey, pledge, what are
you doing here?

378
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,200
Uh well, what are
you doing here?

379
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,636
- It's awesome,
- that'll work.

380
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,273
- <i>Yeah, it's a keg crib for the baby.</i>
- Yo, guys, what's up?

381
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,999
Hey-oh! What do you boys think?

382
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,276
Hey-oh! What do you boys think?

383
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,545
- Huh, pretty cool.
- What's in the bags?

384
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,415
<i>Tons of baby stuff.</i> Enough to wipe
out the omega savings account.

385
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,152
What? Do you realize how long it took me
to balance our budget for this semester?

386
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,456
Okay, 39, let's not forget you're
only the omega rush chairman.

387
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,424
And treasurer
and vice president.

388
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,460
But I'm the president
of the omega house.

389
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,029
I have final say on what
we spend our money on.

390
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,499
Yeah, and as the treasurer, it's my
duty to make sure we have funds.

391
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,501
I can't do that if you're
spending them all.

392
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,105
- We're not completely broke, dude!
- How much is left?

393
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,574
- Like $27.
- Oh my god, Hodges!

394
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,710
You are completely irresponsible.
Our parents and trustees are

395
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,547
gonna kill us when they hear we blew through
over five grand in less than a week.

396
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,150
And they're not gonna come after you.
They're gonna come after me

397
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,152
because they know you're
completely incapable!

398
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,087
You know, I thought
about it long and hard

399
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,323
and, uh, came to
a decision that, uh,

400
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,992
my favorite food is corn dogs
with teriyaki sauce.

401
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,327
That's it!

402
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,764
That's reason why everyone
loves the omegas--

403
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,733
Because they're so visible.

404
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,999
You can't exactly join
the football team, rico.

405
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,069
You can't exactly join
the football team, rico.

406
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,071
I'm not suggesting that,
numskull!

407
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,173
What I'm suggesting is

408
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,709
what if we find a way

409
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,011
to turn the omegas reputation

410
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,181
- against them?
- <i>Hmm.</i>

411
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,586
- Ow!
- Idiots!

412
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,755
- Ow ow!
- Sorry.

413
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,726
You hit the broken part.
Don't touch it anymore.

414
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,170
I guess he doesn't
like the keg crib.

415
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,139
Ungrateful.

416
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,142
Should we play
with him or something?

417
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,645
Maybe one of us should
stay up with him.

418
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,747
We can take turns.

419
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,584
Yeah, good idea.
It's your turn, buddy.

420
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,420
- Hmph.
- Good night, Hodges.

421
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,658
Spending all our money.

422
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,631
What do you want, little guy?
You hungry?

423
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,600
Want some food?

424
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,570
Milk? Toys?

425
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,539
How's your diaper?

426
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,477
You want me to sing you
a lullaby?

427
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,715
Okay.

428
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,689
<i>♪ You move like this,
you slide like that ♪</i>

429
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,624
<i>♪ you wiggle real slow... ♪</i>

430
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,000
<i>♪ And then you dance real fast ♪</i>

00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:01,693

434
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>Shut up!</i>

435
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,610
Hey.

436
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,079
Hodges.

437
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,415
Hey, pledge. Sit down.

438
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm just trying to figure out how
we're gonna get out of this debt.

439
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:29,999
Yeah, the guys seem
pretty mad about it.

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,090
Yeah, the guys seem
pretty mad about it.

441
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:35,326
Yeah, I understand
they're mad. We're broke.

442
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,230
You know, raising
a baby's expensive.

443
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,633
Yeah. I mean, I just
think that, uh...

444
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,303
<i>That, uh...</i>

445
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,207
- What are you doing?
- Shhh.

446
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,179
Oh! I get it.

447
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,548
Pledgy-poo has a little crush.

448
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,149
Shh.

449
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,999
Please, don't do anything
to embarrass me.

450
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,252
Please, don't do anything
to embarrass me.

451
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,321
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

452
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,697
Okay, I kinda liked her,

453
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,667
but El nino

454
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,336
smacked me in the nuts
when I was getting to know her.

455
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,638
Hmm. Do you think
she liked you back?

456
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,106
Yeah.

457
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,209
No, I don't know.

458
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,011
- I mean, it was at the stars, stripes and strippers...
- Shhh!

459
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,214
...party.

460
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:29,999
She probably doesn't
even remember me.

461
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,217
She probably doesn't
even remember me.

462
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,686
There was like
a thousand people there.

463
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,422
Wait a second.

464
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,158
That gives me an idea.

465
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,661
- You know how some parties charge money to get in?
- Yeah, those parties suck.

466
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,397
Yeah. No no no.
That's beside the point.

467
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,368
What I mean is if people will pay to get into
those parties, which, as you said, suck,

468
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,372
they're definitely gonna pay
to get into one of ours.

469
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,544
What's going on, guys?

470
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,000
Nothing besides I'm hungry
and all we have is baby food!

471
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,247
Nothing besides I'm hungry
and all we have is baby food!

472
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,316
Wait, what happened
to all that corn I bought?

473
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,652
It's all good, guys.
Look, pledge and I--

474
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,655
Actually, pledge here figured out what
we need to do to get rid of our debt.

475
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:15,493
Um, I've managed this fraternity's
funds for the past two years.

476
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,263
We've never been in this bad
of a financial situation.

477
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,365
Something pledge would
know nothing about.

478
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,234
Look, pledge may not have
been here for a long time,

479
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,237
but if there's one thing we
taught him, it's how to party.

480
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,606
You wanna know about that corn?

481
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,999
Let me tell you about the corn.

482
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,642
Let me tell you about the corn.

483
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,645
It took me six damn years
to raise that shit!

484
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,180
- <i>When you rip it up...</i>
- What does throwing a party

485
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,582
have to do with us being broke?

486
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,551
Well, everything, actually. We
can throw a party to make money.

487
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,588
You know, it'll be like
a kind of fundraiser.

488
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,457
<i>We can charge admission
at the door, ask for donations.</i>

489
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,561
The last party we had actually
cost us three grand.

490
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,730
And that was ultra low budget
for an omega party.

491
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,000
This time around, we don't even
have enough money for the beer.

492
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,704
I probably can get about 10 to 15 kegs of
beer from the guys on the football team.

493
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,000
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Look,

494
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,506
- yeah!
- Okay, great. Look,

495
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,408
39, you said at the last party

496
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,277
- we had over a thousand people, right?
- Yeah.

497
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,047
All right. So if each person
donates like, what, five dollars,

498
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,349
- that means we'd make...
- $5,000.

499
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,751
A lot of money. Yeah,
you said so yourself.

500
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,287
Our next party is gonna be epic.

501
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,189
Yeah, but this is all irrelevant

502
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,358
because we do not charge
money for our parties.

503
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,161
Oh, come on, man. It's easy.

504
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,330
It's like taking candy
from a baby

505
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,433
- <i>and giving it back to the baby.</i>
- You know, I'm in.

506
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,999
- I'm in too.
- What's it gonna be, 39?

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,520
- I'm in too.
- What's it gonna be, 39?

508
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,107
Come on, man. Come on.

509
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,243
All right, all right!

510
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,179
- All right!
- All right.

511
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,082
But seriously, guys,
if we don't pull this off,

512
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,719
you guys have to be prepared
to either declare bankruptcy,

513
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,621
which would eliminate our status
as a recognized fraternity,

514
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,359
or give up kegston.

515
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,297
So the omegas think that
throwing a keg party

516
00:24:59,298 --> 00:24:59,999
with a baby in their custody
is a good idea.

517
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,132
With a baby in their custody
is a good idea.

518
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,634
Wait, who has the baby?

519
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,603
The omega's, you mule.

520
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,107
- The omegas have a baby?
- That's what I said, is it not?

521
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,377
Yeah, I just--
No, I just--

522
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,016
Well, we'll see what
the local authorities

523
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,351
have to say when
they hear about this.

524
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,521
I predict that not only
will the omegas go to jail,

525
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,993
but their bad reputation will ruin
their stupid fraternity forever.

526
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:29,999
Ah. But how is
local law enforcement

527
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,230
ah. But how is
local law enforcement

528
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,065
even going to hear
about the party?

529
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,401
I mean, 'cause omega parties
never get broken up.

530
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,537
Leave that to me.

531
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,382
<i>♪ Baby, if you're down ♪</i>

532
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,252

this world around... ♪</i>

533
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:58,222

baby powder in the beer.

534
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,999
What-- what are you talk--

535
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,325
What-- what are you talk--

536
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,659
Ow. Ow!

537
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,262
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

538
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,631
- Are you okay?
- It's-- yeah, I'm fine.

539
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,666
I'm sorry.

540
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,102
Hi, yeah, I'm good.

541
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,438
- Okay.
- Hi.

542
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,339
Hi, I'm Kyle.

543
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,443
I thought your name was pledge.

544
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,244
I'm kidding. I'm Caitlin.

545
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,582
Oh well, d-d-do you want
a drink or something?

546
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,318
- Um...
- Yeah no, I'm fine.

547
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,686
- I just--
- Yeah, sure.

548
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,999
- Yeah?
- You sure you're okay?

549
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,322
- Yeah?
- You sure you're okay?

550
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,557
Yeah, I was just more
surprised than anything.

551
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,259
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Okay okay.

552
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,162
All right. Yeah, let me just--

553
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,231
With your legs, not your back.

554
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,133
Who's the dude?

555
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,535
That dude is steak mungro.

556
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,538
He was the omega president
when I was a pledge.

557
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,341
Nice. So you guys still
keep in contact?

558
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,578
Only in my prayers.

559
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,247
What happened?

560
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,050
He died in a motorcycle race

561
00:26:59,051 --> 00:26:59,999
against time.

562
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,019
Against time.

563
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,525
Oh, come on. Please?

564
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,193
- What's going on here?
- Please.

565
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,729
The girl want to know
why they call him 39.

566
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,065
- Come on, man.
- Hmm.

567
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,301
Two years ago, 39 here
was an omega pledge.

568
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,971
That year as part of the
initiation, we decided to time

569
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,406
how long each omega pledge
lasted in bed.

570
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,442
Whoever lasted
the shortest amount of time

571
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,512
would forever be known for how
long they lasted. Or lack thereof.

572
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,514
- It's true, I was there.
- Good job.

573
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,000
Whoa whoa.
Who called the wahmbulance?

574
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,749
Whoa whoa.
Who called the wahmbulance?

575
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,652
Hello, boys.

576
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,988
How's it going?
The phi tau tau's are here.

577
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,725
Here's a hundred bucks. Be good chaps
and give us all cups, will you?

578
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,061
Oh, I want change
as well from that.

579
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,764
Hey, where's my cup!
Hey, give me my cup.

580
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,534
- Hey, you big animal.
- Kegston's adorable.

581
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,637
Isn't he, though? He's like got
the cutest cheeks and the hair.

582
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,373
They're huge. I don't know how
he walks around with them.

583
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,441
Yeah, he walks around.

584
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,744
- He's not yours, right?
- No.

585
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,000
Um, there's no possible way
he could be mine.

586
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:04,282
Um, there's no possible way
he could be mine.

587
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,352
Now Richie on the other hand--

588
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,521
Does he talk like that?

589
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,590
- Kegston?
- No, Richie.

590
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,991
Oh.

591
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,393
Y-yeah.

592
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:19,164
<i>♪ Shake... ♪</i>

593
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:27,038
Oh my gosh, he's so cute!

594
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,106
Hi!

595
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:29,999
- I change his diapers.
- Hello!

596
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,075
- I change his diapers.
- Hello!

597
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,444
Oh, are you the father?

598
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,180
Actually, uh,
I'm the father too.

599
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,249
Really? You are?

600
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,384
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh,

601
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,420
that's so great that they
let you guys adopt.

602
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,989
You know, some couples
aren't as lucky as you guys.

603
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,526
In some states, it's not legal
for same-sex couples to adopt.

604
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,295
Oh, but you're so lucky.

605
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,667
No smoking.
There's a baby in the house.

606
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,670
Aye aye, captain.

607
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,509
I said there's
a baby in the house!

608
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,679
So I've been thinking about
publishing my memoirs

609
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,349
and calling them, How
I bring the rain."

610
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,618
'Cause El nino's like
a state of mind, you know.

611
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,753
And I was-- - actually, El
nino is a climate pattern

612
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,256
that occurs in the tropical pacific
ocean about every five years,

613
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,324
affecting the surface
temperature of the ocean water

614
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,026
and the pressure
of the air above it,

615
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,594
resulting in global climate
anomalies,

616
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,163
some of which are drastic.
It's awesome.

617
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,432
What?

618
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,999
- Tell me one thing.
- What?

619
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,080
- Tell me one thing.
- What?

620
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,039
Me too!

621
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,975
Is this a party? <i>Yeah,
is there a problem?</i>

622
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,678
- We got a noise complaint.
- Oh, sorry, sir.

623
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,315
- We can turn down the music.
- We also hear that there could be a baby living here.

624
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,651
<i>Is that a problem?</i>

625
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,287
Yes, that is a problem.

626
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,725
Yeah, 'cause I want to know what
kind of disgraceful, moronic inbred

627
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,628
would call the cops on such a
fine group of young gentlemen.

628
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,999
To raise a child at your age?
I-- I am impressed.

629
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,399
To raise a child at your age?
I-- I am impressed.

630
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,301
<i>- Thanks, man.
- I agree,</i>

631
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,703
'cause I got two of my own
at home and I gotta tell--

632
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,571
Excuse me, officers.

633
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,175
A keg party is hardly
a place to keep a baby, eh?

634
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,311
Surely one of you fine strapping

635
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,113
civil servicemen
will call somebody.

636
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,415
What did you just say, nerd?

637
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,583
Nerd?

638
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,153
Did you just call me
a nerd, Mr. pig?

639
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,156
Oink oink! Why don't you toddle
off back to your bacon wagon?

640
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,725
Go back to the station, have a
big jolly with all your friends.

641
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,560
You have the right
to remain silent, nerd.

642
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh now, just you listen!
Who do you think you are?

643
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,163
Oh now, just you listen!
Who do you think you are?

644
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,699
<i>Do you know who my father is?</i>

645
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,535
<i>He invented electricity!</i>

646
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:41,173
Class of '98. You know, Dillon?
Class of '93.

647
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,477
<i>Damn, night train is
going for a record up there.</i>

648
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,179
<i>It's been really great.</i>

649
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,614
<i>I thought it was hilarious
you guys hired fake cops</i>

650
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,149
<i>to kick rico out of the party.</i>

651
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,752
- I hope you get enough money for kegston.
- Yeah, I hope so.

652
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,754
- Tell 'em I said bye.
- I-- I really hope

653
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,422
we get out of this situation.

654
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,999
So the total profit
for the party

655
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,758
so the total profit
for the party

656
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,695
is $14,503.

657
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,698
Did you hear what I just said?
14--

658
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,333
You know what?
I'm going up there

659
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,670
and I'm gonna get seconds.

660
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,606
- No, that's-- it's fine.
- They--

661
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,508
It's not a big deal.

662
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,377
<i>Say it louder.</i>

663
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,046
<i>You like that, huh?</i>

664
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,582
<i>Oh, night train,
night train. Oh! Oh!</i>

665
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,150
<i>Night train! Night train!</i>

666
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,152
<i>What the hell you doing here?</i>

667
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,999
<i>I don't know. Just trying
to get to it, you know?</i>

668
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,288
<i>I don't know. Just trying
to get to it, you know?</i>

669
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,423
<i>Get the hell
outta here, Sambora!</i>

670
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,291
Anyway, um,

671
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,560
would you ever want to,
like, hang out

672
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,997
outside of here,
like somewhere else?

673
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,966
Yeah.

674
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,335
- Sure.
- Really?

675
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,370
Yeah. That'd be fun.

676
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,541
Okay, let's do it. I mean,
let's hang out, of course.

677
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,510
- Right. Okay.
- Yeah.

678
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,413
Um, cool. I'll see you around.

679
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,281
- Yeah.
- Okay.

680
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,517
- Okay.
- Bye.

681
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,753
Bye. Yeah.

682
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,588
Boom, I'm going.

683
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,490
Ain't gonna stop me.

684
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,259
Alexander Hamilton

685
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,028
was the first treasurer of the
United States of America.

686
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,631
Do we wanna push it up over here
or we wanna push it up over there?

687
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,299
You have very very light hair.

688
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,502
That? That's steak mungro.

689
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,506
"Do ye know the white whale
then, Tash?"

690
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,110
Gonna go up, swoop swoop swoop,

691
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,545
- over there.
- Hut!

692
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,999
You gotta do what you
wanna do, otherwise--

693
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,680
You gotta do what you
wanna do, otherwise--

694
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,119
You want some?
In a little bit, okay?

695
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,194
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

696
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,764
<i>♪ Lie down and fight ♪</i>

697
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,999
<i>♪ lie down and fight ♪</i>

698
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,035
<i>♪ if I am not a man,
what am I? ♪</i>

699
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,038
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

700
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,607
This is my mask.

701
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,376
That is a--
Stuffed animal.

702
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,047
Okay, man, you got it.
All right.

703
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,316
It's--
I don't know, man.

704
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,518
I do it 'cause
I'm scared, you know?

705
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,186
You know what else?

706
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,389
He was shot by Aaron burr in 1804.
It was very sad.

707
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,658
Hopefully, one day,

708
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,527
you'll become that man.

709
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,763
My brother.

710
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,268
"And the great shroud
of the sea rolled on

711
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,073
as it rolled
five thousand years ago."

712
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,000
The end.

713
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,142
The end.

714
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,645
You know, I still
don't understand

715
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,548
how you're graduating college
and yet you can't remember

716
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,084
to put the diaper on a baby
before you put him in the crib.

717
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,619
Hey, you know what, pledge?
Enough.

718
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,421
You don't understand the pressure of
having to actually graduate college.

719
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,490
When my aunt Debbie
graduated college,

720
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,393
she opened up an orphanage,
an orphanage for midgets.

721
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:53,130
It went really well until they started
getting their hands on candy.

722
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,367
Couple years later, we never
heard from aunt Debbie again.

723
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,235
Anyways, <i>this</i> is boring.

724
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,999
I'm up for getting some drinks
and some food. What's up?

725
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,338
I'm up for getting some drinks
and some food. What's up?

726
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,373
You're buying, man?
I saw you got drafted.

727
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,608
Congrats, by the way,
on the draft. That's sick.

728
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,678
- What's this, man?
- He-- night train got drafted.

729
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,213
What do you mean?
Everybody knew that.

730
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,648
Oh my god, man, you got drafted?

731
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,217
You're going to Iraq, <i>ese?</i>
Oh, man, you're gonna die!

732
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,152
You're gonna be like with the
freedom and the bullets.

733
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,288
They be like--
They're gonna shoot you!

734
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,757
That's not good for you! I don't
want you to die! You're my brother!

735
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,126
- I stand in the bullet for you!
- El nino, El nino.

736
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,094
He got-- he's gonna
play football.

737
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,064
- I'm so confused.
<i>- Man, look see,</i>

738
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,732
that's what you get for
smoking that emotional stuff.

739
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,999
- It's 'cause it's cheap!
- Anyways, this is kegston's stuff.

740
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,669
- It's 'cause it's cheap!
- Anyways, this is kegston's stuff.

741
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,237
I'm not gonna clean this up
and I can't--

742
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,638
Dude, kegston's an infant.

743
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,974
He can't clean up his own room.

744
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,610
Say one more thing again and
you'll be cleaning my girdle.

745
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,745
What's up? I'm as hungry
as a bulimic hippo.

746
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,181
Man, I want waffles.

747
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,159
Whiff.

748
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,727
Meow.

749
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,164
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

750
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,333
Yes-sss.

751
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,501
Yeah-hhhh?

752
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,037
Yeah.

753
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,140
Yeah?

754
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,083
I propose that we
put jaegermeister

755
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,218
in all the water fountains
around campus,

756
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,753
<i>and especially in the quad.</i>

757
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:26,223
'Cause I feel the girls there will be
more compelled to show their breasts.

758
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,193
- They have the biggest breasts out of the whole school.
- Objection!

759
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:29,999
The female anatomy is not
something to be drooled over.

760
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,062
The female anatomy is not
something to be drooled over.

761
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,431
I propose that we stop
making me the accountant.

762
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,034
Just because I'm brown doesn't
mean I'm good at math.

763
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,536
Objection!
It means exactly that.

764
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,206
I propose we initiate

765
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,108
a school-wide manhunt

766
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,110
for the former brilliant
actor Rick moranis.

767
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,579
Objection!
Rick moranis's whereabouts

768
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,015
are a matter for
national security only.

769
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,583
Hmm.

770
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,019
Whatever did happen to him?
Don't know.

771
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,121
All right.
Got all the notes from school.

772
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,456
I've got nothing else
to add so--

773
00:35:59,457 --> 00:35:59,999
Hold it right there, hodgkinson.

774
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,060
Hold it right there, hodgkinson.

775
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,729
Do you remember your little

776
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,534
- kegger for kegston a few weeks ago?
- Yeah, how was jail?

777
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,504
Laugh all you want, collison.

778
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,707
My brief incarceration allowed me
to catch up on a little reading.

779
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,677
I have some paperwork here
that you might be interested in.

780
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,380
I seriously doubt it.

781
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,217
"Article 7k:

782
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,620
All members of university-
affiliated fraternities

783
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,000
must be enrolled
as full-time students.

784
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,157
Must be enrolled
as full-time students.

785
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:36,260
Furthermore, no non-affiliated
students or otherwise

786
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,262
can live in university
Greek housing."

787
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:42,132
- Does that include babies?
- Oh, why yes, it does.

788
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,368
Oh, but don't worry.

789
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,571
I'm sure there'll be an opening
at the local orphanage.

790
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,508
It'll actually be an upgrade
coming from the omega home.

791
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,245
Meeting adjourned!

792
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,548
Meeting adjourned?
What are you talking about?

793
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,650
Dude, the omegas control
the Greek board.

794
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,000
Not for long.

795
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,320
Not for long.

796
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,492
<i>Maybe we could just
hide him, you know?</i>

797
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,395
Dress him up like he's a little
koala bear or something.

798
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,131
Build him a tree house. Whoosh.

799
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,467
Yeah! Nobody would even notice.

800
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,736
That's illegal in so many ways.

801
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,238
What if we--

802
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,108
What if we--

803
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,076
What if we oil him?

804
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,680
<i>Hey, guys, I think
I found a loophole.</i>

805
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:30,000
What are you talking about?

806
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,315
What are you talking about?

807
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,418
If we can get kegston
enrolled at Hamilton,

808
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,021
then he can live with us
and he can remain an omega.

809
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,090
Uh, yeah, pledge,
that's brilliant,

810
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,761
except how are we gonna get a
baby enrolled in a university?

811
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,330
Wow.

812
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:49,099
All right. Let me just
get this straight, guys.

813
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,435
You found a baby
on your doorstep.

814
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,605
- Yup.
- And then you took him back to the omega house.

815
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,241
- That sounds about right.
- And now you want me

816
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,999
to allow you to let
<i>kegston</i> become a student

817
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,111
to allow you to let
<i>kegston</i> become a student

818
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,280
at Hamilton
so he can remain an omega?

819
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,149
Yeah, if you don't mind.

820
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,352
Well, it's kind
of a ridiculous request.

821
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,187
And though I do love all of you

822
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:13,090
because you do so much
for the school--

823
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,492
I mean, Rodney
and Nicholas and Matthew,

824
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,395
you are, like, so high on my
list of everything that you do,

825
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,497
- because I so appreciate--
- What about me?

826
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,567
I don't even know you.

827
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,070
Anyway, um...

828
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,999
Look, I so wish I could give my
permission to do this for you guys.

829
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,641
Look, I so wish I could give my
permission to do this for you guys.

830
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,177
I really do!
I would love to be able to say,

831
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,513
"yes, take the baby. Raise the baby.
Be happy with the baby."

832
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:40,083
I love babies. I wish I had a baby,
but I've had some complications.

833
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:44,221
Anyway, I wish I could allow this
to happen, but rules are rules.

834
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,456
My hands are tied. I'm just
not going to be able to.

835
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,725
We understand. We really do.
Thank you so much.

836
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,130
Sure, no problem. Okay.
Okay, have a good day.

837
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,600
Well, that didn't go so well.

838
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,003
<i>♪ Perfect people
in this world... ♪</i>

839
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,140
Come on, that's how you do it.

840
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,608
That's how you do it, right?

841
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,510
I got this. I got this.
Move out, man.

842
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,347
I got this.

843
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,083
Yeah! Just right.

844
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,353
Renato, the first thing you did
wrong is you had the laces in.

845
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,188
They supposed to be out.
And, El nino,

846
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,357
there is no way you're gonna
make the football team.

847
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,527
I could tell coach anything I
want-- me and kegston can lie--

848
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,230
- And you still ain't gonna make it.
- But let me play, man.

849
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,498
- <i>Let me play.</i>
- You ain't gonna make the Mexico soccer team

850
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,999
- with that kick.
- But I come to you with this,

851
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,968
- with that kick.
- But I come to you with this,

852
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,604
- this little dream of mine--
- Well well well.

853
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,074
Look what I found. What is this,
a shades of brown meeting?

854
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,710
So which one of you einsteins

855
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,246
has worked out whose
mongrel child this is, eh?

856
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,481
<i>Huh? None of you?</i>

857
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,451
Well, bit too optimistic
on my part, I see.

858
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:50,420
I'm gonna go back to my chess
game, a real man's sport.

859
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,725
See how far playing
football gets you.

860
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,729
You all know what?

861
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,999
This gives me a good idea.

862
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,064
This gives me a good idea.

863
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,268
Hamilton university has given me
all that I can ask for.

864
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,970
They took me off the streets
and they made my mama proud

865
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,407
by giving me a chance to do what I
love, and that's playing football.

866
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,143
And now that I'm going pro,
I plan to give back.

867
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,612
<i>And not just by building some pool
or donating a couple of weights.</i>

868
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,181
No, I plan
to give back for real,

869
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,052
and that's the reason why
today I unveil to you...

870
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,999
<i>The Rodney Maine
infant scholar fellowship!</i>

871
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,527
<i>The Rodney Maine
infant scholar fellowship!</i>

872
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,363
Each year, I will sponsor
the full tuition

873
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,666
of an underprivileged infant
who just wants

874
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,135
the opportunity to get
what I've been given:

875
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,003
A chance to be a Hamilton duelo.

876
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,472
- Wow, that's great.
- Boy, this is a really historic moment.

877
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,108
<i>Unprecedented. Bravo!</i>

878
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,347
Please refer all further questions
to my <i>consigliere</i> merkhaus.

879
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,449
- How did he come up with the--
- Wait your turn.

880
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,090
Why don't you wait
your turn there, chief?

881
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,756
Infant scholar fellowship!

882
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,000
What sort of a country is this?

883
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,493
What sort of a country is this?

884
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,597
"I score touchdowns.

885
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm dangerously charming.

886
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,670
I want to give babies--

887
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,572
An education."

888
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,708
Idiots!

889
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:21,178
Well, we'll see

890
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,182
who has the last laugh.

891
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,119
<i>Hey, fellas, can y'all
do me a favor?</i>

892
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,999
<i>Don't mention the kegger
for kegston night.</i>

893
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,188
<i>Don't mention the kegger
for kegston night.</i>

894
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,690
'Cause moms provides
a beatdown like a bongo.

895
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,526
Okay. Speaking of which, they
should be here any second now.

896
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,428
What should I do
with this thing?

897
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,630
<i>Hey! Anybody living in here?</i>

898
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,599
- Hey, mama.
- Hey, baby.

899
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,469
- Ooh, boy, you skinny!
- Let me get that for you.

900
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,038
- All right. Y'all eating?
- Thank you very much.

901
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,975
Huh-uh. Are any
of y'all eating well?

902
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,477
- We will now.
- Just skinny.

903
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,746
- How you doing, Mrs. Maine?
- Oh, wonderful.

904
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,483
- Don't be kissing my mama.
- <i>All right!</i>

905
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,388
Hey, dad.

906
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,457
That shirt looks familiar.
I wondered where it'd gotten.

907
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,060
Oh, look how adorable!

908
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:13,530
Oh! What's that smell?

909
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,066
- What's a baby doing here?
- Um...

910
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,535
<i>He's even cuter than you said
he was gonna look, Rodney.</i>

911
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,638
I think it's a great thing that you boys
are raising this child, I really do.

912
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,108
Yeah. Fatherhood is really
carving you boys into men.

913
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,344
It's a damn shame those nerds,

914
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,999
the phi ta-ta's, are
trying to take him away.

915
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,214
The phi ta-ta's, are
trying to take him away.

916
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,549
Wait.

917
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,353
This fraternity is raising that baby?
Whose is it?

918
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:40,058
- Well, we don't exactly--
- Oh boy!

919
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,163
You're the only family
I got, t-brow.

920
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,998
Hey. I love you.

921
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:52,103
As shitty as you are in darts,
nobody would want to claim you.

922
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,640
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

923
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,558
Whoa!

924
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,231
Still got it, old man.

925
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,701
Love you, you son of a bitch.

926
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,370
Fuck. Thanks for coming, dad.

927
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,106
I wouldn't miss it for nothing.

928
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:29,999
Dad, this is t-brow.
T-brow, this is my dad.

929
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,241
Dad, this is t-brow.
T-brow, this is my dad.

930
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,076
- What's up?
- It's cool, it's cool.

931
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,978
You know...

932
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,013
Now let me get this straight,

933
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,149
with the accent on the word
"straight."

934
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,184
You live in a house
with a bunch of guys.

935
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:44,020
Can you tell me, please,
why a pair of men's underwear

936
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,157
is framed on your wall here?
Can you? Can you tell me?

937
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,459
No, I can't tell you.
I don't know.

938
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,062
Does prince Charles know
that you've got his--

939
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,699
Buttless underwear
up there in a frame?

940
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,169
What's that about?

941
00:43:59,170 --> 00:43:59,999
Pansy. <i>Come on. Want
to play with us?</i>

942
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,539
Pansy. <i>Come on. Want
to play with us?</i>

943
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,441
We got you! Come on, <i>eses.
</i> Let's go.

944
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,610
Hey, Waldo, what's up with the do-rag?
You're from Ohio.

945
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:09,713
Dad, do not call me Waldo.
Here, my name is El nino.

946
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:12,215
- Come on!
- Is that a weather pattern?

947
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,351
Dad, you're ruining my credit!
Come on, man!

948
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:17,254
Hey, are you using one
of those marijuana sticks?

949
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,056
<i>What? No! I cut you!</i>

950
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,427
<i>Respeta a tu padre!</i>

951
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,764
At least one of us has balls.

952
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,999
I'm sorry, <i>mami!</i>

953
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,067
I'm sorry, <i>mami!</i>

954
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:32,202
<i>Well, I know he ain't Rodney's.</i>

955
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,672
Have you looked at
the color of his eyes?

956
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,376
<i>I'll tell you right now,
I know he's not merkhaus'</i>

957
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,978
'cause number one,
he's not smoking.

958
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,081
And I been close to the kid--
He don't smell like bourbon.

959
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,151
Let me tell you about
the omega class

960
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,454
of 1932.

961
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:55,592
Yeah. The stocks were down--

962
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,562
Way way down.

963
00:44:58,563 --> 00:44:59,999
Oh-ho! But so were
the girls' skirts.

964
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,766
Oh-ho! But so were
the girls' skirts.

965
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:05,202
Yeah!

966
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,004
And we, the omegas,

967
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,308
we invented the boobs!

968
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:14,644
The way to go! The way to show!

969
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,013
<i>The way to get
the job done, right?</i>

970
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,249
Skirts are down,
the boobs are out.

971
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,718
Everything is flowing, man!

972
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,020
Like who needed consequences?

973
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,157
We're no candy-asses.
We got it done.

974
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,192
We made it work, baby.

975
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:29,999
The omega omega omega!

976
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,395
The omega omega omega!

977
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,131
Yeah!

978
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,368
- So who are these dudes?
- Well, that's renato

979
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,604
and those are his two dads.

980
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,506
Uh, he's the dad.
I'm the father.

981
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,209
Hi, I'm Bruce! Ooh, score!

982
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,577
Damn it!

983
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,114
I mean, it's still just
the second draft and...

984
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,484
<i>I'm actually considering,</i>

985
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,554
you know, changing some of the
things on the page you're reading,

986
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,422
- but--
- Mm-hmm. And this is

987
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,999
what I'm spending
40 grand a year for?

988
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,292
What I'm spending
40 grand a year for?

989
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:05,428
You writing little short stories
about college parties, huh?

990
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,697
- Yeah, it's self-reflective.
- Oh.

991
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,067
Maybe that's what you should be
doing, Kyle. Reflecting on yourself.

992
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,736
<i>Where are you headed
in your life?</i>

993
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,971
- Why he got to pick on him?
- Come on, dad.

994
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,107
What do you mean,
"come on, dad"?

995
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:21,077
You expect me to just sit here and be happy
with what you're doing with your life?

996
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:24,281
You are raising a baby in a frat
house with a bunch of idiots.

997
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,449
Hey.

998
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,551
What's going on, Mr. motes?

999
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,999
Did you hear that Kyle here is going
to be representing the omegas

1000
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,121
did you hear that Kyle here is going
to be representing the omegas

1001
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,356
- <i>in the upcoming Greek board election?</i>
- You are?

1002
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,493
- I am?
- He is.

1003
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,329
Yeah, absolutely. The omegas
have an 88-year tradition

1004
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,464
<i>of controlling
the university Greek board.</i>

1005
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,400
Kyle here is going
to be number 89.

1006
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,502
- Mm-hmm.
- Well...

1007
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,239
Now that would look great
on a law school application.

1008
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,275

1010
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,513
Who are you, pussycat?

1011
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:58,315
I'm t-brow's mom. Who are you?

1012
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,999
I'm merkhaus.

1013
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,518
I'm merkhaus.

1014
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,354
Are you, uh,
really t-brow's mom?

1015
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,655
I'm as real as a mother can get.

1016
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:10,293
I like that.

1017
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,729
Here, try this.

1018
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,675
Scrumptious.

1019
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,412
Well, thanks, son,
for the great snacks.

1020
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:29,999
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,448
Mm-hmm.

1022
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,284
Congratulations
on the Greek board.

1023
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,654
I suppose that is
an achievement.

1024
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,557
Uh, do me a favor, would you?

1025
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:43,193
- Would you find a real major?
- Okay.

1026
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,029
And consider giving prince
Charles back his underwear.

1027
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,098
- Okay. Bye, dad.
- May be getting cold.

1028
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,767
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1029
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,737
Later, Mr. motes.
Well, Mr. motes.

1030
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:56,473
- Oh my god.
- You ready to take over this fraternity?

1031
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,075
Where's the cornbread?

1032
00:47:59,076 --> 00:47:59,999
Why are you wearing my shirt?

1033
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,160
Why are you wearing my shirt?

1034
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,451
Are you constipated?

1035
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,089
So you guys still have
no clue whose kid this is.

1036
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,126
- No.
- All right, well, is there any hints?

1037
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,994
I mean, what's the baby into?

1038
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,397
Oh, he likes "the pokey dokey."

1039
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,466
Man, to hell
with that "pokey dokey."

1040
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,202
All right, well...

1041
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,338
He doesn't look like thames.

1042
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,999
And we know it's not
t-brow's or pledge's.

1043
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,507
And we know it's not
t-brow's or pledge's.

1044
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,675
Professor street?

1045
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,477
What is it?

1046
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,646
Now is it possible
that it could be my child?

1047
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,615
I mean, not unless

1048
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,418
you had sex with Andre the
giant in the past three years.

1049
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,020
Right? I mean, the kid's
bigger than you are.

1050
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,656
- <i>It's not possible.</i>
- Maybe I'm just a late bloomer.

1051
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,025
You keep telling yourself that.

1052
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,528
That's a good call.

1053
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,396
<i>It was good.</i>

1054
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,331
Hey, guys, can I ask you
a quick question?

1055
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,267
What's up, pledge?

1056
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,701
Well, I'm taking

1057
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,999
Caitlin out tonight.

1058
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,371
Caitlin out tonight.

1059
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:02,472
- Nice.
<i>- I approve.</i>

1060
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,641
Um, anyway, I'm taking her out

1061
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,676
and I don't know where to go

1062
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,512
and so I was hoping you guys
might have some suggestions.

1063
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,748
Okay yeah, it stops right
there and it goes right here.

1064
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,150
Okay, pledge, let me
ask you something:

1065
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,119
- What do women love?
- Flowers?

1066
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,720
Booze. Booze and dark chocolate.

1067
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,290
This is what you're going to get--
Get a flask, half a bottle.

1068
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,193
It doesn't really matter.
Take her to a park, alley.

1069
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,995
It's irrelevant. About
halfway through the booze,

1070
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,363
offer her some
dark chocolate. Why?

1071
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,466
<i>'Cause it's an aphrodisiac,
my friend. All right?</i>

1072
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:29,999
- <i>She'll be wetter than ever before midnight.</i>
- Merk--

1073
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,734
- <i>she'll be wetter than ever before midnight.</i>
- Merk--

1074
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,503
Don't listen to anything
he's saying, okay?

1075
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,673
Caitlin's a nice girl. Take her to
a really nice Italian restaurant.

1076
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,476
- Get a nice bottle of red wine.
- I remember my first date.

1077
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,377
We went mini-golfing.

1078
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,413
And we ate

1079
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:45,682
and had a lot of fun.

1080
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,585
And the best part was

1081
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:52,021
we really got to know each other

1082
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,225
as people.

1083
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,433
Ugh. Another.

1084
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,602
- That's a great idea.
- Really?

1085
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:08,271
Yeah no, it's good because you
can show your manly side.

1086
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:10,273
You know, be aggressive.
Show you like sports.

1087
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:13,042
Ultimately, what you want to do,
you want to get that hole in one.

1088
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,644
I'm not talking about
the golf course.

1089
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:17,213
- I'm talking about putt-putt in her panties.
- That is repulsive.

1090
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,350
<i>It's not repulsive when you're banging
a girl in the back, you know that?</i>

1091
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,752
<i>- It is repulsive, triple x!
- Just shut your mouth!</i>

1092
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,489
Okay, mini-golf it is.

1093
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,559
Yeah whoo!

1094
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,000
Clap it up.

1095
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:31,594
Clap it up.

1096
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,098
Clap it up!

1097
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:39,402
- Go ahead.

00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,182
<i>have you written
anything lately?</i>

1116
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,152
- She's gorgeous.
<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>

1117
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:29,999
- Sort of.
- So what's it about?

1118
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,487
- Sort of.
- So what's it about?

1119
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,990
Well, um,

1120
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,558
it's kind of like
my life as an omega.

1121
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,061
- Oh, here.
- Yeah.

1122
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:41,397
But, you know, not an expose,

1123
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,101
but kind of just telling the
story how it is, you know?

1124
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,038
Rushing and pledging-- - getting
your testicles smacked at parties.

1125
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,673
Yeah...

1126
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,010
That's actually
the title of the story.

1127
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:57,280
- <i>♪ I want to feel good... ♪</i>
- I think that's really cool.

1128
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,999
You're doing something you
love and are passionate about.

1129
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,017
You're doing something you
love and are passionate about.

1130
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:02,285
I still have no clue
what I want to major in.

1132
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:08,057
My dad, he wants me

- Is he a lawyer?

Sorry.
I just must sound like a baby.

1138
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,410
No, it's okay.

00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:29,999

1142
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,120
Now the time where I can
finally exact my revenge

1143
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,656
upon the omegas is
rapidly approaching.

1144
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,091
Revenge? For what?

1145
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,327
Yeah, rico, you're always
talking about revenge

1146
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,729
against the omegas, but what
are you getting revenge for?

1147
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,366
It was a long time ago.

1148
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:55,072

00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,000
I wonder if I could ask
you a question about the--

1169
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,238
I wonder if I could ask
you a question about the--

1170
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,706
Oh wow!

1171
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,375
It's steak mungro,
the omega president.

1172
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,244
Hi, my name's rico.

1173
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,013
I've come all the way over from
england to join this fraternity.

1174
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,249
I heard you have
so many hot chicks here,

1175
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,551
and I really want
to get with girls. Hi.

1176
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,620
I hear you have the best girls.

1177
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,288
Although...

1178
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,057
Yeah, I was expecting
sort of better.

1179
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:23,593
But I'm sure you've been
with better before yourself.

1180
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,294
Steak

1181
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,562
out.

1182
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,298
Okay well, nice to talk
to you, Mr. president.

1183
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:29,999
Hey, do you want my number?
Hey, maybe later on?

1184
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,968
Hey, do you want my number?
Hey, maybe later on?

1185
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,537
Hi, hottie.

1186
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,040
Oh yeah, cool. Can I play?

1187
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,143
Hey, give me a go.
Hey, give me a go.

1188
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,711
You all right? How you doing?

1189
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:45,348
You fancy some white action instead
of some black action for a change?

1190
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,984
Hey, we could tag-team, couldn't we?
Night and day.

1191
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,620
- What?! What'd you say?
- Black and white, that could be the new thing.

1192
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,989
You shouldn't have said that.
Night train?

1193
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,423
Ow! Oh oh.

1194
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,159
Like that? Huh, like that?

1195
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,494
They ripped my underwear,

1196
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,999
giving me what they called
a wedgie from both sides.

1197
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,331
Giving me what they called
a wedgie from both sides.

1198
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,201
That's a Melvin-wedgie hybrid.

1199
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:07,637
I can't believe
you rushed omegas.

1200
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,206
It was a long time ago,

1201
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:12,041
but in the time since

1202
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,443
I have vowed to exact my revenge

1203
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,679
upon the omegas. And now

1204
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,149

I'm just glad he's not mine.

Am I the first white girl
you've ever been with?

1218
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,614
Hell no!

1219
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,185
Well, it only takes
one white girl

1220
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,289
- to make a white baby.
- What?

1221
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,433
- Mom?
- T-brow.

1222
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,401
- What are you doing here, mom?
- Have some respect!

1223
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,204
- Hey, you're not my real dad!
- Hey hey! No fighting!

1224
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,641
- You're not my real dad!
- I love her, okay?

1225
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,710
- No, you don't.
- I love her!

1226
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,178
You don't even know
what love is!

1227
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,649
That's my boy!

1228
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,999
So, rico, I still don't
understand what we're doing here.

1229
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,354
So, rico, I still don't
understand what we're doing here.

1230
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,423
Shush, you idiot!
You'll see soon enough.

1231
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,760
Damn it, I feel like a
jackass from back there

1232
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,029
with t-brow and his mom.
But you know what?

1233
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,764
F-it, because I love
that woman, okay?

1234
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,699
And she loves me and if
loving someone's a crime,

1235
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,370
lock me up and throw away the
key, baby, 'cause I'm guilty.

1236
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,539
What do you think about this?
<i>Goo-goo gah-gah?</i>

1237
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,541
What?

1238
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,444
- Gotcha!
- Damn it, renato!

1239
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,249
What the heck are
you guys doing here?

1240
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,219
We'll be leaving now.

1241
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,421
Go go go! Get out, get out!

1242
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,390
Definitely a good time. It was.

1243
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:10,159
Wait. Isn't that the guy
we gave an atomic wedgie to?

1244
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,362
Actually, night train, that
was a wedgie-Melvin hybrid.

1245
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,299
Where's Einstein

every year
for the past 88 years.

1262
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,355
Exactly.

1263
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,358
Rico just gave me
a copy of the "herald."

1264
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,528
He's beating me by 5%
in the polls.

1265
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:24,333
What if I lose? You should have
just picked a better candidate.

Somebody like 39.
Everybody loves 39.

Forget rico.

1268
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,999
And you're a much better
candidate than 39.

1269
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,040
And you're a much better
candidate than 39.

1270
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,142
I can hear you.

1271

You're not lucky at all.

1274
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:44,755
Part of the reason why I chose you
to become my successor is because...

1275
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,391
I see in you
what I could have been.

1276
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:51,427
You have an opportunity

See? I told you <i>they</i> had him!

Thank goodness I took
those pictures.

1297
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,999
It seems as though you had illegal
custody of someone else's child.

It seems as though you had illegal
custody of someone else's child.

1299
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,133
Wait. How was it illegal?
He was left on our doorstep.

1300
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:07,203
- Did you ever consider calling the authorities?
- We took a paternity test.

1301
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:10,539
- And what were the results?
- I don't know. Did we ever get the results?

1302
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,676
I have some results here
that you'll be interested in.

01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,187
I shall have to think
of a new name for you.

1306
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,089
Oh, but how sweet is this?

1307
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,558
In the very spot where you
once embarrassed me,

1308
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,000
I take away everything

1309
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,061

01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,746
You know, before kegston
showed up...

1313
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,583
I was thinking about sticking
around for another year.

1314
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,721
Figured "why not stay
in college until you're 25?"

1315
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,724
I feel you, man.

1316
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:04,594
I think I finally realized
what it means to be an adult.

1317
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,597
Something still just doesn't
make any sense to me.

1318
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:12,202
Why would rico's baby
be on our doorstep?

1319
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:16,539
- We gotta get him back.
- He's not ours.

1320
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,674

Gotta get him back.

01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,215
- Gotta get him back.
- Yeah look, I wanna get him back too, man,

1324
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:29,018
but he's not ours.

he may not have been

1327
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:32,721

Anything. What are you good at?

1333
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,739

knock-knock jokes.

1335
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,611
- Let's hear one.
- <i>Knock knock.</i>

1336
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,980
<i>- Who's there?
- Fanny.</i>

1337
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,415
Fanny who?

1338
01:01:59,416 --> 01:01:59,999
Fanny body calls, I'm out.

1339
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,151
Fanny body calls, I'm out.

1340
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,253
<i>That's even worse.</i>

1341
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,022
<i>You just--
You made it even worse.</i>

1342
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,427
- Is that thing still crying?
- Yeah, rico, we've tried everything.

1343
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,495
You're lucky I'm in a good mood.

1344
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,664
I just got the latest
poll results.

1345
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,534
As word of the omegas' little child
abduction continues to build,

1346
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,103
my numbers continue
to skyrocket.

1347
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,339
<i>Why, if the election
were held this instant,</i>

1348
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,342
you'd be looking at
the new Hamilton university

1349
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,345
Greek board president.

1350
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,715
<i>That way we can finally get</i>

1351
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:35,719
the annual "farmer's
almanac" ball approved!

1352
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,220
Actually, when I win,

1353
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,556
there will be no more
phi tau tau.

1354
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,158
No more fraternities, period.

1355
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,463
No more resistance to my power.

1356
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,003
I can't believe rico is using
kegston to help him get votes.

1357
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,538
- This is dirty politics.
- Hodges, pledge.

1358
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,074
<i>We just all came back
from the quad.</i>

1359
01:02:59,075 --> 01:02:59,999
I gotta tell you, pretty much the
entire campus hates us right now.

1360
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,077
I gotta tell you, pretty much the
entire campus hates us right now.

1361
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:05,681
And look what those phi tau tau
supporters did to my shirt.

1362
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,716
It's lemon meringue, man.

1363
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,085
They all think
we kidnapped kegston.

1364
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,154
Yeah well, you didn't
really do anything

1365
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,290
to help the situation,
Mr. press conference.

1366
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:18,494
Now if it involved corn dogs, maybe
you'd be all up in that piece, huh?

1367
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,663
You really want
to take it there?

1368
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:23,332
What are you gonna
do about it, Rodney?

1369
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,702
- Take you back to the hood!
- Hodges! Hodges!

1370
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,371
No, put him down.
Night train, put him down!

1371
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:29,999
Hodges, man, when rico wins
the Greek board,

1372
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,573
Hodges, man, when rico wins
the Greek board,

1373
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,210
does that mean we get to like,
you know, join the phi tau taus?

1374
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,047
Hey. Hey, guys, come on!

1375
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:39,716
No-ooo!

1376
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,719
I know everything seems
really messed up right now

1377
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,754
<i>without kegston,</i>

1378
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:49,058
but we can't forget
that we're still omegas.

1379
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,993
That's right.

1380
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,562
Look, pledge, I just need you
to focus on winning

1381
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,431
- the Greek board debate, okay?
- Okay.

1382
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,366
Let <i>me</i> worry about kegston.

1383
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,435
<i>I'll figure something out.</i>

1384
01:03:59,436 --> 01:03:59,999
- Hey! Hey you! Vote!
- Vote for the motes over here.

1385
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,670
- Hey! Hey you! Vote!
- Vote for the motes over here.

1386
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,639
- Merkhaus, this guy.
- Hey hey, you!

1387
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,207
- Vote!
- <i>Vote for motes over here.</i>

1388
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,477
- Vote!
- Vote for motes.

1389
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,579
Guys, I just got off the
phone with the clinic,

1390
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,216
and they have no record of us
ever taking a paternity test.

1391
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,188
Seriously, kid?
"Votes for motes"?

1392
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:22,224
Is this the best you got?
What does this even mean?

1393
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,693
Come on, streets. We're already
in a tight enough spot as it is.

1394
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,529
Last thing we need is an omega alumni
pissing on us while we're down.

1395
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,531
None of your alumni have ever
been in the situation

1396
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,000
you guys are in right now,
all right?

1397
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,166
You guys are in right now,
all right?

1398
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,701
You're about to lose
Greek board.

1399
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,337
I know this whole kegston thing
is messed up right now,

1400
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,141
but I'm working as hard
as I can so I can beat rico.

1401
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:42,244
Working hard isn't gonna cut it.
Have you seen the polls today?

1402
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,381
You guys are getting killed. You're
going to have to have a plan.

1403
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,516
A good plan.

1404
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,618
Look, I remember some years back

1405
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,587
when there was
another omega freshman

1406
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,756
nominated
for Greek board president.

1407
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:56,058
<i>And everyone was walking
around saying,</i>

1408
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,227
"look, this dude's not
gonna win. The streak's over.

1409
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,999
Streak's over." Dude was
prepared, got up on that stage,

1410
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,663
streak's over." Dude was
prepared, got up on that stage,

1411
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,433
- won the whole school over.
- Was that steak mungro?

1412
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:09,071
No, it was Hodges. Same dude that
nominated you to follow in his footsteps.

1413
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,106
<i>You know what I'm saying?
But you know what?</i>

1414
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,342
I think you could be a better
president than Hodges.

1415
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:16,478
<i>I mean, you'd definitely be a
better president than that 39.</i>

1416
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,514
- I'm right here.
- Ha!

1417
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,449
<i>Anyway, rico is a prick.</i>

1418
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,652
So you know what? Kick some ass!

1419
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,322
- Yeah!
<i>- Kick his ass, man!</i>

1420
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,999
Ah, president dumervile.
Finally, a great lead.

1421
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,293
Ah, president dumervile.
Finally, a great lead.

1422
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:33,061
I just wanted to let you know that
when I become Greek board president,

1423
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,297
we will be spending
a lot more time together.

1424
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,566
Oh, you know what though?
I don't usually spend

1425
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,601
that much time
with my students during that.

1426
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,137
Oh, really? Well, I'm sure
you can make an exception.

1427
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,973
No, really. I've got so much-- and
you probably have so much to do.

1428
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,009
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- I did,

1429
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,344
but she lost both her legs last
summer in a skiing accident.

1430
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,747
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Perhaps we can go to dinner one night.

1431
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:54,416
- Chinese?
- Oh no, I'm allergic, heavily allergic to all that.

1432
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,685
I'll cook it myself.
I can make you this lovely--

1433
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,154
You know what? I am on a diet
and it's all just liquids.

1434
01:05:59,155 --> 01:05:59,999
- It's all I do eat.
- You don't need it.

1435
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,023
- It's all I do eat.
- You don't need it.

1436
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,991
Oh, stop it. I really--
I-- - oh please!

1437
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,295
I've got to go to the bathroom! The
liquids are going right through me.

1438
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,397
"As Greek board president,

1439
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:11,700
I plan to keep these
traditions alive,

1440
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,535
<i>and I promise to preserve them</i>

1441
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,504
for future generations

1442
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,307
of Hamilton students to enjoy."

1443
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,376
What'd you think?

1444
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,046
It was good.

1445
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:26,749
- Yeah?
- I think you could do better.

1446
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:29,999
How? This is the best I can do.

1447
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,753
How? This is the best I can do.

1448
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,057
It's not like
I'm gonna win anyway.

1449
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,193
What?

1450
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,462
Look, have you seen
the latest poll results?

1451
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,232
Rico's beating me by 40%.

1452
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,467
Nobody wants to vote
for the fraternity

1453
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,469
that is kidnapping babies.

1454
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,706
Okay, the Kyle motes
I met a few months ago

1455
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:53,675
may not have been the most
confident person in the world,

1456
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,511
but he wouldn't be laying here

1457
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,647
<i>preparing to let rico Larsen
win Greek board.</i>

1458
01:06:58,648 --> 01:06:59,999
Okay, I know you've been
trying really hard

1459
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,250
okay, I know you've been
trying really hard

1460
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:03,619
to get all the information
on kegston,

1461
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,188
and you're under
a lot of pressure,

1462
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,191
but come on, Kyle.
I mean, we're in round 12 here.

1463
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,660
- Are you really just gonna give up?
- No.

1464
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,395
Okay, if you go
up there tomorrow

1465
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,098
and you show the entire
university who you really are,

1466
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,133
they're gonna love you.

1467
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,135
And who cares if you
don't win the election?

1468
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,337
At least you'll go
out there swinging.

1469
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,674
Sorry. My dad's a high
school basketball coach.

1470
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,144
All I really know
are sports analogies.

1471
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,748
I've just never spoken in front
of that many people before.

1472
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,983
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

1473
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,587
- I'm really nervous.
- So was Willis Reed before game seven.

1474
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,426
Oh-hhh!

1475
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,030
Look at pledge popping
his cherry over here.

1476
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,435
<i>With only days remaining
before the Greek board debate,</i>

1477
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,304
<i>Richard "rico" Larsen</i>

1478
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:59,608
<i>has surged into a commanding
25% lead in the polls.</i>

<i>many attribute

1481
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:04,513
- <i>that omega fraternity abducted and hazed...</i>
- Hey, vote for motes!

1482
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,682
<i>...Larsen's baby, rico, Jr.</i>

1483
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:10,552
Rex moonberry, a Hamilton
freshman, had this to say:

1484
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:14,556
<i>I'm voting for rico 'cause I heard
the omegas kidnapped his baby.</i>

1485
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,727
<i>Do you know dolphin babies can't see for
the first two months of their lives?</i>

1486
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,762
And that's not
the only negativity

1487
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,999
directed at the omegas
ways these days.

1488
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,535
Damn omegas always make a mess!

1489
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,737
And I always have
to clean it up!

1490
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:29,999
Why can't you clean up
your mess, you potheads!

1491
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,574
Why can't you clean up
your mess, you potheads!

1492
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,011
<i>Can Kyle motes keep
the omegas tradition alive?</i>

1493
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:38,147
<i>We'll find out very soon.</i>

01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:41,717
Hey, son.

1495
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,685
Dad.

1496
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:46,221
Um...

1497
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,156
What are you doing here?

1498
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,093
I have something to show you.

1499
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,398
That's your mother
and me in 1978.

1500
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,301
Wow. Um--

1501
01:08:59,302 --> 01:08:59,999
Wait. You were an omega?

1502
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,969
Wait. You were an omega?

1503
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,071
Not quite.

1504
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,040
I never made it past
being a pledge.

1505
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,609
Why? Did they kick you out
for wearing those socks?

1506
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,578
Not quite.

1507
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:14,316
My father didn't approve of me
participating in such things.

1508
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,085
Go figure.

1509
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,722
But until the day she died
your mother always believed

1510
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,158
that I never should have
given it up.

1511
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,328
And I know that
she would be very proud

1512
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:29,464
to know that her son
was omega material.

1513
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:29,999
Well, I might not be
omega material much longer

1514
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,035
well, I might not be
omega material much longer

1515
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:35,537
if I don't win this thing.

1516
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,606
That really doesn't matter.

1517
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:40,509
Because win or lose,

1518
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,279
you're still our son.

1519
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,987
All right?
Now just do me one favor.

1520
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:55,090
- Could you consider becoming a lawyer?
- Yeah okay.

1521
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:57,159
Just a little thought,
if you wouldn't mind.

1522
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,227
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Okay.

1523
01:09:59,228 --> 01:09:59,999
I'm out there cheering you on.

1524
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,431
I'm out there cheering you on.

1525
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:10,073
Turns out your old man
was just a pledge too.

1526
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,976
Maybe you could help me
with this thing.

1527
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,379
Won't stop crying. Shut up!

1528
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:22,051
You know I'm thinking
of naming him rico Jr.

1529
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:27,656
Darwin was right--
Survival of the fittest.

1530
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,999
See you on the other side,
pledge!

1531
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,320
See you on the other side,
pledge!

1532
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:47,275
Rico! Rico! Rico!

1533
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,178
Rico! Rico! Rico!

1534
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,748
<i>Rico! Rico! Rico!</i>

1535
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,649
<i>Okay, all right, all right.</i>

1536
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,586
Everybody, please settle down.

1537
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,999
Today's debate
for Greek board president

1538
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,022
today's debate
for Greek board president

1539
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,125
features two candidates.

1540
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:06,027
First, representing phi tau tau

1541
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,164
is Richard Larsen, a junior.

1542
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:11,466
Rico! Rico! Rico!

1543
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,069
Rico! Rico! Rico!

1544
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,004
All right, and representing

1545
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,373
the incumbent omega fraternity

1546
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,010
is Mr. Kyle motes, a freshman.

1547
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:29,117
Um, today's debate will feature
a series of questions

1548
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:29,999
about each candidate's
vision of the university.

1549
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,287
About each candidate's
vision of the university.

1550
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,323
And it is up to you,
the student body,

1551
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:38,193
to decide who you think
is the best candidate.

1552
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:42,063
So, Mr. motes,
the floor is yours.

1553
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:44,033
Um...

1554
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:48,136
Well, I've never spoken

1555
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,338
in front of a crowd
this large before.

1556
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,208
<i>Wimp!</i>

1557
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:57,012
Um, let me start
by introducing myself.

1558
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,147
My name's Kyle motes.

1559
01:11:59,148 --> 01:11:59,999
I'm a creative writing m-major.

1560
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,249
I'm a creative writing m-major.

1561
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,287
- Um, I--
- Get off the stage, nerd!

1562
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,057
I-I-I-I live about
20 miles east--

1563
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,394
Oooh!
I'm a creative writing major!

1564
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,429
<i>- All right, all right.
- Enough of that.</i>

1565
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,998
Settle down, please.
We don't need that.

1566
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,100
You sound like a little baby.

1567
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,203
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1568
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:25,040
All right. Why don't we
go to our first question.

1569
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,075
Okay? Mr. Larsen,

1570
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,344
this will be directed to you:

1571
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:29,999
What would you do
as Greek board president

1572
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,980
what would you do
as Greek board president

1573
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,549
to make Hamilton university
a better place?

1574
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,153
As a father,

1575
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:40,388
I have learned what is important

1576
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,024
for the Hamilton community now,

1577
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,660
but more importantly,

1578
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:49,030
what is important
for the Hamilton community

1579
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,499
in the future.

1580
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,202
As any great parent would know--

1581
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:58,340
Oh, um, do you--

1582
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,999
- Do you need a moment?
- Uh, yes.

1583
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,509
- Do you need a moment?
- Uh, yes.

1584
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,278
Thank you.

1585
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,214
Come on, rico junior...

1586
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,584
Are you hungry? Oh, cranky
little one I have here.

1587
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:13,255
<i>Shut up, shut up.
We're going to win.</i>

1588
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:16,524
<i>The presidential
victory is ours.</i>

1589
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:20,128
Mmm.

1590
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,696
<i>It's all part of his act.</i>

1591
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,165
<i>He's happy, really.
Wave! Come on!</i>

1592
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,568
- Wave with daddy!
- <i>♪ you move like this ♪</i>

1593
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,336
<i>♪ you slide like that ♪</i>

1594
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,999
<i>♪ you wiggle real slow ♪</i>

1595
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,273
<i>♪ you wiggle real slow ♪</i>

1596
01:13:30,274 --> 01:13:32,207
<i>♪ and you dance real fast ♪</i>

1597
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:35,577
<i>♪ you do it all over,
but you change it all around ♪</i>

1598
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,613
<i>♪ then you jump
off the ground. ♪</i>

1599
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,615
What is this, a circus?

1600
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,652
Oh no. Maybe it's
just great parenting.

1601
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,987
Something you would
know nothing about

1602
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,089
considering
<i>you</i> are not a parent!

1603
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,659
You're right. I'm not.

1604
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,694
But neither are you.

1605
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:56,031
What the heck are you
talking about?

1606
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,401
Well...

1607
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,471
What I've just handed
president dumervile

1608
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,507
are the results
of a paternity test

1609
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,310
to see if Mr. Richard Larsen

1610
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:11,012
is the father of that baby.

1611
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,681
That's absurd.
You don't have any of my DNA.

1612
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:15,216
Actually, rico...

1613
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,220
I do.

1614
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,325
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1615
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,628
Well, Mr. rico,
it looks like you

1616
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,097
are not the father.

1617
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:29,999
Yes, you're right, I'm not!

1618
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,598
Yes, you're right, I'm not!

1619
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,434
But I was doing
this poor child a favor

1620
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,503
by taking him away
from you scoundrels!

1621
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,475
What?

1622
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:51,753
Steak mungro.

1623
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,521
Oh my god, he's alive!

1624
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,590
Legend.

1625
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,592
What are you doing here?

1626
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,527
I thought you were dead.

1627
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,000
I thought I killed you!

1628
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,197
I thought I killed you!

1629
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,734
Steak out.

1630
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:08,504
Steak out!

1631
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,507
<i>Steak! Steak! Steak! Steak!</i>

1632
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,677
<i>Steak! Steak! Steak!
Steak! Steak! Steak!</i>

1633
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,256
When I first rushed omega,

1634
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:29,999
I didn't know what I was
getting myself into.

1635
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,625
I didn't know what I was
getting myself into.

1636
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,495
I-- to be honest,

1637
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,530
I was just trying to fit in.

1638
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,701
Then I found out what
being an omega meant.

1639
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:43,171
<i>And it's not just hanging out
with your best friends</i>

1640
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:47,108
or throwing crazy parties

1641
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:50,513
or sleeping with the same
girls in the same night.

1642
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,215
It's going
beyond being a brother.

1643
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,651
It's going beyond
even a fatherhood.

1644
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,521
<i>And we help each other</i>

1645
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:00,000
become better people.

1646
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:02,390
Become better people.

1647
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,593
That's what fraternity
means to me.

1648
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:09,998
And as Greek board president that's
what I plan on doing for Hamilton.

1649
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:13,134
- He doin' a good job, ain't he? Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1650
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:17,305
I mean, I'm sure you've all
heard of the omegas'

1651
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,375
88-year streak of controlling
the Greek board.

1652
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,977
Well, tonight

1653
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,380
that streak comes to an end.

1654
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:29,184
From now on, it doesn't matter
what fraternity you're in,

1655
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:29,999
what sport you play
or who you hang out with.

1656
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,688
What sport you play
or who you hang out with.

1657
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:37,492
As Greek board president, I plan
on being there for everyone.

1658
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:40,562
Because I honestly
believe that each

1659
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,567
and every person
in this room <i>is</i> an omega.

1660
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:52,041
Clap it up. Clap it up!

1661
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,999
Omega! Omega! Omega!

1662
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,449
Omega! Omega! Omega!

1663
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,318
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

1664
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,720
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

1665
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:08,990
<i>Omega! Omega! Omega!</i>

1666
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,328
<i>Shortly after his presumed

He's not just yours.

1704
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,069
Hey, man, don't forget.
He's not just yours.

1705
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,605

- Yeah.

1706
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,640
Do you have an idea
who the mother is?

1707
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,976
No, I don't know.

1708
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,677
I mean, to be honest
with you guys,

1709
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,313
I really haven't had that much
sex in the last two years.

1710
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,283
Okay.

1711
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:17,252
- Come on.
<i>- Sorry.</i>

<i>What it is,

1714
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,294
And it's from a Dutch armory
in Switzerland.

1715
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:28,563
It smells beautiful too.
It smells like roses.

1716
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,999
Here, night train,
you wanna smell this?

1717
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,332
Here, night train,
you wanna smell this?

1718
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:33,434
