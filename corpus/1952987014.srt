1
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,267
PUDDLE: <i>Steve was in</i>
the middle of a game

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,067
 <i>when his friend,</i>
 <i>Fa'ad arrived.</i>

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,267
(WHISPERS LOUDLY)
Fa'ad.

4
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,100
Fa'ad, pop the trunk
so I can hop in.

5
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,234
Why?

6
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,534
I'm playing "$500 if you
can find me" with Puddle.

7
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,367
It's like a more
incentivized
hide and seek.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,801
I made it up
when I was a kid.

9
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,801
Well, that explains
the low prize amount.

10
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,601
The other twist is
that you don't tell
your opponent

11
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,067
that you're
actually playing...

12
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,934
Actually playing,
so they have to
figure that out too.

13
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,667
I'd like to play
that game with you.

14
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,467
Oh, you have.
Many times.

15
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,767
You're horrible at it.

16
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,300
Well, you're not
much better.

17
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,567
If Puddle sees me talking
to the back of my car,

18
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,968
she'll spot you
instantly.

19
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,534
We should be safe
here until nightfall.

20
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,634
Lot of luggage
back here.

21
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:57,801
Mmm, well, summer
"bacation's" over
and fall is finally here,

22
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,634
so that can only
mean one thing.

23
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:00,934
Fall vacation.

24
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,167
I'll be joining
my mothers and father
on a trip to the Gulf.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,801
Always nice to see
somebody else's spill.

26
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,868
And of course you'll be
"trabeling" with your family.

27
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,434
Oh, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,767
I forgot that your family
has little regard for you.

29
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,167
No, they care about me.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,601
They just choose
not to show it
with words or actions.

31
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:22,400
But with Emmy
and Puddle here,

32
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,100
I kind of have
a new family.

33
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,601
We all have our own
roles to play in
our little psychodrama.

34
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,868
And I'm hoping that
by taking them away
on vacation,

35
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:32,834
I'll finally be able to make
love to the wife character.

36
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:34,734
How clueless of you.

37
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,067
Don't you think
there must be a reason

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,033
why she insists
on "libing" in
that tree house?

39
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,467
Why doesn't Darren
let Samantha use magic?
I don't know.

40
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,667
She finds you
and your lifestyle
morally repugnant.

41
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,767
Do you think?

42
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:46,467
Of course.
This is a woman

43
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,100
who spent all her
time in the jungle.

44
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,734
She probably doesn't
even "shabe" her legs.

45
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,467
That actually came
up the other night.

46
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,434
PUDDLE: <i>It was right after</i>
Mom took her first
bubble bath in six years.

47
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,868
STEVE: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Emmy.

48
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:59,000
Emmy, are you
taking a bath?

49
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,200
Emmy.

50
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:02,200
 <i>Of course, she didn't want</i>
 <i>Steve to know about it.</i>

51
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,067
Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't waste
hot water on a bath.

52
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,601
I couldn't figure out
how to use your dishwasher.

53
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:09,868
Who, Oleg?

54
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,934
Oh, just push the
dish into his chest.
He'll take it from there.

55
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,133
Listen, you've been
in the jungle
for a long time,

56
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,701
so if you want to just
soak in a hot tub

57
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,434
or shave your legs
or whatever...

58
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,133
That won't be necessary.

59
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,634
Are you saying that
because they're
already shaved, or...

60
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,634
No, I was saying
I don't believe that
one person is worth

61
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,901
the energy it takes
to heat 80 gallons
of water for a bath.

62
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,601
Oh, well, you may not
be worth it, but I am.

63
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:31,934
I'm filthy rich.

64
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,701
No, no, no, I wasn't
talking about money.

65
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,200
I was talking about
personal worth.

66
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:36,567
Yes, and I'm saying

67
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,501
that I have far more
personal worth
than you do,

68
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,667
but I'm not
judging you for it.

69
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,567
Steve, I am judging you.

70
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,901
Overruled.

71
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, admit it.
You find my wealth
to be emasculating.

72
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,400
I am not a man.

73
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,868
Then shave your legs, sir.

74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,534
(CHUCKLES) Oh, "Stebe",
you have a better
chance of romance

75
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,267
with me in the back
of this escalade

76
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,934
than you do
of getting that woman
to go on a trip with you.

77
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,033
Just so much baggage.

78
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,434
We could move it.

79
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,100
No, I meant
between Emmy and me.

80
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,400
Let us out of here.

81
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:09,400
I was a fool to think
that I could ever
get close with her again.

82
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,634
(SIGHING)
Tell your mom I'm going
out of town next week.

83
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,067
On vacation.

84
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:17,601
Alone.

85
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,934
PUDDLE: <i>I was sorry</i>
to hear about that,

86
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,901
 <i>although happy</i>
 <i>about the $500 tip.</i>

87
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,200
EMMY: Did
you see Steve?

88
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:25,868
I found him
curled up in a ball

89
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,234
at the back
of Fa'ad's car.

90
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,567
Huh. That
can't be good.

91
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:33,067
Unless... Did he
give you $50?

92
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,234
Uh-huh.

93
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,167
PUDDLE: <i>Among</i>
450 other things.

94
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,501
Yeah, that's a game.

95
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,267
He's trying to make
it fun for you here.

96
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,868
He really is a big
sweetie, isn't he?

97
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,634
God, I feel terrible
about what I said
the other day to him.

98
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,868
I Just... I think
I was feeling guilty

99
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,467
about not staying
in the tree house.

100
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,734
Why are we staying
in the tree house?

101
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,801
We're making a point.
We're making some point.

102
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,701
But maybe we do
deserve a little
vacation

103
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:57,901
from the tree house,
right?

104
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,501
It is fall break at school.

105
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,934
Maybe we could stay
in Steve's house
while he goes on vacation.

106
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,067
Hmm?

107
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,667
Oh, yeah,
he wanted me
to tell you.

108
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,834
He's going alone.

109
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,801
Alone? What?

110
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,200
Oh, okay, I get it.
He's trying to
make a point

111
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,901
about how he's worth
more than we are,

112
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,167
and how he deserves
some big, fancy trip

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,334
while we live
in this tree
like animals.

114
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:18,467
Where is he?

115
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,033
Been there.

116
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,400
Don't want to go there.
Found you.

117
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,434
I'm not paying you
500 for that.
I'm not playing.

118
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,734
Neither am I.
I can't believe...
Five hundred?

119
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,601
Did I count that wrong?

120
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,434
I can't believe you're
going out of town alone.

121
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,968
Well,
you're obviously
not going with me.

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Well, obviously,
because I misunderstood

123
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:35,467
what's going on
here between us.

124
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,834
Well, I obviously did too.

125
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,400
After all,
I'm not worth a vacation.

126
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:41,067
Well, I love planning
a great, big trip to go
on all by myself.

127
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,601
Oh, so you prefer
going with Puddle
and me?

128
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:43,701
There's nothing
I'd like more.

129
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:44,968
Well, same here.

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,267
Great. So then we're
not actually fighting.

131
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
No. We're agreeing.
Then go pack your bags.

132
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,801
You know what?
I will.

133
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,934
I'm really excited.

134
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,400
It's gonna be fun, right?
Yeah.

135
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,734
So you really
talked her into
going, huh?

136
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,400
Three weeks of her, me,
and a four-poster bed.

137
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,767
You know, you always
tell me to bring that,

138
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,767
and we never actually
put it together.

139
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,167
At least I have
a chance for
a little me time,

140
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,501
and I'm finally going
to finish renovating
my little cottage.

141
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:14,868
Wait, isn't that
on my land?

142
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,133
Yes, it's the old
hunting cabin.

143
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,734
You gave it to me
after I had
my second heart attack.

144
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,300
Well, sure.
I didn't think
you'd make it.

145
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,234
PUDDLE: <i>For some reason,</i>
Mr. Lunt was touched by that.

146
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:27,767
Well, I'm going up there
with a bottle of Chardonnay,

147
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,634
some stenciling,
and a good Kitty Kelley.

148
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,567
So where
are you taking
Emmy and Puddle

149
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,434
without feeling guilty
for not taking me?

150
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,133
You know, I thought
I'd just gas up the jet,

151
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,367
maybe take her
to a private resort
in Montenegro.

152
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,167
You know, Emmy's really
not a "gas up the jet"
type of gal.

153
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
You want to
impress her,

154
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,701
you don't leave
a carbon footprint.

155
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:43,868
Well, what am I
supposed to do?

156
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,234
Take her to some
shed in the woods
within walking distance?

157
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,767
Like the old
hunting cottage.

158
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,767
Yeah, that's woodsy
and rustic.
She'll love that.

159
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, no, no, no,
it's not like
that anymore.

160
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,734
I've been redoing
it for years.

161
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,067
It's all slate
and seagrass,

162
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,801
and leftover Carrara marble
from your pool house redo

163
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,901
you said I could have
after my prostate.

164
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,868
Well, easier to tear down
than to build up, right?

165
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,300
Is it?

166
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,834
Sure. Migo, why don't
you could go over there
with a couple of your guys,

167
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,000
put some leaks in the roof,

168
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,434
knock down some
of that gingerbread,

169
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,934
bring it back
to the skinning shack

170
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,868
it must have been
at the turn of
the century, huh?

171
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,701
That okay
with you, Lunt?

172
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:19,334
Well, it's just that
I spent so long fixing
it up.

173
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,701
I was sort of hoping
to retire there

174
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,634
when you stopped
needing me.

175
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,300
Hey, look at me.

176
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,467
I'm never gonna
stop needing you.

177
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,167
No, the last thing
that you'll see
on this earth

178
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,934
is my tear-stained face

179
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,100
as I shovel dirt onto yours.

180
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,367
I'm going to see this?

181
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,534
We're going to a cabin?

182
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,667
I know. It doesn't sound
like a huge step up
from the tree house,

183
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,968
but he's really
trying, isn't he?

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,067
They all are.

185
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,934
PUDDLE: <i>They were.</i>

186
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,601
 <i>Especially Migo</i>
 <i>and his family.</i>

187
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,701
We found that weird room
filled with china dolls.

188
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:57,467
I say we leave it.

189
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,567
It's a little creepy.

190
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:01,033
Steve said he wanted
creepy, right?

191
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah, you know, it's really
not the right kind of creepy.

192
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,501
Get it out.

193
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,667
(SHATTERING)

194
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:09,601
Well then,
let me at least
tissue and box 'em.

195
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,434
So it looks like
we'll need
our bed rolls,

196
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,100
and it might
be tight quarters,

197
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,834
so I'm gonna do
a little touch-up.

198
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,400
PUDDLE:
 <i>She'd never admit it,</i>

199
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:20,567
 <i>but I think my mom</i>
 <i>was really looking forward</i>
 <i>to having a man in her life.</i>

200
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,834
MAN: Hey.

201
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:24,400
 <i>Until she was reminded</i>
 <i>that she already had one.</i>

202
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:27,501
Can a guy who just traveled
three weeks on a garbage barge
to see you

203
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,467
get a hug around here?

204
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,701
PUDDLE: <i>Kind of.</i>

205
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:36,434
 <i>My mom's fiance had arrived</i>
 <i>off a garbage barge from Peru.</i>

206
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, dear God,
you smell.

207
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:39,300
Yeah.

208
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,734
So why did you
take a barge
and not fly?

209
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,300
Well, you know, I was
in line to get a ticket,

210
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,667
but then I saw
this migrant worker

211
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,667
who was trying to get
back to his pregnant wife,

212
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,434
and, you know, he was
oppressed and huddled.

213
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,334
Not... Not so much a mass,
but, still, I... You know,

214
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,367
I gave him
my money, and...

215
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,667
Andy. Mmm.

216
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,634
Oh. Oh, no, no,
no, no. So bad.

217
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,667
Anyway, now I'm broke.

218
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,234
I got no money,

219
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,567
and the little money
I do have

220
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,834
is gonna have to
go to Hep C shots.

221
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,801
Let that be a lesson
to you, little lady.

222
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,133
See a nice bag
of soft cotton balls

223
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,000
but it's marked
"Medical Waste",

224
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,467
you don't use her
as a pillow.

225
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,734

(LOUD CLATTERING)

227
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,901
Oh, shy.

228
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,067
But then I got your letter.

229
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,868
And it occurred to me
the light of my life
has infiltrated the enemy.

230
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,934
Together, we can
bring Wilde Oil

231
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:27,334
to its knees
from within

232
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,501
and liberate
the oppressed masses.

233
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:33,167
Well, big plans,
but Steve really
is just the son,

234
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,834
and he is letting
us stay here

235
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,167
so Puddle can
go to school,

236
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,334
so there is that.

237
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,200
I can't believe
you're trading in
your principles

238
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:44,400
for some pampered
existence in some
luxurious McTree Mansion.

239
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,667
I mean, look at this.

240
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,133
This is everything
we fought against.

241
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,667
I mean, what kind of deal
did you make with this guy?

242
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,000
No deal.
We hardly even
see each other.

243
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:56,033
STEVE: Come on down, girls.
Our family vacation awaits.

244
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,267
Except on trips.

245
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,767
We do see each
other on trips.

246
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,901
Is that him?

247
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, pig.

248
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,601
Who the hell are you?
I'll give you a hint.

249
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,634
It rhymes
with candy cheeks.

250
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,434
What? It rhymes
with candy cheeks,

251
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,200
or is candy cheeks?

252
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,968

Oh, come on.

254
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,334
I'm the guy
who's engaged
to Emmy,

255
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,868
the guy she's been
telling you about.

256
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,501
Yeah, well, I've never
heard of you before.

257
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,934
I've mentioned you.
He never listens.

258
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,801
She says you never listen.

259
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,033
Well, why don't you
come down here

260
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,567
and see if I
never glisten.

261
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,033
I'll be on the cover
of <i>Men's Journal</i>

262

than you will, pal.

coming down,
I'm heating up.

Oh, yeah,
no, here I come.

to come up and face
me man-to-man?

Well, no,

270
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,334
Well, just... Well,
you can come on the side.

271
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,801
I don't know
if my arms can...

272
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:48,901
Well, then,
now we're both...

Oh, my God.
I don't know why they
call you candy cheeks.

275
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:53,634
You smell like
a garbage barge.

276
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,167
Hey, you don't think
I'm self-conscious
about that?

Well, I'm glad
somebody's calm.

281
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,334

that gargoyle
in Birkenstocks

I mean, you're pretty
and beautiful
and attractive,

and he is like
a poor man's poor man.

00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,834
Well, unlike you,
I don't judge people
just by how they look, okay?

299
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:48,467
I'm more concerned
about their compassion
and their principles.

300
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,934
Well, that is not
very compassionate

who look fantastic

302
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:53,367

No. Bathing in that
capitalist pig's home

make me more...

so much about

00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,667
one might think you,
uh, cared about him,
or something.

335
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:06,968
I am not a man.

336
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,467
No, I am. I'm a man.

337
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,067
Oh, I didn't mean to
emasculate you. I...

338
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,367
I'll be all right.

339
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,667
By the way, I do not
care about him, okay?

340
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,434
He's a rich son
of a rich dad.

341
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,667
If you're gonna
go after anyone,

342
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,734
I would concentrate
on the father.

343
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:18,968
I mean, he's really...

344
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,367
Emmy, that's it.
That's a brilliant idea.

345
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,934
Yes. We'll kidnap Steve,

346
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,434
use the ransom money
from his dad

347
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,968
to buy back the land
from the tribes
he displaced.

348
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,701
See, that's how
you help people.

349
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,634
Okay, but you can't
really kidnap Steve.

350
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,968
I mean, among a million
other reasons,

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,100
once he's released,
he'd tell everyone
it was you,

352
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,634
and you'd go to jail
for the rest of your life.

353
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,167
What if he didn't know
he was being kidnapped?

354
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,901
Then I guess it wouldn't
be the best kidnapping.

355
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:44,601
What if he thinks
he's going on a vacation
with his friend, Andy,

356
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,767
who, unbeknownst to him,
has sent a letter off
demanding his ransom?

357
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,067
See, rich people
have insurance
for stuff like this.

358
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,033
Oh, my God! Oh!

359
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,834
We get to stick it
to the insurance
people, too.

360
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,801
It's the perfect crime.

361
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,234
But it is still
a crime, you know?

362
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,601
And it's not gonna work,

363
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,234
because he's not gonna
go anywhere with you.

364
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,767
You've done nothing
but fight since
you met him,

365
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,934
and will you
please find a hose?
You're gonna hurt yourself.

366
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:08,434
Emmy, I did not win
a loose cannon at
the Eco Terrorist Awards

367
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:12,133
by not knowing
a little something
about water pressure.

368
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,501
Oh!
Oh! Andy!

369
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:18,234
PUDDLE: <i>So Andy went</i>
ahead with his fake
kidnapping plan after all.

370
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,467
 <i>First by making</i>
 <i>a ransom note.</i>

371
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,200
 <i>Then by trying to</i>
 <i>get Steve to like him,</i>

372
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,801
 <i>which he knew</i>
 <i>would take a while.</i>

373
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,167
(LAUGHING) Oh!
(LAUGHING) Hey.

374
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,167
I was hoping
to see you.

375
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,601
Steve, I was
hoping to see you.

376
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,601
PUDDLE: <i>But Steve was</i>
following Migo's advice
to act friendly to Andy.

377
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:36,467
 <i>There was a lot of fake</i>
 <i>acting-nice going on.</i>

378
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:40,367
I wanted to apologize
for accusing you
of not listening earlier.

379
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,801
I would like to apologize
for not being more
glisteny earlier.

380
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,567
Steve says, "We should
do something sometime.

381
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,501
"Let me get to know
the real candy cheeks."

382
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,300
This would be easier
if you gave me
the binoculars.

383
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,801
I happen to have
a backpack right here.

384
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,534
We could hike up
to my family's cabin
as early as...

385
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,868
Right now.

386
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,067
Let's.

387
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,734
PUDDLE: <i>And so both men headed</i>
directly into the woods.

388
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,567
Won't this be fun?
Great.

389
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,501
 <i>Stopping only so Andy could</i>
 <i>mail his ransom letter.</i>

390
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,934
Come on, new buddy.

391
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,734
I haven't made
a new buddy
since never.

392
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,801
 <i>And soon we had</i>
 <i>a surprise visitor.</i>

393
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:27,634
FA'AD: Have you a moment?

394
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,133
I just wanted to
know, not that I care,
who that gentleman was

395
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,400
that "Stebe" went
on "bacation" with.

396
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,601
Vacation?
Vacation?

397
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,968
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm embarrassed
to admit

398
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,501
that I sometimes get
my Bs and my Vs
confused.

399
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,601
(CHUCKLES)

400
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,133
"Bacation."

401
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,534
Not that I wanted
to "trabel"
with "Stebe" myself.

402
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,934
Plus I could always
go into the woods
with him.

403
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,000
They went into
the woods?

404
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,200
They went
into the woods?

405
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:54,701
Look, she's right there.

406
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,901
I don't need you
to lipread for me.

407
00:14:56,934 --> 00:15:00,534
It's weird they would
go somewhere
without leaving a note.

408
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,834
I saw him
making a note.

409
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,868
He was cutting
up magazines.

410
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,100
Oh, no.

411
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,167
I think my fiance's
kidnapping Steve.

412
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,133
Well, I don't want to
rush you through
the grieving process,

413
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,501
but would you like to
go on "bacation" with me?

414
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:20,567
PUDDLE: <i>My mother was</i>
shocked to find out that
Andy was kidnapping Steve.

415
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:23,367
Puddle, go find Migo
and Mr. Lunt.
Tell them what's going on.

416
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
We have to stop that
letter from going through,

417
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,133
otherwise Andy
will go to jail.
Hurry. Go.

418
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:31,667
PUDDLE: <i>I ran as fast</i>
as I could until they
couldn't see me anymore.

419
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,434
 <i>I'm not a giant Andy fan.</i>

420
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,033
They must be
going to the cabin.

421
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,834
Fa'ad, can you take me
to the cabin in the woods?

422
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:39,601
If you're okay
with me taking my "SUB".

423
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,701
No, we're not
taking a submarine.

424
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:43,200
What is with these
rich people and...

425
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,601
Oh, you mean SUV.

426
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:46,667
Yes, that's
what I said. S-U-B.

427
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,300
PUDDLE: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
Andy and Steve

428
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,934
 <i>were growing tired</i>
 <i>of being fake-nice</i>
 <i>to each other.</i>

429
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:53,167
Got anything to drink
in there, friend?

430
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,334
In where, friend?

431
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,467
That giant backpack
of yours, friend.

432
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh. I don't think that
there's anything in it.

433
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,434
Just packed with the hiking
paper it came with, my friend.

434
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:06,734
That's not hiking paper.

435
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,968
That's the filler they
use to make it look fat,
you idiot... Friend.

436
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,334
You look fat, you moron.

437
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,934
(LAUGHS) So you're not
my friend, are you?

438
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,000
Of course not.

439
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,968
And I can't believe
that you want to
be my friend.

440
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,701
I don't.
I'm kidnapping
you, you twit.

441
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:19,868
What are you
talking about?

442
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,801
I could overpower
you in a moment.

443
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,901
Yeah, that's why
I didn't tell you.

444
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,334
Come on.

445
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,868
Stop saying that.

446
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,734
Just lead us
to that damn cabin

447
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,000
so I can call Mr. Lunt
and he can get us
the hell out of here.

448
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,567
Fine. Wait,
what do you
mean "lead us"?

449
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,534
I don't know where
your stupid cabin is?

450
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,067
Well, neither do I.

451
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,334
What, you think I've been
everywhere on my property?

452
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,767
I don't think I've been
everywhere in my house.

453
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,834
Anyway, aren't you
some kind of
jungle doctor,

454
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:45,200
who knows how
to track things?

455
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,501
Ouch!
That hurt.

456
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,434
Look, you can't track
anything that doesn't

457
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,400
walk or leave droppings
for a trail, you know?

458
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,167
Like... Like that.
That's a trail, see?

459
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,467
Comes all the way
right up...

460
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,067
Oh. I'm sick.

461
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:01,834
(GRUNTS)

462
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,033
Candy cheeks!

463
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,534
Oh, I think I'm gonna need
some of that hiking paper.

464
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,567
PUDDLE: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
Fa'ad and my mother
arrived at the cabin.

465
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,868
Steve? Andy?

466
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,934
Where...

467
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,634
What kind of cabin is this?

468
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,400
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

469
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:20,767
Used to be
an old hunting lodge,

470
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:23,000
but now it's sort
of a "haben" for me

471
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:26,200
where I can just
slow down and get
to know somebody

472
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,033
recently "abailable".

473
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,534
Are you insane?

474
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,601
You were supposed to
take me to Steve's cabin.

475
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,033
Oh, "Stebe's" cabin.

476
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,868
Yes. We are heading off
a potential disaster here.

477
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,467
I'm so sorry.
I didn't get
that at all.

478
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,167
It's hard to hear
under the tree house.

479
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
No, I have no idea
where Steve's cabin is.
(SIGHS)

480
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,534
Are you good at tracking?

481
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,100
Well, I'm okay,
if they've left
some sort of trail.

482
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,367
You look terrible.

483
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,901
I don't feel so great.

484
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:54,234
I'm leaking like
the Exxon Valdez.

485
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,067
I think I'm
a little delirious.

486
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,133
These trees were
making fun of me.

487
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,734
Oh, but then I met
a family of raccoons.

488
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,734
(LAUGHING) They
were so delicious.

489
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,000
Quick.
Let's make love.

490
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,467
Oh, no.

491
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:10,734
God, you are just
a head coming out
a pile of packing wrap.

492
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,767
There's still
things we can do.

493
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,300
What is wrong with you?

494
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,067
I honestly don't know.

495
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,067
I think it might
be related to
the medical waste

496
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,400
I used as a pillow,

497
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,067
but don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be fine.

498
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,367
I'm talking
about the kidnapping.
You sent a letter?

499
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,167
Well, he led me
into the woods.

500
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,534
I thought it was
my last chance.

501
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:27,767
Okay, so where
is he now?

502
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,734
Well, he made this nice
hiking nest for me,

503
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,167
and then he went
to go get help,

504
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,601
which is weird,
'cause he's such a jerk.

505
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,567
It's because he's
not a jerk, Andy.
I'm the jerk.

506
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,234
Because when you asked me
why I'm staying with Steve,

507
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,534
I should have
told you the truth,
which is...

508
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,834
I like him.

509
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,100
He's my friend.

510
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:44,801
What?

511
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,334
Wait, you're not
just gonna leave me
here, are you?

512
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,501
You're a quarter mile
from the tree house.

513
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:52,767
Oh, come on!

514
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,434
EMMY: Stop saying that.

515
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,934
PUDDLE: <i>My mother</i>
finally found the cabin,

516
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:00,167
 <i>hoping that Steve was there,</i>
 <i>calling for help.</i>

517
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,968
God, it's grotesque.

518
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,567
Oh.

519
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,133
This is not
what it looks like.

520
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,734
Really?
Because it looks like
you're warming yourself

521
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,200
in a dilapidated cottage.

522
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:17,234
Yeah, the guys did
a really good job
with the dilapidating.

523
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:20,133
But I called Mr. Lunt.
He's gonna pick up Andy.

524
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,601
Oh...
Well, you don't look
very kidnapped.

525
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:26,200
Looks kidnapped to me.
Wonder how long
Andy's going to jail for.

526
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,667
Oh, Steve, about that,
I just want you to know

527
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,801
I would never condone
something like kidnapping.

528
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,701
In fact, I sent Migo
to try to intercept
that letter at your father's,

529
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:34,901
but he did not
get there in time.

530
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,868
It's okay. It's great.

531
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,334
I actually think
that it's great

532
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,667
that the money
might actually go
to a good cause, so...

533
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,434
My dad has insurance
for stuff like this.

534
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:43,968
Believe me, how much
did he end up paying?

535
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Well,
I think your father
was a little worried

536
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,300
it would up the premiums.

537
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,701
At first.

538
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:55,400
Which is why he decided
to sit this one out
and not report you missing.

539
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:56,934
But... (LAUGHS)

540
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,667
I... I have
nothing else to say.
(CLEARS THROAT)

541
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,634
PUDDLE: <i>All of a sudden,</i>
I got why Steve made up a game

542
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,367
 <i>to make people</i>
 <i>want to look for him.</i>

543
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,434
That's great.

544
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,467
It's good to know
what you're worth.

545
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,200
You know, let's
change the subject.

546
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,501
Migo, you had...
Nothing else to say.

547
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,167
Hey, you mean
a lot to us, okay?

548
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,734
And, you know,
we're already here,

549
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,300
so why don't we take
that family vacation?

550
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,734
Really?
Yeah.

551
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,801
I would love that.

552
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:33,667
Hey, is there room
for one more
on this "bacation"?

553
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,801
Of course.

554
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,767
Well then,
let's bring "Stebe".

555
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,567
He's "habing" a rough day.

556
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:44,601
Hey, listen.
We can't have people
sleeping on the floor.

557
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:48,434
What about I bring
that four-poster out
for you and me?

558
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,300
Uh, how about
for me and Puddle?

559
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,667
There's nothing
I wouldn't do
for you and Puddle.

560
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,734
Migo, go do that
for her and Puddle.

561
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:56,767
(LAUGHS)

562
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,234
(EXHALES)

563
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,000
Sorry about coming
on so strong there.
I...

564
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,400
You know, Steve,
you talk a big game,

565
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:08,467
but I think
what I really am
to you is a friend.

566
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,767
(LAUGHS)

567
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,067
Please take
your hand off my leg.

568
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,601
I get it.
You haven't shaved.
