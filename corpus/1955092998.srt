1085
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:17,025
When I shall be no more,

1086
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:20,298
the very remembrance of us both
will speedily vanish.

1087
01:23:20,894 --> 01:23:24,137
I will no longer see the sun nor stars,

1088
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:27,309
or feel the winds play upon my cheeks.

1089
01:23:28,068 --> 01:23:30,912
I shall ascend
my funeral pile triumphantly

1090
01:23:32,873 --> 01:23:35,581
and exalt in the agony
of the torturing flames.

1091
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:40,351
The light of that conflagration
will fade away.

1092
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:44,486
My ashes will be swept into the sea
by the winds.

1093
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:47,759
My spirit will sleep in peace.

1094
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:52,632
Or if it thinks,
it will not surely think thus.

1095
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,468
Farewell.

1096
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:49,450
I am Adam!
