1
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,080
We are closed.

2
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,921
Just a small drink.

3
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,329
The toilets?

4
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:38,956
A quick drink
and then l'll leave.

5
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,355
Why are you rushing off?

6
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,027
l said, ''Why are you rushing off?''

7
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,362
l don't understand.

8
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,698
The man from Bristol called ya.

9
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:02,044
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

10
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,182
What were you doing back here?

11
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:47,819
Lady, l never walk into a place
l don't know how to walk out of.

12
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,958
Then why get into that van?

13
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,463
You know the reason.

14
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,902
Make yourselves at home.

15
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,266
You've come a long way.

16
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,399
- Thanks for comin'.
- What's the job?

17
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:15,296
There are some people
who have something we require.

18
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,805
- And we want you to get it from them.
- Does it involve shooting?

19
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,536
You must be tired.

20
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,805
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

21
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:37,814
- Seven fat years and seven lean years.
- That's what it says in the Bible.

22
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,552
You ever kill anybody?

23
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,191
l hurt somebody's feelings once.

24
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,432
Don't l know you?

25
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:56,066
l don't think so.
l'd remember.

26
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,914
Two hour shifts.

27
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,852
- l'll watch the front, you the back.
- For later.

28
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,689
Merci.

29
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,471
You awake then?

30
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,276
How we doin'?

31
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,664
You labor or management?

32
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:05,837
lf l was management,
l wouldn't have given you cigarette.

33
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:11,513
l am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

34
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:14,451
Over here the Louvre.
Over there les toilettes.

35
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:18,480
- What do l call you?
- My name is Vincent.

36
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:19,752
Sam.

37
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,430
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week...

38
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,526
with a minimum
of four weeks' work.

39
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,901
On the successful completion
of the mission...

40
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:36,965
you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

41
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,405
And by the way,
my name is Dierdre.

42
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:45,747
-The broad outlines of the mission are--
-Who are your principals?

43
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,548
For you, no one but myself.

44
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,980
And what can we infer
from your charming lrish lilt?

45
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:53,954
Anything you like.

46
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,892
Where's the equipment?

47
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:58,522
Make a list
and give it to Vincent.

48
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:01,795
- The equipment is quite technical.
- lf it's in Paris, l'll find it.

49
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,399
This is what we're after.

50
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:09,499
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

51
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,067
- How many men?
- You American?

52
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:15,876
The group would be quite small. Between
five and eight. No more than eight.

53
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,849
You don't know for sure?

54
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,511
l don't know now,
but l will before the event.

55
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:24,148
lf you don't know,
why do you say between five and eight?

56
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,158
There's two to three cars.
The group's travelin'.

57
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,660
- They're not in Paris?
- Where are they?

58
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:31,356
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

59
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,026
Our plan, in the broad strokes,
is an ambush.

60
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:38,696
lt's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

61
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,706
Transit? City, country?

62
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,571
Right now l don't know.

63
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:46,043
But we've to move very quickly.
We've to improvise.

64
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:49,548
We'll start with this: ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles...

65
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:54,485
five to eight men, and our objective is
the safe retrieval of this case.

66
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:57,079
Tell Vincent what it is you'll need.

67
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,192
What do we know about them?
Are they French?

68
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,126
Where are they from? Who are they?

69
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:06,563
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

70
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,833
You've done
this kind of thing before?

71
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:14,740
- How difficult can it be?
- No idea how these men will be armed?

72
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,276
They'll be very well armed, indeed.

73
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,504
Where are we going
and how do we get back?

74
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,707
lt'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

75
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:26,411
- What does she mean?
- After that, we're on our own.

76
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,250
- lt's a military term.
- That's right.

77
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,914
Larry, tell Vincent
what you'll need.

78
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,487
Something very fast.
Audi S-8.

79
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,791
Something that can shove
a little bit.

80
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,763
l'm going to have it
for you by afternoon.

81
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:42,563
l'm also gonna need a nitrous system.
l've got the specs.

82
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,665
What do you use, weapons-wise?

83
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,972
Weapons. l'm a-- l'm a weapons man.

84
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,173
Weapons man?

85
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,182
- Yeah.
- Great.

86
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,243
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favor?

87
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,051
lt's a toolbox. l don't care.

88
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,284
- You put the tools in for the job.
- What?

89
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:09,453
You know, l actually
favor the old 1911.

90
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:12,993
Forty-five? Old gun.

91
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,928
lt served my country well.
A long time.

92
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:21,638
Your country. Not done too well,
though, last few wars?

93
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,176
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

94
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:29,676
- You ex military?
- l got my job through the ''Times.''

95
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:33,219
Don't let him get you down.

96
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,548
lt don't mean nothin'.

97
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,486
l say what l think.

98
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,818
You ex military?

99
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,319
Hereford?

100
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,862
l'd like to do it backwards.
The line of retreat is?

101
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:48,833
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

102
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:52,736
l understand. l'm just trying
to get a vague notion of the opposition.

103
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:57,208
l mean, we're setting out to cause
some animosity over here, and l--

104
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:00,337
- How many are coming after us?
- You worried about your own skin?

105
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:03,814
Yeah, l am.
lt covers my body.

106
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,778
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

107
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,256
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

108
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,882
That is our information.

109
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,587
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

110
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,927
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol, an assault rifle.

111
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,590
Quite diverting.

112
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:26,533
l'll need bigger injection jets. The
Bosch won't do it. Must be custom made.

113
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,198
We going north or south?

114
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:33,508
l'd like some new clothes.

115
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,343
- Vincent will sort you out.
- l'll take care of it.

116
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,352
- What brought you here?
- A fellow that doesn't work so well.

117
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,750
The man in the wheelchair?

118
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:55,467
- How did he get there?
- That was in your neck of the woods...

119
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,366
back in the late unpleasantness.

120
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:09,981
Good reflexes.

121
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,948
Yeah.

122
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,127
They die hard.

123
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,396
- lnterrogation.
- What?

124
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,495
Methods to withstand interrogation.

125
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:30,699
You've done that?

126
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,801
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

127
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:36,913
Nobody can.

128
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,243
- ls that so?
- Yeah. Everybody has a limit.

129
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,079
l spent some time
in interrogation once.

130
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,784
- They make it hard?
- They don't make it easy.

131
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,723
Yeah, it was unpleasant.

132
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,786
l held out as long as l could.

133
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:57,163
All the stuff they tried.
You just can't hold out forever.

134
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,998
- lmpossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

135
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,835
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

136
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:07,435
Let's see. That's two part gin, two part
brandy, one part creme de menthe and--

137
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,445
Fuckin' smart-ass.

138
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:13,508
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

139
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,518
l know it.

140
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:18,680
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

141
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,656
You're gonna exchange
for cash?

142
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:24,759
- Aye.
- You know these people?

143
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:25,796
My people know them.

144
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:27,728
Your people have done business
with them before...

145
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,857
or they just gave
your people a number?

146
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:52,488
lf we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

147
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,188
l'm busy.

148
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,464
Come on. Let's go.

149
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:04,330
The answers to your questions
l'll know when l get back.

150
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:07,530
- l'll go with you.
- Go with them.

151
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,753
Who's this girl work for?

152
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:35,898
She works for our ''betters.''
Seems that's what we're meant to know.

153
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,236
Always a waiting game.

154
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,213
- What?
- lt's a waiting game.

155
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,051
Would you not do that, please?

156
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,187
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

157
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,629
There they are.

158
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,646
- You have the list?
- Yes, l have it.

159
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,483
Give it to me.

160
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,290
Money?

161
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,490
You follow my lead.
Just make sure you watch my back.

162
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:23,567
Don't make any sudden moves.

163
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,940
Just because we're buying guns
doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

164
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:29,809
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

165
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,618
Want to back him up?

166
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,684
What would l profit
from your death?

167
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,225
- You'd have the money.
- l have the money already.

168
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,696
l'll watch the back.

169
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,070
Have you got it all?

170
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:01,638
- You're sure?
- Of course. Come and see.

171
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,752
There it is.

172
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:34,406
lt's not all here.

173
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,674
What?

174
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,353
lt's not all here.

175
00:20:55,666 --> 00:21:00,126
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

176
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:05,335
lf he agrees, we have no problem.
Here, take the car keys.

177
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,503
Go on. Take them.

178
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,173
There you are. No problem.

179
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:14,216
Come along. Come on.

180
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,554
Give me some money.

181
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:34,666
- You aren't going in there?
- Yeah, l'm going in there. So are you.

182
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:38,566
- Why am l going in there?
- To protect me.

183
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:41,668
There is no protection there.

184
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,942
lf it's a come-on, we're fish in
a barrel. Why do they want you in there?

185
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,483
- What are you, crazy?
- You think too hard.

186
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:51,253
Nobody ever told me that before,
but l wouldn't go in there.

187
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,451
- What is it?
- l don't like it. Look at it.

188
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,491
Let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

189
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:04,859
Don't go in.

190
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:09,031
l'm getting paid to go.
lt's that simple.

191
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,368
Let's go.

192
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:13,899
lf anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

193
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:16,343
lf there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

194
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,142
- Let's go.
- All right.

195
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,191
Stop!

196
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,195
Stay where you are.

197
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,904
So, everything's fine.

198
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,884
l can't see!

199
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,842
Have some of this!

200
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,075
Fuckin' arsehole!

201
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,851
Fuckin' have some more, bastards!

202
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,488
Come on!

203
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,198
- Let's go!
- You goddamn--

204
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,667
Come on! Let's go!

205
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,607
- Anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

206
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:18,517
Wow. Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

207
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,354
A bit of raspberry jam back there.

208
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:28,022
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

209
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,795
That's a fact.
That is a fact.

210
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,028
Slow down.

211
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:56,426
Slow down.

212
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,628
l think l have to stop.

213
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,457
Thank you.

214
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,937
Why did you take this job?

215
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,505
My friend, l need the money.

216
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,016
The money is here.

217
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,516
That's what this is, money.

218
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,459
But who are our employers?

219
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,001
You're right.

220
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,160
Excuse me.

221
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,063
Excuse me, monsieur.

222
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,211
The Russians are trying
to bid for the case.

223
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,340
The case is in Nice. They're trying
to sell it to the Russians.

224
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,720
They're staying
at the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

225
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,087
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

226
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,556
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

227
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,761
Excuse me.

228
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:16,128
l have the information.
We'll be moving very soon.

229
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:18,392
lt'll definitely be
in the nature of an ambush...

230
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:21,333
somewhere between here and here.

231
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:26,807
We'll anticipate a three-car convoy
with backup team.

232
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:30,675
Obviously we will try and stop
the target before they can get away.

233
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:32,610
- What's in the case?
- That isn't necessary.

234
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:36,845
ls it heavy, is it explosive, is it
chained to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

235
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:39,011
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

236
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:41,351
But l am not under any obligation
to let you know--

237
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:43,118
lf not,
the price has gotta go up.

238
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:46,219
l'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

239
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:49,627
lf it's gonna be amateur night,
l want $100,000. l want it up front.

240
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:54,465
l want it in a bank account. l want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

241
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,935
We've got shooters here,
shooters here.

242
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,808
l'll tell you an old trick.

243
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:50,183
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

244
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:54,918
Draw it again. You're the ace field man.
Draw it again.

245
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,659
lt's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

246
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,633
Draw it again!

247
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:09,842
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

248
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:12,038
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

249
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:14,138
Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?

250
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,944
- ln the regiment.
- What regiment was that?

251
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,609
The 22nd Special Air Service.

252
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,119
What's the color
of the boathouse at Hereford?

253
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:24,892
- l don't like your attitude.
- What's the color of the boathouse--

254
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,223
- Fuck off!
- What's-- You got the gun.

255
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:29,456
l'm unarmed. Do something.
Go ahead. Do something.

256
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,341
Tell me about an ambush.

257
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:48,075
l ambushed you
with a cup of coffee.

258
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,146
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

259
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:56,281
The others too.

260
00:29:56,357 --> 00:30:00,487
That is what l understood.
We've gotten the word. We're movin'.

261
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,764
Put this near the front.

262
00:30:10,972 --> 00:30:14,669
Careful.
Careful with that.

263
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:28,247
So what color
is the boathouse at Hereford?

264
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:31,556
How should l know?

265
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,916
This'll complete your compensation.

266
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:02,322
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

267
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:05,886
Do l need to suggest
you forget us?

268
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,262
Because we will not.

269
00:32:15,797 --> 00:32:17,287
Morning.

270
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:19,595
l see you're reviewin' our problem.

271
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:24,104
You're part of the problem, part of
the solution or part of the landscape.

272
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:27,232
- lndeed.
- What's in the case?

273
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:30,643
Something we're payin' ya for.

274
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:49,890
- You and the girl are in front.
- The name's Dierdre.

275
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,963
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

276
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,366
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

277
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:58,769
He activates his cell phone. How do
you know he's gonna use his cell phone?

278
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,468
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

279
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:02,873
l'm gonna call him on it.

280
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:06,539
- How do you know he'll have it?
- He's waitin' for a call?

281
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:10,948
The people he's doin' business with
will call him to arrange a meeting.

282
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:16,622
The villa. The hotel. The car.
The stoplight. Eight to ten guys.

283
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:18,386
How good is security?

284
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:21,519
- l can't tell you.
- Let's find out. Where are they?

285
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,291
The last report,
they were at the hotel.

286
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,559
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

287
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:28,431
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

288
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:30,869
- lt's tempting.
- lt's a good plan.

289
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:33,133
Let's stick to the plan.
Everybody wants to go to the party.

290
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:35,732
- Nobody wants to stay and clean up.
- Please.

291
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,940
The only thing is that the map--
the map is not the territory.

292
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,047
Let's look at the ground. Bring some
money. We're gonna do a little shopping.

293
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,787
Loosen up.

294
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:01,100
You're my wife.
Be who you want to look like.

295
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:04,468
lt's just a game.
Just a game.

296
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,099
Man and a woman goin' for a walk
and all that entails.

297
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:10,838
Piece of cake. Relax.
Relax, darling.

298
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:15,044
You look good cleaned up.

299
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:20,621
That the hotel?

300
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,105
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

301
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:44,039
So why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

302
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:46,546
Fun and games,
pretty girls and beer?

303
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,663
Can l help you, sir?

304
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,323
We're just looking
at the menu.

305
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,603
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

306
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:48,607
A little.

307
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:51,611
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife? lt's very easy.

308
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,874
- You press like that. Very easy.
- Sure.

309
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:57,349
Like that. That's it.
Focus like that.

310
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:02,956
We're gonna do it over here.

311
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,286
See.

312
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,055
- Could you get that palm tree in?
- Yeah.

313
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,528
We wanna show
we're on the Riviera.

314
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,224
Bye now.

315
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,530
- How many do you want?
- Just snap away.

316
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:18,335
Very--

317
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:19,600
Again.

318
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,643
Get the background.

319
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:27,779
Take a couple of my wife.
Just take a couple of my wife alone.

320
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:40,120
Take my luggage up
right away.

321
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,931
Thank you.

322
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,460
Can we take one picture of you
with my wife? One picture with you?

323
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,333
That's it.

324
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:01,806
So?

325
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:04,918
They're good.

326
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,853
A guy goes for the case, the other guy's
protectin' the principal.

327
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:09,514
Nobody panics.
They're good.

328
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,558
So what have we learned?

329
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:13,753
- Can it be done?
- lt can be done.

330
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:15,728
We should have two more men.

331
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:18,560
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

332
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,601
- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

333
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,693
There's no handler.
There's only me.

334
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,035
You want this thing, you want the case,
we're gonna need some more men.

335
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:29,338
There's no more help.
There's no more men. Are you afraid?

336
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,810
'Course l'm afraid. You think
l'm reluctant because l'm happy?

337
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:35,212
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

338
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:42,088
What do we do?

339
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:45,552
We wait.

340
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:49,178
So who are they?

341
00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:51,018
Our employers.

342
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,996
lt's me.

343
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:01,198
They've gone back
to the villa.

344
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,531
- Did they have the case with them?
- They did.

345
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,093
- Did you get the other cars?
- Got 'em.

346
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,469
- And how do they run?
- They'll do fine.

347
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,215
What does that mean?

348
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:22,379
lt would be nice to do something.

349
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:25,322
We are doing something.
We're sitting here waiting.

350
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,532
lt's not gonna happen today.

351
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:38,969
The buyers are out of town.

352
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,131
Tomorrow at the earliest.

353
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:47,944
The hell with it.
Let's go put 'em to bed.

354
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:50,505
- We've got the report.
- l take the report if that's all.

355
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:53,984
l can go and see for myself.
They at the villa?

356
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:57,580
l'm gonna take one last run over
the route and tuck 'em in.

357
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:06,231
l'll come with ya.

358
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,068
So how'd you get started
in this business?

359
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:48,301
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

360
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,506
Same with me. How 'bout that?

361
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:57,280
Take out the map.
lf anybody looks, we're--

362
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:15,466
So who are those guys inside?

363
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,469
You tell me.

364
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,899
Ex military, Northern,
Sov Block, somebody or other.

365
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:25,843
They need a job.
That's my excuse.

366
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:27,311
ls it?

367
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,715
Cops.

368
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,584
System activated.

369
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:18,263
System check.

370
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:24,502
Repeat system check.

371
00:41:29,943 --> 00:41:33,174
There he is. He's being good.
He's activated his phone.

372
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:55,432
l'm in position.

373
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:33,929
They're passin' me now.

374
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,474
Target is on the way.

375
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,179
Hell of a time to be workin'.

376
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:23,779
What do you want for Christmas?

377
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:26,120
My two front teeth.

378
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:28,285
May your wish be granted.

379
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,194
Target is 400 meters
from the traffic light.

380
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:09,153
Come on! Come on!

381
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,725
So far, so good.
Target on the right road.

382
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,799
Escort car...

383
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,569
four tenths of a click
in front of you.

384
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:45,802
Got it.

385
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,435
You should see them in four seconds.

386
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,272
Two cars.

387
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,671
l got 'em.

388
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,551
Target has escaped.
l repeat: Target has gotten away.

389
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,469
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

390
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,470
Through the market,
then straight.

391
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,780
Right at the fork, Marechal fork.

392
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,688
Okay, you're in front of him.

393
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,167
You can cut him off
at the end of the port.

394
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,068
Roger that. l got it.

395
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,000
He's coming from the right.

396
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,140
He's yours.

397
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,468
- l'm hit! Take the case!
- Up the other way!

398
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,873
Get the fuckin' case!

399
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:48,537
- Get the car. We'll meet you up there.
- Take it.

400
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,806
All right.

401
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,440
Get out of here!
We'll see you at the safe house!

402
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,319
Give me the case!

403
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,566
Where's Gregor?

404
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,574
Gregor fucked us.

405
00:52:41,747 --> 00:52:44,341
- How is it down there?
- A lot of heat. How you feeling?

406
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:47,249
Okay. Thanks for before.

407
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,911
Don't mention it.

408
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:52,990
Could you clean
the paint off this?

409
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:55,120
Got a pack of Camels?

410
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:56,991
No, you smoke too much.

411
00:53:11,844 --> 00:53:13,778
We must get out of here.

412
00:53:15,014 --> 00:53:17,505
l'm gonna need your people
to help us.

413
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,677
- And l need you to find the case.
- All right, call your guy.

414
00:53:20,753 --> 00:53:23,187
When we bring in the case,
he'll help you.

415
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:26,019
- How can l bring in the case?
- Gregor has it.

416
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,524
- Why?
- l presume to sell it to the Russians.

417
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:33,064
Why the Russians?
Why not you?

418
00:53:33,132 --> 00:53:37,193
lf we had money to buy it, we wouldn't
have hired you to steal it, would we?

419
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:38,998
Go to your people.
Talk to them.

420
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:41,972
You want the case?
We find Gregor, we find the case.

421
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,474
How do we find Gregor?

422
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,136
How did you find him to hire him?

423
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:49,942
Through your friend the cripple who
gave me nothing but a bunch of lames!

424
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:52,950
- You, Spence and the sorry lot of you!
- Hey, hey.

425
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:56,210
We can find him
through his cell phone.

426
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:02,292
Can we trace his cell phone?

427
00:54:05,364 --> 00:54:09,061
They can triangulate it,
if we had that equipment.

428
00:54:09,134 --> 00:54:10,260
Who has that equipment?

429
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:14,566
Who has that equipment?

430
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:19,505
Tell me.

431
00:54:21,113 --> 00:54:22,740
Who has it?

432
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:28,047
All right. Give me the number
to his phone.

433
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:12,758
How does the day find you?

434
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:16,858
How do they say in French--
en plein forme?

435
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:32,981
This was supposed to be
a social occasion?

436
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:36,680
- Life is uncertain.
- lt is indeed.

437
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:39,815
But, Gregor, we have
so much history together...

438
00:55:39,892 --> 00:55:42,520
l was sure you wouldn't mind.

439
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:46,223
- Besides, the world these days is so--
- Unsafe?

440
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:48,526
Exactly.

441
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:52,130
l'll show you how unsafe it is.

442
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:17,152
See that little girl down there?

443
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:26,628
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you do that?

444
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:28,570
To make a point.

445
00:56:31,777 --> 00:56:35,543
l don't know her, but l was ready
to splatter her brains all over.

446
00:56:35,614 --> 00:56:39,414
But you,
l don't particularly like you.

447
00:56:39,484 --> 00:56:43,215
Just imagine what l'll do to you if you
try anything. Now give me my money.

448
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:01,305
Put down the gun.

449
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:10,539
- l never liked you either, Gregor.
- Where did that come from?

450
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:15,448
l should have made you strip.

451
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,216
- Now where's my package?
- Right behind you.

452
00:57:50,355 --> 00:57:52,550
Clever girl.

453
00:57:52,624 --> 00:57:55,889
- You liked it?
- My little sun.

454
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:00,424
You make me so happy.

455
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:02,091
My sweet love.

456
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:05,628
Excuse me.

457
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:10,402
ls it done?

458
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:13,909
lt's done, Mikhi.

459
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,510
Gregor? ls that you, Gregor?

460
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:22,553
Much to your disappointment.

461
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:26,483
lt was a mistake.
lt should not have happened.

462
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:29,721
lf it happens again,
l'll sell it to the lrish.

463
00:58:29,795 --> 00:58:32,696
- Don't do that.
- Then don't make me.

464
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:35,096
My price just went up 300%.

465
00:58:37,202 --> 00:58:41,036
l want the package.
What do l have to do to get it?

466
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:45,737
Just wait for my next phone call. l'll
find a place where l have the advantage.

467
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:32,382
Excuse me. Excuse me.

468
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,044
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

469
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,848
Do l know you?

470
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:40,948
l'm sorry. Do l know you,
'cause how did you know l speak English?

471
00:59:41,025 --> 00:59:43,789
You got an English newspaper.

472
00:59:43,861 --> 00:59:46,694
Sorry. l'm sorry.
l beg your pardon.

473
00:59:46,764 --> 00:59:48,391
lt's all right.

474
00:59:48,466 --> 00:59:50,559
What do you need a post office for?

475
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:53,304
- Over here, they use them differently.
- l need your help.

476
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:54,066
- Over here, they use them differently.
- l need your help.

477
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,667
- l thought you left.
- l did leave.

478
00:59:57,742 --> 00:59:59,937
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

479
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:02,445
Can you help me? l need your help.

480
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:06,007
What's the number?

481
01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:13,589
The post office is
down to your left.

482
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:15,455
Up on the left? Thanks.

483
01:00:23,568 --> 01:00:27,265
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

484
01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:30,839
Everyone's your brother
until the rent's due.

485
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:32,341
Ain't that the truth?

486
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,378
On the terrace?

487
01:00:35,446 --> 01:00:37,209
Facing me?
l see him.

488
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:39,715
Yes, l'll get him.
Hang on, please.

489
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:46,214
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Sam?

490
01:00:49,594 --> 01:00:51,528
A phone call for you.

491
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:02,230
Good to see you too.

492
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:05,070
lf his position changes,
l'll let you know.

493
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:13,774
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

494
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:32,318
He's at the Arena.

495
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:07,689
This is the amphithιβtre of Arles...

496
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:11,929
which was built at the end
of the first century A.D.

497
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:14,369
lt was built with limestone.

498
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:23,074
l know those men.

499
01:03:56,681 --> 01:04:01,209
You can see the dominant yellow color
which is caused by a lantern.

500
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:03,913
We're not sure the walls
were actually yellow.

501
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:08,618
So now, we will continue and visit
the Roman baths down this way.

502
01:04:27,878 --> 01:04:30,574
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

503
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,384
lt's Sergei. l remember you.

504
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:37,211
Yes, Gregor, it's me.

505
01:04:37,288 --> 01:04:39,688
- How have you been?
- Well.

506
01:04:39,757 --> 01:04:44,353
These are trying times. l'm sorry
about the unfortunate incident.

507
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:47,920
lt was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

508
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,767
l couldn't agree with you more.

509
01:04:50,835 --> 01:04:53,167
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

510
01:04:54,705 --> 01:04:57,538
He's turned rogue
and can't be controlled?

511
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:15,120
l don't--

512
01:05:15,192 --> 01:05:18,161
Oh, English. Sorry.
Such a fool.

513
01:05:18,229 --> 01:05:20,459
l was looking
for van Gogh's old house.

514
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:24,865
What could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere...

515
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:27,199
is now fucked into a cocked hat.

516
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:29,136
What do you think?

517
01:05:29,206 --> 01:05:31,231
l'll think we'll meet your price.

518
01:05:34,745 --> 01:05:38,545
So let's see it now.
Where do you have it, in your belt?

519
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:41,312
- Let's see it.
- Show me the case first.

520
01:05:43,554 --> 01:05:48,753
You're great in the locker room, but
you're weak when you put your spikes on.

521
01:05:51,128 --> 01:05:53,995
- Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

522
01:05:54,065 --> 01:05:57,159
But l think you're in
a wee spot of trouble.

523
01:05:58,135 --> 01:06:00,194
Where is it? Where is it?

524
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:02,205
- l don't have it with me.
- Where?

525
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,741
l mailed it to myself.
Post office box in Paris.

526
01:06:05,976 --> 01:06:08,171
Help! He's robbing me!

527
01:07:55,796 --> 01:07:57,024
Stop.

528
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:03,468
- Where do l know you from?
- Vienna.

529
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,937
Of course.

530
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:07,701
- Sorry to have to do this.
- Hey!

531
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,384
- Christ.
- Drive.

532
01:08:50,284 --> 01:08:52,752
Stop! Piss off.

533
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:16,876
l'm gonna have to
take care of this.

534
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:20,506
What do you want to do?

535
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:23,778
Get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

536
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:25,944
l'll just boost what l need.

537
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:33,785
- Could you do that?
- Of course. l can do better.

538
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,754
- How is it?
- l'm leaking.

539
01:09:40,568 --> 01:09:41,830
l'm sorry.

540
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,401
That girl sold us out.

541
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:54,881
She sold us out.

542
01:10:47,735 --> 01:10:50,431
- ls everything ready, Jean-Pierre?
- Yes, everything.

543
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,783
Get my legs.

544
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:13,451
Careful.

545
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,565
Sure you can do this?

546
01:11:25,639 --> 01:11:29,268
Yeah. l once removed a guy's
appendix with a grapefruit spoon.

547
01:11:29,343 --> 01:11:32,710
- Have a drink.
- No booze.

548
01:11:38,285 --> 01:11:40,048
Easy, easy, easy.

549
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:52,894
Yeah. lt's just below the surface.

550
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,862
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

551
01:12:01,742 --> 01:12:06,076
Take the gauze and wipe away the blood.
Keep it clean so l can see it.

552
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:24,190
What we're gonna do is routine.
l've done this many times before.

553
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:27,256
There are no vital organs or arteries.
lt's okay. You won't kill me.

554
01:12:27,334 --> 01:12:30,792
Just make sure you get the bullet
before you pry it out.

555
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:32,805
Take that scalpel.

556
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:38,936
The upper part.

557
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,941
Over here. Just cut up there.

558
01:12:43,016 --> 01:12:44,950
Just a little cut.

559
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,589
Got it.

560
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:01,362
Now take the clamp.

561
01:13:01,435 --> 01:13:04,529
Take the clamp
and open up the hole.

562
01:13:04,605 --> 01:13:08,041
Just put it in there.

563
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:09,871
Put it in there.

564
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:12,275
That's it. Put it in.

565
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,280
Now open it up. Spread it.

566
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,876
Now get the other clamps
and get the bullet.

567
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:22,114
Don't take it out
unless you really got it.

568
01:13:40,507 --> 01:13:43,874
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try with--

569
01:13:55,622 --> 01:13:59,490
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

570
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,992
Put the gauze there.

571
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,405
Fucker sprayed his bullet
with Teflon.

572
01:14:20,814 --> 01:14:24,614
He was trying to stamp me.
Paid in full.

573
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:27,620
ls that why it went
through the vest?

574
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:30,781
Can you stitch me up
on your own?

575
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:37,163
lf you don't mind,
l'm gonna pass out.

576
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:29,255
You gonna kill me?

577
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:30,797
No.

578
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,459
l'm not gonna kill you.

579
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,992
Why would l want to kill you?

580
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:24,817
- l gave you a job.
- l did my job.

581
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:29,689
- So how'd it go wrong?
- l thought you wanted the case.

582
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:33,818
Oh, we'll get the case. Huh?

583
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:36,294
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

584
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:40,293
Don't you worry about the case.

585
01:16:42,536 --> 01:16:44,163
l want an explanation.

586
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,002
An explanation? For what?

587
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:51,208
- You bollixed it up.
- l did?

588
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:54,213
- You hired him.
- Through your fucking contact!

589
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:03,918
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

590
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:05,925
Larry, is it?

591
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:08,955
l was clearing up your mess.

592
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:11,964
My mess? Well, you take over then.

593
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:14,000
- Huh?
- But you can't, can you?

594
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:18,801
lt's you that's hiding, isn't it,
Seamus? You can't show your face.

595
01:17:21,241 --> 01:17:22,538
Who else thinks that?

596
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:24,907
Who you been talking to?

597
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:27,243
That's why l'm doing this job.

598
01:17:30,884 --> 01:17:33,785
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

599
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:35,617
Do your job.

600
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:51,764
He's tough, your Yank.

601
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:55,203
You're right about that.

602
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,806
But who is he?

603
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:01,939
That's not important.

604
01:18:03,484 --> 01:18:05,645
Didn't he work for the ClA?

605
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:07,550
He used to.

606
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:10,748
Not anymore?

607
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,024
He's on the run.

608
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:17,060
You're sure?

609
01:18:18,732 --> 01:18:21,428
l know what he can do.
l've seen him.

610
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:25,336
Why would he carve himself up
if he were still ClA?

611
01:18:25,406 --> 01:18:27,397
He makes a phone call,
and it's taken care of.

612
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:39,945
And you?
How have you been?

613
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,295
We need some information.

614
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:54,198
We need to find
some people in Paris.

615
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:55,758
Who?

616
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:58,737
An lrish man and woman...

617
01:18:58,806 --> 01:19:00,933
and a German, ex-KGB.

618
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:02,771
They're professionals.

619
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,435
And they're in hiding.

620
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:08,105
This is really important to you?

621
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:12,846
He saved my life.

622
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:21,553
l'll find them for you.

623
01:19:40,314 --> 01:19:42,009
Where's the case?

624
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,554
lt'll come tomorrow,
l'm sure.

625
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,186
l'm sure it will too. Let's go.

626
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,660
Let's hope so,
for your sake anyway.

627
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:29,443
Are you feeling better?

628
01:20:29,518 --> 01:20:31,713
Yeah, enough to move around.
Thanks.

629
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:43,389
My hobby.

630
01:20:44,499 --> 01:20:46,091
One grows old.

631
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:52,197
A lot of friends of mine
just wanted to live to open a bar.

632
01:20:52,274 --> 01:20:54,742
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

633
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:59,811
Then they were spared
their disillusion.

634
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:01,075
That's right.

635
01:21:03,218 --> 01:21:05,277
Who were they,
friends of yours?

636
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:11,251
- l wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

637
01:21:13,428 --> 01:21:15,089
That's right.

638
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:22,959
Well, who are you?

639
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:28,100
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

640
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:32,272
At the end of the day, we're likely to
be punished for our kindnesses.

641
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:35,411
Don't worry about me.
l won't hurt you.

642
01:22:03,345 --> 01:22:05,643
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

643
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:12,945
Forty-seven samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

644
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:16,821
They became ronin,
masterless samurai...

645
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:19,486
disgraced by
another man's treachery.

646
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:23,326
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves...

647
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:26,026
mercenaries, even madmen.

648
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:28,365
That l didn't have time to do.

649
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:33,033
Then they snuck into the castle
of their lord's betrayer and killed him.

650
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:37,010
Nice. l like that.
My kind of job.

651
01:22:37,913 --> 01:22:39,505
There's something more.

652
01:22:40,649 --> 01:22:44,881
All 47 of them
committed seppuku...

653
01:22:44,953 --> 01:22:47,786
ritual suicide in the courtyard
of the castle.

654
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:51,017
Well, that l don't like so much.

655
01:22:51,093 --> 01:22:52,651
But you understand it?

656
01:22:52,728 --> 01:22:54,423
What do you mean?

657
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:58,728
The warrior code--

658
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,166
The delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

659
01:23:02,337 --> 01:23:05,170
But also something more.

660
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:10,143
You understand there is something
outside yourself that has to be served.

661
01:23:10,212 --> 01:23:12,680
And when that need is gone...

662
01:23:12,748 --> 01:23:16,206
when belief has died,
what are you?

663
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:18,343
A man without a master.

664
01:23:19,354 --> 01:23:21,288
Right now l'm a man
without a paycheck.

665
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:25,190
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

666
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,490
They could have fought
for themselves.

667
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:30,531
But they chose honor.
They chose myth.

668
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,192
They chose wrong.

669
01:23:41,276 --> 01:23:43,870
Seppu-- what?

670
01:23:43,945 --> 01:23:45,970
Seppuku.

671
01:23:46,047 --> 01:23:48,345
Disembowelment.

672
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:50,782
The sword goes in here.

673
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:05,593
- You sure this address is good?
- Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

674
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:41,432
Under the bridge by the river...

675
01:24:42,604 --> 01:24:44,868
how did you know
it was an ambush?

676
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:49,900
When there is any doubt, there is
no doubt. First thing they teach you.

677
01:24:53,582 --> 01:24:55,516
Who taught you?

678
01:24:56,585 --> 01:24:59,645
l don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

679
01:25:04,693 --> 01:25:07,127
All good things come
to those who wait.

680
01:25:37,893 --> 01:25:41,522
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

681
01:26:06,688 --> 01:26:08,280
How you doing?

682
01:26:14,996 --> 01:26:17,829
What are you?
What are you gonna do to me?

683
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:21,801
Let's just be calm
for one more moment.

684
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,235
One more moment.

685
01:26:35,784 --> 01:26:38,048
Why? Why?

686
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:40,226
Oh, you know why.

687
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:42,418
No. You don't want to do that.

688
01:26:46,031 --> 01:26:47,259
You can't.

689
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:54,333
Get back!

690
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:56,375
Get in the fucking car!

691
01:27:06,318 --> 01:27:07,910
Why didn't you shoot her?

692
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:02,700
- Take the tunnel now!
- Oh, Christ!

693
01:31:16,735 --> 01:31:18,168
Come on!

694
01:31:43,262 --> 01:31:45,253
That fuck.

695
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,234
Where could he be?

696
01:35:19,173 --> 01:35:22,267
The lrish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

697
01:35:22,343 --> 01:35:26,211
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

698
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:29,807
Gregor ain't coming in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

699
01:35:29,884 --> 01:35:32,079
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him.

700
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:37,516
He's got to work it out soon
before the lrish find him.

701
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,727
Where does he go?

702
01:35:42,763 --> 01:35:44,390
You go to what you know.

703
01:35:47,802 --> 01:35:51,795
He's KGB. He goes to
one of his old safe houses.

704
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,902
No, they're all blown.

705
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,439
Where does he go?

706
01:36:05,419 --> 01:36:07,580
You're on the run.
Where do you go?

707
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:15,558
Where has he been?

708
01:36:29,877 --> 01:36:32,004
He made the fake case.

709
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:34,604
He had the fake case made.

710
01:36:34,682 --> 01:36:36,582
Gregor.

711
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:40,177
He had it made.
He had to have had it made.

712
01:36:42,656 --> 01:36:45,853
ln Paris, before we went to Nice.

713
01:36:45,926 --> 01:36:47,757
He didn't have time
to have it made.

714
01:36:47,828 --> 01:36:49,989
He bought something like it
and painted it.

715
01:36:50,064 --> 01:36:52,760
Where did he get the paint?
He never left.

716
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:54,801
Where did he get the case?

717
01:37:28,035 --> 01:37:29,900
lt's a case for ice skates.

718
01:37:33,307 --> 01:37:34,899
Why ice skates?

719
01:37:37,478 --> 01:37:39,673
And why would Gregor
know an ice skate case?

720
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:44,114
He didn't have time
to have it made.

721
01:37:44,184 --> 01:37:47,676
He didn't have time
to have the fake case made.

722
01:37:47,755 --> 01:37:49,086
The Russians made it.

723
01:37:52,092 --> 01:37:53,650
The Russians made it.

724
01:37:57,097 --> 01:37:58,689
We're following the wrong people.

725
01:37:58,766 --> 01:38:01,530
We don't have to find Gregor.

726
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:04,594
lf we find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

727
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:07,436
You've lived in Paris a long time.
You know the people.

728
01:38:07,508 --> 01:38:08,839
l get around.

729
01:38:08,909 --> 01:38:11,810
You meet the new Russians.

730
01:38:11,879 --> 01:38:16,282
You know how it is.
Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.

731
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:19,376
Under diplomatic cover.

732
01:38:19,453 --> 01:38:21,114
KGB?

733
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:22,485
Ex-KGB.

734
01:38:22,556 --> 01:38:26,959
Heavy hitters. Gamblers.
Lots of money. Big cars.

735
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:30,292
They live like Tsars,
throw money away.

736
01:38:30,364 --> 01:38:31,831
Fur hats are expensive.

737
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:32,866
And bodyguards.

738
01:38:32,933 --> 01:38:35,493
Expensive coats. Dr. Zhivago.

739
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:39,665
l have a lot of work. No time.

740
01:38:41,275 --> 01:38:43,334
l understand.

741
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:46,842
All right. Let's go.

742
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:57,387
lt's going to be fine.

743
01:38:58,559 --> 01:39:00,493
The guy is gonna reach out.

744
01:39:00,561 --> 01:39:02,392
ls he any good?

745
01:39:02,463 --> 01:39:05,864
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris--

746
01:39:17,277 --> 01:39:20,041
lf l wanted to find Russians
in Paris this week...

747
01:39:21,115 --> 01:39:23,276
l would go to the ice show.

748
01:40:53,807 --> 01:40:56,071
l'll trade you a favor
for a cigarette.

749
01:40:57,578 --> 01:40:59,842
The favor is,
steer clear of those guys.

750
01:40:59,913 --> 01:41:01,073
The Russians?

751
01:41:07,521 --> 01:41:09,751
They sure throw money
around here.

752
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:30,738
The Russian is seeing this Natacha
Kirilova, the star of the ice show.

753
01:41:30,811 --> 01:41:33,974
He spends every evening
in the audience.

754
01:41:35,282 --> 01:41:39,048
- How'd you find that out?
- We went to high school together.

755
01:42:15,058 --> 01:42:17,583
Mikhi, is everything
all right?

756
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,389
Everything is fine.

757
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:21,662
Sweet girl.

758
01:42:23,733 --> 01:42:25,724
Go. Go on.

759
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,783
Ladies and gentlemen...

760
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:49,188
we are very proud to present...

761
01:42:49,258 --> 01:42:52,750
two-time Olympic champion...

762
01:42:52,829 --> 01:42:55,855
and three-time world champion...

763
01:42:55,932 --> 01:42:58,867
Natacha Kirilova!

764
01:45:06,496 --> 01:45:08,054
Let's go.

765
01:45:21,677 --> 01:45:23,372
Wait out here.

766
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:30,143
Yes, he is.

767
01:45:31,754 --> 01:45:33,016
Hello, Mikhi.

768
01:45:33,089 --> 01:45:35,523
The meeting is not
until later tonight.

769
01:45:35,591 --> 01:45:37,115
The meeting's now.

770
01:45:40,429 --> 01:45:41,987
You have the money?

771
01:45:43,432 --> 01:45:46,993
Well, you know, we were going back
to get it before the meet.

772
01:45:47,069 --> 01:45:48,468
l don't think so.

773
01:45:50,406 --> 01:45:51,930
You have the money?

774
01:45:56,312 --> 01:45:59,281
l might have the money.
Where is the case?

775
01:46:00,349 --> 01:46:04,012
No, you have to do it.
l couldn't live with myself.

776
01:46:16,899 --> 01:46:18,526
l have the money.

777
01:46:18,601 --> 01:46:21,229
We conclude this now
and part friends.

778
01:46:25,775 --> 01:46:27,037
Where is the case?

779
01:46:39,722 --> 01:46:41,383
l'd like to be paid now.

780
01:46:47,063 --> 01:46:49,190
No doubt.

781
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:55,833
Now tell me the other part.

782
01:46:57,273 --> 01:46:59,207
The other part?

783
01:46:59,275 --> 01:47:01,243
l'm leaving.

784
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:03,676
l'm taking my fee
and l'm leaving.

785
01:47:05,915 --> 01:47:09,214
l have a person with a rifle
in the stadium.

786
01:47:09,285 --> 01:47:12,118
l've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

787
01:47:13,155 --> 01:47:15,089
l will call.

788
01:47:15,157 --> 01:47:17,682
l have to call within
45 seconds...

789
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,751
to say that l'm leaving.

790
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:23,196
And then in another ten minutes
to say l'm safe.

791
01:47:24,934 --> 01:47:28,301
Should l be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

792
01:47:39,048 --> 01:47:40,481
Thirty seconds.

793
01:47:41,717 --> 01:47:43,241
We have to see
somebody inside.

794
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:44,946
You can't pass
without badges.

795
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,585
Twenty seconds.

796
01:48:03,973 --> 01:48:05,235
Ten seconds.

797
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:38,907
There were two of them.
They were looking for those guys.

798
01:48:38,975 --> 01:48:41,375
Just a minute, sir.

799
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,691
l am a Chilean citizen,
as you can see from my passport.

800
01:49:43,797 --> 01:49:45,059
Maman!

801
01:50:08,855 --> 01:50:09,879
Stay with him.

802
01:50:42,723 --> 01:50:45,283
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

803
01:50:46,193 --> 01:50:48,252
Get out. Walk away. Walk away!

804
01:50:49,996 --> 01:50:51,156
Go.

805
01:50:52,132 --> 01:50:54,123
- l will if you will.
- Just go.

806
01:50:54,201 --> 01:50:56,692
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

807
01:51:01,074 --> 01:51:03,634
l didn't come for the case.
l came for your boss.

808
01:51:05,412 --> 01:51:08,040
l came for Seamus.
l came for him.

809
01:51:09,416 --> 01:51:10,940
Just get out of here.

810
01:51:11,017 --> 01:51:14,350
l never left. Don't you see?

811
01:51:16,857 --> 01:51:19,724
Get out of the way!
Get out of--

812
01:51:26,366 --> 01:51:27,697
Get out of the way!

813
01:51:27,768 --> 01:51:30,464
You can't pass this way.
lt's blocked.

814
01:51:56,163 --> 01:51:58,825
l can take you in
or leave you here.

815
01:52:00,233 --> 01:52:01,825
That's him with the case.

816
01:52:01,902 --> 01:52:04,598
- Sir, over here, please.
- Wait, wait.

817
01:52:12,245 --> 01:52:15,271
There are more back there!

818
01:52:52,519 --> 01:52:55,249
All right. Stay where you are!
Don't move.

819
01:52:55,322 --> 01:52:58,382
Shut your fuckin' mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

820
01:53:12,672 --> 01:53:14,333
You stupid shite.

821
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:16,341
You're a dead man.

822
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:42,761
This is the BBC World Service.

823
01:53:42,836 --> 01:53:45,168
lt was announced today
after almost 30 years...

824
01:53:45,238 --> 01:53:49,004
of bloody and seemingly intractable
civil conflict in Northern lreland...

825
01:53:49,075 --> 01:53:50,804
that a peace agreement
has been reached between...

826
01:53:50,877 --> 01:53:54,472
the predominantly Protestant government
of that British-ruled enclave...

827
01:53:54,547 --> 01:53:56,071
and the lrish resistance--

828
01:54:01,721 --> 01:54:05,487
...have told CNN that it was the
apprehension and slaying in France...

829
01:54:05,558 --> 01:54:09,756
of the lrish terrorist Seamus O'Rourke
by parties still unknown...

830
01:54:09,829 --> 01:54:12,957
that contributed a stability,
largely allowing...

831
01:54:13,033 --> 01:54:16,730
the negotiations to proceed
to their historic conclusion today.

832
01:54:16,803 --> 01:54:18,361
O'Rourke had been denounced...

833
01:54:18,438 --> 01:54:21,202
by the lRA,
the military wing of Sinn Fein...

834
01:54:21,274 --> 01:54:24,505
as a rogue breakaway operative.

835
01:54:26,646 --> 01:54:30,138
Then, good knowin' ya.

836
01:54:43,296 --> 01:54:45,161
- l'm sorry?
- You said something.

837
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:48,723
l said she would not
be coming back here.

838
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:52,103
Yeah.

839
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,374
She would not
be coming back here, would she?

840
01:55:01,314 --> 01:55:03,714
l can't even put my hand
in my pocket to pay the bill.

841
01:55:04,751 --> 01:55:05,911
l'll get it.

842
01:55:09,422 --> 01:55:11,287
l'll get the next one.

843
01:55:17,097 --> 01:55:18,394
What was in the case?

844
01:55:19,733 --> 01:55:21,598
l don't remember.

845
01:55:22,302 --> 01:55:23,530
Lesson number two.

846
01:55:25,538 --> 01:55:27,472
Keep in touch.

847
01:55:46,826 --> 01:55:48,418
Let's go.

848
01:56:00,874 --> 01:56:03,809
No questions. No answers.

849
01:56:03,877 --> 01:56:06,137
That's the business we're in.

850
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:08,636
You accept it and move on.

851
01:56:09,707 --> 01:56:13,040
Maybe that's lesson number three.
