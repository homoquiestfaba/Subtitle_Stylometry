1
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:14,815
* You know it's a sin
to tell a lie

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:19,587
* Still you keep saying
I love you

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,757
* It may be true, I wish I knew

4
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:29,663
* But I'm giving
fair warning to you

5
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,366
(maniacal laughter)

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,704
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

7
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,909
(laughing gets louder)

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,679
* It's a sin to tell a lie

9
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:51,552
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

10
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,887
- (sobs) No!

11
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,159
* Just because these words
were spoken

12
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,060
- [Voiceover] Somebody help me!

13
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,295
Help!

14
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,234
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

15
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,301
- [Voiceover] Help!

16
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:11,572
* If you break my heart I'll die

17
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,212
* So be sure it's true
when you say I love you

18
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,452
- (sobs) Please don't kill me.

19
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,789
* It's a sin to have a lie
- Please don't kill me please!

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,463
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

21
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,702
* It's a sin to tell a lie

22
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:49,577
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,247
- Somebody help me!

24
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,151
* Just because these words
were spoken

25
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:01,489
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

26
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,128
* If you break my heart I'll die

27
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,600
(laughing)

28
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,937
* So be sure it's true
when you say I love you

29
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,943
- Help, help!

30
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,549
* It's a sin to tell a lie *
(screaming)

31
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,961
(blues music)

32
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:46,367
* Folks I'm going down
to St. James infirmary

33
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,704
* See, my baby there, she's
stretched out

34
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,976
* On a long white table

35
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,547
* She's so sweet, so cold,
so fair

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,615
(electrical charge)
(muffled screaming)

37
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,919
* Let her go, let her go,
God bless her

38
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,991
* Wherever she may be

39
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,729
* She will search this wide
world over

40
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:21,101
* But she'll never find
another sweet man like me

41
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,839
* Now when I die, bury me
in my straight-leg britches

42
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:30,444
* Put on a box-back coat and a
stetson hat

43
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,446
(electrical charge)
(muffled screaming)

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,849
* Put a $20 gold piece on my
watch chain

45
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:40,187
* So you can let all the
boys know I died standing pat

46
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:46,394
* Then give me six crap
shooting pall bearers

47
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,732
* Let a chorus girl
sing me a song

48
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:56,604
* Put a red hot jazz box
at the top of my head

49
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,273
* So we can raise
hallelujah as we go along

50
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,241
(screaming)

51
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:06,414
* Folks, now that you have heard
my story

52
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,751
* Say boy, hand me over
another shot of that booze

53
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,856
* If anyone should ask you

54
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,193
* Tell them I've got those
St. James Infirmary blues *

55
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,402
- If I can't find you...

56
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,448
Then I'll make you
come after me.

57
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,494
- Hey Cordova, Chief's
looking for you.

58
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,329
She doesn't look happy.

59
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,598
- When does she?

60
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,667
That woman needs
to get laid badly.

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,435
All that pent up aggression.

62
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,003
- Man, I wouldn't even
speak out loud

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,872
about this, she really
hates you.

64
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,174
- You know what all that
hate is, right?

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,776
Sexual tension.

66
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,244
(chuckling)

67
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,855
Chief, why the long face?

68
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,124
- The bastard did it now,
Cordova,

69
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,894
he killed a goddamn lawyer.

70
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,362
- She was a lawyer?

71
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,131
- A crooked lawyer, but
very well connected.

72
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,501
She was the commissioner's
niece.

73
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:34,668
- Shit.

74
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,236
- Yeah shit, and you have
once again

75
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,671
proven yourself to be completely

76
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,807
inept at handling the situation.

77
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,175
All these kills since
JC, and we're nowhere

78
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,012
closer to finding any leads.

79
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:45,979
- I'll get Brock on it.

80
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,515
- No, the hell you will!

81
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,517
I want Kate on it now!

82
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,820
Don't give me that look.

83
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,354
You know she's the best.

84
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,791
If anyone would want to nail
that bastard, it's Kate.

85
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:01,729
Besides, it's not like
you can handle it.

86
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,263
- Kate's damaged goods.

87
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,466
She went crazy after JC.

88
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,836
- Please, you've been gunning
for her position for months.

89
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,538
Big shot womanizer.

90
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,240
Cordova with a
woman Police Chief

91
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,275
and another as his
commanding officer.

92
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,479
(phone rings)

93
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,447
Yeah.

94
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,582
Crap, when?

95
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,052
All right, send Brock
and Amanda.

96
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,721
Kate is the lead on this.

97
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:31,692
I'll have Cordova meet you
all down there.

98
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,693
Damn it.

99
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,928
Another killing.

100
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:35,929
A hooker.

101
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,866
- The Laughing Mask?

102
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,501
- We don't know.

103
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,069
Go figure it out.

104
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,004
- On it.

105
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,544
Rethink this Kate business,
Chief.

106
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:54,281
She's nothing but a
liability in the field.

107
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,590
= Kate.

108
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,826
(country rock music)

109
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,813
- So did I rock your world
or what, babe?

110
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,814
- Or what.

111
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,316
- You know what we should do?

112
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,486
We should just take off
and fly to Tahiti.

113
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,355
Enjoy the scenery babe,
you know what I mean?

114
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,859
- No, no one knows
what you mean, Chuck.

115
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,261
- Chad, babe.

116
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,329
- Whatever.

117
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,335
- So how many orgasms
did Chad give you?

118
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,903
- None.

119
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,973
Did you just refer to
yourself in third person?

120
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,308
- I counted three, milady.

121
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,614
- Being jackrabbitted
for five minutes

122
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,916
hardly constitutes
as a good time.

123
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,287
- Babe, come on, I thought
we were having a great time.

124
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,989
- If you call me babe
one more time,

125
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,725
I swear to God I'm
gonna fucking shoot you.

126
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:16,129
- [Chad] Come on babe, Chad is
purely awesome in bed, babe.

127
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,731
- That's it!

128
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,700
- Oh no, babe, no no,
no no, I didn't mean

129
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,969
babe, I meant like a hot cougar.

130
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:22,803
- Cougar?!

131
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:23,671
- [Chad] Yeah!

132
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:24,672
- Get out!

133
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,340
- [Chad] I'm sorry.

134
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,179
(phone rings)

135
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,484
- Hello?

136
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:44,725
Should I consider this
the end of my vacation?

137
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,428
How am I possibly gonna
get to that crime scene?

138
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:52,766
(helicopter whirring)
(police radio chatter)

139
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,878
- [Brock] That's a shame
right there.

140
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,546
- Quite a tragedy.

141
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,182
- Now those are nice.

142
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,183
- Damn it!

143
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,552
- What's up, man?

144
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,255
- They're fake.

145
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,060
- Hold on, I could've
sworn those tits were real.

146
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,962
- Check for yourself.

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,752
- Checking for a pulse, Cordova?

148
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,920
(whistling "Hail to the Chief")

149
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,789
- Well well well.

150
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,691
Look who it is.

151
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,292
Was that really necessary?

152
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,695
- Is your red Porsche
really necessary?

153
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,396
- How was your vacation, Kate?

154
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,767
- Long, boring, just
wanna get back to work.

155
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,970
So what the hell happened here?

156
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
- Well Mr. John Green
over there,

157
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,439
one of those local hippies that

158
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,809
loves to recycle shit,
he found the

159
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,978
body around 1:30 PM.

160
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,946
We have no eyewitnesses
and there's

161
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,048
no security cameras.

162
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,717
- Who is she?

163
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,520
- She was dumped here
naked, no ID, no nothing.

164
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,189
We sent her pictures
and now we're

165
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,124
awaiting to hear back
the results.

166
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:24,958
(camera clicks)

167
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,060
- Cause of death?

168
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,461
- Asphyxiation.

169
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,131
No signs of a struggle.

170
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,734
Signs of sexual activity.

171
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,670
My best guess would
be auto-erotic
asphyxiation gone wrong.

172
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,972
- (laughs) You see,
that's my kind of girl.

173
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,641
She likes it rough.

174
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,311
- That is so incriminating
of you, Brock.

175
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,680
- Fuck you, Amanda.

176
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:50,617
- Ugh, come on Amanda,
help me flip the body.

177
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,689
- We got some ink.

178
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,190
- Whoa whoa whoa,
wait a minute here.

179
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,126
I've seen that tattoo before.

180
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,362
- You are just making yourself
the prime suspect today.

181
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,897
- Wait, where
have you seen that?

182
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,165
- It's Wink's brand.

183
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,000
He's known to tattoo his girls.

184
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,869
Brands them like they're cattle.

185
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,337
- Who's Wink?

186
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,839
- You've really been out of the

187
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,340
action for awhile Kate, huh?

188
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,775
Let me fill you in.

189
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,111
Wink is this lowlife
pimp, drug pushing piece

190
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,048
of shit and he's part
of The Rancors.

191
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,482
- What the hell's a Rancor?

192
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,217
- New crime syndicate,
just popped up

193
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,053
out of nowhere last few months.

194
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,989
Wink, well he runs
their prostitution ring.

195
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,223
- I mean what the hell have you

196
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,591
guys been doing since
I've been out?

197
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,126
Why didn't you bring him in?

198
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,562
- Well you see, he's
a slippery bastard.

199
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,165
This guy always has an alibi.

200
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,035
Nobody wants to testify, no one.

201
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,538
Anybody who tries,
they disappear.

202
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,140
- Where is he?

203
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,475
- He's known to hang out at this

204
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,677
strip club called The Barn.

205
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,345
- I'm gonna go find him.

206
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,547
- Are you sure you're
up for this, O'Malley?

207
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,016
First day back on the job,
maybe you

208
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,351
should take it easy, you know?

209
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,619
I can go check it out.

210
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,054
- (laughs) Sure, Cordo,
you just wanna

211
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,823
check out the girls, man.

212
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,557
- And your point?

213
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,559
- No, you guys finish up here.

214
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,660
I got this.

215
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,400
Stop looking at my ass, Cordova!

216
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,835
- Come on!

217
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,705
It's one of the few perks
from working with ya.

218
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,607
(phone rings)

219
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,608
- Crap.

220
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,611
Hey Lloyd, what's up?

221
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,713
- Did you forget
something, Kate?

222
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,249
- Oh fuck, Nancy,
is she all right?

223
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,251
- [Lloyd] She is now.

224
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,120
Forgetting to pick up
our daughter at school?

225
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,754
What the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,223
- I got racked up with this--

227
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,258
- Let me guess,
it was an emergency.

228
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,726
- There was a murder.

229
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,862
- [Lloyd] So you're
back at work?

230
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,964
Still, the body wasn't
going anywhere.

231
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,232
Listen, I know
you don't care about

232
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,234
how I feel, but Nancy's
your daughter.

233
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,102
- I don't need this
shit from you right now.

234
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,437
- You fucked up
our marriage because

235
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,239
of this stupid shit,
don't ruin your

236
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,541
relationship with her too.

237
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,444
- Let me talk to her.

238
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,948
- Nancy do you want to talk
to your mom?

239
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,618
She doesn't wanna talk
to you right now.

240
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,420
- All right, well
tell her I'm sorry.

241
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,289
I'll make it up to her.

242
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,658
- Don't make promises
you can't keep.

243
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:19,499
* What you want, what you want

244
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,537
* What you want, what you want

245
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,843
* What you want, what you want *

246
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,115
- Stupid disgusting bitch!

247
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,686
(sobbing)

248
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,288
The fuck you think
you're going, huh?

249
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,722
Trying to get pregnant on me?

250
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,191
You trying to run away?

251
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,725
- (sobs) I wasn't
trying to run away.

252
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,759
- Really?

253
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,101
I found your fucking
bags, you whore.

254
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,137
- (sobs) Please stop.

255
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,974
- And we found your
piece of shit boyfriend!

256
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,180
Bring that motherfucker
over here!

257
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,585
Right here, right here,
right in front of her.

258
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,404
This him?

259
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,839
Huh?

260
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,108
Is this your knight
in shining armor?

261
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,877
Is this your savior?

262
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:42,082
Look at me, you fucking
stupid bitch, look at me!

263
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,183
Look at him.

264
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,417
I want you to tell him.

265
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,885
I want you to tell him
you love him.

266
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:46,886
- No, no.

267
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,321
- Say it.

268
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,289
Say it!

269
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,926
- I love you.

270
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,167
Oh God, no no no no.

271
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,569
(gunshot)

272
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,404
No, no!

273
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,139
- [Voiceover] (laughs)
Yeah, man!

274
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,174
Yeah!

275
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,709
(sobbing)

276
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,544
Stupid nasty bitch.

277
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,147
- [Voiceover] This is the
shit I'm talking about.

278
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,783
(maniacal laughter)
(old blues music)

279
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,717
The fuck is that?

280
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,386
- [Voiceover] a laugh?.

281
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,888
- No fucking shit, Sherlock!

282
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,457
Go check it out!

283
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,562
Hurry up!

284
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,830
- All right, all right!

285
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:31,831
- [Voiceover] Check it.

286
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,300
- Nothing serious.

287
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,068
- [Voiceover] Man
don't be a pussy.

288
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,136
- Nobody's here--

289
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,970
(dramatic sting)

290
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,371
- What the fuck?!

291
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,707
- [Voiceover] What the fuck?!

292
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,575
Fuck was that?!

293
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:43,910
- It's blood, man!

294
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,145
- Go check it out!

295
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,513
- You have the gun!

296
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,117
- Motherfucker, you
better go check it out.

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,787
Move it!

298
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,458
- [Voiceover] Oh shit!

299
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,592
- Motherfucker!

300
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,928
(gunfire)

301
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,639
(bone cracks)

302
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,142
(screaming)

303
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,013
Son of a bitch!

304
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:20,980
(bone cracks)

305
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,749
(screaming)

306
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,484
* 'Cause he runs on the floor

307
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,785
* 500 or more

308
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,354
* And he says he will come

309
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,688
* With a horrible sound

310
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,823
* Like a hundred million drums

311
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,093
* A million one, he really had
to

312
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,795
* Yes that man will really
affect you

313
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,365
* What you say, he almost tried
to

314
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,234
* Say have a super oogie woogie

315
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,536
* Better get by, more that you
try

316
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,339
* He will soon have you
feeling his rhythm

317
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,641
* He makes you sing

318
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,044
* Enjoying the beats
like the rhythm swings

319
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,514
* So if you don't go along

320
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,882
- I'll fucking kill you!

321
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,517
(maniacal laughing)

322
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,885
You're dead!

323
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,223
* I'm the oogie woogie boogie
man *

324
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,168
- Don't.

325
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,538
(laughing)

326
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,420
This is O'Malley.

327
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,754
I need backup.

328
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,260
(acoustic guitar music)

329
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,942
- Double coconut café mocha?

330
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,879
And black coffee for you.

331
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,981
- Thank you.

332
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,416
- Anyone ever tell you
you resemble

333
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,718
a young Angelina Jolie?

334
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,387
- No.

335
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,889
- My name is Markus Tipton,
talent agent.

336
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,258
Call my office.

337
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,859
This could be your lucky day.

338
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,026
- Thank you.

339
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,301
- A little early
in the day, Jake.

340
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,671
- Yeah, well this scotch
is probably older than her.

341
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,705
- Touche.

342
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,341
Well I read your book last night

343
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,211
and I gotta be honest,
my expectations were,

344
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,947
how do I put this,
not very high.

345
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,318
- Your confidence in my work
is overwhelming as always.

346
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,020
- I was just expecting
a boring biographical

347
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:45,392
type account of events,
but this, this is riveting.

348
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,595
But somewhat suicidal.

349
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,029
- What do you mean?

350
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,131
- Well that masked character
is still out there.

351
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,801
He's killed what, four people?

352
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,136
I don't think this was the best

353
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,672
idea taunting him this
way, don't you agree?

354
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,808
- Maybe I don't care.

355
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,376
- But I care, and if you're not

356
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,612
thinking of yourself,
think about me and all

357
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,481
the money I'm going
to lose if you die.

358
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,617
- Well now Mark,
everybody knows an

359
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,020
artist's work skyrockets
after his death.

360
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,022
- That's a good point.

361
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,326
But all jokes aside Jake,
this is suicide.

362
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,960
- Don't worry about it.

363
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,730
Everything's gonna be fine,
just set up the interview.

364
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,298
I'll take it from there.

365
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,299
- Fine.

366
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,902
(phone buzzes)

367
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,072
- Hey Red, what's up?

368
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,276
You what, you sure, you okay?

369
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,744
Are you sure?

370
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:42,081
No, look, I've got a
meeting, I can cancel.

371
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,150
If you're sure, okay.

372
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,219
All right, well I'll see
you at the house then.

373
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,220
All right.

374
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,289
- What's going on?

375
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,523
- I gotta go.

376
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,262
- Check please.

377
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,338
- What type of tea
do you prefer?

378
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,640
- I don't cake, Jake.

379
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,609
- Well chamomile then.

380
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,579
Mine's black currant.

381
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,849
Yeah, JC used to make it for me.

382
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,352
I've grown quite fond of it.

383
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,692
- Seriously?

384
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,536
You went through with it?

385
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,038
Are you fucking kidding me?!

386
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,573
This guy's a maniac!

387
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,543
You know what he's
gonna do to you?!

388
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,712
- What do you mean?

389
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,415
- I saw him tonight,
in the alley.

390
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,616
Yeah, he attacked me.

391
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,818
- The laughing mask guy,
he attacked you?

392
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,119
Did you kill him?

393
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,921
- No, he's fast.

394
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,723
Held a knife to my throat,
toyed with me

395
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,958
for a little bit,
and then let me loose.

396
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,729
What the hell you think
he's gonna do to you?

397
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,631
- Did you want sugar?

398
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,300
- Sugar?

399
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,403
Are you fucking kidding
me, what's wrong with you?!

400
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:11,771
After JC died, did you just give

401
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,541
up ever trying to find Barbara?

402
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:20,246
This guy is our only lead to
finding out what happened.

403
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,982
What are you planning on doing?

404
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,419
- I wanna show you something.

405
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,420
Follow me.

406
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,671
I've been tracking him
for months.

407
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,973
I'm convinced.

408
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,108
This bastard knows what
happened to Barbara.

409
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,643
- What the fuck, Jake!

410
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,346
You're tampering with
evidence from a crime scene!

411
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,814
I'm a cop!

412
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,749
This is the kind of shit
that gets people arrested!

413
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,885
- Three months
you were gone, Kate.

414
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,455
Do you know what the
cops did in that time?

415
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,956
Nothing.

416
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,693
This psycho killed
three people since then.

417
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,428
Not a single arrest was made.

418
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,129
- This is not a TV show, Jake.

419
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,498
You're not a cop.

420
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,699
You're just a writer.

421
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,300
What could you possibly do that

422
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,303
my department isn't
already doing?

423
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,442
- These are the three deaths
since JC's.

424
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,676
One was a lawyer.

425
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,379
(muffled screaming)

426
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,247
Second was an accountant.

427
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,582
(gasps)

428
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,318
And the third was a doctor.

429
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,387
No connection, nothing
to tie them together.

430
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,456
Besides of course
the beware signs.

431
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,890
- Exactly.

432
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,225
- Except this.

433
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,198
- Who the hell's Lopez?

434
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,333
- No idea.

435
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,801
All I know is that he had paid

436
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,470
each of them, and then
this laughing mask

437
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,672
guy picked them off one by one.

438
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,507
I don't know where this
trail leads, this is as

439
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,343
as I can get with
my limited resources.

440
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,747
Like you said,
I'm just a writer.

441
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,684
You need to go out and
figure this out, Kate.

442
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,186
- This doesn't change my opinion

443
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,056
on you publishing this book.

444
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,057
- Fine.

445
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,125
I'll call Mark.

446
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,471
(jazzy bass guitar music)

447
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,618
- That's vintage there.

448
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,826
Now we wait.

449
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:00,900
Now we wait.

450
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,541
Life is good.

451
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,522
(notification beep)

452
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,666
Will you look at that.

453
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,102
It was a collectible after all.

454
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,537
(laughing)

455
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,509
(power fizzes out)

456
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,111
(ominous music)

457
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,713
Who's out there?!

458
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:53,119
(door slams)

459
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,887
I'll call the cops!

460
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,057
And I got a gun!

461
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:18,110
(groaning)

462
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,901
Please, please.

463
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,106
Oh man.

464
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,377
Oh no, no, please please please.

465
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,344
Stop!

466
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:54,981
I got money.

467
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,972
(blues music)

468
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,078
* Hidey hidey hidey hi

469
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:28,214
* Hidey hidey hidey hi

470
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,416
* Whoa oh whoa oh

471
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,785
* Whoa oh whoa oh

472
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,222
* You didn't see me
climb through the window

473
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,656
- The fuck you want?

474
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,960
* Nobody had to open that door
- Son of a bitch!

475
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,228
Who are you?!

476
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,863
* I just climbed right through
the wall

477
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,898
* And I want you one and all

478
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,633
- Fucking kill you, you bastard!

479
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,969
* To let me have the floor

480
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:54,306
* Take a look, I'm not
such a stranger

481
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,309
* Here's the face your
cokeys all ought to know

482
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,011
- Bastard, I'll kill you.

483
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,713
* You can tell me I'm not wanted

484
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,449
- Stop, come on, please stop!

485
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,485
* 'Cause I'm the ghost
of Smokey Joe

486
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,587
- I'll give you anything
you want, come on.

487
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,022
Stop, please stop!

488
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,190
Please stop!

489
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,826
Come on, man!

490
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,028
Come on!

491
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:18,364
Hey, please, please don't.

492
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,067
Don't, come on, stop!

493
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,103
Stop, no more!

494
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,839
Come on, no no no no!

495
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,908
* Do you remember Minnie

496
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,843
* Yes we remember Minnie

497
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,579
* The thrill I never found

498
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,215
* You'll never recognize
your Minnie

499
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:40,552
* You mean to say that Minnie
was kicking the gong around

500
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:47,226
* I've got a date on
my estate down in Haiti

501
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,728
* Call my chariot so I can go

502
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,730
(chainsaw revs)

503
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,565
* And should the boots
your walking

504
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,168
* Just tell them
you've been talking

505
00:28:56,302 --> 00:29:00,072
* To the ghost of Smokey Joe

506
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,911
* Yes I remember Minnie

507
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:09,248
* She's that thrill
I never found

508
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:16,022
* People say that Minnie
was kicking the gong around

509
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:22,594
* I've got a date on
my estate down in Haiti

510
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:26,866
* Call my chariot so I can go

511
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,734
* And should the boots
your walking

512
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,403
* Just tell her
you've been talking

513
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:35,107
* To the ghost of Smokey Joe *

514
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,277
(maniacal laughing)

515
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,600
- Hey Brock!

516
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,602
Listen, I need your help
with something.

517
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,604
I'm trying to catch up here.

518
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,707
Does the name Lopez
mean anything to you?

519
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:12,578
- That's a pretty
broad question, Kate.

520
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,813
- I've been looking at
The Laughing Mask kills

521
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,150
and I found something
pretty interesting.

522
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,051
- What do you got?

523
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,087
- [Kate] Check it out.

524
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,126
- What, all these people had
deposits from this Lopez guy?

525
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,527
- I mean that's the thing.

526
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,529
I checked out all three
of them and

527
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,999
no one named Lopez
knows any of them.

528
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,233
- Did you run an
IP address search

529
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,634
to find the location
of the computer

530
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,870
that made these deposits?

531
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,472
What, 'cause I'm
a bigger guy I'm

532
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,309
not supposed to know
anything about computers?

533
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:47,479
(chuckles) Let me help you out.

534
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,282
- Learn something new
every day, huh?

535
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,218
- Step aside for a second.

536
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,153
Let me work my magic.

537
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,925
All right, let's take
a look here.

538
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,663
Huh.

539
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,969
The computer used to make these

540
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:13,572
transactions was located
in The Barn.

541
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,007
- The strip club?

542
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,642
- Yeah.

543
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,445
Where Wink was just killed.

544
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,314
(phone rings)

545
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,515
- Yes?

546
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,717
- [Cordova] Kate,
we have another one.

547
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,753
- All right, text me
the address.

548
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,022
I'll be right over there.

549
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:34,360
(dramatic piano music)

550
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:43,869
So what happened here?

551
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,105
- Mr. John Grunswald
is the owner

552
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,208
of the funeral home
that the victim...

553
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,477
Larry Willows works at.

554
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,947
He called us as soon as
he found him like this.

555
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,083
- What's inside all these boxes?

556
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,584
- Well it looks like Mr. Willows

557
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,719
was doing some moonlighting as

558
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,821
an Ebay seller on the side.

559
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,090
He was selling stuff that was

560
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,924
buried with the deceased.

561
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,194
Clothes, toys, gold, etc.

562
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,296
- Gold?

563
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,563
- Gold teeth.

564
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,603
- He's all yours, Kate.

565
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,839
- How long have you
known Mr. Willows?

566
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,842
- He's been working for me
for five years.

567
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,711
- And did you know that he was

568
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,747
selling the deceased's
personal items on Ebay?

569
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,050
- No, of course not.

570
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,484
I was shocked and appalled when

571
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,286
I discovered what he was doing.

572
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,521
I couldn't believe it.

573
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,922
- Well thank you, Mr. Grunswald,

574
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,057
and I'll contact you if I have

575
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,958
any further questions.

576
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:40,759
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,760
- Thanks.

578
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,497
- Good of you to show up.

579
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,067
- Hey, figured the body
wasn't going anywhere.

580
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,635
- Hey, if we're gonna be
doing the

581
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,638
mortuary humor, I get
to be the quippy CSI.

582
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,006
- And this is the point in every

583
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,641
crappy movie when
the cop comes in

584
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,809
and says "What's
the cause of death?"

585
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:02,114
- And I say something like
"He should've saw it coming."

586
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,351
- But let's just
skip that, shall we?

587
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,952
- [Amanda] Let's.

588
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,424
- So what is the cause of death?

589
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,394
- Well he should've saw
it coming.

590
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,396
- Really?

591
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,200
- Just a couple of
regular jokers, aren't we?

592
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,968
- Shut up, Cordova.

593
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,738
(squishing noise)

594
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,375
What is that?

595
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,679
(suspenseful music)

596
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,225
(dramatic sting)

597
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,360
("Pop Goes the Weasel" melody)

598
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,362
- I'm gonna need
a new pair of undies.

599
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,863
- What the hell?

600
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,571
- It looks like his
internal organs

601
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,175
have been removed and
replaced with toys.

602
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:09,215
- Well that's a fucked
up pinata right there.

603
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:10,649
- Keep looking.

604
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,380
(muffled speaking)

605
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,998
Hey Amanda, I need you to run
some DNA on this elephant.

606
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,633
Let me know what you find.

607
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,271
Call me and only me if you
find anything, all right?

608
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,105
- What do you think this is?

609
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,907
- I think it might be Barbara's,

610
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,477
but I don't wanna get
anybody's hopes up.

611
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,478
- No worries.

612
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,612
I understand.

613
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,013
- Thanks.

614
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:19,251
Now I'm off to my closet
to find my hooker dress.

615
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,621
- Yeah, well they said
that he used

616
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,324
to do the... used to
play there during nights.

617
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,625
- How you feeling, Jake?

618
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,160
- I'm okay.

619
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,496
- [Mark] Don't worry
about anything.

620
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,697
Just forget everything
the critics

621
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,133
have said and focus
on the sales.

622
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,802
Just go out there
and be yourself, okay?

623
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,404
- Mark, I'm fine.

624
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:40,806
I've got this.

625
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,852
- So you know what
not to ask, right?

626
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,454
- Yes, I got all the e-mails
and texts,

627
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,190
as in plural,
as in all 16 of them, Mark.

628
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,660
- Good good, it's good to
be prepared I always say.

629
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,796
Well let's get started then.

630
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,698
Angela, this is Jake.

631
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,801
- Hi Jake, nice to
finally meet you.

632
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,470
- You as well, I apologize
for Mark,

633
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:14,206
he can be a little protective.

634
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,874
- It's okay,
nothing to apologize for,

635
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,643
it's understandable,
let's get started.

636
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:18,744
Are you ready for this?

637
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:19,745
- Yeah I'm ready.

638
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,247
- [Angela] Okay.

639
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,850
- All right.

640
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:29,555
- [Voiceover] We're going
live in five, four, three.

641
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,824
(gentle piano music)

642
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,065
- Hey everyone and thanks
for watching Rose Live,

643
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,700
my name is Angela Rose
and we have

644
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,669
a very special guest
with us today.

645
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,437
His book, The Laughing Mask
of Vengeance,

646
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,872
has been sitting as
a best seller

647
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,707
on New York Times
for the last two weeks.

648
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,009
Please help me welcome
Mr. Jake Johnson.

649
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,778
- Hi.

650
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,746
I'm sorry Angela,
before we begin,

651
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,715
can I ask you a favor?

652
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:57,849
- [Angela] Yes, Mr. Johnson.

653
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,651
- No no, please, call me Jake.

654
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,888
- Yes Jake, of course,
what is it?

655
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:06,325
- My fantastic agent Mark
gave you a

656
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,027
list of questions that
you could ask me, right?

657
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,597
- Yes, I have them right here.

658
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,732
- Tear them up.

659
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,100
You better do it quickly before

660
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,735
my agent has a heart attack.

661
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:17,869
- Are you sure, once I do this

662
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,605
it's no holds barred.

663
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,241
- I wouldn't have it
any other way.

664
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,911
- Okay, here we go.

665
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,280
In your book, you go
into factual detail

666
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,148
and then you go into
how you finally

667
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,384
hunt and catch your killer.

668
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:33,685
Your wife was murdered and your

669
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,254
daughter was kidnapped,
is that correct?

670
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,890
- That is correct, yeah.

671
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,559
- Isn't it disrespectful to make

672
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,227
money off your wife's murder,

673
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,695
especially with
the ongoing search

674
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,130
for your missing daughter,
it's a pretty

675
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,598
sleazy thing to do.

676
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,367
- Well don't pull
any punches now, Angela,

677
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,636
I mean there's no need
to sugarcoat it.

678
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,104
- You told me to tear the cards.

679
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,105
- I did.

680
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,275
It's a fair question.

681
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,812
I've been listening
to a lot of critics

682
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,748
talk about what
my intentions were

683
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,816
when I wrote this book.

684
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,419
And the truth is...

685
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,422
I needed closure.

686
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,125
In a case like this
where no evidence

687
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,729
was found, no arrests were made,

688
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,631
even if it was only
in a fictitious

689
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,033
form, I needed vindication.

690
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,070
- You know Jake, I just finished

691
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,405
reading your book and I have to

692
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,006
say the way you portray
the killer

693
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,141
is nothing short
of a suicide note.

694
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,010
I mean you extrapolate
how he was abused

695
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,746
as a child and then has
a sexual dysfunction.

696
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,114
- I said he probably can't get

697
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,551
it up without torturing someone.

698
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,187
A sadistic person like that gets

699
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,289
off on other people's pain.

700
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,024
They're usually cowards,
so they have

701
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,126
to create a persona
to hide them from the

702
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,296
failures they've created
in their own lives.

703
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,031
- What about the money factor?

704
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,633
You can't ignore that
millions of copies

705
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,868
of your books are being sold,
and this

706
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,471
has nothing to do
with the money?

707
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,773
- All proceeds
from this book will

708
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,309
be donated
to the National Center

709
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:07,679
of Missing and Exploited
Children.

710
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,482
I'm literally not making
a dime off this.

711
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,350
This is not about the money.

712
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,819
- Then what is it about?

713
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,153
You can't expect us
to think this

714
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,055
is only about closure,
Mr. Johnson.

715
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,356
There has to be more to it.

716
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,691
- Oh there is.

717
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:27,733
For the past few months
I've been living in fear.

718
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,669
And the death of my family,
along with the

719
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,071
fact that that psychotic...

720
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,709
That he's still out
there, well that's been

721
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:40,712
my cross to bear
on a daily basis.

722
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,983
Today I am no longer afraid.

723
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,219
I will be a victim no more.

724
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,090
I refuse to be silent
any longer.

725
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,093
If that twisted
son of a bitch wants

726
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,530
to find me, well he knows
where I live.

727
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,633
- Okay folks,
that is all the time

728
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,635
we have for today,
I'm Angela Rose,

729
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,937
and this is Rose Live.

730
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,740
- [Voiceover] And we're clear.

731
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:11,176
- So did you get
what you wanted?

732
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,044
- You just aired the
longest death sentence

733
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:16,515
in TV history and I
did nothing to stop it.

734
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,951
- Yeah, well think of
the ratings you'll get.

735
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,554
(rock music)

736
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,923
- What'll it be, gorgeous?

737
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,491
- Whiskey please.

738
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,400
- Hey babe.

739
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:15,306
It's a little early for
that, don't you think?

740
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,011
- Well see, my boyfriend,
he kicked me

741
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,280
out of the apartment,
and this drink

742
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,182
right here symbolizes the only

743
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,851
money I have left.

744
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,821
- Such a shame.

745
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:33,525
With a body like yours,
you'd be raking

746
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,627
the dough here in no time.

747
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,028
- You think?

748
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,597
- I know so, baby.

749
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,966
- Are y'all hiring?

750
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,235
- We're always hiring
beautiful girls.

751
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,639
- So who do I talk to?

752
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,208
- You're talking to me, doll.

753
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,380
You know, I'm the only
man you'll ever need.

754
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,216
- So you must be the owner then?

755
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,689
- You could say I'm in charge.

756
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,290
- The hell you are.

757
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,793
- Hey, you shut the fuck up!

758
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,328
Wink is dead,
you fucking hear me,

759
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,864
I'm the fucking boss here now!

760
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,733
You fucking hear me?!

761
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,003
Such a fucking asshole.

762
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,504
- Somebody died?

763
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,809
- Yeah, a former manager here.

764
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,379
Got his head popped off
like a champagne cork.

765
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,315
(chuckles)

766
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,250
- Well that just
sounds terrible.

767
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,185
- Not for me.

768
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,589
Not for me, next in line
to the throne, baby.

769
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:41,126
Once Lopez signs off
on it, I'll be running

770
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,095
this joint and The Rancors.

771
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,565
- Well I love me a powerful man.

772
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:51,069
- [Voiceover] Then you're
gonna love me.

773
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:57,709
- Well I was gonna go
out and get some things

774
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,746
and I was gonna be right back.

775
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,914
Would you wait for me?

776
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:05,250
- I don't wait for no one.

777
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,990
But for those I'll make
an exception.

778
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,763
- I'll be right back.

779
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,768
* She'll be the little small
town girl from somewhere

780
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,370
* 'Cause she's got fast cars,
nice shoes

781
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:30,408
* Bad habits and blues, got
everything a tough girl needs

782
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:34,746
* Nice legs, killer smile, great
body *

783
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,484
(dramatic piano music)

784
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,634
- Come on, you bastard.

785
00:43:57,903 --> 00:43:59,437
I've done my part.

786
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,007
Now it's your turn.

787
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:09,280
* Oh the shark, babe, has such
teeth, dear

788
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:13,618
* And it shows them pearly
whites

789
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,621
* Just a jackknife

790
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,589
- Mama mia, delicious!

791
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:26,231
* And he keeps it out of sight

792
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:30,601
* You know when that shark
bites with his teeth, babe

793
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:36,808
* Scarlet billows start to
spread

794
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,714
* Fancy gloves, oh, wears
MacHeath, babe

795
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,519
* So there's never, never a
trace of red

796
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:52,223
* Now let that thick smoke on
the sidewalk

797
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,827
* Huh, ooo Sunday morning, uh
huh

798
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:59,497
* Lies a body oozing life

799
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,234
- Wait.

800
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:07,405
* Someone's sneaking around the
corner

801
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,743
* Could that someone be ol' Mack
the Knife

802
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,747
* There's a tugboat, huh, huh

803
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,917
* Down by the river don't you
know

804
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,586
* Where a cement bag's
just dropping on down *

805
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,289
- You can definitely be
in the movie, Marcie.

806
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,958
Let's just see
how grateful you are.

807
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:29,727
I'm gonna make you work for it.

808
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:35,066
(music changes
to classical music)

809
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:47,879
* Five will get ya a dime
old Macky's back in town

810
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,449
* You hear 'bout Louie Miller

811
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,320
* He did to the rhythm, honey *

812
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,290
(music changes back)
- What the hell?

813
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:03,962
* You know it's a sin
to tell a lie

814
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:08,900
* Still you keep saying
I love you

815
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:13,071
* It may be true, I wish I knew

816
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,643
* But I'm giving fair warning to
you

817
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,817
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

818
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:33,291
* It's a sin to tell a lie *

819
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,835
* Five gonna get you a dime
old Macky's back in town

820
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,906
* Now did you hear about Louie
Miller

821
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:51,910
* He did to the rhythm, honey

822
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:57,248
* After drawing out all
his hard-earned cash

823
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,118
* And now MacHeath spends
just like a sailor *

824
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,620
(screaming)

825
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,459
- [Voiceover] Hello,
girls and boys.

826
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,595
I'm your Peter Pan storyteller.

827
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:11,963
When you hear this sound.

828
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,464
(bell dings)

829
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:14,832
You turn the page.

830
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,834
Now let's read
the story together.

831
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,303
Here we go.

832
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,138
Alice in Wonderland.

833
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,708
(fanciful music)

834
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,712
On a warm summer day
many years ago,

835
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,547
a little girl named Alice
was making

836
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,517
daisy chains in the grass
when suddenly,

837
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,819
right in front of her,
ran a little white rabbit

838
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,688
with long ears and pink eyes.

839
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:40,191
(bell dings)

840
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,193
He was wearing white gloves
and he carried

841
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:45,363
a green umbrella and
a little magic fan.

842
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,764
- [Rabbit] Oh my ears
and whiskers,

843
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,699
I mustn't be late,
I mustn't be late!

844
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,169
(fanciful music)

845
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:54,439
* I'm a silly little
rabbit from Wonderland

846
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,708
* I got a green umbrella
and a magic fan

847
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,344
* I'd like to stay
and play with you

848
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,912
* But I've got things I must do

849
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:03,982
* Hippity hop, hippity hop,
I'm off to Wonderland *

850
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:05,216
(giggles)

851
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,484
- [Voiceover] And away
ran the little

852
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,885
white rabbit and jumped down
the rabbit

853
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,755
hole with Alice following
right behind him.

854
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,791
(orchestral sting)

855
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,127
(bell dings)

856
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:17,862
Alice found herself
sitting at the

857
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,697
bottom of the rabbit hole
in the

858
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,432
middle of a big room surrounded

859
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,868
by many beautiful golden doors,

860
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,436
all tightly shut.

861
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:28,239
Then she spied
a golden key lying

862
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,341
on a little glass table.

863
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:33,011
- [Alice] Maybe this
will fit one of the doors

864
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:35,280
and I'll find the white rabbit.

865
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,882
(bell dings)

866
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,150
- [Voiceover] But
the only door that

867
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:40,952
the key would fit
was hanging there.

868
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:44,055
(screaming)

869
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,958
This door was hardly as
big as a dollhouse door.

870
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,760
- [Alice] Oh dear, I'll
never fit through that door.

871
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,929
- [Voiceover] But just
then, Alice saw a bottle

872
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:54,599
with the words "drink me"
written on it.

873
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,135
(bell dings)

874
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,904
So she took a drink
from the bottle.

875
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:02,040
- [Alice] My goodness,
I'm getting smaller!

876
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,574
And smaller!

877
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:04,742
And smaller!

878
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,813
- [Voiceover] And there was
little Alice,

879
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,849
so very very small,
until she spied

880
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:14,785
a little box
lying near the wall.

881
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,922
In the box was a small cake with

882
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:21,059
the words "eat me"
marked in raisins.

883
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,461
So she ate the cake.

884
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,630
- [Alice] Oh my goodness,
I'm getting taller!

885
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:26,998
And taller!

886
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,599
And taller!

887
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:29,667
Stop, stop!

888
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,104
(bell dings)

889
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,505
- [Voiceover] Alice was now over

890
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,074
nine feet high
and so frightened,

891
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,542
she didn't notice
the white rabbit

892
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,010
coming down the hall.

893
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:41,179
(fanciful music)

894
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,549
* I'm a silly little
rabbit from Wonderland

895
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,985
* Where turtles go to
school and think it's grand

896
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,356
* Where elephants are
as big as fleas

897
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,024
* And now if you will pardon me

898
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,227
* I'll take off
like the breeze *

899
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:58,863
(screaming)

900
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,431
- [Voiceover] As the rabbit
ran away,

901
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,233
he dropped his little magic fan.

902
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,302
(bell dings)

903
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,104
Turn the record over and we will

904
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,506
continue on the other side.

905
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:17,315
(dramatic music)

906
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,483
- Goddammit.

907
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,018
Fell asleep again.

908
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:27,525
I knew it.

909
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:28,859
No more booze!

910
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,063
Come on Jake, come on!

911
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:33,998
Keep your head clear.

912
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,874
Come on come on,
wake up, come on!

913
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:54,419
What the hell?

914
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,266
Damn washer.

915
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,552
(dramatic sting)

916
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:28,319
Fuck!

917
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:29,554
(glass shatters)

918
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:30,555
Mark?

919
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,594
(sirens wailing)
(police radio noise)

920
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,770
- I told you not to release
the book!

921
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:46,671
What do you do?

922
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,739
You go on live TV!

923
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,941
Don't blow me off, Jake!

924
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,411
We had a deal, okay?

925
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:54,945
I help you find the psycho and

926
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,248
you don't release the book.

927
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:59,484
- Mark's dead because of me.

928
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,487
- Yeah, because he
doesn't want to kill you.

929
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,088
He wants to torture you.

930
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,123
And now he's gonna do everything

931
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,625
he can to target every person

932
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,960
you've ever loved
or cared about.

933
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,229
We have to get you out of here

934
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:12,963
now and into protective custody.

935
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,200
- Yeah, not gonna happen.

936
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,568
I'm not going anywhere.

937
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,638
If he shows up,
I'll deal with him.

938
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:26,211
Did you find out anything?

939
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,979
- Lopez runs The Rancors.

940
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,981
A thug for hire type local gang.

941
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,783
Everybody that's been killed
so far

942
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,385
has either been a member
or associated

943
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,721
with them in some way.

944
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,924
Wink ran their
prostitution ring.

945
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,926
- How does that help us
find Barbara?

946
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,862
- It doesn't, but if
we can find this Lopez,

947
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,365
okay, then we can
use him as bait.

948
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,401
I don't think he'll
come after you, not yet.

949
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,802
God Jake, your whole plan was

950
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:53,170
misconceived from the beginning!

951
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:54,872
- Look, somebody had
to do something!

952
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,707
Someone did!

953
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,644
- Just stay safe,
out of the way.

954
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,380
Let me handle this.

955
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:06,851
That's why you came to me.

956
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:10,855
If that bastard has
Barbara, we will find her.

957
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:15,426
Take those.

958
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,027
They'll calm you.

959
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,597
I'm gonna get you some water.

960
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:26,837
- [Amanda] You can just
take this back

961
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:30,775
inside the van and then
I'll be right there with you.

962
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,377
As soon as you get this
back in the van

963
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,878
I'll be out in
just a few minutes and

964
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,547
then we can take this back to...

965
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,215
There, and Cordova
will show up and

966
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,419
we'll get this guy
put back together.

967
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:43,721
Okay, all right?

968
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,525
- Anything?

969
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,026
- Nope, nothing.

970
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:53,097
There's no blood,
no hair, no DNA.

971
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,065
It's like the head
grew on the plate.

972
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,667
- How'd he get in?

973
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:59,270
- No signs of forced entry,
all windows and doors locked.

974
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,805
I mean this is the first time
I've ever

975
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,140
been on a scene,
there's no evidence.

976
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:07,778
Whoever this guy is, he is
very very good at what he does.

977
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,246
- What about Mark's home?

978
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,349
- Cordova's over there
with another team.

979
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,683
The body was actually found by

980
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:14,585
this waitress
from the local coffee house,

981
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,687
yeah, Mr. Romantic over
there, he invited her

982
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,889
over for an audition,
and check this out,

983
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:20,758
there was a note
on the front door

984
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:25,029
that said "Come inside,
'head' to the kitchen."

985
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,163
- You're kidding me.

986
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,498
- [Amanda] Nope.

987
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,367
- No, it fucking said
head in quotation marks.

988
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,901
- So she walks
into the kitchen and

989
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,137
there's a body, no head,
blood everywhere,

990
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,807
filled with knives,
just craziest scene.

991
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,376
Needless to say,
all her tit money's

992
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,110
gonna be going towards
therapy bills.

993
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,146
- And of course there's
no clues we can use.

994
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,248
- It's all clean, just
like all the others.

995
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,616
We ain't got shit.

996
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,617
- Great.

997
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:57,928
Jake.

998
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,832
We'll find her.

999
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,268
Hey, what's with the row
of keys in the cabinet?

1000
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:07,304
I never noticed that before.

1001
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,306
- They're master keys.

1002
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,975
For the tenants.

1003
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,010
In case they lose one,
we can cut one for them.

1004
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,479
- What tenants?

1005
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:16,347
- My family, they made
their money in real estate.

1006
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:17,748
They sold most of it years ago,

1007
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:19,016
but they kept this
one little place

1008
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,486
over in Pine Hills, I think?

1009
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:22,753
I thought you knew that.

1010
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,321
- No, first time.

1011
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,758
- Why do you ask?

1012
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:29,794
- No reason.

1013
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:30,995
At any rate, I just
wanted to let

1014
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,663
you know you can stay
at my house.

1015
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:34,665
You'll be safer there.

1016
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,802
- [Jake] I'm not leaving.

1017
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:42,172
- Look, we can't make
you Jake, but I would.

1018
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,842
(phone rings)

1019
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,447
I have to go.

1020
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,015
Brock's gonna have
the patrol car

1021
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,250
parked out front
for the next two days.

1022
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,185
Shit, I gotta go.

1023
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:58,423
If you need anything,
please call me.

1024
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:05,295
(dramatic piano riff)

1025
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,174
* Boo, I'm the boogeyman

1026
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,177
* The terrible, horrible
boogeyman

1027
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,480
* I come in the middle of night
and

1028
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:26,350
* Frighten bad little girls like
you

1029
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,487
* Beware, better have a care

1030
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,423
* I'm going to follow you
everywhere

1031
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,525
* I crawl through the ceiling
and the wall

1032
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:38,629
* And call on bad little girls
like you

1033
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:40,364
* I'll torture you and hunt you

1034
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:41,899
* I got you where I want you

1035
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:45,069
* A victim of my dark and dirty
plot

1036
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,872
* At the slightly whim,
I'll tear you limb from limb

1037
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,709
* In other words, I'll put you
on the spot

1038
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,411
* Boo, I'm the boogeyman

1039
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,715
* The terrible, horrible
boogeyman

1040
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,717
* I come in the middle of the
night

1041
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,987
* And frighten bad little girls
like you *

1042
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,490
(screaming)

1043
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,614
- [Voiceover] Bobby was
the first to go.

1044
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,817
He dashed out into the
sunlight singing and joyful.

1045
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,686
* I'll build a fine house,
get myself a good wife

1046
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,789
* And settle down for
the rest of my life *

1047
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,290
- [Voiceover] That's what
he thought when he came

1048
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:43,360
Across a man carrying
a load of straw.

1049
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:44,929
Spotty asked the man.

1050
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,664
- [Spotty] What have you there,
mister?

1051
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,699
- [Voiceover] Straw,
my fine young pig.

1052
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:49,967
Would you like some?

1053
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,201
- [Spotty] Oh very much.

1054
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,103
I'll build me a house
out of the straw.

1055
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,338
Oh thank you.

1056
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,941
- [Voiceover] And so Spotty
took the

1057
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:59,476
straw and built himself
a fine looking house.

1058
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,612
He finished it up in one day.

1059
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:04,348
But the next day the wolf came.

1060
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,787
He knocked on the door.

1061
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,221
(knocking)

1062
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:15,860
- [Wolf] Open up, my
friend, and let me come in.

1063
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,695
- [Spotty] No never
mister Wolf, not by the

1064
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,064
hair of my chiny chin chin!

1065
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,032
(sobbing)

1066
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,669
- [Wolf] Then I'll
huff, and I'll puff,

1067
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,171
and I'll blow your house in!

1068
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:31,241
(dramatic sting)

1069
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,711
- [Voiceover] And so
the wolf took

1070
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,213
Spotty to his cave.

1071
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,183
Then the wolf went out
looking for Curly Tail.

1072
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,519
Well when Curly Tail set
out to see his fortune,

1073
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,822
he also met the man.

1074
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:48,959
This time he was carrying
a load of twigs.

1075
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,996
* You smiled when we parted

1076
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:55,099
* It hurt me somehow

1077
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:59,403
* I thought there was nothing
worthwhile

1078
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,308
* The tables are turning

1079
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:08,245
* And you're crying now

1080
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,182
* While I am just learning to
smile

1081
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:14,585
(groaning)

1082
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,724
* Who's sorry now

1083
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:25,129
* Who's sorry now

1084
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:29,499
* Whose heart is aching
for breaking each vow

1085
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:36,240
* Who's sad and blue

1086
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,977
* Who's crying too

1087
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:45,049
* Just like I cried over you

1088
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,657
* Right to the end

1089
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:57,294
* Just like a friend

1090
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:02,232
* I tried to warn you somehow

1091
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,539
* You had your way

1092
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:14,544
* Now you must pay

1093
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:21,418
* I'm glad that you're sorry now

1094
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,626
- (muffled) No, no, no, no!

1095
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,430
* You will never know the
pain you had brought to me

1096
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:37,768
* When I realized that it was
not to be

1097
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:41,405
* Every hour of sadness that I
spent

1098
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:45,710
* They say madness will embrace
you

1099
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,078
- No, no--

1100
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,380
(gunshot)

1101
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,018
* You knew love was blind at
last *

1102
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,453
(music cuts off)

1103
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:00,290
(muffled distant screaming)

1104
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,640
(upbeat keyboard music)

1105
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:20,344
* A very happy birthday to you

1106
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:24,014
* A very happy birthday to you

1107
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,716
* Smile a smile from ear to ear

1108
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,819
* Wish a wish that lasts all
year *

1109
01:01:28,953 --> 01:01:30,788
- Finally Kate, what the fuck?

1110
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:33,357
- Would you stop giving
me grief, Lloyd, okay?

1111
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,392
I'm here, I'm just
a few minutes late.

1112
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,761
- A few minutes?

1113
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:38,729
I should be lucky you
even showed up this time?

1114
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:40,197
- How I ever married you,
or had sex

1115
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,932
with you, is beyond me, okay?

1116
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,801
By the way, this is
an inappropriate

1117
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,502
time to have this conversation.

1118
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,838
We're at our kid's
ucking birthday party.

1119
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:49,874
- 'Cause you're so readily
available all the other times?

1120
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:54,278
- I'm doing my job.

1121
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:56,346
You're out there
banging your secretary.

1122
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,348
- My secretary, what are
you even talking about?

1123
01:01:58,482 --> 01:01:59,549
- You know what I mean.

1124
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:00,684
- [Lloyd] Know what you mean?

1125
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:03,187
This is ridiculous, Kate.

1126
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,621
- Where's Nancy?

1127
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:05,722
- She's right over there.

1128
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:07,024
- Nancy?

1129
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,425
Nancy!

1130
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,261
(ominous music)

1131
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,833
(screaming)

1132
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:16,834
Nancy, baby!

1133
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,168
- [Lloyd] Oh my God, baby!

1134
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:19,636
Nancy, what are you doing?

1135
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,038
- [Kate] Nancy, baby!

1136
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:24,441
- [Lloyd] Oh my God,
Nancy, what are you doing?

1137
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,576
- Baby, are you okay?

1138
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,078
Why'd you leave the party?

1139
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,847
- Some clown gave me
this balloon.

1140
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,248
- Baby, where'd this clown go?

1141
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,316
- [Nancy] That way.

1142
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:33,984
Okay Lloyd, take her now.

1143
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:35,152
Get out of here.

1144
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:38,856
- Come on, we'll get
some cake, okay?

1145
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,026
(maniacal laughing)

1146
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:03,413
- You made a big mistake
coming for my daughter.

1147
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:08,052
(ominous music)

1148
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,866
(gunshots)

1149
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,168
Damn it.

1150
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,681
(coughing)

1151
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,233
(classical blues music)

1152
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:45,916
* You know it's a sin
to tell a lie

1153
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,252
* Still you keep saying
I love you

1154
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,787
- [Kate] Why are you
doing this?!

1155
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:56,060
* This may be true,
I wish I knew

1156
01:04:56,193 --> 01:05:00,397
* But I'm giving
fair warning to you

1157
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:07,737
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1158
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:14,578
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1159
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:22,386
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

1160
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:29,226
* Just because these words
were spoken

1161
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,432
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

1162
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,069
(sobbing)

1163
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:43,407
* If you break my heart,
I'll die

1164
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,844
* So be sure it's true

1165
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:48,878
- Bastard!

1166
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,317
* When you say I love you

1167
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:59,023
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1168
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:07,264
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1169
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:13,103
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1170
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:21,011
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

1171
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:27,184
* Just because these words
were spoken

1172
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:33,123
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

1173
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:35,759
(maniacal laughing)

1174
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:39,996
* If you break my heart I'll die

1175
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:47,337
* So be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1176
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:55,945
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1177
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,688
* Be sure it's true
when you lay I love you

1178
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:05,689
- No, no!

1179
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,865
- Christ, Kate!

1180
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:18,835
Are you okay?

1181
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:19,836
Kate!

1182
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,072
- Don't let him get away!

1183
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,279
* I love you, yes it's *

1184
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:32,048
- [Voiceover] Miss
O'Malley, stop being a baby.

1185
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,483
- [Kate] Well it hurts!

1186
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:34,751
- [Voiceover] You're fine,
I hardly even touch--

1187
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,486
- [Kate] Ow!

1188
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,887
Get a doctor!

1189
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,023
- You know what, I will
call the doctor, okay?

1190
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:41,358
If that makes you happy.

1191
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:43,493
- Makes me happy.

1192
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,996
(heart monitor beeping)

1193
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,268
- Well you've done it now.

1194
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,536
- What do you mean?

1195
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,904
- Your little covert
operation is over.

1196
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:57,374
Yeah, I know about it, Kate.

1197
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,510
Brock told me everything.

1198
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,279
- It wasn't a secret, Cordova.

1199
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,114
And I didn't withhold shit.

1200
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:06,783
Just didn't have time
to log in the evidence.

1201
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,854
- Twice this guy's put
you in the hospital.

1202
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:12,389
You're lucky we were
already looking

1203
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,524
for you when 911 dispatch
contacted us.

1204
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:17,093
Otherwise, you might be dead.

1205
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,297
Do you have any clue
who he is?

1206
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,866
- None, but if
he's coming after me

1207
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,034
we must be pretty close.

1208
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,971
You got anything
at the location?

1209
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,874
DNA, fingerprints, anything?

1210
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:32,942
- Amanda's checked it over
with a fine-toothed comb.

1211
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:34,344
Nothing.

1212
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,480
- That's impossible.

1213
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,348
- What about the leads
you told Brock about?

1214
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:40,584
Where are you at with those?

1215
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,753
- This Lopez guy,
he runs The Rancors.

1216
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:48,091
And through them, most
of the crime in the city.

1217
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,994
- Never heard of a Lopez.

1218
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,862
- The Laughing Mask
is systematically

1219
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:55,098
killing off his men one by one.

1220
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:58,101
That's why we need to get
to him before he does.

1221
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,170
And there are these
bank statements.

1222
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,938
These transactions
were made from

1223
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,441
a computer at The Barn.

1224
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,243
When I went there,
this guido looking

1225
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:09,446
kid told me all about
this Lopez guy.

1226
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,352
- This kid?

1227
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,753
- Yeah.

1228
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,088
- His body was found where
Wink's was this morning.

1229
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:20,390
- Oh my God.

1230
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:23,360
- Whatever he told you
cost him his life.

1231
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,695
This is serious, Kate.

1232
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,632
Did they see you at this bar?

1233
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:29,866
- Yeah.

1234
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,701
The bartender got
a good look at me.

1235
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:35,205
- Take my advice, stay in bed.

1236
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,606
Don't do anything,
now you've got

1237
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,643
The Rancors and this maniac
on your ass.

1238
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,478
We'll put an officer
outside your door,

1239
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,012
I'll follow up from here.

1240
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:44,814
Don't do anything, you hear me?

1241
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:46,383
- I can take care of myself.

1242
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,551
- Says the woman with multiple

1243
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,419
broken ribs in the hospital bed.

1244
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,054
Think of Nancy, Kate.

1245
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,490
She needs her mother alive.

1246
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:55,592
- Fine.

1247
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,231
But you keep me updated
on everything.

1248
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:04,067
So what's your next move?

1249
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,935
- After looking
at what you have,

1250
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,872
I think I might know
where he's going next.

1251
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,974
One last thing, where did you

1252
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,310
get these bank statements?

1253
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,313
- I can't say, Cordova.

1254
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,215
- It might mean catching
the son of a bitch.

1255
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:23,520
If I'm gonna help, I
need to know everything.

1256
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,188
- It was Jake.

1257
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:27,457
Playing detective.

1258
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:31,127
I think he's seen way too
many episodes of Castle.

1259
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,563
But you don't need to worry
about that.

1260
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,064
Honestly, I don't know
why we didn't

1261
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,933
find this shit ourselves.

1262
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,802
- Jake Johnson?

1263
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,270
- Yeah.

1264
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,239
But like I said, dead end there.

1265
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,774
- Sure, O'Malley.

1266
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:46,510
Rest up.

1267
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:01,991
(ominous music)

1268
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,768
- Sweet dreams, pumpkin.

1269
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:45,769
Love you.

1270
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:54,978
(lights power off)

1271
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,112
What the hell?

1272
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:59,282
(maniacal laughing)

1273
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:01,785
Grrr!

1274
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:07,190
You son of a bitch!

1275
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:10,226
You want me?!

1276
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,430
(suspenseful music)

1277
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:20,670
(gunshot)

1278
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:23,006
I got you, you son of a...

1279
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,481
(groaning)

1280
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:32,682
Go ahead.

1281
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,984
Do it, you fucking coward!

1282
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,655
You took them from me!

1283
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:41,691
My wife, my little girl!
(knocking)

1284
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,292
Where's Barbara?!

1285
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,261
- [Voiceover] Mr. Johnson!

1286
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,930
Mr. Johnson!

1287
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:47,897
- Yeah.

1288
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,833
- Are you all right?!

1289
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:52,536
- He was here.

1290
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,005
I couldn't catch him.

1291
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,208
- Are you all right?

1292
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:01,511
- I'm fine.

1293
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,456
- What a dump.

1294
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,855
Fucking waste of time.

1295
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,461
What is this shit?

1296
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:30,199
(somber piano music)

1297
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:54,283
Son of a bitch.

1298
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,522
(dramatic music)

1299
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,493
- Kate, Kate, Kate.

1300
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,264
You should've stayed
in the hospital.

1301
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,934
Don't think I won't, gorgeous.

1302
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,939
You should've listened.

1303
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,875
It's for your own good,
you know?

1304
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:30,654
- Chang's?

1305
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,123
- The one and only.

1306
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,592
- Not afraid of germs?

1307
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,928
- Have you seen this place?

1308
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:42,666
Come on Kate, I'm
offering you a last meal.

1309
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:47,336
- Alejandro L. Cordova.

1310
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:53,409
Lopez Cordova.

1311
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,812
Did you mean to throw that
one right in our face?

1312
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,315
- One of my proudest
achievements, Kate.

1313
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,118
But I do have to thank you.

1314
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,787
- For what?

1315
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,254
- If you didn't have your little

1316
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:07,256
nervous breakdown,
The Rancors would still

1317
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,827
be nothing more than
street thugs and pimps.

1318
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,762
Now we run this town.

1319
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,666
- What about the masked killer?

1320
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,435
He's gonna come after you next.

1321
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:32,816
- Officer O'Malley was found
dead at the scene of the crime.

1322
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:42,525
She was never the same after
the death of her friend JC.

1323
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,294
After returning back
from active duty,

1324
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:48,965
Officer O'Malley
acted erratically,

1325
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:53,302
conducting her own investigation
looking for the killer.

1326
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:58,541
Her body was found mangled
and mutilated.

1327
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,310
Much like her friend's.

1328
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:02,812
- You're insane.

1329
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,483
(groaning)

1330
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:10,553
- Aw, shit!

1331
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,189
Bitch!

1332
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,228
(ominous music)

1333
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:30,339
(children yelling playfully)

1334
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:44,988
(phone rings)

1335
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,291
- Kate, Homicide.

1336
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:49,926
- Hey, I have the results
on that

1337
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,295
stuffed elephant you gave me.

1338
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,163
- What did you find?

1339
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,900
- Well the dirt was
definitely from the cemetery,

1340
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,768
and also there was some DNA.

1341
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,303
Besides the groundskeeper,
there was

1342
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:02,638
also some from Barbara.

1343
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:05,441
- All right, get a team
out to the graveyard.

1344
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,410
The girl's buried there.

1345
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:08,677
- Understood.

1346
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,115
- Thanks.

1347
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,316
I owe you one.

1348
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,019
- [Amanda] I'll remember that.

1349
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:24,928
Hey.

1350
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:28,031
- What are you reading?

1351
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,067
- Nothing good, honey.

1352
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,814
(classical blues music)

1353
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:32,695
* The house is haunted by
the echo of your last goodbye

1354
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:40,003
* The house is haunted by the
memories that refuse to die

1355
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:46,509
* I can't get away from
a vision that brings

1356
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:50,746
* Intimate glimpses of intimate
things

1357
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,217
* A voice in my heart
like a torch singer sings

1358
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,553
* I wonder who's kissing him now

1359
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,891
* The house is haunted by the
echo of your favorite song

1360
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,630
* The place is cluttered up
with roses

1361
01:21:07,763 --> 01:21:12,635
* That have lived too long,
much too long

1362
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:16,872
* The ceiling is white,
the shadows are black *

1363
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:19,475
(rock music)

1364
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,663
* Going down tonight

1365
01:21:40,796 --> 01:21:43,599
* On a magic dragon flight

1366
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,002
* Baby I'm just out of sight

1367
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:48,104
* It's a party now because

1368
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:53,442
* You're the best thing, you're
the best thing that I know

1369
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:57,780
* You're the best thing, you're
the best thing that I know

1370
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:02,051
* Going out tonight

1371
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:04,620
* On my magic carpet ride

1372
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,090
* Baby I'm out of sight

1373
01:22:07,223 --> 01:22:09,292
* In the morning I'll be gone

1374
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:14,497
* You're the best thing, you're
the best thing that I know

1375
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:19,168
* You're the best thing, you're
the best thing that I know

1376
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,637
* You're the best thing *

1377
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,041
- [Voiceover] Cordova,
always a pleasure to see you.

1378
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,110
You don't look so good.

1379
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,312
Poor baby.

1380
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:32,915
You're hurt.

1381
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:35,251
- I feel horrible.

1382
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:36,652
Please help me.

1383
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,622
- Fucking Cordova.

1384
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:41,324
When is he gonna share
some of that?

1385
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:45,761
- [Cordova] Adam!

1386
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:47,530
You're way too quiet over there.

1387
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:48,831
Come here!

1388
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:07,150
- Don't make me wait too long.

1389
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,491
- Shouldn't we be running
by now?

1390
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:18,527
That cop chick's gonna
be coming after you hard.

1391
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,529
- O'Malley's a goddamn pimple.

1392
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,031
- I can't believe
this place isn't

1393
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:24,467
crawling with cops already.

1394
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:31,374
- I'm tired of running.

1395
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:34,643
This is my night.

1396
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,979
My last night!

1397
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:40,916
- Yeah.

1398
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,551
- This town belongs
to The Rancors!

1399
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,053
(lights power down)

1400
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:46,389
(screaming)

1401
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,558
(maniacal laughing)

1402
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,364
What the fuck you waiting for?!

1403
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,032
Shoot the motherfucker!

1404
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:59,668
(gunfire)

1405
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,839
(laughter gets louder)

1406
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,920
(gunshot)

1407
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,429
- Guns, guns are for pussies.

1408
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,864
You want to get to Cordova?

1409
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:35,571
You gotta go through me,
motherfucker.

1410
01:24:36,972 --> 01:24:38,607
You wanna dance, clown boy?

1411
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,075
Let's dance!

1412
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,911
(gunshot)

1413
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:05,234
- Die!
(gunshots)

1414
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:08,404
(maniacal laughing)

1415
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,509
(gun clicks)

1416
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:18,013
(gunshot)

1417
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:21,116
(Cordova groaning)

1418
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:50,673
(screaming)

1419
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,515
(gunshots)

1420
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,960
Mercy, please!

1421
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:15,898
(gunshot)

1422
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,839
(knocking)

1423
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:27,476
- What the hell happened to you?

1424
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,744
- Cordova.

1425
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:29,545
- The cop?

1426
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:30,713
- Can I come in?

1427
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:32,448
- Yeah, of course.

1428
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,890
You sure you're okay?

1429
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:52,468
Can I get you anything to drink?

1430
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:54,803
- Coffee if you have it.

1431
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:56,572
- [Jake] Of course.

1432
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,116
- You never heard of Cordova
before the other day?

1433
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,785
- I've heard you mention him a

1434
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:13,456
few times, but other than that
not really.

1435
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,792
- That's interesting.

1436
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:21,196
- What's with the cloak
and dagger, Kate?

1437
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,131
I feel like you're
interrogating me.

1438
01:28:23,265 --> 01:28:25,167
- Just want to make sure
you didn't know.

1439
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,268
- Know about what?

1440
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:28,303
You're not making any sense.

1441
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:29,738
- About JC.

1442
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,106
- JC?

1443
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:32,541
- And her affair (echo) affair.

1444
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:33,642
(dramatic sting)

1445
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:35,478
- What?

1446
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:37,813
- She went to him
after the murder.

1447
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:40,248
After she killed Barbara.

1448
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:49,358
(somber piano music)

1449
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,532
You know about this, Jake?

1450
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,003
- (sobs) They're gonna
catch me, baby,

1451
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:03,906
they're gonna catch me,
what do I do?!

1452
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:06,008
- I'll take care of it.

1453
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,210
Wink.

1454
01:29:09,612 --> 01:29:13,115
- But one thing wasn't
making sense to me.

1455
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:14,617
What about Mark?

1456
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:18,921
Talk to me Jake (echo) Jake!

1457
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:20,288
Say something!

1458
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:25,193
(phone rings)

1459
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:27,663
Kate, Homicide.

1460
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:29,732
When?

1461
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,367
No, I can't.

1462
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:35,170
Yeah, I'm recovering.

1463
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,238
Send Brock.

1464
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:40,342
All right, put me in the loop.

1465
01:29:40,476 --> 01:29:42,344
That was the station.

1466
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:44,012
Cordova was found mangled with

1467
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:46,348
bullets in his night club.

1468
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:51,219
The Laughing Mask of Vengeance

1469
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:54,890
was in your damn book
title the entire time.

1470
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:57,025
Jake, you're sick.

1471
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,360
You need help.

1472
01:29:58,494 --> 01:29:59,595
Put those on.

1473
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:04,600
I let you get Cordova.

1474
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,268
God help me I did.

1475
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,405
Everyone is dead.

1476
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:13,576
Every member of The Rancors
is dead.

1477
01:30:14,843 --> 01:30:17,713
It's not gonna
bring Barbara back.

1478
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,385
We know where
she's buried, Jake.

1479
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:27,723
(ominous music)
(old blues scat singing)

1480
01:30:40,703 --> 01:30:42,137
- I did it, love.

1481
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:43,972
I left him.

1482
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:49,978
(chuckles) Yeah.

1483
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,580
We're almost out.

1484
01:30:54,817 --> 01:30:57,119
Well can you get some more?

1485
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:02,390
I'll make it worth your while.

1486
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,160
Yeah.

1487
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:10,633
Love you.

1488
01:31:18,574 --> 01:31:20,609
(gasps)

1489
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,013
Who the fuck are you?!

1490
01:31:30,252 --> 01:31:33,622
(acoustic guitar music)

1491
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:37,192
* I don't want to set

1492
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,728
* The world on fire
- Jake, I can help you.

1493
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,664
I can help you, Jake.

1494
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,004
* I just want to start
- Yes Jake, I can help you.

1495
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:53,241
* A flame in your heart

1496
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:56,011
- Stay back!

1497
01:31:56,144 --> 01:31:57,345
I'm gonna get Jake some help and

1498
01:31:57,479 --> 01:31:58,847
you're gonna go away.

1499
01:31:58,981 --> 01:31:59,882
You're gonna go--

1500
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,384
(screaming)

1501
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:10,125
* And that one is you

1502
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,630
* No other will do
- I know you're in there Jake.

1503
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:16,198
(maniacal laughing)

1504
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:17,399
Fight him!

1505
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,501
Fight him!

1506
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:24,673
* I've lost all ambition
for worldly acclaim

1507
01:32:24,807 --> 01:32:29,011
* I just want to be
the one you love

1508
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:35,718
* And with your admission
that you feel the same

1509
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:40,055
* I'll have reached the goal
I'm dreaming of, believe me

1510
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:45,694
* I don't want to set
the world on fire

1511
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:55,203
* I just want to start
a flame in your heart

1512
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:03,311
(phone rings)

1513
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:10,152
* I don't want to set
the world on fire, honey

1514
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:13,889
* I love you too much

1515
01:33:14,022 --> 01:33:15,390
* I just want to start

1516
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,125
- [Voiceover] 911,
what's your emergency?

1517
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:18,927
* A great big flame
- [Voiceover] Hello?

1518
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:23,365
* Down in your heart
- [Voiceover] Hello, hello?

1519
01:33:23,498 --> 01:33:25,968
* You see
- [Voiceover] Are you okay?

1520
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:28,170
Hello, is anyone there?

1521
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:30,405
* Way down inside of me

1522
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:35,477
* Darling, I have only one
desire

1523
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,847
* And that one desire is you

1524
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:43,218
* And I know nobody else
ain't gonna do

1525
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:52,160
* I've lost all ambition
for worldly acclaim

1526
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:57,966
* I just want to be
the one you love

1527
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:04,940
* And with you admission
that you feel the same

1528
01:34:05,073 --> 01:34:09,277
* I'll have reached the goal
I'm dreaming of, believe me

1529
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:15,183
* I don't want to set
the world on fire

1530
01:34:21,023 --> 01:34:25,260
* I just want to start
a flame in your heart *

1531
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:36,705
- [Maria] My department
has prepared a statement.

1532
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:39,307
Our department is deeply
saddened by the loss of

1533
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:44,246
decorated officers Kate
O'Malley and Alejandro Cordova.

1534
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:45,814
Our thoughts and prayers
are with

1535
01:34:45,948 --> 01:34:49,051
the families at this
difficult time.

1536
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,053
I visited them today and spoke

1537
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,789
with Kate's daughter Nancy.

1538
01:34:53,922 --> 01:34:56,524
She is too young to
understand this injustice,

1539
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:58,326
but I assure you that justice

1540
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:01,596
will be served on her behalf.

1541
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:03,732
A daughter has lost her mother,

1542
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:07,870
this department has
lost two of its finest.

1543
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:10,038
We will not rest
until this masked

1544
01:35:10,172 --> 01:35:13,508
vigilante is behind bars.

1545
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,678
- [Voiceover] What can you
tell us about James Thompson?

1546
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:19,247
- James Thompson, otherwise
known as "The Wog",

1547
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,216
escaped from custody
wounding Officer

1548
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:24,486
Brock Washington in the process.

1549
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:27,389
He is to be considered
extremely dangerous.

1550
01:35:27,522 --> 01:35:29,457
That is all, thank you.

1551
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:37,732
- You son of a bitch,
I'll kill you.

1552
01:35:37,866 --> 01:35:40,836
* You know it's a sin
to tell a lie

1553
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:45,874
* Still you keep saying
I love you

1554
01:35:46,008 --> 01:35:50,979
* It may be true, I wish I knew

1555
01:35:51,113 --> 01:35:55,350
* But I'm giving
fair warning to you

1556
01:35:58,553 --> 01:36:02,757
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1557
01:36:06,061 --> 01:36:09,697
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1558
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,636
- [Voiceover] What's wrong
with you?

1559
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,205
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

1560
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:19,875
- [Voiceover] Let me out!

1561
01:36:20,008 --> 01:36:23,111
* Just because these words
were spoken

1562
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:25,047
- Let me out of here!

1563
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:30,585
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

1564
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:37,625
* If you break my heart I'll die

1565
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:44,499
* So be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1566
01:36:47,502 --> 01:36:48,937
- You're sick, you sick bastard,

1567
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:50,605
let me out of here, come on!

1568
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:51,706
Come on!

1569
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,477
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1570
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:01,850
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1571
01:37:04,419 --> 01:37:08,023
* It's a sin to tell a lie

1572
01:37:11,459 --> 01:37:15,230
- No, get me out of
here, get me out of here!

1573
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:21,870
* Just because these words
were spoken

1574
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:23,471
- [Voiceover] No!

1575
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:27,542
Come on man, stop!

1576
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:34,482
* If you break my heart,
I'll cry

1577
01:37:37,552 --> 01:37:41,789
* So be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1578
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:45,360
- No, stop, come on!

1579
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:48,363
Let me out, no, no!

1580
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,099
No, no!
(cutting noise)

1581
01:37:51,233 --> 01:37:54,569
(maniacal laughter)
(screaming)

1582
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:58,907
* It's a sin to tell a lie *

1583
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:09,151
(classical jazz music)

1584
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:32,567
* Be sure it's true
when you say I love you

1585
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:40,275
* It's sin to tell a lie

1586
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,984
* Millions of hearts
have been broken

1587
01:39:53,888 --> 01:39:58,060
* Just because these words

1588
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:05,033
* I love you, yes I do,
I love you

1589
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:10,672
* If you break *
