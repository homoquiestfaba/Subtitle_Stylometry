You know the sad,

33

Looks like a poster child

34

35
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,848
Oh, Dan.

36
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,618
When I was a young boy,

37
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,588
Satan came to me as an
imaginary friend.

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,192
Daniel,
what are you doing?

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,963
I had no clue
as to what Satan really was.

40
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,330
I'm a monster.

41
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,000
You'd
be surprised, buddy.

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,300
For
thousands of years,

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,071
Satan has corrupted
the souls of men.

44
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,409
Out of spite and jealousy.

45
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,946
Satan,
I asked you to stop putting

46
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,581
body parts in the freezer.

47
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,281
For it is through his seed

48
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,552
that he can
create the Antichrist.

49
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,621
You really
like this girl, right?

50
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,023
Every time I talk to her,

51
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:36,524
every time she talks,
I just freeze.

52
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,527
This time,
let me hold the ring.

53
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,328
For
the last time,

54
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,731
Satan, you can not
possess my mortal soul.

55
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,499
Then, what happens?

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,136
I don't actually know
for sure.

57
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,972
But that shit
is definitely bad.

58
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:53,708

a title contender?

you don't wanna fight?

87

you're not worth the fight.

I mean, I know I gotta tell
Quinn before anyone else does.

92
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,153
Why would you go
to any promoter

93
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:46,521
without telling me first?

94
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,321
I was gonna
tell you about the fight.

95
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,726
But I needed to wait
till the time was right.

96
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,929
If you were to do this,
how would you win?

97
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,631
I'm gonna try my best.

98
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,867

Okay, fine, God!

175
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,013
Here's to...

176
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,182
beer in a bottle.

177
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,684
Yeah.

178
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,671
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,440
Sounded
like something caught it.

180
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:33,894
Fucking Jesus Christ.

181
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,584
Mr. Buford. Mr. Buford.

182
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:56,884
Jesus fucking Christ.

183
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,919
You just gave me
a heart attack.

184
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,021
Sir, Ferg is dead.

185
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,358
-What?
-Uh, I-- I don't know.

186
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,027
We-- we-- we were out there,
and-- and a broken beer bottle

187
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,163
came out of the woods
and stabbed him in the chest.

188
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,334
Well...

189
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:14,802
...did you see who it was?

190
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,237
I didn't see who it was.

191
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,872
It's dark out there.
I can't see fuck all.

192
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,774
All right.

193
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,209
Okay, uh...

194
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,679
you stay here.

195
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,548
Call Gus,
he's-- he's in town.

196
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,749
I'm gonna go see
what's going on.

197
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,251
Why call Gus?

198
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,920
Think it through, brainless.

199
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,557
It's the end of summer,
and we've got

200
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:37,358
counselors coming up
this weekend.

201
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,962
You have got to tell them,
not to come here.

202
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,965
You're right.

203
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,889
<i>All right, folks,</i>

204
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,289
<i>opening credits are over</i>
<i>so pay attention</i>

205
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,625
<i>'cause this part's important,</i>
<i>it comes back</i>

206
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,159
<i>into play later</i>
<i>in the story.</i>

207
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,462
Hello.

208
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,732
Hi, mom.

209
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,101
Yes, mom.
I'm gonna be home all weekend.

210
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,603
Casey's not gonna be alone.

211
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,173
Uh, who's gonna come over?

212
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,708
All of my friends
are gonna be at camp.

213
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,778
No, they're not getting paid
for the counselors' weekend.

214
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,513
Am I getting paid
to watch Casey?

215
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,750
Hmm.

216
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,618
Yeah. No, I know.

217
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,288
Okay.

218
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,490
Okay.

219
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,661
Love you too. Bye.

220
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:11,205
Hello?

221
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,974
Hey, Mary. Goddamn.

222
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,276
You-- you answered fast,
you know that?

223
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,948
Andy? That's insane.
I was just about to call you.

224
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,248
<i>Yeah, no. I know.</i>

225
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,016
I know, I can, you know,
I can-- I can sense

226
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,418
these things, babe.

227
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,186
<i>Andy, are you smoking?</i>

228
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,256
I'm not smoking a cigarette.

229
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,758
- Andy!
<i>- What?</i>

230
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,426
<i>Hey, we talked about this.</i>

231
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,228
Yeah, you know,
the boys are over

232
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,930
and you said you don't have
a problem with grass.

233
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,632
It's not like I'm smoking
a dart or something.

234
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,268
Yeah.

235
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,706
<i>So, off the hook, yeah?</i>

236
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,174
Yeah. Yeah. Off the hook.

237
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,309
Great, 'cause, babe,
let me tell you something.

238
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,111
I've got something that's
going to cheer you right up.

239
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,580
Guess where
you're coming tomorrow?

240
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,148
Camp, with us.

241
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,818
Ugh, Andy,
don't even say that.

242
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:58,887
It's just gonna make me upset.

243
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,923
-You know I can't come.
-And, why is that?

244
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,324
Because I promised my mom,
I'd watch Casey.

245
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,728
<i>You promised?</i>

246
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:08,362
Yes.

247
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,399
Okay.
What exactly did you promise?

248
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,035
<i>Just that I would watch Casey.</i>

249
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,104
Just that you would watch her?

250
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,139
You didn't say
where you'd be watching her?

251
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,943
No. I just said
that she wouldn't be alone.

252
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,979
Okay. So, bingo-bango, babe.
That's problem solved.

253
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,814
All you gotta do is
you bring her with you.

254
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,316
You can even tell mom and pop
that you're bringing her.

255
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,685
She's not gonna be alone.

256
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,120
<i>She's gonna be</i>
<i>the exact opposite of alone.</i>

257
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,289
Andy...

258
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,057
...don't be ridiculous.

259
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,960
Look, Mary,
I really didn't want to

260
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,160
bring this up, okay?

261
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,864
But this is
a very key stage

262
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:44,398
in our relationship

263
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,901
if-- if I'm just left
unattended,

264
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,703
like-- like
a free range buck,

265
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:51,471
you know, to my own devices
for a whole weekend.

266
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:52,974
Who's-- who's to say
what can happen?

267
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,142
I could really be swept
right off of my feet,

268
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,443
<i>right off from under you.</i>

269
00:17:56,544 --> 00:18:00,080
Oh, yeah? By who?
Chester and Noah?

270
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,885
Stranger things have happened,
you know.

271
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,787
Somehow,
I just doubt that.

272
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,656
<i>All right, look, Mary,</i>
<i>I'm gonna come by your place</i>

273
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,325
<i>at nine am tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

274
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,493
If you don't want me to come,
then just say, "Stay away,"

275
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,162
right now, and I won't do it,
all right?

276
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,496
How's that?

277
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,369
<i>Say, "Andy, I do not</i>
<i>want you to come pick me up.</i>

278
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,738
<i>"I'd much rather stay home.</i>

279
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,740
"And, in fact,
I never even cared about you

280
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,809
in the first place."
Just say that and I won't come.

281
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,176
Okay, babe?

282
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,548
So, I'll see you at nine?

283
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,152
I'll think about it.

284
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,354
So, I'll see you at nine?

285
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,557
I will-- I will think about it.

286
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,792
Mary!

287
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,495
- Yeah?
<i>- I'll see ya.</i>

288
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,231
I'll see ya.

289
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,823
Casey?

290
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,359
Are you packed
for the weekend?

291
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,674
- Hi.
- Hey, ladies.

292
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:12,613
There she is,
prettiest girl on this planet.

293
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,315
You know, your sister
does not look bad either,

294
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,584
does she, Case?

295
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:19,654
Ugh,
oh, and speaking of Casey,

296
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,155
you owe her $10.

297
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,356
-Do I, now?
-Mm-hmm.

298
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,226
My parents think I'm staying
home with her this weekend.

299
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,261
So, we're buying her silence.

300
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,497
Naturally.
Of course, we are.

301
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,232
Case, I better not see
more than $10

302
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,534
missing from there, okay?

303
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,770
No promises.

304
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,573
Very funny.
You ladies ready to get going?

305
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:39,874
Yup.

306
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,343
Wait, why am I
the only kid coming to camp?

307
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,412
Uh, well, you know,
at the end of the summer,

308
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:46,948
when the kids all go home,

309
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,050
they let
the counselors come back.

310
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,383
Kinda run the show
for a weekend.

311
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,787
But don't you guys get bored
without kids?

312
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,356
Usually, yeah. We do.

313
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,126
Um, this year, you're coming,
so we're not gonna have

314
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,426
- that problem.
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,499
- Oh, there she--
Yeah.

316
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,968
I don't know how she does--

317
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,503
how you just fall asleep
like that?

318
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,705
-God, I wish I could do that.
-I resent her for it

319
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:11,706
if I'm being honest.

320
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,141
Baby,
I'm just glad she likes me.

321
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,809
Baby,
everybody likes you.

322
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,944
Thank you.

323
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,679
I really hate the way

324
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,048
this new haircut makes
my ears look...

325
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,684
I just really don't like it.

326
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,087
You lose points, by the way,
for not noticing.

327
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:30,290
I noticed. I-- I could tell
you didn't like it.

328
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,593
So, I pretended not to notice.

329
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,662
You're hilarious.

330
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:37,364
But seriously,

331
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,768
I just-- I can be
really sensitive about it.

332
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,003
Can you just make sure

333
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,204
they don't make fun of me,
okay?

334
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,739
What are you talking about?

335
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,708
You know how the guys can be.
They can be such assholes.

336
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,943
Just...

337
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,712
promise you won't let them
make fun of me.

338
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,714
Yeah. I promise.

339
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,951
Okay.

340
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,853
Ready to go?
Let's get going.

341
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,878
- Ready?
- Yeah.

342
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,149
Boys, boys, boys.

343
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:31,285
What's up?
Big weekend. Jer Bear.

344
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,520
- What's up, man?
- Looking good?

345
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,222
- How you doing?
- So boys,

346
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:35,388
how'd you get up there?

347
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,292
So, did you talk
to him about it yet?

348
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,963
Shh. No, I haven't
talked to him about it yet.

349
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,598
Why? Come on.

350
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:47,001
I just really want this weekend
to be about having fun, Trish.

351
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,302
You can have some fun.

352
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,005
Some little alone time fun
with Andy.

353
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,807
Look, I just..

354
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:55,408
I don't really think
I'm ready for that yet.

355
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay. Fine.

356
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,582
I just want you to, so badly.

357
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,951
I know you're ready.
It's fun.

358
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,687
I-- when I'm ready,

359
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,623
I know exactly
who to come talk to.

360
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:10,057
I can give you some tips.

361
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,826
Oh, I know you can.

362
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:14,394
All right.
I'm calling the boys.

363
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,763
Let's do it.

364
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:49,130
Yell-o.

365
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:52,800
-Chez.
-Oh, it's Chez?

366
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,602
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.

367
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:56,170
Hold on.
Andy wants to talk to you.

368
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,807
Yo, what's up, man?

369
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,309
- Andy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

370
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,077
Uh, just letting you know,
we're leaving, like, right now.

371
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,478
So, we'll be there
in half hour, 35 minutes.

372
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,580
<i>Sounds good, brother.</i>

373
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,149
All right. Sweet.

374
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,452
Hey, man.
Call him an idiot.

375
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:14,055
- Hey, Andy.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

376
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:16,223
<i>You're the best.</i>

377
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:19,727
Thank you, man.
All right, I'll see you later.

378
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,231
What's the plan?
- What's up, baby?

379
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,666
One love.

380
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,470
-You call him an idiot?
-No.

381
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:35,042
-Can you not hear me?
-No.

382
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,549
After you.

383
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,057
We ready to go?

384
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,526
Born ready.

385
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,663
Trish, Jerry, Brett,

386
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:58,933
this is my little sissy, Casey.

387
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,169
Aw, I didn't know
you had a sister.

388
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,637
She looks just like you.

389
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:06,040
Well, she's actually
my stepsister, so...

390
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,209
Oh.

391
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,679
Sissy, what is a stepsister?
You never told me.

392
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,215
It's not important, Casey.
It doesn't matter.

393
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,119
-Jerry, are we ready to go?
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

394
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:23,190
On this vessel, I'm only to be
referred to as, Captain Jer.

395
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,192
And I'm ready.

396
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,262
I fucking hate Captain Jer.

397
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,698
By the way guys,
my dad gave me

398
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,767
his camera
to use for the weekend.

399
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:35,269
So, let's take some videos.
Here, Casey, get with Brett.

400
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,040
Cute.
Here, do you wanna try?

401
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,007
-Yeah.
-Okay.

402
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,776
Just push that button
right there.

403
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,613
<i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Oh, yes. Oh, yes, folks.</i>

404
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,214
<i>This next tune is called</i>

405
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,617
<i>"The Last Road Trip</i>
<i>You're Ever Gonna Take"</i>

406
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,185
<i>by the Darts.</i>

407
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,848
- Get him.
- Get him.

408
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,517
- Get him, get him!
- Get his ass.

409
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:23,684
Get his ass!

410
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:34,095
Get her foot
on the ceiling, babe.

411
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,463
Whoa.

412
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,532
Whoa, look at that.
Loving it.

413
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,233
Now, give me--

414
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,801
You're fed up with the world.

415
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,311
I'm literally
gonna kill you in two seconds.

416
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:51,912
Oh, yeah?
Two seconds?

417
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,614
Two seconds.
One, two--

418
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:54,782
You're not gonna touch
my girl,

419
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:56,250
you're not gonna touch her.

420
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:23,010
Motherfucker.

421
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,646
You smoking in my kitchen?
Get the fuck out of here, man.

422
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,381
-Get out of here.
-My bad. My bad. My bad.

423
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,817
-You want?
-No, get out of here.

424
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,298
You gonna pass that?

425
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,302
Shit.

426
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:55,743
What the fuck?

427
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,111
Devon, man.

428
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,514
You scared
the shit out of us.

429
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:00,814
How long
y'all two been out here?

430
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,449
What time is it?

431
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,451
- 8:30.
- Shit.

432
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:07,955
Man, we've been out here
for like

433
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,791
five hours now.

434
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,561
So, you mean to tell me
y'all two clowns

435
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,928
been out here smoking it up,
chilling.

436
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,362
I'm in there
working on Mr. Chekov

437
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:17,064
trying to cook food
for you fools for this weekend.

438
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,832
And y'all couldn't even come in
to help?

439
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,435
Sorry, man.

440
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,771
But, uh, duty calls.

441
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:26,641
Duty calls, man. Duty calls.

442
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,878
At least let
me get in a hit, then--

443
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,248
Yeah, of course, man.
You earned it.

444
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:37,251
Here.

445
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,803
You, lazy son of a
bitches.

446
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,573
Sorry, Mr. Chekov.

447
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:00,007
My ass.

448
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,243
Anyway, there's food
for the weekend

449
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,844
and I have to go.

450
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,281
Oh, shit, me too.
Hey, Mr. Chekov.

451
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,283
You still got
that Walkman in there?

452
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,752
Oh, yes, my friend.
I almost forgot it.

453
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:14,054
-It's in my office.
-Hey, Mr. Chekov.

454
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:15,657
You still keep
your gun in there, too?

455
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,358
Yes, Chester. I do.

456
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,727
In fact, I keep it

457
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,529
in the right top hand drawer,
to be exact.

458
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:24,599
Very cool, man.

459
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:25,933
Very cool.

460
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,235
Yeah. Hope
no one forgets where it is.

461
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,337
Just in case
it becomes useful later.

462
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:33,974
Don't go fuck around with it.
It's not a toy.

463
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,087
Yeah, I'll get your bag.

464
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,343
Aw. You can't stay the weekend?

465
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:11,546
Can't even do it.

466
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:12,946
Well...

467
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:15,717
where are you guys' cars?

468
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,752
Oh, other
lot on the far side.

469
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:21,088
Okay. Well,
maybe we see you in the Fall?

470
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,990
I'll be around.

471
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:25,826
See ya.

472
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,363
Boys.

473
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,006
I don't remember
bringing any bags.

474
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,141
I loaded them up
when no one was looking.

475
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,310
All right.
Good enough for me.

476
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,580
You ladies get bored without
us?

477
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,748
- Yes.
- Brett.

478
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,382
Always
bored without you.

479
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,452
Land ho!

480
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,288
What?

481
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,725
Like "land ho," you know,
the vessel arrived.

482
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,025
Land ho!

483
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,662
We arrived
like seven minutes ago.

484
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:03,430
- I don't know, man--
- To the cabin, then.

485
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,235
What's up,
smallish girl?

486
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:12,272
-Hi, I'm Casey.
-I'm Chester.

487
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,042
Do you know
you guys owe me $10?

488
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,244
What? For real?

489
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:19,313
Mm-hmm.

490
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,682
Each.

491
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:24,017
-Wha-- what? Such bullshit.
-Huh?

492
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:25,553
Nothing.

493
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:32,560
Fuck that girl, dude.

494
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,596
For real, man. For real.

495
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,267
You ready, man?

496
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:41,803
Yeah, man.
It's been a little while.

497
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,370
All right. All right.
All right.

498
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,808
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

499
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,442
Let's start.

500
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:14,268
I don't want to fucking do this
with you, anymore, Jer.

501
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,970
It's been--
it's been a while, man.

502
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,589
Step into my office.

503
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:42,664
Come on.

504
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:44,566
All right.

505
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,802

Thank you. Thank you.

523
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,911
Encore. Encore.

524
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:13,881
I don't think he knows
any other songs, do you, babe?

525
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:15,349
I don't.

526
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,317
Boo. What else you got?

527
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:19,821
Gee...

528
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:21,455
I don't know.

529
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,193
How about
a spooky campfire story?

530
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,595
Ooh. Yes. Yes. Yes.

531
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,666
So, I mean,
I can only assume

532
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,768
you guys have heard about
the-- the massacre

533
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,036
here in 78, right?

534
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,704
At this very campsite?

535
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:39,206
I thought that was just a myth.

536
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,875
Think again.

537
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,813
It was a dark
and spooky night.

538
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,883
You know,
it was a lot like tonight,

539
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:50,084
-wasn't it, Mary?
-You know what?

540
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,218
Now that
you mentioned it, Andy.

541
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,655
It was a lot like tonight.

542
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,858
There were exactly...

543
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,458
...seven people
on the grounds

544
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,193
that night, weren't there?

545
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:05,298
And, a little girl.

546
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:10,370
Some, nut-job, lunatic,
psycho...

547
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,272
busted out of an insane asylum,

548
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,208
and paid this very camp...

549
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,111
a little visit.

550
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:20,048
A visit
that would forever change

551
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:23,985
this camp's name
to Camp Murder.

552
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:25,820
Duh, duh, duh.

553
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,556
He donned himself in all black.

554
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:31,793
Black sweater, pants,
boots, gloves.

555
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:35,663
And a mask,
with reflective lenses.

556
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,600
A shadow for the eyes.

557
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,637
One by one,

558
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,906
he picked them off
with his hatchet.

559
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:51,211
Chop. Chop. Chop.

560
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:55,282
You know, by the time
he was finished,

561
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,450
there was less left

562
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,219
of the campers' bodies
than wasn't.

563
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,756
- Uh-huh.
- It took them days

564
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,991
to figure out
whose parts were whose.

565
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,361
They say he still walks
these very grounds

566
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:12,867
to this day,
waiting to strike again.

567
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,234
Heard it.

568
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,971
Whoa, heavy.

569
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,711
For sure.

570
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,446
And on that note,
I'm gonna go in.

571
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:32,620
I think
I'm gonna head in too.

572
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,454
Great timing there,
old buddy.

573
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,057
Got nothing
to do with timing, Brett.

574
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:37,625
It's a little thing
called pacing.

575
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,794
It's only Thursday night,
we've got a long weekend

576
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,261
of debauchery ahead of us.

577
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,797
That, we do.

578
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:54,575
Man,
that's a pretty spooky story.

579
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,477
I mean,
for everyone besides me.

580
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,847
Boo.

581
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:00,948
Ow.

582
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:06,154
So, uh,
how was my timing?

583
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:12,392
Are you referring
to Brett the Jet's comments?

584
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:13,961
No.

585
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,264
Much as I hate to admit it.

586
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:24,471
I-- I--
I don't think I'm ready.

587
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,675
But I'm getting close.

588
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,477
It's okay, hey, no, no.
No, no, it's all right.

589
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,014
No pressure,
no pressure at all.

590
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:35,082
It's just
the wellbeing of my loins

591
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:36,416
we're talking about.

592
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,451
You know, they could just
stop working, fall off

593
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,021
and we won't be able
to have kids.

594
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,222
But it's the risk

595
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,489
we're going to have
to take, I guess.

596
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,859
-Oh, God, shut up.
-It could happen.

597
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:52,033
So, uh, kids, huh?

598
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,400
What?

599
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,571
You, um, you just said
"kids" back there.

600
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,474
I don't know
if we should get that far

601
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:02,944
ahead of ourselves, babe.

602
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,478
Maybe someday?

603
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,015
Sure.

604
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,021
Sure, yeah. Maybe someday.

605
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:18,526
What?

606
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:25,566
I thought I saw something.

607
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:28,803
Give me
a fucking heart attack.

608
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,806
Do that again, I'm going
to start withholding sex.

609
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,515
Coming?

610
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,609
Get up, bitch,
we're going to the lake.

611
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,443
Up, up, up,
let's go.

612
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,117
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

613
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:52,452
We're going to the lake,
we're going to go to the lake.

614
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,522
-Okay, okay.
-Come on, come on, come on.

615
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,692
Fuck me.

616
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:06,300
Do you guys need help
with carrying--

617
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,601
Nah.

618
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,378
<i>♪ Well I heard you talkin' ♪</i>

619
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,879
Brave this heat Mary.

620
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:21,582
Sixth grade,
three days undefeated.

621
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,485
Come on!

622
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,322
I told you it's gonna--

623
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:29,557
Bullshit!

624
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,225
Come on, Andy,
that's your fault.

625
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,863
<i>♪ I've got you under</i>
<i>my thumb, now baby ♪</i>

626
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,368
- All right!
- Don't worry about it Brett.

627
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,003
You can-- you feel it.

628
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:45,506
- I want the heat!
- You want the heat?

629
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:46,707
Strike her ass
out of here, bro.

630
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,342
No going easy on her!

631
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:49,910
Oh, you know.
Here comes the heat Mary.

632
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,012
Better get ready.

633
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,981
Let's go Mary!

634
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,185
-Hah!
-Oh, shit.

635
00:41:59,153 --> 00:42:02,056
- Hey!
- Oh, shit, she roped it.

636
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,158
Yeah, Mary!

637
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,227
Someone forgot to tell us
we're out of this game.

638
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,796
You bet your ass Chez.

639
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:15,202
That's a double.

640
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:17,038
Will you put
a fucking bow on it Andy?

641
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:18,739
If I knew you're gonna be
such a pussy,

642
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,241
I wouldn't have picked you
on my team.

643
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,409
Would you chill out?

644
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,476
We're going
to fucking win anyway.

645
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:23,577
How?

646
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:25,579
I'll carry you.
Don't worry about it.

647
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,249
Nobody carries
"The Jet," bro. Okay?

648
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,550
You can eat shit and die.

649
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,086
Eat shit and live, Brett.

650
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,725
Brett.

651
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:39,960
Brett.

652
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,329
I don't want to be
in the water anymore.

653
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,632
I'm trying to win
a game here, okay?

654
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,167
Go--
go stand in your position.

655
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,169
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Go stay in your position.

656
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,404
Trying to win a game.

657
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:52,606
-Do not talk to me.
-Lock it in...

658
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,175
-Do not talk to me.
-... over there.

659
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:55,276
Little prissy.

660
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:59,113
- Hey, Jerry.
- Ah, hey.

661
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:02,517
You wanna look
for shells or something?

662
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:04,051
Ah, we gotta-- we gotta play.

663
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,987
I'm so-- I-- I--

664
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,656
-Brett, Brett.
-Don't look at me!

665
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,192
Seriously,
don't look at me right now.

666
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,660
I'm not talking to you.

667
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:18,199
Swing and a miss!
I cannot be stopped.

668
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,936
Brett, can you do something
about this, please?

669
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:24,738
I don't-- sorry.

670
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,975
Batter up. Let's go.

671
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:32,581
<i>♪ I'm going away,</i>
<i>I'm going away ♪</i>

672
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,881
I didn't touch it.

673
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:43,290
All right, everybody,

674
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,666
The Jet has finally arrived.

675
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:53,868
-Mary...
-Boo!

676
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:55,703
...don't think
I didn't remember

677
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:57,238
what you did last inning.

678
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,740
Guess what?
Andy's not here to save you.

679
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,975
And that ball's coming straight

680
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:02,443
for those big
ass ears of yours.

681
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,351
Yeah, right.

682
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,156
Ah, fuck, babe!

683
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,993
My bad. Sorry. Throw back.

684
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,730
Okay. Ball one.

685
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:32,373
And that boy
is out of here, baby.

686
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:33,707
Call it game.

687
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,409
All right,
good game, everybody.

688
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,145
Losers carry the cooler back,
sorry, I don't make the rules.

689
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:47,221
- Losers!
- I am so sorry.

690
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:57,264
-You ready man?
-Oh, yeah, brother.

691
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:47,381
So, let's blaze it up.

692
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:01,696
Hey, man,
I think we should, like,

693
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:03,330
have girlfriends.

694
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,802
-What for, bro?
-I don't know.

695
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:10,739
Seems like
everybody else has one

696
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,139
asides us.

697
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,276
Makes us kind of feel
like the odd mans out.

698
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,279
Jerry doesn't
have a girlfriend.

699
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,080
Yeah, that's Jerry.

700
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:22,082
Nobody likes that kid.

701
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,519
- That's true.
- Yeah.

702
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:26,420
I didn't think of that.

703
00:46:27,288 --> 00:46:29,624
You know, man,
we don't need girlfriends

704
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:31,258
to not feel like
the odd man out.

705
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,031
You mean that?

706
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,501
Yeah, man. You got to joint.

707
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,407
This is about cashed out,
so, I'm gonna head back, okay?

708
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,511
Come on, man.
We'll smoke on the dock.

709
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:50,712
Will be the last time.

710
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:53,548
Yeah,
but I'm just kind of over it.

711
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:55,916
That's cool, man.

712
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:58,919
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

713
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,515
Oh!

714
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:42,657
Fuck it.

715
00:48:56,437 --> 00:49:00,274
Hey, hey, hey. No!
No, hey, ow! Uh, no!

716
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:05,145
No! No! No!

717
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,988
Water!

718
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:18,325
Water! Come on!

719
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,663
Oh, yeah!

720
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,718
- Casey.
- Where were you?

721
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,385
We were at the lake.

722
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:46,821
Yeah,
you were at the lake.

723
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:48,188
You realize
you left me here?

724
00:49:49,256 --> 00:49:51,926
-Hey, um, Andy?
-Yeah?

725
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,795
Can I talk to you
inside for a sec?.

726
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:55,095
Yeah.

727
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:58,967
- Uh, Trish?
- Yeah?

728
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,267
Can you, um--

729
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:03,738
Yes.

730
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:06,440
What is your name?

731
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,742
After you.

732
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,477
You know what?
I forgot.

733
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:14,582
Oh, okay.

734
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:21,054
So anybody wanna smoke
some ganj?

735
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,123
Fuck no.

736
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:38,540
What's up, babe?

737
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:42,309
I was hoping we could talk
about what happened back there.

738
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,444
Hey, babe,
I didn't pick the teams,

739
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:45,345
all right?

740
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:46,781
I can't just
toss you a gimme

741
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:48,016
every single time
you're at bat.

742
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:49,316
I gave you the one, right?

743
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:52,085
Not talking about that.

744
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:54,556
I'm talking about

745
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,791
how Brett said
that shit about my ears

746
00:50:56,891 --> 00:51:00,528
like I said he would
and you didn't do anything.

747
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:07,802
I'm sorry, babe.

748
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:12,239
Like, we specifically
talked about it, you know?

749
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:14,642
I know, I just...

750
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:17,311
I forgot, I forgot.

751
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,146
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say

752
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:20,480
other than I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

753
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:23,751
It's not about
what I want you to say.

754
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,989
It's like, I just, like,
want to feel like you hear me,

755
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,323
you know?

756
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:33,493
I don't-- I don't really
know what that means.

757
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:36,496
Babe, to be honest,
I mean, I made a mistake.

758
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:37,599
I feel, like,

759
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,433
you're kind of
making this out to be, like,

760
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:40,935
I purposely slighted you
or something,

761
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,202
I mean, I forgot something.

762
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,772
Well, does it not matter
to you that you promised?

763
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:46,440
I mean, like,

764
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:49,043
I specifically asked you
to promise and you did.

765
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:50,243
Okay,
why are you attacking me?

766
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,879
I mean, what,
do I not feel bad enough?

767
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,081
You want me to feel worse?

768
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,582
I can cry
or something if you want.

769
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:55,750
I'm not attacking you.

770
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:57,250
Andy, I feel, like,

771
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,418
every time we try to have

772
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,687
some sort of
serious conversation,

773
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:00,888
you get really defensive

774
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:02,624
and you say
that I'm attacking you.

775
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:04,191
Because it feels,
like, you're attacking.

776
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,660
- I'm not attacking you.
- Then what?

777
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,295
You're not attacking me,
what are you doing?

778
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:10,497
I mean, 'cause you're
beating around the bush.

779
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:11,966
Why? Is there something
you wanna say?

780
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:13,367
what are we talking about?

781
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,570
If you just listen
to me, I can tell you.

782
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,673
Okay, sorry. Please go.

783
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:24,812
I feel, like...

784
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,652
I feel, like,
you don't really commit to me,

785
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:31,753
you know?

786
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,454
No. No, I don't know.

787
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:35,790
You're my girlfriend, right?

788
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,224
I mean,
is that on a commitment?

789
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,761
Ah, yes, I just...

790
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:43,330
Do you ever feel, like...

791
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:47,101
do you ever feel, like,
everybody loves the Andy,

792
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,402
because...

793
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:53,173
because you don't really
stand by anything

794
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:54,474
or anyone?

795
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,544
What the fuck is that
even supposed to mean?

796
00:52:56,644 --> 00:52:58,412
I laugh
at some fucking joke

797
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:00,180
and now I don't stand
by my girlfriend?

798
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,984
You broke a promise

799
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,853
or forgot you even made one,
and you know what?

800
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,989
I can't tell which one
is worse at this point.

801
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,222
You never want
to have a conversation

802
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:10,725
about our future.

803
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:13,326
And every time we try to have
a serious conversation,

804
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:15,429
you just never happen
to want to have it.

805
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:19,299
Mary.
I'm 18 goddamn years old.

806
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:21,602
Okay?
What do you want from me?

807
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,271
You want me to get down
on my bended knee

808
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,773
and pull out
a diamond ring?

809
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,208
Gonna go throw
on my shining suit of armor

810
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,144
and go kick Brett's ass,
what do you want?

811
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:33,280
Yeah, I think
I can go for some ganj here,

812
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,481
let's go and do it.

813
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:36,249
You know,
I got a tent to set up.

814
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,251
Oh, right,
I forgot about that.

815
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,821
All right. Bye, Caitlin.

816
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:44,424
Why do you make
everything serious to me

817
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:45,927
into some kind of joke?

818
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,499
Not now, Casey. Seriously.

819
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,402
No, you can't just
leave me here, I'm your sister.

820
00:53:55,503 --> 00:53:57,205
God damn it, Casey,
you are not my sister,

821
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,706
can you just fuck off?

822
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:06,881
Great. Smooth, Mary.

823
00:54:06,981 --> 00:54:08,950
-Now we got to deal with this.
-Can you stop?

824
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,588
It's getting dark out.
Come on.

825
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,792
All right, fine. Let's go.

826
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:48,022
You know, they've been in there
for quite a while now, eh?

827
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:50,792
Yeah, I want to say
they got the tent set up,

828
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:51,893
what...

829
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:55,663
30 minutes ago?

830
00:54:56,396 --> 00:55:00,001
Now,
What can we do in a tent

831
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:01,301
in 30 minutes?

832
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,845
Brett the Jet, baby.

833
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:13,648
Trish.

834
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:16,584
Brett the Jet, baby!

835
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:22,056
Adamsville,
Brett the Jet, baby.

836
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:29,429
- I'm drawing a blank.
- Right?

837
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:33,466
Brett the Jet, baby.
Here he comes.

838
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:48,850
Ah, Trish.
Ah, here comes the jet.

839
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:50,651
Ah, it's at 30.

840
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:55,189
20. Ah, it's a ten.

841
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:57,525
What was that?

842
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,327
What?

843
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,561
I heard something outside.

844
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:03,197
A-- a noise?
We're outside, you know?

845
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:06,466
-What if someone's out there?
-Like pervin' us?

846
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:08,435
Yes, go check.

847
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,671
Hey, assholes.

848
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:14,308
See?
It's nothing. Come on.

849
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:15,843
I don't trust it.
Just go check.

850
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:19,113
Babe,
Jet was about to blast off.

851
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,849
Okay, you're not blasting shit
until you go check.

852
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,918
Fine.

853
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:28,689
Uh-oh. What do we have here?

854
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,732
It seems, like,

855
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:41,035
Brett has expelled
from the tent.

856
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:44,805
While Trish has, uh,

857
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:45,973
remained inside.

858
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,943
Yes, indeed.
Things have complicated.

859
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,912
Indeed, indeed.

860
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:04,859
Are you assholes out here?

861
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,696
You know, I'm going
to fuck you up if you are.

862
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,001
- Case!
- Casey!

863
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,871
Come on, Case.
Come on out.

864
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:18,706
Casey, I'm sorry.

865
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:22,343
Casey,
you're the best, little sissy,

866
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,911
please come back.

867
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:27,715
Mary, look...

868
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,484
you're-- you're right,
you were right.

869
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:32,920
I was being a dick, okay?

870
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:35,389
Let's just--
let's just find Casey,

871
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:36,657
and when we get back,

872
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:38,025
we'll have
a serious conversation, okay?

873
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,360
I promise.

874
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,228
Just like you promised
last time.

875
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:46,200
Fuck it, fuck it,
I tried, fuck it.

876
00:57:58,012 --> 00:57:59,479
Fucking bullshit.

877
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:01,481
Jet's taking a piss.

878
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,686
Don't want
to get you dirty, baby.

879
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:44,625
Ooh, we have contact.

880
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,529
You know, see,

881
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:50,131
I can definitely get myself
in the right headspace

882
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:51,599
to go round two that fast.

883
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:54,735
You know, Jerry,
it's hard for a lot of men,

884
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:58,172
but that's assuming
this still isn't round one.

885
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:05,913
Indubitably.

886
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:07,882
In doobie-dilly.

887
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:11,318
Shut up.

888
00:59:11,419 --> 00:59:13,287
Oh!

889
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:15,289
Attaboy, Brett.

890
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:16,857
Can't help it.

891
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,363
They don't call him "the Jet"
for nothing, man.

892
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:23,998
No.

893
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:36,410
Oh, fuck, dude,
she's fucking dead, man.

894
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:37,512
Fuck!

895
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,214
Dude,
where the fuck you going?

896
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:42,483
Where are you going, man?

897
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,018
I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

898
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:46,454
Dude, we got to go
get everyone else.

899
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:48,889
You can go on Chester's car,
buddy, I'm sorry, man.

900
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,958
No!
Chester has the keys.

901
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:53,794
I don't even know
where Chester is.

902
00:59:58,466 --> 00:59:59,867
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck.

903
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:05,906
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

904
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,547
<i>Ooh,</i>
<i>tough spot for Captain Jer.</i>

905
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:14,381
<i>Does he stay or does he go?</i>

906
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,451
Oh!

907
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:20,187
<i>I just hope he didn't forget</i>
<i>to check the back seat.</i>

908
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,115
- Casey!
- Case!

909
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:56,951
Casey, are you in here?

910
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,852
Come on Case,
don't mess around!

911
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:00,589
God damn it.

912
01:02:00,689 --> 01:02:02,022
I told you
she wasn't fucking in here.

913
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,625
It was worth a shot,
wasn't it?

914
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:05,893
Where is everyone?
We need help.

915
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,332
Jesus, Noah,
what happened to you?

916
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,133
Get the fuck out of here
right now.

917
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:15,169
Well-- slow down.
What are you talking about?

918
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,004
There's no time to slow down.

919
01:02:17,104 --> 01:02:20,074
Trish is dead,
and the van is gone.

920
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:21,175
What?

921
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,678
Jerry and I saw
someone kill Trish

922
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:25,513
and Brett's probably dead too,

923
01:02:25,614 --> 01:02:26,981
and then
Jerry took the van.

924
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:29,416
All right, Noah,
be serious for a second, man.

925
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:30,652
Are you fucking
with us or what?

926
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:33,655
-No, I'm not fucking--
-Jesus! Fuck!

927
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:37,091
Oh, my God!

928
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:43,297
Don't fucking touch it!

929
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:45,466
I'm just trying
to fucking help, all right?

930
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:54,842
Holy fucking shit.
He's dead.

931
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,314
All right, we gotta think,
we gotta think.

932
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,316
How the fuck are we going to
get out of here, seriously?

933
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:04,952
I don't know, he just said
Jerry took the van.

934
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:06,655
Well, I don't know.
Maybe he hasn't left yet.

935
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:08,556
- Ow!
- What is that?

936
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:13,894
They haven't left yet.

937
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:16,631
Fuck me!

938
01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:19,166
All right, we gotta
at least get to the road.

939
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,003
Oh, Chekov's gun.

940
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:25,139
Holy shit.
You're right.

941
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:26,807
It's probably still
in his office, let's go.

942
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:40,954
Hey, Jerry.
No, don't, just don't look.

943
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,956
Don't look, come here.

944
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:46,026
Yeah, we gotta go.
We gotta go. Come on.

945
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,562
-Jerry.
-Just go, we gotta go.

946
01:04:05,613 --> 01:04:09,083
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

947
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:12,086
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

948
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:14,254
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

949
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:16,924
Okay, you're fine.
You're okay, you're okay.

950
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,093
Okay? Uh, where
did he say that gun was?

951
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,028
Um, uh,
top right drawer.

952
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:22,496
-Go check it.
-Top right drawer!

953
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,435
Babe, is there a key here?
Is there a key?

954
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,904
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, God!

955
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,374
What, babe?

956
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:37,311
Chekov never left last night.

957
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,414
So, that means--

958
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:43,384
- He never made it to his car.
- Oh, yes.

959
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:51,125
Babe, catch.

960
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:54,461
Jesus, hey, um, babe,
maybe don't throw that, yeah?

961
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:55,563
Sorry.

962
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:58,633
He said other lot
on the far side, right?

963
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:00,067
- Yes.
- Let's get there then.

964
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,079
-Wait, where are we going?
-Not now baby, come on.

965
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,616
What are you talking about?
We have to go back for Casey.

966
01:05:16,116 --> 01:05:18,018
Mary, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

967
01:05:18,118 --> 01:05:19,486
What are you talking about?
Come on.

968
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:25,392
It doesn't look like there's
anybody left back there.

969
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:28,262
-Andy, stop it.
-We didn't find her.

970
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:30,297
Andy, stop it.

971
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,398
I'm sorry.

972
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,470
I just really don't think
it's a good idea.

973
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:38,238
I cannot believe
what I'm hearing from you

974
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:39,473
right now.

975
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:40,407
This is exactly

976
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:41,876
what we were
just fighting about.

977
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:43,243
-Come on, don't say that.
-Come on, Andy.

978
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:44,813
- It's not fair, stop it.
- Come on!

979
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:46,113
Stop it!

980
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:53,220
If you want me to be safe,
then come with me.

981
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,029
Baby, you know I have to.

982
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:21,315
Baby we got this, come on.

983
01:06:44,873 --> 01:06:47,675
Come on, don't go Mary,
please don't.

984
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,278
Fuck!

985
01:07:45,098 --> 01:07:47,267
Stay the fuck
away from my sister.

986
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,308
Sissy!

987
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:56,176
Casey.

988
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:57,779
Casey, you okay?

989
01:07:57,946 --> 01:07:59,346
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-Are you okay?

990
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:00,982
Okay, we gotta
get you out of here, okay?

991
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,650
Behind you!

992
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:17,865
No, no, no, no.
Please, please, please.

993
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,473
- Nice shot, babe.
- Andy.

994
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:01,909
Andy! Andy!

995
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:06,914
Come, babe. Come.

996
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:20,662
Andy!

997
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:26,199
Hey, Mary.

998
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:30,605
Andy,
we gotta get you out of here.

999
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:32,305
Let's get you out
of here, come on.

1000
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,143
No, no, no. Put me down.

1001
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,579
Just-- just put me down.

1002
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:48,656
You came back. You came back!

1003
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:52,927
You know I had to.

1004
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:57,598
I know, I know.

1005
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:02,837
Mary, I'm going
to be honest with you, okay?

1006
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:06,708
I don't think
I have a long time.

1007
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:11,713
Don't say that.
Don't fucking say that.

1008
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:15,415
Mary, I mean it.

1009
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:18,720
No.

1010
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:28,696
I love you.
More than anything.

1011
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:32,800
I love you more than that.

1012
01:10:33,668 --> 01:10:35,670
I love you more than that.

1013
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:51,451
Where's Case?

1014
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:54,421
-Where's Casey?
-Casey!

1015
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,664
Hey, Case.

1016
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,969
It looks like--

1017
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:10,505
looks like I will have to
stick around here for a minute,

1018
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:11,606
okay?

1019
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,244
Just take care of your sister
while I am gone.

1020
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:17,845
Okay,
can you do that for me?

1021
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:20,148
I promise.

1022
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:23,050
Oh, thanks Case.

1023
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:25,853
Mary.

1024
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,658
I'll see you.

1025
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,735
No, no, no, no, no.

1026
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:49,577
No, no, no, no, no.

1027
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:52,479
No!

1028
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:00,487
What Casey? What?

1029
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,564
We have to go.

1030
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:12,066
We gotta go.

1031
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,036
<i>Ooh, tough break for Andy.</i>

1032
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:51,072
You know, I bet
you would have finally put out

1033
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:53,574
<i>after that, too.</i>

1034
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,610

01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,846
