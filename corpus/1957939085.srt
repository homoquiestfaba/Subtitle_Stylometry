00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,463
Whoo-hoo!

484
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,270
Unh!

485
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,540
Show me some skin, baby!

486
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,485
- That's all right. We cuter than you anyway.
- We have better boobs.

487
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:34,719
- Headlights!
- You know what? You still suck!

488
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,557
Oh!

489
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:46,299
Hey, why don't you take it back
to the strip club, Charo?

490
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,464
Coochie, coochie, coochie,
coochie, coochie... Ooh!

491
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,169
- Dude, your balls!
- [Voice Cracking] My balls!

492
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,268
- Mandilon!
- Yeah!

493
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:59,649
- I think I wanna go home.
- Let's go home.

494
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,152
[Cheering Continues]
Hey! Yeah!

495
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,613
Ay, yi, yoi. I broke nail.

496
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,853
You broke her nail, you bitch!

497
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,588
[All]
Aww!

498
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,495
Here, good-lookin',
get a manicure. Hoo-hoo!

499
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,961
Olga! Just play. Forget about
your friggin' nails, okay? Just play.

500
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,408
- Unh!
- Hey, Pop, look who I found...
our sponsor, Mr. Wong.

501
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:30,812
- Ahh, Billy-san, me like this.
- Yeah.

502
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,146
- My nails!
- Are you making fun of us?

503
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,119
- Did they say my name on the loudspeaker?
- Oh, of course.

504
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,522
Everybody... The whole place
was chanting, “Wong! Wong!”

505
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,492
They went, like you
say in Japanese, loco.

506
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,326
- Loco! Yeah? Aha!
- Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:50,163
- You eye-ballin' me? What you
lookin' at? You don't know me!
- Oye, puta!

508
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,896
- They supposed to do that?
- [Tenspot] Oh, yeah.

509
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,168
- [Whistle Blowing]
- I told the girls, “Don't be intimidated.”

510
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,006
[Tenspot]
Right.

511
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,637
- Over here, the...
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

512
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,047
[Indistinct Arguing]

513
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,653
Remind me I gotta work
on the girls' etiquette.

514
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,423
All right, here's to the ladies.
You guys were great today! Yeah.

515
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,488
[Chuckles]

516
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,734
- Well, damn, was it somethin' I said?
- We got beat!

517
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,743
I no like competition “wolleyball.”
And they broke four of my nails!

518
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,836
We were a joke.
People were making fun of us.

519
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:39,213
Yeah, they were treatin' us
like we were... sex objects.

520
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,584
Champagne's right.
I mean, in here it's every girl for herself.

521
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,214
Out there I felt like
we were a part of something.

522
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,349
Yeah, and we was as good
as those white Westside bitches...

523
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,918
who pay my cousin minimum wage
to clean their toilets.

524
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,556
Look, look, look. Ladies, ladies.
All you guys gotta do is win...

525
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,602
and you're gonna turn
their jeers into cheers.

526
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,194
Easy for you to say, Tenspot.
They weren't laughin' at you.

527
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,933
Let 'em laugh all they want.
I don't give a damn if they laugh...

528
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,169
as long as they keep throwing
cash like that around.

529
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:09,042
What other team do you know
that made $2,900 in tips?

530
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,104
[Women]
Twenty-nine?

531
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,243
Billy said we got 2,500.

532
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,787
It is... It is 25.
I forgot to carry the one.

533
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,289
You know how I do that sometimes?
The one?

534
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,587
- [Champagne] Tenspot, you holdin' out on us?
- No!

535
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,118
'Cause I've been workin' too long and too hard
and gettin' sand in all the wrong places...

536
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,255
to take that from a brother.

537
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,891
- [Phone Ringing]
- Ooh, my phone. My phone, it just...

538
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,959
Hello? Hello?
Billy Cole Enterprises.

539
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,970
Uh-huh. Who's calling?

540
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,567
Cabo Wabo Tequila?

541
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:43,511
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The girls?
The girls! Yeah, they were great today.

542
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,516
I was just telling them
that they were great today.

543
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,076
You want to talk to us
about sponsorship?

544
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:53,647
Well, yeah, look. I'm sure that Mr. Cole
will be calling you back momentarily.

545
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:58,389
He's indisposed right now. And can I tell you,
I think your tequila is jammin'!

546
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,193
[Chuckles]
Yeah, yeah. Okay, thank you.

547
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,099
- Ladies, I think we just got us a sponsor.
- [Whooping]

548
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:13,539
Now, make sure you call me the minute
Anthony Hopkins gets in the car.

549
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,138
Yeah, man. I promise you
I'm gonna take care of you. Yeah, yeah.

550
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,240
Okay. All right, all right.
Cool, cool.

551
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,017
Hello. How do I look?

552
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,287
- Where did you get those clothes?
- Up there.

553
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,819
Those are Mr. Hopkins's.
You stole Anthony Hopkins's clothes?

554
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,195
We break into the man's house,
and you stole his clothes?

555
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,828
I didn't steal nothin'! I'm just borrowing them.
I think I look pretty dashing, don't you?

556
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,805
I think you should dash upstairs
and change clothes.

557
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,479
What in the hell is that?

558
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,227
- Carlos, right?
- Si

559
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,926
Yeah.
Carlos, you're a houseboy.

560
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,267
You don't come in here and just plop down
on the couch and just start eating. Right?

561
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:18,332
- Si
- Okay. No sittee on couchee.

562
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,935

563
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,675

Oh, Carlos.

567
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,926
From now on
your name is Chin Cho.

568
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,986
Si.

569
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,063
[Chuckles]
I thought we needed some houseboys.

570
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,229
You know, give it a little class.
I got him from Wong.

571
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,399
By the way... [Coughs]
we're gonna need a butler.

572
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,943
Your name will be... Hamilton.

573
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,274
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Ho! Get the door, will ya?

574
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,783
- Where are you going?
- Hey, I need an entrance.

575
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,079
You need a sedative
is what you need, man. [Muttering]

576
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,386
Hamilton.
What kind of name is that?

577
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:13,556
Hey, uh, Hopkins resi... Ooh, I mean, who...
who is at the door of Mr. Billy Cole?

578
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,963
Open it!

579
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,502
All right!

580
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:23,006
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, please,
entree, entree. Yes. Good to see you.

581
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,008
Good to see you.
Oh, those are some nice, red shirts.

582
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,740
- What are y'all? Y'all twins?
- No, no, no. He got the extra pocket.

583
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,145
- I like pens.
- Hello.

584
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,256
- I'm Billy Cole.
- Ooh, Mr. Cole...

585
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,025
may I present Jim Buckner...

586
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:50,556
and this handsome gentleman with
the two pockets on his shirt...

587
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,194
is Big Dan Wiener.

588
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,706
Actually, it's, uh, Weiner, really.

589
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:01,177
I don't know 'bout you, but I'd rather
be known as a big wiener than a big Weiner.

590
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,612
- [Cackling]
- Ohh.

591
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,845
That'll be all, Hamilton.

592
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,250
Y'all need to drink
some of that tequila.

593
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,552
[Sighs]
Step into my parlor.

594
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,558
- Parlor!
- Ooh!

595
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,856
Well.

596
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,626
Well, this is, uh,
quite an impressive place you have here.

597
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,031
Well, just a little
weekend getaway.

598
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,399
[Sighs]

599
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,461
- Hey.
- Huh?

600
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,509
- Is that a Golden Globe?
- Huh? No!

601
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,806
This? Huh! No!

602
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,506
This is a... nutcracker.
Would you like one?

603
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,572
Maybe later.

604
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,245
- Drink?
- Uh...

605
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,221
[Together]
Tequila, yeah, sure! Yeah.

606
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,420
[Rings]

607
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,744
Geez! Oh.
[Laughing]

608
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,737
Chin Cho...

609
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,283
uh, Cabo Wabo.

610
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,553
Tres... tequila.

611
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,994
Oh! Huh! 57 si.

612
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,089
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]

613
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,125
Just had him a little while.
He used to work for the mayor of Tijuana.

614
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,571
- What a great place.
- Yeah. Well, it's good to
move up in the world, hmm?

615
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,631
- Right.
- In life, yeah.

616
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,701
- Mr. Cole, we're not gonna take
up a lot of your valuable time.
- No.

617
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,214
But, Mr. Cole...

618
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,218
- I think we have what you're
gonna find a very attractive proposal.
- Yeah.

619
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,413
[Both Chuckle]

620
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,922
You see, my company feels
that your volleyball team...

621
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,482
is the perfect delivery system
for our alcoholic beverage.

622
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,687
- Uh-huh.
- And that tournament...

623
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,059
- has gotten such a response that it's just amazing.
- Sure.

624
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,326
- No one can talk about anything except your girls.
- No.

625
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,334
And so what we're gonna do
is have your girls come along with us...

626
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,737
and we're gonna do a promotional tour
through bars and nightclubs across the country.

627
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,242
Then we'll set up
an opponent in each one of those cities...

628
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,745
you know, somebody
that we can guarantee that they can beat.

629
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,182
Not unlike, uh, oh, say,
Harlem Globetrotters or WWF wrestling.

630
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,083
- You know?
- [Chuckles] Right.

631
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,859
[Munching]

632
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,422
Well... [Clears Throat]
I think we're...

633
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,264
We all are headed
in the right direction here...

634
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,794
- Oh, yeah.
- and these girls are gonna take us there.

635
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,308
But then again,
I'll just let you be the judge.

636
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,640
- Oh? What? You mean, they're here right now?
- Oh, yeah.

637
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,114
- Oh, well, I...
- Yeah, I don't know if we're
dressed. I mean, we just...

638
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,982
No, no, they... they like guys
in, uh, bowling outfits.

639
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,044
- Get out. No way.
- Oh?

640
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,318
- Yeah
- Oh, I told you.

641
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,552
A little music
to set the mood?

642
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,617
- Okay then!

the best volleyball players in the world.

here's the true star this week:

967

Christina Hansen.

968

- So, Christina...

on your own turf by some... players.

- [Rawley] Now, they earned the right to be here.

It's more like a freak show.

As a guy, I gotta say.

974

has always been a sexy sport.
