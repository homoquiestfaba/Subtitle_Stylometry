did you leave me?

186
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:56,310
Hm.

So Maxine, you didn't
see nothing weird,

192
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,308
nothing suspicious, huh?

193
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,244
No, just a normal Tuesday, Rex.

194
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,546

What the fuck is
wrong with you, Rex?

200
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,082
Don't you fuck with me, Riley.

201
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,519
Nora, what the fuck
is wrong with him?

202
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,390
I was peeing.

203
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,058
I got my period.

204
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,894
I bought a tampon, and he was
just fucking dead like that

205
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:21,629
when I found him.

206
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,365
You don't say.

207
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,637
Can you just leave, please?

208
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:33,374
She didn't do it.

209
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,276
What, did you have
a fucking hunch?

210
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,651
There's my hunch.

211
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,285
Oh.

212
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,221
Look, I'd love for
it to be that cunt

213
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,356
more than anybody else,
and you know that.

Nothing.

She's fine.

228

to be left alone.

[Nora] So what are
you doing here?

237
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,560
They made her leave, I think.

I don't know.

at the stop alone,

Okay.

You know, I can talk to Nora

337
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:18,218
and probably get her to let
you stay another couple days

what you wanna do.

'Cause it's rough out there.

368
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,896
And it's nice to have
someone who has your back.

369
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,801
But we have a rule.

370
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:16,504
You stay, you work.

371
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,371
But if you work, we
take care of you.

372
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,814
Hey, don't be so nervous.

373
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:27,748
I'm not gonna hurt you.

374
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,085
So what do you think?

375
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,787
You think you wanna stay
with us for a while?

376
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:37,424
Good.

377
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:42,462
Stand up for me.

378
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:46,968
[ominous music]

379
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,836
Look at you.

380
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,976
Where do they even
get these dresses?

381
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,911
Where is that store?

382
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,813
I mean, is it like
a pioneer thing?

383
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,181
It's so pervy.

Don't be ashamed.

You really are an angel.

387
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,873
I have to ask, have you ever
even kissed someone before?

388
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:28,408
No.

389
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,991
Not so bad, huh?

390
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:48,495
[ominous music]

391
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:52,199
[Sadie] So, this whole
lot is exit 17.

392
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,835
There's three stops
like ours on route 66,

393
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:55,870
but if you're heading west,

394
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:58,940
this is the last stop
for any quality action.

395
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,574
If you wanna unbuckle
the bible belt,

396
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,876
this is the place to do it.

397
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:06,580
Good, clean, old-fashioned,
drug-free pussy.

398
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:07,815
And dick.

399
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,750
We have a bit of
a reputation here,

400
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:10,685
and we're so proud of it.

401
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,720
Hey, you know, Riley's mom,

402
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,522
she worked exit 17.

403
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:17,191
Gave it the nickname,
too. Candy Land.

404
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,226
So there's four parts.

405
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,862
<i>The pit. Think of it
as a neighborhood.</i>

406
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:23,965
Yeah, you'd never just
walk up to any old house

407
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:25,733
and knock on the door
at 3:00 AM and be like,

408
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:28,069
"Hey, how's it going? You
want your cock sucked?"

409
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:29,737
There's rules.

410
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,906
If someone wants company,
they'll let you know.

411
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,077
[Sadie] <i>The first is simple,</i>
<i>back-in parking.</i>

412
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,914
<i>Next is more of the same,</i>

413
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,082

414
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,118
Remember, they're
watching for you too.

415
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,855
Next is the bathroom
cruisers. Levi?

416
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,057
So your bathrooms are for
your thrill seekers, you know,

417
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:53,060
not just about getting off,
but about not getting caught.

419
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,731

00:24:56,764 --> 00:25:00,001

00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:12,980
<i>Or do they come in casually?</i>

429
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:17,184

start to tap my foot.</i>

You know, and a lot of
these cats are not truckers.

433
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:29,130
They're married men,
and proud of it too.

434
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,931
They're just looking
for a little excitement.

435
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,701
Who's that?

436
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,137
That's Rex. Don't
worry about him.

437
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,038
Not unless you're Levi.

438
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,706
[Levi] Mm-hm.

439
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,007
[Liv] Babe, the radio.

440
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:40,908
Right. Go.

441
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,777

And when that happened, she
changed. Her mind changed.

728
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:14,201
She became barbaric,

729
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,403
with no mercy for
the dissenters.

730
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,341
Now I've made peace with
her since she left us,

731
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:22,577
and I am grateful for the
life that she showed me,

732
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,846
and that is why I feel I
owe the same debt to you.

733
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:34,088
We are not here to cleanse
the dissenters of the world.

734
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:39,259
We are here to cleanse
ourselves of this world,

735
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,931
and when we are cleansed,
then we will leave it.

736
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:50,371
Theo.

737
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:56,511
Your mind has
always been so small.

738
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:02,416
Ye shall tear down
their altars, Theo,

739
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:06,487
rip down their sacred
constructs, and burn them,

740
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,290
cut down the images
of their gods,

741
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:12,359
and erase their
memories of this place.

742
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,229
You know this.

743
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,700
You are so lost.

744
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,968
We must be the ones
to drive the stakes

745
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,403
into their hands and their feet,

746
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:24,405
for they cannot
do it themselves.

747
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:28,442
We must cleanse the world
before we can cleanse

748
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:31,345
- ourselves of it.
- Stop it.

749
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:32,547
Stop it, please.

750
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,552
I just came here to tell
you that we are leaving.

751
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:40,522
The other elders and myself,

752
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:42,590
we have decided that it is time.

753
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:53,701
When?

754
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:54,702
Tomorrow morning.

755
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:01,408
And I know that we asked
for your withdrawal,

756
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:04,512
and I know that our
beliefs are not the same,

757
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:06,180
but deep inside you, Remy,

758
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:08,248
there is a light so bright.

759
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:12,019
And I know that. And
so does the Lord.

760
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:15,523
And we just thought
that we owed you

761
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:17,357
the opportunity to come with us.

762
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:24,398
You know where to find us.

763
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,436
Say goodbye to your sister.

764
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,742
Hey.

765
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:35,643
How are you?

766
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:36,477
Good.

767
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,411
Good.

768
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:39,213
Theo says we're leaving soon.

769
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:42,449
Are you coming with us?

770
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:46,754
I'll think about it.

771
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:49,456
Come, Jonah. It's time.

772
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:53,093
It's time. Let's go.

773
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:03,470
[ominous music]

774
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:44,444
Father.

775
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:52,386
Father... I am ready for you.

776
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:56,189
[Remy] <i>Use me.</i>

777
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,594
[ominous music continues]

778
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,499
<i>Guide my hands to
do your bidding.</i>

779
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:13,508
<i>I am ready.</i>

780
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,854
How come... your legs are...

781
00:51:26,888 --> 00:51:27,956
I shaved today.

782
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:32,292
Alright, well, yeah, but
like when it's, like, cold,

783
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:35,429
like, my hair just grows
back so fucking fast.

784
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,633
Like, yours are all smooth.

785
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,499
Look at mine.

786
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:40,434
These are nice.

787
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:41,569
No, I have strawberry legs.

788
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:43,838
What?! What's a strawberry leg?

789
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,439
I have, like,
black dots on my legs,

790
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:46,808
so when I shave, and it,

791
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:48,810
it's just, like, it
always looks hairy.

792
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,312
It's really unbecoming.

793
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:53,280
It's really...

794
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,049
[Remy] Hey.

795
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,684
[Sadie] Only you
would notice that.

796
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:57,552
Hey.

797
00:51:58,553 --> 00:51:59,654
Is everything okay?

798
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:01,889
Everything's okay.

799
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:03,858
You want a smoke?

800
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,359
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

801
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:06,293
Okay.

802
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,361
We'll break you down
though, soon enough.

803
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:10,330
[Levi] Oh, Sadie-bug, let me
get your cigarette.

804
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,306
Hey, you feel okay?

805
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:21,509
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

806
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:25,847
[truck horn blares]

807
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,582
Heads up.

808
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:28,916
Oh, man. I just sat down.

809
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,785
I'm gonna go get
something to eat.

810
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,486
No, no.

811
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,554
I need to eat.

812
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:35,188
I need...

813
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:36,289
Don't do that!

814
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,759
And my fucking feet, too.

815
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,664
Well, who's gonna go?

816
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:43,531
I'm not going.

817
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,602
Hey, why don't you go down?

818
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:48,536
Riley, fuck me.

819
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:50,738
Come on, she's not ready
for the pit, okay?

820
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:51,673
- Sadie.
- I'll go.

821
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:52,740
Stop.

822
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:53,608
Hold on.

823
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:00,782
Yeah, I can do it.

824
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:01,683
[Riley] Yeah?

825
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,618
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

826
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:04,686
Mm-hm.

827
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:06,988
What'd I tell you?

828
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:09,356
- You got a rubber?
- Mm-hm.

829
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,625
Yeah.

830
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:11,726
You've got this, girl.

831
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:12,794
Go.

832
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:13,795
You've got it.

833
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,738
There she goes.

834
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,678

[pants unzip]

836
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:51,599
All right, let's
do half and half.

837
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:54,635
Money's in the cup holder.

838
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:57,605
You ain't touching
it 'til you're done.

839
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,615
What, you just gonna sit there?

840
00:54:07,648 --> 00:54:09,249
Come on. Mash your motor, honey.

841
00:54:17,024 --> 00:54:18,526
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

842
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,627
What are you doing?

843
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,695
- I was...
- No, no, no, no.

844
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:22,730
I'm not wearing no raincoat.

845
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:24,832
There's an extra 40 in there.

846
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:25,666
All right?

847
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,036
So quit your fucking
lolly-gagging

848
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,773
and give me that
bean cap, right now.

849
00:54:32,874 --> 00:54:33,708
Woo, woo!

850
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:41,314
Hey! Get over here,
you little whore.

Oh. Hey, babe.

860
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:34,001
So how did, uh, how'd it go?

861
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,804
Good. It went good.

[Liv laughs]

863
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:42,109
What is that?

864
00:55:46,848 --> 00:55:48,115
Remy, what is that?

[ominous music]

Shh...

[Woman] I'll meet you outside.

Meet me at the car.

[Liv gurgling]

876
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:30,691
Are you okay?

Hey, catch.

880
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:53,648
Thank you.

881
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,515
No problem.

882
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:01,522
How are you?

883
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:04,525
I'm good.

884
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,836
I heard that some guy
came by the motel for you.

885
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:18,973
Yeah.

886
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:25,913
Is that, like, your dad, or
your brother, or something?

887
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,817
You got, like, a
boyfriend or something?

888
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:31,652
- No.
- No?

889
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,854
That's cool.

890
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:40,661
He likes to think
that he's, like,

891
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:43,597
my dad, or my older
brother, but he's not.

892
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,668
Yeah, I was just asking.

893
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,909
[engine rumbling]

894
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,010
Looks like you're up.

895
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:01,248
Hold that.

896
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:02,817
You can have it.

897
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:09,991
I'll save it for you.

898
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:11,759
Okay.

899
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:25,106
Uh, hi.

900
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:25,940
Hi.

901
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:29,844
Uh, to tell you the truth,

902
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,946
I haven't done this before,

903
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:35,583
and I really don't
know what to say.

904
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,085
Why are you here?

905
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:43,057
Uh, well, let's see.

906
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:48,796
Well, I suppose I'm lonely,

907
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:52,900
just looking to feel
the touch of a woman.

908
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:58,706
But now you must be cleansed.

909
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:04,211
Um, is that part of the game?

Oh my god, Remy.

1132
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:06,213
God, you scared me.

1133
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:09,850
I'm sorry,

1134
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:12,987
I'm just still a little
jumpy from everything.

1135
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:15,256
It's okay.

1136
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:21,829
Yeah, I uh, I just can't
be here anymore.

1137
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,065
[Sadie] I need a change.

1138
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,167
I've felt it for a
while, now I know.

1139
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:30,938
Where will you go?

1140
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,542
I don't know, and
I don't even care.

Anywhere else, you know?

1142
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:38,279
Yeah.

1143
01:19:40,014 --> 01:19:42,816
Look, I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm abandoning you.

1144
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:45,352
It doesn't.

1145
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,054
I'm leaving too.

1146
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,324
Oh.

Home.

1149

I, um, I found
this in my dresser.

1150
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:04,371
I saw the photo of you
and, is that your mother?

1151
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:07,408
Yeah.

1152
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:09,843
What happened to her?

1153
01:20:11,646 --> 01:20:15,382
She got sick and left us.

1154
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,286
She gave you that?

1155
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:22,456
Yeah, this was hers.

1156
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:24,491

I think I need to
do this on my own.

1160
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:38,506
Thank you, though.

1161
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:42,076

They've already left.

1171

What? What do you mean?

1172
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:14,642
