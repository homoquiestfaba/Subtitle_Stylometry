to get away from my house,

58
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,777

Well, not really a rut,

Devil's Canyon Marathon

78
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,556
15 years ago,

79
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,526
um, which it's
an exciting year, 15 years.

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,996
We're gonna celebrate
our own way,

81
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,570
The Devil's Canyon way,
as I like to say.

82
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:43,648
How are you celebrating?

83
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:46,635
Well, we're celebrating with,
you know, our usual swag,

84
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,905
the medals, and the cheering,

85
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,140
and the, the, you know,

86
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,876
the usual Devil's Canyon way.

87
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,745
Nothing different for 15.

88
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,881
Training in uniform helps
identify trouble spots.

89
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,883
So, friction against
the forehead,

90
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,584
reduced stride,

91
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,854
all these issues have to be
ironed out before race day.

92
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,790
Here's the secret
to running a marathon:

93
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,225
quit early!

94
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:11,794
(lighter flicking)

95
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,165
Unless you wanna keep recording.

96
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:17,166
I'm here for it.

97
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,135
We're here for it.

98
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,104
I chose Devil's Canyon because
it's a Boston qualifier.

99
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,807
Like Pre... Steve Prefontaine,

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,743
I'm a front runner
in all aspects of my life.

101
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,979
Ugh, God! Oh!

102
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,148
I can't let fear
dictate my decisions.

103
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:35,785
I wanna run a marathon,
so I'm gonna run a marathon!

104
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,852
Entry form,

105
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:40,089
Devil's Canyon.

106
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:42,124
The hardest part about
planning a marathon is

107
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,193
the permit process.

108
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,128
I mean, we've been doing this
for more than a decade,

109
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,831
and we still
haven't been approved.

110
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:51,533
They started to, uh,
see us coming,

111
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,601
and, uh, locked the doors
at city hall.

112
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,737
I'm just like,

113
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,571
"Guys, it's business hours.

114
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:57,840
You gotta let me in."

115
00:04:57,873 --> 00:04:59,574
I was training
for my first marathon

116
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,509
when I got pregnant, so...

117
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,178
(baby babbling)

118
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,679
I know, right?

119
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,613
And I had to stop 'cause of you!

120
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:09,251
But, now I feel like
after a year of being a mom,

121
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,153
I feel like I'm finally
coming up for air.

122
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,022
(baby babbling)

123
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,957
Oh, that's a weird one.

124
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,960
There is a stigma
to being a costume runner.

125
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,595
Faster competitors
don't take you serious,

126
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:21,629
slower runners think you're

127
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,766
making a mockery
of the marathon,

128
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,203
which couldn't be
further from the truth.

129
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,570
(sighing)

130
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:31,874
Being the average
marathoner is 35, male,

131
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:34,542
predominately middle-
to upper-class,

132
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:36,979
she has 26 miles
to find herself a husband.

133
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:40,683
No, I... I mean, "alone,"
that's, what does that mean?

134
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,318
I wouldn't date a runner.

135
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,086
Try getting into an argument

136
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,255
two miles into a 20-mile run.

137
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,723
"Oh, you let me win.

138
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,158
Why you passin' me?

139
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,161

140

141
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,099
None of these houses
are on the market

142
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,834
'cause we moved 'em all.

143
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:01,837
Yeah, not too much in my life
is on the market right now.

144
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,272
I'm off, uh,
I'm off the market.

145
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,907
I'm not in the dating pool.

146
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,910
I'm taking some
time to focus on myself.

147
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:11,280
Uh, I've taken two years,
and I think I might, uh,

148
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,316
I might just keep ridin' it
because it feels pretty great.

149
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,685
Miles, can you say "mama?"

150
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,788
Yeah.

151
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:19,822

152
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,157
Say, "mama."

(baby groaning)

154
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:23,259
Can you say "ma..."

155
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,127
(baby blabbering)

156
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:26,695
Miles can say "mama."

157
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,197
I've heard him say it.

158
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,698
He's called Michael mama.

159
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:32,701
He's called his
happy hippo mama.

160
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:34,737
He's called his car seat mama,

161
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,138
but not me.

162
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:37,807
Hasn't, um,

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,043
called me mama, not once.

164
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,244
Not once.

165
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,980
Finishin' a marathon means
provin' my sister wrong

166
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,215
once and for all,

167
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,884
or just once.

168
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,219
She's a triathlete,

169
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,822
and I just "try."

170
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,691
- Her words.
- "I'm tired, I'm hot."

171
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:58,094
He's like a little baby
that you're just like,

172
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,029
"Come on, grow up already."

173
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,030
He can't finish a marathon.

174
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,898
He can't even tie his own shoes.

175
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:05,935
Banana, that would not
have been my first choice.

176
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,171
Something more vaginal,
like a guava,

177
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,372
you know?

178
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,808
Men see a guava
running at them...

179
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,810
Papaya, oh, that's beautiful.

180
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:19,081
I started running
right after my divorce.

181
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,117
Well, actually, it was, uh,

182
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,852
it was when we first
started having problems.

183
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:25,421
That's when I
picked up running.

184
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah, in hindsight,
the running probably

185
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:29,657
drew us further apart,

186
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:34,063
but hindsight's
always 50/50, so.

187
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,431
Same as a divorce, right?

188
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:37,366
We met at a 5K fun run.

189
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,435
- It was miserable.
- Right.

190
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,270
I didn't wanna look like
I was trying too hard,

191
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,671
so I was breathing
only outta my nose.

192
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:44,672
Mm-hmm.

193
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,408
- 'Cause I felt like...
- And I literally thought

194
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:47,776
there was a horse behind me.

195
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,745
- I was like, "Ee."
- Yeah, yeah.

196
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,046
(vocalizing)

197
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,248
I was like, "I have to,

198
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,350
I think I'm gonna have to
take this guy to the hospital."

199
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,085
I feel like if someone
screws up a marriage,

200
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,921
they should have to find you...
however long it takes...

201
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:01,357
they should have
to keep searching

202
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,958
until they find you

203
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,793
a replacement spouse.

204
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,195
That's just... I don't know,

205
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,863
that just sounds
like human decency.

206
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:12,034
But I found running, so,
I mean, I'm not alone.

207
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,303
Uh, yeah, I'm single.

208
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,804
I don't see how that has

209
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:17,439
anything to do
with the marathon.

210
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,041
There's more to women than men.

211
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,927
How's training going?

212
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,079
Well...

213
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,347
I have

214
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:30,119
six new pairs of socks!

215
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,921
So, pretty well.

216
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,190
And they were like, "Why do
you need pyro for a marathon?"

217
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,958
And it was just like,

218
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,060
"Marathons are boring
without pyro.

219
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,996
It's just people running!"

220
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,299
I think people run for a lot
of different reasons, you know.

221
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:45,267
Sometimes you're
running to something,

222
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,203
sometimes you're
running from something.

223
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,506
Um, I mean, mostly,
I just run to win.

224
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,474
(microphone thudding)

225
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,144
I run for a sense
of accomplishment

226
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,413
and stress relief.

227
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,982
(sirens wailing)

228
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:07,256
Yeah, most people
zone out when they run,

229
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,391
not me, I'm just the opposite.

230
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,227
I like to focus on the pain

231
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,363
and the agony of every step.

232
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:15,464
It helps to pass the time.

233
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:18,033
(microphone thudding)

234
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,336
Usually, when he sleeps,

235
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:24,306
um, I run a few laps
around our neighborhood,

236
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,208
but I can only go so far 'cause

237
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,077
the monitor only goes so far.

238
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,180
Hold on, sometimes he cries
and then goes back to sleep.

239
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,749
(baby crying)

240
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,154
Victoria King
ran as a strawberry,

241
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,924
which, honestly,
is a little uninspiring,

242
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,194
but that's why I went...

243
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,228
What?

244
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:53,068
♪ ♪

245
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,403
Hi. Who?

246
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,473
- Who, who are you?
- Ben Duffy!

247
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:59,875
I'm running the marathon.

248
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:01,477
Are you fucking kidding me?

249
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,879
Uh, no.

250
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't run anymore.

251
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,883
Um, I already won my medal.

252
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,852
Aw.

253
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,921
Third place!

254
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,157
Did you have that
hiding there?

255
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,893
Bronze, I think it's real.

256
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,995
I don't think anyone
really makes bronze anymore.

257
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,231
I think that's burnzing,
I think is what they call it.

258
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:23,299
- Burnzing is a...
- I don't think that's

259
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,601
- real bronze.
- We love your storyline,

260
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,436
okay, we really do,
so we're, uh,

261
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,305
all we're doing is
where adding to it.

262
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,840
Why is he running
the marathon as a banana?

263
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,942
Really, really, why?

264
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:36,245
Well, he... Okay.

265
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:37,846
- He works for Dole.
- I knew it.

266
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,481
- And... Look...
- Knew it!

267
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,349
- Knew it!
- Look, that is the only way

268
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,484
we could secure
financing for this film.

269
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,619
An actor?

270
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,087
God, no!

271
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,355
He's product placement.

272
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,457
I am a real runner.

273
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,192
I am a real runner

274
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:52,961
trying to break
a real world's record.

275
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,897
- Mm-hmm
- Well, the two guys that beat me

276
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,566
I don't even think
they were American.

277
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,468
They were Black,
so they could run faster.

278
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:01,403
I don't... I didn't say that.

279
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,339
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,873
It's okay, you can say Black.

281
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,544
I don't, I don't
see runners of color.

282
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,312
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not supposed to

283
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:12,214
- Ba...
- Ba...

284
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,983
Look, I have so many friends

285
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,185
from different neighborhoods.

286
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:16,985
- Ba...
- I don't even know

287
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:17,721
- where they're from.
- ...lack.

288
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,655
- I don't ask.
- Yeah, why?

289
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,290
That's not...
Wouldn't you be curious?

290
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,400
Shareef, why aren't marathons more popular

291
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,859
in the
African-American community?

292
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,032
I don't know.

293
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,600
I vote with my heart.

294
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,003
I don't even see
political parties.

295
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,305
Sometimes I don't even vote.

296
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,207
That's how much I see
everyone as equal.

297
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,943
I don't even vote.

298
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,945
Ah, okay.

299
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:43,946
I run in lane one.

300
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:44,848
- Yes.
- Come on.

301
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,582
- Oh, lane one... Is that lane?
- Now, yup.

302
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:47,950
- Yup. Yup
- What lane is this?

303
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:50,419
You are second banana, lane two.

304
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:53,021
Okay, maybe from my point
of view, I am first banana.

305
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,390
What did you say?

306
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,127
- This one?
- Yes.

307
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,361
Ha! Ha!

308
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:03,465
I know who you are.

309
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:04,533
All right.

310
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,202
Doin' eight miles,
speed intervals mixed in,

311
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,304
pick... God dammit.

312
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,711
Boston, Chicago,
all the big races are,

313
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:19,348
are pushing out the smaller
mom and pop races like us.

314
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:22,451
I mean,

315
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,520
shop local, run local.

316
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,587
That's what I say.

317
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,690
Just cooperate, okay?

318
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,124
All right, and we can
make this thing work.

319
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:30,659
- Yeah, I'll cooperate.
- All right?

320
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:31,527
- But I'm gonna be...
- Great.

321
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,395
I'm gonna be
a real dick about it.

322
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:36,365
So how did you
get into running Ben?

323
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:39,034
My mother was a runner!

324
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,037
Rest in peace.

325
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,740
Osteoporosis.

326
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:47,242
The doctor said if
she had just eaten more

327
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,678
bananas,

328
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,113
specifically Dole bananas,

329
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,750
she would have stood
a fighting chance.

330
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:57,186
Wow, Ben,
that's a great back story.

331
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,388
- It's heartfelt and emotional.
- Cut!

332
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,758
Missing Boston again
by nine seconds,

333
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,559
that's my biggest fear,

334
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,260
or a terrorist attack.

335
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,763
Boston strong.

336
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,031
I mean,

337
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:11,734
the Boston attack, it was,

338
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,669
it was horrible.

339
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,673
And then when I found out that

340
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,375
they had more entries
the next year,

341
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,613
I just... I mean, we,

342
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,114
we can't compete!

343
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:29,384
Oh, this is, uh,
for testicular cancer.

344
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:30,285
I'm donating a dollar

345
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,121
for every minute
of my race to charity.

346
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,697
No, that's...

347
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,799
No.

348
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:45,367
They pay me for every mile,

349
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,570
but then all the money that
I don't get goes to charity.

350
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:51,106
With running,
you gotta stay on schedule.

351
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,342
You miss one day,
you're screwed!

352
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,410
It's like birth control.

353
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:56,545
No.

354
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,515
Running just purifies the...

355
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,283
body... I'm sorry, I'm really

356
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:04,486
having trouble with
how the math works on this.

357
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,054
So, people who run...

358
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:07,055
What am I supposed to run

359
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,057
slow so I can give more money?

360
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,460
Or do I start with a...

361
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:15,297
Birth control, you're screwed

362
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,133
first?

363
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,669
Then, if you miss a day,

364
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:24,540
you're also screwed.

365
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,342
It's not like birth control.

366
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:31,079
$926, that's...

367
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,682
Well, that's a lot,
that's a lot,

368
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:35,350
that's a good chunk of change.

369
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:40,122
I'm not afraid to
donate that, I just,

370
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,291
I mean, I don't think
I should have to pay for

371
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:44,861
all of the cure either, though.

372
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,228
Um.

373
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,196
You know, I'm not running away

374
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,232
from my identity as a mother,

375
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,868
like, I love being a mother.

376
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,703
I love Miles!

377
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:56,706
- I think I just...
- Honey, where's his bottle?

378
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,442
It's in the fridge.

379
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,210
(fridge opening)

380
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:03,846
I think that, um,

381
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,881
- I'm really trying...
- Garage fridge

382
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:05,815
or kitchen fridge?

383
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,649
It's in the kitchen fridge!

384
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:10,552
Yeah, it means a lot to me
if you're at the finish line

385
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,722
to eat your words!

386
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:13,622
I don't see it.

387
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,157
Did you look?

388
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,394
Did you look with your eyes,
are you looking?

389
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,396
- It's in the door.
- Found it, it's in the door.

390
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,531
What was that?

391
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:23,532
Wait, what?

392
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,534
I know you did the Ironman.

393
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,703
I got the Christmas card!

394
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:30,238
You put it in the warmer,
and it'll come together.

395
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,475
Sorry.

396
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:36,746
Um, yeah, I feel like I...

397
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,781
Which cabinet is the warmer in?

398
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,549
(cabinet door squeaking)

399
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,384
- I'm really trying to ident...
- Can I just put it in

400
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,186
- the microwave?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

401
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:46,246
Has anyone ever been seriously injured

402
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,081
at Devil's Canyon Marathon?

403
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:50,258
Are we still off the record?

404
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:51,543
No.

405
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,897
Nope.

406
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,126
Can we talk about
something happy now?

407
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:59,843
What's your fondest memory of Devil's Canyon?

408
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,605
(sighing)

409
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,207
I don't know.

410
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,342
Night runs are a fun
way to beat the heat,

411
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:10,512
but you have to take
the necessary precautions.

412
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:12,882
(microphone thudding)

413
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,754
What's your greatest fear?

414
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,621
My biggest fear

415
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:23,291
is probably...

416
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,192
(handcuffs clinking)

417
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:25,460
(helicopter beating)

418
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,429
...global warming?

419
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,597
Fear,

420
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,900
that's why people
run a marathon.

421
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,534
Fear of being fat.

422
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,604
Fear of dying, disease.

423
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:37,439
In my opinion,
it takes more courage

424
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,808
not to run a marathon.

425
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,208
(water boiling)

426
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,778
Big half marathon tomorrow.

427
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,512
Pre-race meal is critical.

428
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,414
Crab loading ups
the glycogen levels

429
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:48,583
and prevents the body
from burning reserve fats.

430
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,620
This helps the runner
endure for longer distances.

431
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:54,623
It's a little perk
of the job, get to...

432
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,826
Before every race,
get to eat a lot of crab.

433
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,193
Em?

434
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:00,997
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!

435
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,464
- Hey!
- Oh.

436
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,266
How are you?

437
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:05,001
Good.

438
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,335
Uh, what's with the camera?

439
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,638
Oh, uh, he's filming me
while I train for a marathon.

440
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:11,606
A marathon?
You're running a marathon?

441
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,541
(laughing)

442
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,375
No.

443
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,585
- Call me sometime?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

444
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,754
- Okay.
- Uh, good to see you.

445
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,621
- Yeah, you too, bye.
- Okay.

446
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:29,624
Bye!

447
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:32,762
That's "Big Dick" Brian
from high school.

448
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,463
He's a quarterback.

449
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:35,832
No, it's not
what everybody does.

450
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:36,799
It's what I do.

451
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,467
I'm not most runners, okay?

452
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,669
If I had meant carb loading,
I would have said carb loading.

453
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,636
I mean crab loading.

454
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,805
When their carbs give out,

455
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,741
that's when my crabs kick in.

456
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,508
Aw, man!

457
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,879
"Big Dick" Brian!

458
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:52,514
It's the little
things in life, huh?

459
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,282
Oh! He's a doctor...
No, wait, I'm sorry.

460
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:55,985
He's a dentist.

461
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,955
Dentist.

462
00:17:58,988 --> 00:17:59,822
That good?

463
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:01,356
- Yeah, you're good.
- I'm good?

464
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,357
I feel something.

465
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,362
Oh, yeah, is it?

466
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,664
Yeah, let's just
follow the leader, huh?

467
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:10,967
Yeah, carb load.

468
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,835
Great idea, Jeff, mm.

469
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:13,903
I'm not gonna do that,
you know what,

470
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,872
this is fuckin' ridiculous!

471
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,439
It's a documentary!

472
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,709

He is an actor.

486
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:14,831
Kind of.

487
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,665
- Yeah. No!
- He's not very good.

488
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,100
Devil's Canyon
was four months out

489
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:19,769
when I decided to
try for the record,

490
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:22,071
so schedules lined up perfectly.

491
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:23,739
(Ben crying)

492
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:27,009
It's where we buried
my mother's ashes.

493
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:30,746
Her brittle bones crumbling
through my fingers like

494
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,380
chalk!

495
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,750
(sobbing)

496
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,957
Stupid! Stupid!

497
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,557
(crying)

498
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:44,727
I wouldn't run a marathon
for two reasons.

499
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,698
The first, um, I don't really
like the clothes that you wear.

500
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:52,068
Uh, they're not
flattering to my body type.

501
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:53,568
I look better in,

502
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,939
in more upscale
sort of clothing.

503
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,741
Secondly,

504
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:01,844
I don't enjoy
the people that run.

505
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,612
This is what we call
a tune-up half,

506
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,914
or a tunie halfie,

507
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:08,184
but I never half-did
anything in my life.

508
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,052
Wish me luck.

509
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:17,193
You're not gonna say it?

510
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:17,894
It's a superstition,

511
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,197
I need you to say, "Good luck."

512
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,999
Fine, all right,
good luck, Jeff!

513
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,702
Say, "Good luck."

514
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,437
Say, "Good luck."

515
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,107
Even a fly would say,
"Good luck."

516
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,909
Hey, good luck.

517
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,509
Good luck.

518
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,745
Good luck.

519
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,813
Jesus Christ!

520
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:41,050
So, you know, you go to,
like, parks and libraries,

521
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,020
anything they can kind of,
like, stare at, or, like,

522
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:47,422
run around and try to destroy.

523
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,727
Okay!

524
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,628
Miles, you ready?

525
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:54,596
Do you know where the keys are?

526
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,898
Mama's keys?

527
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,000
(musical toy playing)

528
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,502
Did you throw it
down here, honey?

529
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,905
The longest I've run

530
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:06,208
outside is about three miles.

531
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:08,811
The police chased me
for the last 800 meters.

532
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,980
A treadmill's convenient
for a lot of reasons.

533
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:13,883
You just can't jog around
the neighborhood every day.

534
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,952
That'd be crazy!

535
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,153
(breathing heavily)

536
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:19,487
Um, can you just like,

537
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:21,223
can you just watch him
for just a second?

538
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,793
(microphone thudding)

539
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:32,500
Television commercials, nothing.

540
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,502
The radio commercials,
that was fun.

541
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:35,404
I did all the voices.

542
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah, I can't afford
a voiceover guy.

543
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:40,843
Those, those pros are expensive.

544
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,212
(baby crying)

545
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:46,849
I read in an advertising book

546
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:48,818
that I got at
the library one time

547
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,786
that you need to, uh,

548
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,587

549
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,623
seven times before
they remember it.

550
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:58,094
So, we just said,
"What's that?

551
00:21:58,127 --> 00:21:59,061
"Devil's Canyon."

552
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,129

00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:07,236

I don't wanna say I'm

Sequoia doesn't think
running's a real sport.

It's not!

576
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,918
If everyone can do it,
then it's not a sport.

Is shitting a sport?

In high school,
I was all-state.

Oh, great, you do
insurance commercials too?

581
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:12,068
Yeah, I'm auditioning for them.

I can't just call him,
I gotta like,

586
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,316
"Woops, we ran into each other.

587
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:28,851
Oops, not again!

See what I'm saying,
so, figure out where they go

591
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,825
instead of calling him.

592
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,625

He's gonna call.

00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:00,648
You can just tell

from his eyeballs.

601
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:05,221

So, no comment.

We totally banged banana suits.

I mean, she has tics,
but we all have tics, right?

00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:48,384
I do have a sex tape, so.

It's called Too Little Too Late.

663
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:53,322
I mean, the budget wasn't
too crazy on the sex tape.

664
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:55,424

something, you know.

665

just do it for free, you know.

Obviously,
you have to pay for it.

Okay, yes, we slept together.

681
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:31,960
Ben's a method actor,

682
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:35,898

But I saw a different
side of Ben.

686
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:52,381
Once you peel back
the, uh, outer layer,

687
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,350
there's a sensitive
soul underneath.

688

I hope you enjoy
your muscle cramps.

689
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:59,955
I hope you enjoy all of your
muscles cramping on you.

690
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:01,490
Oh, now you wanna run away.

691
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:04,426
Now you wanna run away
because you know I'm right!

692
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,327
That's why.

693
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:08,071
What can you tell us

694
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:10,065
She's a great motivator.

695
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,433
She used to bully me

696
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:14,203
and still does to this day.

697
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,905
Every month, I get
a sports bra in the mail

698
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:19,007
and an issue to Women's Fitness.

699
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,534
Why do you keep 'em?

700
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:24,613
Not everything,

701
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:26,148
um,

702
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,117
goes back to where
it's supposed to go.

703
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,452
Did you know that
a bladder can drop?

704
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:31,320
I didn't.

705
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,255
Vagina stays there,
thank goodness,

706
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:35,958
but it spreads open,
and it rips and tears.

707
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,329
There's an old poem, uh,

708
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:43,298
"A road diverged in the woods,

709
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:47,436
and I took the one
less traveled by."

710
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:50,005
(birds chirping)

711
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,177
A champion takes their own path,

712
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,081
which is why we're going

713
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,349
there.

714
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,021
Feels right, doesn't it?

715
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:08,257
It's a feeling you get here.

716
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,660
Bladder is so,
so tired and weak.

717
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,996
Oh, what a weak little bladder!

718
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,164

Oh, no, pee-pee time!

720
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,601
Makes her very sad.

721
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:23,305
Oh, she's not
a grown woman anymore.

722
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,007
Why? Why?

723
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,177
What a dumb idea,
I should have wore a condom.

724
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,180
But I do think this the way
back to the car, seriously.

725
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:32,682
I'm getting hungry.

726
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:36,552
Hup-hup, let's go!

727
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:38,320
Hup-hup, come on!

728
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:43,992
Wanna get your Lunchable,
don't you, Jeff?

729
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,327
You know all
the nitrates in that?

730
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,528
You're gonna kill yourself.

731
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:48,530
Oh, Jesus.

732
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:50,767
Kegels, Kegels, Kegels, Kegels.

733
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,634
What, uh, what's your

734
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,470
favorite theatre role?

735
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:59,241
Ah, well, I've been
working on Hamlet.

736
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:02,745
Speak the speech,

737
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:04,646
I pray you!

738
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:07,483
To think not my...
Nope, not my line.

739
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,385
Oh, God, who wrote this?

740
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,287
Trail running,

741
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:15,557
they can't teach you
this on the pavement.

742
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:18,093
And you make yourselves,

743
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:20,329
uh, another.

744
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,363
You jig, you am...

745
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:23,098
You a...

746
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:25,100
Huh.

747
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,001
That's a little,

748
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,603
- little racy.
- You know it's weird

749
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:28,738
that you're not saying Black,

750
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,240
- like it's even weirder now.
- I haven't even,

751
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:32,274
- I haven't e...
- Because you can't say it,

752
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:33,609
then it's making it

753
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,077
- really weird.
- We haven't even had

754
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,111
dinner today.

755
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:40,717
And all of our neighbors,
yeah, are Caucasian,

756
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,485
but I don't think
that that makes me

757
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,787
- in a different neighborhood.
- Safe.

758
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:46,723
- It makes you feel safe.
- No, it makes... No,

759
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:48,423
it doesn't make us in
a different neighborhood

760
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:50,092
because our neighborhood
isn't this block.

761
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,160
Our neighborhood
isn't this county.

762
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:54,731
Our neighborhood is America,

763
00:30:54,764 --> 00:30:57,299
and America is entirely

764
00:30:57,332 --> 00:31:00,302
the same.

765
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,271
It, it...

766
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:03,205
We're not.

767
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,775
That's where all
the conflict comes from.

768
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:08,678
Well, we saw the mountain
on the way in, so.

769
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,817
I guess that
doesn't really help.

770
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:17,653
At least we know
we're in the same park.

771
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:22,224
- I will be here...
- No, please,

772
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:23,191
don't use the stove.

773
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,526
- Don't turn it on.
- No, I would never!

774
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,795
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

775
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,396
I only turn one thing on.

776
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,398
(laughing)

777
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,700
Oh, God!

778
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,835
All right.

779
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:37,139
Rewind the footage, yeah?

780
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,841
See if we can
spot a landmark.

781
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,109
All right, you know what,
give me the camera!

782
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,277
Give me the camera!

783
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:45,180
(screaming)

784
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,416
Go! Go!

785
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,719
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

786
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:51,453
It's broken!

787
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:53,355
Oh! Go get help!

788
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:57,159
Go! Go get help!

789
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,528
(moaning)

790
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:09,504
I lost five pounds!

791
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:11,874
(slurping)

792
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:16,278
Ah!

793
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,881
Oh, how did it bruise so fast?

794
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:20,783
Oh, Godspeed, Jeff.

795
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,417
Godspeed.

796
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:23,886
Come back with help.

797
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:28,490
God dammit, Jeff!

798
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:30,893
Go!

799
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:32,494
Go!

800
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,566
Ah!

801
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,868
Ugh!

802
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:41,436
(crying)

803
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:43,873
My fondest memory,

804
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:48,210
uh, is the look on

805
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:49,946
the kids' eyes

806
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:53,916
when they see their mom or dad

807
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,618
crossing the finish line

808
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,388
throwing up.

809
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:01,556
Just the looks on their faces,

810
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,860
they're just like,

811
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:07,262
"Why is Daddy doing this?"

812
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:10,265
I was trying to get
a toy of the ground,

813
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,601
and something happened.

814
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:13,836
I mean, it's fine.

815
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,673
Um, just a little setback.

816
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,541
We can keep going.

817
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:21,276
Let's keep going.

818
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:24,881
Ah!

819
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,515
What do you think about
when you run?

820
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,218
My sister once told me
I was a mistake.

821
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:32,789
That's hard not to think about.

822
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:35,524
Other than that,

823
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,959
I guess my pace.

824
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,428
What do you dream of doing?

825
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:41,363
Oh, I love dreams!

826
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,332
One time, I was dreaming
that I was a kitten,

827
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,868
and I was caught in a field,

828
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:47,602
and there was this mouse
I was tryin' to get.

829
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:48,603
And every time
I'd try to get it,

830
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,740
he just ran a little bit
further into the field.

831
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:52,340
Mm.

832
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:54,877
(both sighing)

833
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,545
I like your place.

834
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,780

I don't, I don't understand

Young, young men...

850
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,709
...swiping things.

851
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,443
When I met my husband,

852
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:06,048
it was at a, at a, um,
mixer thing for our work.

853
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:07,917
And he said,
"I'm gonna call you."

854
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,020
And he called me 24 times
in the next 24 hours.

855
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:13,689
That was one time an hour.

856
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:18,360
I saw his car, and I said,
"Let's get married."

857
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,796
You can't run
behind a woman because

858
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:22,799
she thinks you're
staring at her ass.

859
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:25,868
But then, you can't
run in front of her

860
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:28,805
because she's
starin' at your ass.

861
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,406
(birds chirping)

862
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,810
Always go 50/50 on a check.

863
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:35,443
That's cool now.

864
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:38,915
Unless it's your birthday,
then, like,

865
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:40,582
someone else's problem.

866
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:43,019
Where they take the spaghetti

867
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,486
and then they meet
in the middle, and they kiss,

868
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,855
they spaghetti kiss.

869
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:46,856
It doesn't happen also because

870
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,558
no one orders a plate
of spaghetti to share.

871
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:51,526
Like, you'd each have
your own plate of spaghetti,

872
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,930
so it doesn't work.

873
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,131
It doesn't work like that.

874
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:56,799
Ugh!

875
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,902
No setbacks.

876
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:03,438
Boston,

877
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:05,507
here I come!

878
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:12,782
Hope you're ready
for me, Boston,

879
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:15,117
'cause I'm comin' with a full,

880
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,686
full head of steam.

881
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,457
(clanging)

882
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,693
Oh, no.

883
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,027
Michael!

884
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:27,864
(treadmill whirring)

885
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,799
I'm goin' crazy, man.

886
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:32,400
I feel like a Nike lab rat.

887
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,436
As we all know, Nike is,

888
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:38,440
uh, the famous Greek
goddess of victory.

889
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:41,777
I am designing the Achilles,

890
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:43,980
the famous Trojan war hero.

891
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:46,082
That's, that's not
a desired effect.

892
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,950
Some people have insoles.

893
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,719
I mean, these
are just out-soles.

894
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,854
The glue still
needs to dry a little bit,

895
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,122
or I think it's too dry.

896
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,124
Just gonna stretch it down.

897
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:57,760
Just takes about, you know,

898
00:36:57,793 --> 00:36:59,028
three or four hours.

899
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:01,030
The Achilles.

900
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:02,932
Rah, Trojan war!

901
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,167
You've gotta wear shoes
to get by in life.

902
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,870
Have you ever walked down
a street without your shoes on?

903
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:09,071
It hurts!

904
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:11,040
Oh! Ow! Oh!

905
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:11,908
Why are you sitting down?

906
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:13,009
Jeff, get up.

907
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:13,709
We're not staying long.

908
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,177
Get up, we're running here.

909
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,712
Ah!

910
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:17,847
We're running,
come on, let's go.

911
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,853
No, I'm fine.

912
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:25,553
It's not that bad.

913
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,455
(breathing heavily)

914
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:28,758
It's... You think this is bad.

915
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,759
(laughing)

916
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,128
(coughing)

917
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:40,236
Ah! Ah!

918
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:42,805
(groaning)

919
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:46,742
Running has

920
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:49,245
probably only negative effects.

921
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,479
A healthy run would be like,

922
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,082
"Oh, my bus!"

923
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,184
We should get back
out there soon, I just,

924
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,953
I just got, I think I have
a rock in my shoe.

925
00:37:56,986 --> 00:37:58,688
Not even a rock,
probably like a pebble.

926
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,791
I'll just take my shoe off,
and get the pebble outta there.

927
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:04,492
Oh!

928
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:05,593
Oh!

929
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:06,829
Right there, that was the one,

930
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:09,699
that was the culprit, so.

931
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,067
That's the one.

932
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,968
Ow!

933
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:15,670
It's an old evolutionary tool

934
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:18,774
that was used to use
to run from wild animals.

935
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:21,609
I don't see any wild animals.

936
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:24,814
Why? 'Cause they're
all in the zoo.

937
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,614
Ow!

938
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:29,285
Ow!

939
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,754
(gong ringing)

940
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:35,858
The wall is, uh,
one of the things that you

941
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,961
experience when you are...

942
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,931
I don't know.

943
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:44,734
I don't know what the wall is.

944
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,870
The wall is like, uh,
an electric fence.

945
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,108
You think it's gonna
hurt too bad to go through...

946
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,043
(electricity zapping)

947
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:56,112
...but you don't know
'till you get to the other side.

948
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:58,981
What do I do?
The wall, the wall marathon?

949
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:01,616
Will that Google get me
what I'm lookin' for?

950
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:03,651
You could just
tell me what it is.

951
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:04,954
The wall's not real.

952
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:07,555
It's a self-imposed
mental block...

953
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:09,225
(popping)

954
00:39:09,258 --> 00:39:10,926
...like menopause.

955
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,195
I hit a wall every day.

956
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,730
I am a mother.

957
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,265
How to beat the wall.

958
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:17,632
Hit the wall,

959
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,201
understanding
why you hit the wall.

960
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,836
The wall?

961
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,238
The wall is systemic racism.

962
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,939
(squashing)

963
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,307
Is it like a block?

964
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:27,777
I got it, it's like
a marathon block.

965
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,812
It's like you can't,
it's like when you hit the wall,

966
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:32,114
you're like, "Ugh,
I can't run anymore!"

967
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:34,216
I hit that wall
when I got the packet,

968
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,685
so we're past my wall.

969
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,322
Well, I don't know
what the future holds,

970
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:42,691
except the marathon.

971
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:45,194
But, yeah, yeah,
I could see myself with Ben.

972
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:48,197
(screaming)

973
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,268
When you marry someone, you,

974
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:56,005
you share something that you
don't have with anyone else.

975
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,040
And so,
there's definitely, uh,

976
00:39:58,074 --> 00:40:01,911
a part of me that, uh,

977
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:05,014
would definitely want
to have her back

978
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:05,915
in my life.

979
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,284
Ryan walked in on me
cheating on him...

980
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:10,252
twice.

981
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,354
That was a rough week.

982
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:15,391
I have a lot of regrets
about that relationship.

983
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,893
We were married two years.

984
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,228
The second time he caught me,

985
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:20,996
he just turned and ran.

986
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,698
He kept running.

987
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:25,901
I wanted to chase
after him, but...

988
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,069
Do you know what a sex swing is?

989
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,038
- Let's just put it this way.
- Oh, this is serious.

990
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,107
Life is a race,

991
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,942
and one of the reasons
I quit running

992
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,376
is because I feel like,

993
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,314
um, we're not all starting
from the same place.

994
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,149
Mm.

995
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:43,018
The finish line
is a straight line,

996
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,020
but the starting line,
no one talks about that.

997
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:46,722
The starting line is,

998
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:49,825
is an, is an uneven line,
and sometimes

999
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:50,926
the line is even,

1000
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,294
it's not even how close it is.

1001
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:54,029
Sometimes the line is lower,

1002
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:56,832
and people have to
climb out of a hole to start.

1003
00:40:56,866 --> 00:41:00,169
Not even just that they're back.

1004
00:41:00,202 --> 00:41:01,837
Black!

1005
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,807
Black!

1006
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,175
I like Black people!

1007
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,943
Okay, you can say it softer.

1008
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,012
I'm sorry.

1009
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:13,249
A felony jaywalking.

1010
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:14,850
Ben?

1011
00:41:14,884 --> 00:41:17,686
No.

1012
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,321
Nope. I don't know Ben.

1013
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:21,290
I would like to first say
thank you

1014
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:24,927
and I would also
like to propose a toast.

1015
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,996
I'm not toasting!
I'm not toasting!

1016
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,200

Yah!

1061
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,042
We got into some trouble
with some groups

1062
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:23,412
who thought that
it promoted Satanism but...

you know...

1064
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,549
I think we invite
all people to run.

1065
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:30,819
We do have a few Satanist
who run in the marathon.

00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:16,565
Quit.

1083
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:19,268
Just quit.

1084
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:22,004
(treadmill humming)

1085
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:27,943
Don't you have
this shot already?

1086
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:31,180
Last year we have a picture of a
running crossing a finish line.

1087
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:33,916
This year, um...

1088
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:36,151
this year we got

1089
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,120
a couple of MMA fighters

1090
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:40,222
pounding on each other.

1091
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:44,460
Um, we have this guy
pinning this guy down

1092
00:44:44,493 --> 00:44:46,528
and he's about to give him
a good old wallop.

1093
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,430
No, no it's non-refundable.

1094
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:50,532
Um.

1095
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,435
Uh and you know...

1096
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:55,604
we got a bunch of them so.

1097
00:44:55,637 --> 00:45:01,243
It's kind of what
we've got to work with.

1098
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:04,046
So, err.

1099
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,449
Poom, poom, poom,
Devil's Canyon.

1100
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:10,419
I ran with the devil, mm!

1101
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:12,421
I think it works.

1102
00:45:12,454 --> 00:45:14,423
Momma! Momma!

1103
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:17,092
Momma, momma, momma.

1104
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:18,093
Say momma.

1105
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,396
Say momma.

1106
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,232
(baby mumbling)

1107
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:24,600
I don't want to be...

1108
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:29,938
Jeff, get back!

1109
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:31,708
I don't want to be
in a documentary

1110
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:34,143
about running a marathon
if I can't run in the marathon.

1111
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:35,477
It's embarrassing.

1112
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:37,312
Can I at least
get a new camera man?

1113
00:45:37,346 --> 00:45:39,481
No, is there a problem?

1114
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:42,184
No, he's just... he's just Jeff.

1115
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,986
That's the thing about him,
he's very duplicitous.

1116
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,989
He's able to lie,
he's like a chameleon.

1117
00:45:47,022 --> 00:45:49,291
Well intentioned simpleton.

1118
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:51,059
He spit on a nun the other day.

1119
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,128
I mean, whether you decide to
get me a new camera man or not,

1120
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:55,230
I think you should,
I think you should

1121
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:56,699
based on what I've told you.

1122
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:58,735
It's one of my favorite parts.

1123
00:45:58,768 --> 00:46:01,970
Is the design,
the swag, the stuff.

1124
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:05,140
It's all about... it's... I mean,
it's about the people

1125
00:46:05,174 --> 00:46:06,642
but it's mostly about the stuff.

1126
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:08,977
Stay outside, I'm having
a conversation right now.

1127
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:10,546
It's private.

1128
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:11,748
Staying out there.

1129
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:14,149
He pilfered some
of my silverware.

1130
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:15,517
We were trying to do something

1131
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,187
and there was this jingling that
we heard

1132
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,356
and it ended up being
a bunch of forks and knives.

1133
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,991
It was actually
my wedding silverware

1134
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:25,360
which is very dear to me
because obviously,

1135
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:27,262
I've been through a lot.

1136
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:30,332
I've been divorced
and it still means a lot to me.

1137
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:33,001
That silverware is a family...
a family heirloom.

1138
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:34,403
Goddammit Jeff!

1139
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,571
Goddammit!

1140
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:37,172
I'm secretary at a law firm.

1141
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:39,742
Uh, Rodrigues,
Rodrigues and Rodrigues

1142
00:46:39,776 --> 00:46:42,311
but my boss,
Rodrigues numero dos

1143
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:47,382
said that he would pay
for my law school if I got in.

1144
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,585
His wife had a stroke
during a turkey trot

1145
00:46:49,618 --> 00:46:52,287
so he's inspired by my
"brave stance

1146
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:55,591
against long distance running."

1147
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:13,141
How's Abby doing?
Is she okay?

1148
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:14,576
Seems like we got an empty nest.

1149
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,044
We're all clear here.

1150
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:18,046
(action noises)

1151
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,682
Oh, oh! Get down.

1152
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:21,116
Get down everybody!

1153
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:22,050
Get down!

1154
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:24,419
(mimicking gun fire)

1155
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:30,592
I killed a man once.

1156
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:33,595
I slit his throat
from ear to ear.

1157
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:36,431
And then I realized
it wasn't a man at all

1158
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:39,234
but an animal.

1159
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:40,502
It's okay, it's just one-way.

1160
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:41,470
He can't hear me.

1161
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:44,640
(baby crying)

1162
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:46,241
Oh.

1163
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:50,279
(baby crying)

1164
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,285
I'm real worried okay.

1165
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:58,520
(knocking)

1166
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:00,422
This is a marathon documentary
footage.

1167
00:48:00,455 --> 00:48:03,458
I, Ryan O'Brien have taken over
principle photography.

1168
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:06,662
If you notice a strong uptick
in the quality of footage

1169
00:48:06,696 --> 00:48:08,765
at this point of the film,

1170
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:10,532
that is to be expected.

1171
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:11,633
I'm going to be sharing entries

1172
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,703
from my running diary.

1173
00:48:13,736 --> 00:48:16,605
This is a great way
to chart your goals,

1174
00:48:16,638 --> 00:48:18,273
keep track of injuries,

1175
00:48:18,307 --> 00:48:19,641
hold yourself accountable.

1176
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:21,310
"Take a look back
at your training logs

1177
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,211
to remind yourself that
you've done everything possible

1178
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:25,882
to prepare,
the race is the run part

1179
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:28,818
where you get to see the hard
work pay off, enjoy it."

1180
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,352
Okay, well.

1181
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:31,587
This is one of my favorite
quotes

1182
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,790
from Prefontaine.

1183
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:36,693
The suicide pace
is my favorite pace.

1184
00:48:36,726 --> 00:48:40,562
And today seems
like a good day to die.

1185
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:42,865
Shareef, what's your favorite
running quote?

1186
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:46,134
When you put the cleats on,
make sure they fit.

1187
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:48,270
Ugh, ah.

1188
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:50,907
Oh god.

1189
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,408
Just in time for
a little feetsy massage.

1190
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:54,343
No.

1191
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:57,145
(shouting)

1192
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,749
Ow, just let it go,
just let it go.

1193
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:02,284
Oh my god, oh my god!

1194
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:06,723
Ugh!

1195
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:07,790
I mean, define "Enjoy."

1196
00:49:07,824 --> 00:49:10,359
Does anybody enjoy anything
that they do really?

1197
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:13,696
I mean, you know,
you have to endure somedays.

1198
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,231
Somedays are better than others.

1199
00:49:16,264 --> 00:49:19,434
Some days you just want to like,

1200
00:49:19,468 --> 00:49:24,539
you know,
take a sawed-off shotgun and...

1201
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:25,942
and just go shooting
at a shooting range.

1202
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:28,945
I mean, you know,
that's all I would do with that.

1203
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:30,545
Um.

1204
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:32,614
And that's a good day.

1205
00:49:32,648 --> 00:49:34,917
(baby shouting)

1206
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,754
Ow, fuck.

1207
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:42,224
Ugh, god.

1208
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:43,826
I think I'm okay.

1209
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,763
(baby crying)

1210
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:48,263
Shit.

1211
00:49:48,296 --> 00:49:51,333
I won 50 dollars!
I never do this.

1212
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:52,634
I just picked this up
for fun and look at that.

1213
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:54,336
I won 50 bucks.

1214
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:55,537
It's just a scrape.

1215
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,906
It's nothing.

1216
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:59,842
It just looks... it looks
worse than it is.

1217
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,912
So yeah.

1218
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:04,613
See? Everything's fine.

1219
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:09,451
The badge of motherhood.

1220
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:13,655
Like everyone, I have doubts
and insecurities

1221
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,726
and moments of weakness.

1222
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:18,360
When you're trying
to do something great

1223
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:19,896
like break a world record

1224
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:23,966
you just have to work
through those hang-ups.

1225
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,737
If it were easy
everyone would run a marathon

1226
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,639
dressed as a fruit.

1227
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:31,941
Look back at history.

1228
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:34,409
Say oh, here look at this.

1229
00:50:34,443 --> 00:50:36,713
This banana beat
this head of cabbage

1230
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:38,781
with the short legs.

1231
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:43,686
She's running around
in fruit clothes.

1232
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,656
They lowered the Boston
qualifying times.

1233
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:53,462
There was an increase
in the number of entries.

1234
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:56,298
Is your flight refundable?

1235
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:59,334
Is my flight refundable?

1236
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,871
That's the first question
you have for me?

1237
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:04,272
Not is there anyway
that I can still get in?

1238
00:51:04,306 --> 00:51:05,975
It would be like
if my mom died and you asked,

1239
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:08,845
"Can you return the Mother's Day
card you bought?"

1240
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:11,948
You are fucking inconsiderate.
Fuck you, Jeff!

1241
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:15,484
No, I can't return... I can't
get a refund on my flight!

1242
00:51:15,517 --> 00:51:17,419
No flights are refundable now.

1243
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:21,958
The airlines are brutal.

1244
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,693
- What if...
- Uh-huh?

1245
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:26,294
...you don't run the race

1246
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:28,831
but we watch it?

1247
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:30,599
That sounds like the
most bringing thing

1248
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,334
I've ever heard.

1249
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:36,304
(TV murmuring)

1250
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:39,641
You gotta what,
four bedroom house

1251
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:42,511
stucco exterior, I'd say...

1252
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:52,021
♪ ♪

1253
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:53,655
It's over, huh?

1254
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:56,491
You gotta keep
firing positive arrows,

1255
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:58,694
- positive arrows.
- Okay, positive arrows.

1256
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:00,562
- Positive.

did he give a message

00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:06,142

the race as uh...

1346
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:09,211

1347
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:12,681
spectator.

1348
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:15,317

1349
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:17,585
I'm sorry, I'm not...
Are you sure you registered?

1350
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:19,688
Yeah, oh,
I just saw it right there.

1351
00:56:19,722 --> 00:56:23,591
- Oh there it is.
- Can you do it again?

1352
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,895
No, that's...

1353
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,630
Thirty minutes late and you
want to get another take.

1354
00:56:28,663 --> 00:56:31,367
I'm not a machine, this
is just what I'm going through.

1355
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,670
- How do you say that?
- Sha-Reef.

1356
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:36,839
Got it.

1357
00:56:36,872 --> 00:56:39,208
- Shareef.
- What?

1358
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:42,577
- Have a great run.
- Here we go.

00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,268

00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:09,305
Ugh.

1363
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,373
Ah!

1364
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:12,875
Ah-ha.

1365
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:15,643
What happened?

1366
00:57:15,677 --> 00:57:16,979
I fell!

1367
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:20,683
Ugh, ow!

1368
00:57:20,716 --> 00:57:22,184
- All right.
- It's the bones, Jenna.

1369
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:25,321
It's the goddamn bones!

1370
00:57:25,354 --> 00:57:27,690
- Thank god for all the bananas.
- Cut the shit!

1371
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:29,758
Okay, are... are you
really not running?

1372
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:32,161
Look, I'm only contracted
to do the training, okay.

1373
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:35,798
I'm not gonna run
an actual marathon.

1374

- Ugh.
- Who steals crutches?

1375
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:41,070
Even if they're just laying out.

1376
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:42,805
Who steals them?

1377
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,807
I struggle to imagine
that someone

1378
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,276
who actually needed them
stole them.

1379
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:48,777
I... I gotta go to Florida.

1380
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:50,312
They want me at the Miami Zoo.

1381
00:57:50,346 --> 00:57:51,914
They're opening up
a monkey sanctuary

1382
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:54,283
and Dole wants me
to cut the ribbon.

1383
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:55,718
That's it?

1384
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:58,921
What about Shakespeare?
What about us?

1385
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:03,292
Like if I had left out
like a hat or like a shirt.

1386
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:07,730
Like then if it was gone
I'd be upset but it's on me.

1387
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:10,766
What... what are you even
gonna use a crutch for?

1388
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:15,271
I'm not an actor.

1389
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:18,073
I'm product placement.

1390
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,776
Hang on, no, no.

1391
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:24,813
Just go...
just...

1392
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:28,083
(groaning)

1393
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:30,819
It hurts!

1394
00:58:30,853 --> 00:58:33,355
It hurts the bones!

1395
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:35,891
The goddamn bones.

1396
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:37,193
A couple of announcements.

1397
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:40,262
All right, wow, great turn out.

1398
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:42,498
Paramedics are on-call
for any injury

1399
00:58:42,531 --> 00:58:44,733
but the reception
has been spotty.

1400
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:49,972
So it's best to get hurt
between miles six and thirteen.

1401
00:58:50,005 --> 00:58:51,807
Six and thirteen.

1402
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,076
Yeah, I really liked her.

1403
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:55,144
Can even say I loved her.

1404
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:57,413
Whatever... whatever that means.

1405
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,348
I mean, we were together
for six weeks

1406
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,283
which is an eternity
in actor's time, you know.

1407
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:02,418
What will you do with the money?

1408
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:04,186
Hm.

1409
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,522
LA baby, should be enough.

1410
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:08,924
- Hey, Benny boy.
- How's it going?

1411
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,292
- Hey, good, good.
- Yes!

1412
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:12,027
- I have... I have some great news.
- Yes!

1413
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:13,429
- Yeah?
- I am ready for my check.

1414
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:15,531
Dole's or mine?

1415
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:16,465
What?

1416
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,133
You're running the race.

1417
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,435
What race? What do you mean?
What does that mean?

1418
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:21,036
Respect the cones everyone.

1419
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,505
Please, just have some
respect for the cones.

1420
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,040
- Okay.
- I'll be there holding this.

1421
00:59:25,074 --> 00:59:29,311
Okay, look for the guy
holding this all right.

1422
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:33,449
(sighing)

1423
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,418
Fuck!

1424
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:44,293
Great news, you're up.

1425
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:47,963
Water, it's important
to keep hydrated.

1426
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:51,967
There's, uh,
there's gonna be water every...

1427
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,902
I think at least
at the beginning

1428
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,204
and at the end of the race

1429
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:56,305
there will be water
for everybody.

1430
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:57,973
There's ' something in this one.

1431
00:59:58,007 --> 00:59:59,408
So I'm not gonna...
I won't... I won't...

1432
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:04,280
I check these every five minutes
for dust, for mites.

1445

What's the marathon
in the metric system?

1446

Like how many kilometers?

1447
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:40,282

Please don't make me do it.

It might work without
the batteries though.

1457

Do you want to stand on here?

1465

Do you want to stand on the box?

1466

Do you want to do that... No, no
that was a rhetorical question,

1467

Eric, the command will be

1468

01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:56,458
I had a... I had a clear goal.

1787
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:57,493
I worked hard at it.

1788
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:00,496
I worked toward it everyday.

1789
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:02,865
I didn't delineate from my path.

1790
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:05,301
I tried to be my best self.

1791
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,102
I prayed that
it would come true.

1792
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:08,971
I sacrificed for it.

1793
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,173
I didn't give way
to distractions

1794
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:16,445
or temptation
and I still fell far short.

1795
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:29,325
Can we go eat now?

1796
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:34,430
I've been on a plane all day.

1797
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:39,268
My legs are killing me.

1798
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:40,536
You guys are here?

1799
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:44,273
(indistinct conversation)

1800
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,208
You think we would miss this?

1801
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,576
Are you kidding me.

1802
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:48,911
Did you guys know this?

1803
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,280
Did you know they were coming?

1804
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:54,083
How you gonna... how you gonna
live, you know?

1805
01:17:54,116 --> 01:17:56,885
Without the...

1806
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:00,889
What time is is?

1807
01:18:00,923 --> 01:18:05,227
Does anybody know the time?

1808
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:14,269
♪ ♪

1809
01:19:52,534 --> 01:19:54,503
So yeah, I guess if I learned
anything from the Marathon

1810
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,338
it's how to hate myself,

1811
01:19:56,371 --> 01:19:58,607
dreams don't come true,

1812
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,210
life has no meaning,

1813
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:03,746
and that uh,
people cannot be trusted.

1814
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,380
No one can be trusted

1815
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,516
even if you think
you can trust them.

1816
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:08,751
All right, this is over.

1817
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:11,520
Oh yeah and I learned
I hate documentaries.

1818
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:13,121
I hate documentaries.

1819
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:16,258
So you can, you know,
you can suck it.

1820
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,060
You can all suck it.

1821
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:21,263
You're just vultures
just praying on my misery.

1822
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:23,265
So yeah, that's...
If you want to learn...

1823
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:24,767
You want to know what
I learned from the marathon

1824
01:20:24,801 --> 01:20:28,670
it's that I hate myself,

1825
01:20:28,705 --> 01:20:30,372
dreams don't come true,

1826
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:32,374
life has no meaning,

1827
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:34,276
no one can be trusted

1828
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:37,279
and documentaries...

1829
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:38,748
suck.

1830
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:42,251
They're a sadistic,
it's not even an art form.

1831
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:45,287
You just... just like, oh,
I want to be a film maker

1832
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,056
but I don't know what
to tell a story about.

1833
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,158
Let me just shoot
a bunch of bullshit

1834
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:52,829
and then somebody else
will cut it all together.

1835
01:20:52,862 --> 01:20:54,596
So yeah,
I think that's what I learned

1836
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:57,499
from the marathon...
Stop filming me.

1837
01:20:57,533 --> 01:21:00,235
Oh and I learned that wood
is also a terrible crutch.

1838
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:02,170
This is killing my armpit.

1839
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:04,139
So yeah, you want to know what
I learned from the marathon

1840
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:06,408
I guess I'd say it's that, uh,

1841
01:21:06,441 --> 01:21:08,711
it's that I hate myself,

1842
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:11,313
that dreams don't come true,

1843
01:21:11,346 --> 01:21:13,549
life has no meaning,

1844
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,785
no one can be trusted,

1845
01:21:15,818 --> 01:21:18,654
documentaries fucking blow

1846
01:21:18,688 --> 01:21:21,456
and a two by four
is a terrible thing

1847
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,358
to use as a crutch.

1848
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,861
Oh god, ugh.

1849
01:21:24,894 --> 01:21:27,095
Hey, are you getting
all your footage?

1850
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:29,531
Ah, I'd hate for you
to help me or anything.

1851
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:32,167
Hate for you to think of me
as another human being

1852
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,469
who might need
a compassionate hug.

1853
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:39,474
God as my witness,
I will never run again.

1854
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:43,345
(heavy breathing)

1855
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:46,445
