1
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:35,948
Roy Acuff, as you know, has been a big star
at the Opry here for quite some time.

2
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,458
We have a company,
a music publishing company.

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,462
But, yeah, I liked Hank right off.

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,628
I think it's 'cause he didn't give a darn
if you liked him or not.

5
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:01,420
I tried so hard, my dear

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,780
To show that you're my every dream

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:14,946
Yet you're afraid each thing I do

8
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:20,121
Is just some evil scheme

9
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:26,672
A memory from your lonesome past

10
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:33,179
Keeps us so far apart

11
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:40,315
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

12
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:47,855
And melt your cold, cold heart

13
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:59,334
Another love before my time

14
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,327
Made your heart sad and blue

15
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:11,586
And so my heart is paying now

16
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:17,012
For things I didn't do

17
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,981
In anger unkind words are said

18
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,319
That made the teardrops start

19
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:37,906
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

20
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,500
And melt your cold, cold heart

21
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,192
You know what time
I get up every morning, Hank?

22
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,027
No idea, sir.

23
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,287
4:45.

24
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,842
Sun don't never ever beat me.

25
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,514
Then know what I did at 6:15?

26
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,495
Listen to my radio show?

27
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,038
On WSFA?

28
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,098
Nope. I had my breakfast.

29
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,335
Well, fair enough, I guess.

30
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,129
We ain't that big
or we wouldn't be singin' at that hour.

31
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,714
Nah, I was just kidding around.

32
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,508
I listen to your program
every now and then.

33
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,592
- You do?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,302
- What do you think?
- That's pretty good stuff.

35
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,952
Well, pretty fair.

36
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,723
All right, now.

37
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,993
Just a couple more
little Justice of the Peace details.

38
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,730
So, this is your license
and divorce decree, Miss Guy?

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,023
Well, I'm Miss Sheppard now.

40
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,900
Guy was Erksine's surname.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,403
But these divorce papers
are in order, right?

42
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,695
They definitely are.

43
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,073
Mr. Guy and I took care of that.

44
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,951
You'll take notice that
it's been notarized as well?

45
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,681
Yeah, I see that.

46
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,178
- Just 10 days ago, huh?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,183
Well, to the business at hand.

48
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,797
Just because these ceilings aren't vaulted
and the windows aren't stained glass

49
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,397
doesn't mean this union
is any less sacred.

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,970
Audrey Mae Sheppard,

51
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,726
do you take Hiram King Hank Williams
to love and honor in all duty and service,

52
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,866
to live with him and cherish him
according to the bonds of marriage?

53
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,166
I sure will.

54
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,445
And do you, Hiram King Hank Williams,

55
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,449
have this woman, Audrey Mae Sheppard,
to be your wife?

56
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:03,746
And will you promise faithfulness in all
love and honor and all duty and service

57
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,096
to live with her
according to the bonds of marriage?

58
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,809
I will.

59
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,045
Then by the authority vested in me,

60
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,882
from the County of Covington
in the state of Alabama,

61
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,902
I declare you husband and wife.

62
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,012
I've tried and I've tried

63
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,347
And all night long I've cried

64
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,277
But I can't get you off of my mind

65
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,528
All right, folks.

66
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,918
Now I'm gonna play a little tune for ya.

67
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,992
It might make sense to y'all.

68
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:47,432
Tonight or this mornin',
whatever the hell it is.

69
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,718
Don, don't screw it up.

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,480
- I'll try not to, bub.
- Let's roll.

71
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,640
When you are sad and lonely
And have no place to go

72
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,813
Come to see me, baby
And bring along some dough

73
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,397
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'

74
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,030
Honky tonkin', honey baby

75
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:46,784
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town...

76
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,060
How much you got there, Miss Lillie?

77
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm under no obligation to you.

78
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,898
Well, that goes both ways, huh?

79
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:59,027
Call me up, sweet mama
And we'll go steppin' out...

80
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,497
He's drinking like a fish tonight.

81
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,574
You think so?

82
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,594
Honky tonkin', honey baby

83
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,221
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

84
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,457
Thank y'all, folks.

85
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:45,381
Now, I'm gonna invite up here
my precious wife, Audrey.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,993
Audrey, get up here.

87
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,203
Don't worry, Lillie.

88
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,473
Hank will hand it over to me
before we even get home.

89
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,683
Get up here.

90
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,252
She is a hell of a singer.

91
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,942
Say hi, Audrey.

92
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,476
Hi.

93
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,571
Hi.

94
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,742
Now we're gonna sing a little song here
calledBlues Come Around.

95
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,531
Boys, let's roll.

96
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,315
Once I was happy as I could be

97
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,915
But I let a man make a fool of me

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,804
And ever since he let me down

99
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,221
The blues come around
When the sun goes down

100
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,994
As long as the sun is in the sky...

101
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,788
Hey, Williams!

102
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,623
You sound like a billy goat,
and so does she.

103
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,973
Sit down!

104
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,836
Sit down, you horse's ass.

105
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,129
When the sun goes down

106
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,672
Oh, the blues come around...

107
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,442
You skinny little shit!

108
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,261
When my wife wakes up,
she listens to you on the damn radio.

109
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,321
If she's listening tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna beat the hell out of her.

110
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,148
Well, partner, why don't you
just turn the damn thing off?

111
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,708
That's why they put knobs on it.

112
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,249
Wait, no!

113
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,488
Get off him!

114
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,088
- Get off!
- Get off!

115
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,928
Get off! Get off!

116
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,806
You need to control yourself, sir!

117
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,500
Damn.

118
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,668
Are you okay?

119
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,711
I'm fine, I'm fine.

120
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,901
I'm good.

121
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,326
You are late.

122
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,618
No, no, no.

123
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,798
No.

124
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,390
I know I birthed you, Hank.

125
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,985
I was there.

126
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:09,283
But where you came from
and how you got what you got

127
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,262
and why you got it,

128
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,702
I swear, nobody knows that.

129
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,776
Except maybe the Lord.

130
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,330
Maybe.

131
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,584
She's gonna be pissed about this.

132
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,399
You think I care?

133
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,069
Shoot. I'm doing everybody
at the station a favor.

134
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,988
That woman hasn't got a clue
who the star is around here.

135
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,033
And I haven't been driving you
all over the state for 10 years,

136
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,952
booking joints and schoolhouses,

137
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,602
to see her swoop in
like she is the Queen of England.

138
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,726
Know why you and Audrey don't get along?

139
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:50,189
One of you is afraid the other's gonna
beat her to my pocket when I get drunk.

140
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,804
That's a hurtful thing to say, son.

141
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,454
Yeah, I'm just whupped, that's all.

142
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
I wish that was all.

143
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,830
When's the last time you ate?

144
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,252
Can't recall.

145
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,420
Is your back sore?

146
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,551
It's fine.

147
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,428
If you want to be sure you're getting
the tops in quality when you buy gas...

148
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,003
Hi, Laura.

149
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,403
Hey, Hank.

150
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,090
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

151
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,509
Now, you never write, you never call.

152
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,762
- What'd I do?
- Hank, I got to get these to the office.

153
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,472
You got to go? Well, I'll see you soon.

154
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,912
Bye, Hank.

155
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,817
I'll miss you.

156
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,608
Hi, boys.

157
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,151
- Morning, boss.
- Howdy, Hank.

158
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,251
How are y'all?

159
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,684
I am moving slow today.

160
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,855
Well, where's the missus?

161
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,518
She ain't here.

162
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,675
Williams!

163
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,928
Where you get off
wasting 12 minutes of airtime?

164
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,679
That shit ain't gonna work.

165
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,389
And you smell like a damn still.

166
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,974
All of ya.

167
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,102
Why, I'm sorry, Mr. Pill.

168
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,603
Yeah, well, that don't mean nothing to me.

169
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,333
I'll boot you, I swear to God I will.

170
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,998
We're running a business here, asshole.

171
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,460
I surely know that, Mr. Pill.

172
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,382
Count him off.

173
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,680
Three, two, one.

174
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,542
Hey, a fine, very early good morning
to all you friends out there.

175
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,670
This is Hank Williams
and the Drifting Cowboys.

176
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,005
We're awful sorry
we're getting a late jump,

177
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:57,525
but last night, we got jumped ourselves
out on Highway 31.

178
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,930
Yeah.

179
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,820
There's one more thing.

180
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,687
This looks like it's gonna be
our last program here at WSFA.

181
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,941
So, if any of you out there have enjoyed it,
we'd sure like to hear from ya.

182
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,961
You just write us and let us know.

183
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,671
Hey, Lycrecia, don't you love this book?

184
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,449
That's her cowboy.

185
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,889
I dreamed about you, baby

186
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,787
Even though...

187
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,872
Bless you, honey.

188
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:25,956
You let me go

189
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,791
- Look at his hat.
- Honey, what you think?

190
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,918
I'd like a hat like that.

191
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,796
How long's it been
since Lycrecia saw her daddy?

192
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,606
Well, he's gonna stop by next week
when she's at Mom and Dad's.

193
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:42,534
Oh, my heart is oh so heavy

194
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,726
And these tears

195
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,227
No longer glow

196
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,787
Come on. Eat-up time.

197
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,692
I'm done dreaming

198
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,632
About you, baby

199
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:04,428
All because you let me go

200
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,928
So?

201
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,003
It's fine, baby.

202
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,943
It's fine?

203
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,633
Yeah. Fine.

204
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,983
Well, how's the stew?

205
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,736
It's fine.

206
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,736
Everything's fine, then?

207
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,279
Just fine.

208
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,272
You know, if it's fine,
it doesn't need any ketchup.

209
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,582
But it isn't that fine.

210
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
The food or the song?

211
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,048
Well, they both need
a little ketchup, honey.

212
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,868
Screw you, Hank.

213
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,870
- Come on, Auds.
- You come on.

214
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,510
You always do this.

215
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,082
Do what?

216
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,812
Well, you know...

217
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,503
Like you said that I could sing with you
on the program.

218
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,338
And there's been none of that at all.

219
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,608
Okay, fine.

220
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,008
What's that mean?

221
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,488
Geez, just what I said it means, okay?

222
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,371
Hi.

223
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,712
What are you writing, Hank?

224
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,508
Maybe a little poem to the Lord.

225
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,450
Might turn into a song.

226
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,243
Can always use a new one.

227
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,553
Really?

228
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,505
Are you the religious sort?

229
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,585
Well, when I was a boy,

230
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,985
I spent a lot of time in church
listening to gospel.

231
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,477
You still are a boy.

232
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,276
You think so, Ellie?

233
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,316
Why don't you write me a poem?

234
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,116
Well...

235
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,135
I might have to get to know you
a little better.

236
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,800
Get lost, Ellie.

237
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,911
Did you see Howard Pill called?

238
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,101
Hank's got to come back.
He has a contract.

239
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,056
That's true, we do.

240
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,292
And it's a good job right now.

241
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,795
He also said he'd like me
to do some singing on the show.

242
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,525
That is not true.

243
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,403
Geez, I was doing pretty good here.

244
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,766
Few more shows,
I want to be done with him.

245
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,893
It's not so easy to get out of.

246
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,645
Well, he can do what he wants, Lillie.

247
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,063
What is this, a schoolyard?

248
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,147
Where are you going?

249
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,983
Right now, I'm gonna take a piss.

250
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,153
Then the day after tomorrow,
I'm going up to Nashville.

251
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,989
Charlie Holt gave me the name of a guy
who can help me get on the Opry.

252
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,158
Well, I pressed Charlie Holt.
You know that. I told you.

253
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,827
You did. I know, yeah.

254
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,927
That's just swell, Audrey.

255
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,849
Sounds good?

256
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,291
So, when are we going, baby?

257
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,601
Friday.

258
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,795
Friday?

259
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,775
But Mama's bringing Lycrecia back then.

260
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,940
So, there you go.

261
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,354
- Hello, sir.
- Hey there.

262
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,356
- I'm Hank Williams.
- I heard that.

263
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,166
Well, I'll get down to it, then.

264
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,944
Charlie Holt gave me your name.

265
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,196
He said you'd tell me what I have to do
to get on the Opry.

266
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,949
There's only one way to do that,
and that's to audition for Jack Stapp.

267
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,389
Well, I... You know, I sure hate
those auditions, Mr. Collins.

268
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,121
Maybe I could just meet him.

269
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,011
Son, there are no shortcuts to the Opry.

270
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,814
Well, could you tell Mr. Stapp
that I'm here?

271
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,150
Hank, how old are you?

272
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,717
Twenty... Twenty-three
when I last checked, sir.

273
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:50,220
Well, that's old enough that you
ought to know that's not how it works.

274
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,740
Now, you're gonna make an appointment,

275
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,102
and then you'll play for him, and if he
likes it, you'll play for Judge Hay.

276
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,582
And then what?

277
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,064
And then Judge Hay's likely to tell you
to come back

278
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,334
when you're hot enough to draw flies.

279
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,004
Well, I just might know how to do that.

280
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,797
Hank, you know Fred Rose?

281
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,970
I know of him.

282
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,661
Roy Acuff's partner.

283
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,330
Among other things.

284
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,970
You might want to know of him
a little bit better.

285
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,169
When he first came to see me,
he played some songs he'd written

286
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,849
and some other folks' material.

287
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:28,842
Well, actually, I believe Audrey, his wife,
had been calling here quite a bit,

288
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,862
pushing me to see him.

289
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:36,121
And I offered him a contract
right then and there as a songwriter.

290
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,893
Damn publishing deal.

291
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,187
Ten dollars per song, plus royalties.

292
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,523
Officially a paid songwriter.

293
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,713
So I suggest you address me
as Mr. Hiram Williams from now on.

294
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,114
Where the hell'd Hiram come from anyway?

295
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,949
From my old man.

296
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,576
Got it from King Hiram
of the Book of Kings.

297
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,787
Hiram the First of Tyre.

298
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,330
Can we get some strawberries later?

299
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,730
Lillie never mentions your daddy at all,
you know, like he never existed.

300
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,463
Yeah, she put him in
the Veterans Hospital when I was six.

301
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,841
The one down in Pensacola.

302
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,886
I don't know, it was a...
A war injury from France or something.

303
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,639
But a cousin told me
it was from a truck accident

304
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,199
in a lumberyard he was working in.

305
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,582
Anyway, he was all messed up, and...

306
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,583
That was about it for us.

307
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,010
Night-night, little bastard.

308
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,478
Better watch where you put that thing.

309
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,220
Howdy.

310
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,400
Hi.

311
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,091
I think we might have
a little bronco riding tonight.

312
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,989
Says who?

313
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,629
Says ol' Hank.

314
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,993
Well, I look forward to that event.

315
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,473
You should.

316
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,390
Especially since you're not drinking.

317
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,559
Now, darling, that's uncalled for.

318
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,523
You're right.

319
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:37,357
Well, then come on and climb up, cowboy.

320
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,819
My back.

321
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,661
- It's gone again, baby.
- All right, then.

322
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,214
You love me?

323
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,173
You love me?

324
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,135
Do you really love me, honey?

325
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,850
Most of the time I do.

326
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,632
Came in last night at a half past 10:00

327
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,510
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in

328
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,303
So move it on over

329
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,097
Move it on over

330
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,599
- Move it on over
- Move it on over

331
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,699
Move over, little dog
'Cause the big dog's moving in

332
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,650
She changed the lock on our front door

333
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,445
And my door key don't fit no more

334
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,572
So get it on over

335
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,116
- Move it on over
- Scoot it on over

336
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,451
Move it on over

337
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:44,351
Move over, skinny dog
'Cause the fat dog's moving in...

338
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,667
Now, why don't you come down here, and
you'll see what I'm talking about.

339
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,057
Come down.

340
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,464
Now, you see that the left
is much higher than the right.

341
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,965
- Can you see it now?
- Sure, yeah. Yeah.

342
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,009
Now, good.
Now, why don't you go back up and fix it?

343
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,177
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,762
And watch your head.

345
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,742
I don't need no blood.

346
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,826
Hey, honey, get in here.

347
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,119
What?

348
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,704
I want to show you something.

349
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,289
What is it?

350
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,849
Well, get in here, and I'll show you.

351
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,604
Well, okay, then.

352
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,186
What do you have to show me?

353
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,437
You see this?

354
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,611
Now...

355
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,449
"Where the inspiration for Move It On Over
came from, Hank couldn't say.

356
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,979
"It surely wasn't his own married life.

357
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,150
"Mr. and Mrs. Hank Williams
lead a model domestic life."

358
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,735
Wait, you think that's funny?

359
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,835
I kind of do. Don't you?

360
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,035
Also says we've sold over 90,000.

361
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,161
My God.

362
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:10,271
If that's even half true, I wonder what
kind of money that really adds up to.

363
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,544
Adds up to Hiram Williams
is a big damn deal.

364
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,524
Well, big deal, did you see
that note on the counter?

365
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,468
Howard Pill called, making sure
we're at the station tomorrow.

366
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,738
Hell with that show.
I should have never gone back.

367
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,852
All right, folks.

368
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,687
I know it's 6:30 in the morning,

369
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,565
but say you're milking a cow
or just going to the store

370
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,652
for some extra feed or supplies,
we sure appreciate you listening to us.

371
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,154
We really do.

372
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,866
Now, I got a young lady
gonna sing a song for you.

373
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,909
- You here?
- I'm here.

374
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,661
I'm up in here.

375
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,581
She's slowly approaching the microscope.

376
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,040
You good?

377
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,250
I'm fine.

378
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,960
Hey, you don't sound like you mean it.

379
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,020
- Well, I do.
- Well, good.

380
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:01,008
She's gonna sing a little ol' song called
Pan American, which some of you will know.

381
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:06,013
It's the locomotive that highballs it
from Cincinnati all the way to New Orleans

382
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,783
just about every day.

383
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,642
At least turn her mic down,
for God's sake.

384
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,436
Set your clock by it.

385
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,036
All right, Byrd.

386
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,299
I have heard your stories
About your fast trains

387
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,332
And now I'll tell you about one

388
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,918
All the Southern folks have seen

389
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,670
She's the beauty of the Southland

390
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,560
Listen to that whistle scream

391
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:47,567
It's that Pan American
On her way to New Orleans...

392
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,685
Well, we got through that.

393
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,905
Barely.

394
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,857
Someone's got to do something about her.

395
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,037
Well, well, well.

396
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,001
You boys discussing the weather or Audrey?

397
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:09,095
Well, Hank, actually
we were discussing her singing.

398
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,536
You were?

399
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,756
Yeah.

400
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,390
Well, Hank,

401
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,794
she's awful.

402
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,671
Hey, you son of a bitch, that's my wife.

403
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,589
Well, now, look, Hank,
you know as well as I do.

404
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,008
- Now, come on.
- Maybe I do, but that don't matter right now.

405
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,938
That's my wife you're talking about.

406
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,159
Well, screw you, my husband.

407
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,731
Darling. Darling, you didn't hear what I was
saying back there. I was defending you.

408
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,483
You did a hell of a job on that song.

409
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,860
- Just forget about it.
- Baby.

410
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,236
Baby, it's a beautiful morning.

411
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,571
You look beautiful.

412
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:46,739
We're doing really swell.

413
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,532
Have another drink, Hank.

414
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,616
We're doing shit.

415
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,909
Why'd you got to say that?

416
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,161
You know people like my singing?

417
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,954
They tell me that. But not you.

418
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,498
Every time you get a chance,
you squash me like a bug.

419
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,208
What are you talking about, a bug?

420
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,585
More like a damn queen bee.

421
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,670
I bring you up there.
I stand by your side.

422
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,505
- Yeah, holding your nose!
- Holding my nose? No.

423
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,799
Yeah, I'm sick of feeling bad,
Hank, I'm sick of it!

424
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,010
Hey, we've got a hit record,
in case you don't know.

425
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,220
We got a new house, and you got
a goddamned fur coat.

426
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,223
You think that makes up for all the
drunken whoring around bullshit I take?

427
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,243
- It ought to make up for something!
- Well, it don't!

428
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,605
Not for a second does it make up
for crushing a person's dreams.

429
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:20,856
What?

430
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,826
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
'cause it's clear as hell right now.

431
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,864
You can take your hit record,
wrap it up in that fur coat

432
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,514
and you answer the phone
when my lawyer calls.

433
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,505
Great.

434
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,314
He can call right fucking now!

435
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,687
"Love each other."

436
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:46,115
"Hank, I'm opening my heart to you
because I love you like my own son.

437
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,589
"You and Audrey,
you surely love each other.

438
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,589
"But you both want to be the boss.

439
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,513
"Both of you have your pride.

440
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:03,478
"Pride is one of the most
destructive lies on Earth."

441
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,956
Say, how do I look?

442
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:46,136
Better than you did
when you came in, Mr. Williams.

443
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,379
Thank you, Miss Warwick.

444
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,423
I ain't coming in again.

445
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,113
I'm pleased to hear that.

446
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,770
- Don. How are ya?
- Pretty good.

447
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,064
- What, you brought me some candy?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,164
Thank you.

449
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,377
My darling valentine not with you?

450
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,129
Well.

451
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,426
Winner and still champion.

452
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:38,345
"This day in April, 1948,
my husband, Hank Williams

453
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,695
"has a violent and ungovernable temper.

454
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:47,604
"He drinks a great deal,
and during the last month,

455
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,124
"he's been drunk most of the time.

456
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:54,194
"The past few months, he's been engaging
in the wildest extravagances

457
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:57,134
"and wasting the funds
which come into his hands."

458
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,908
I've been wasting the funds.

459
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,468
Audrey ran up a hell of a tab
at Lowry's Furniture.

460
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,539
The owner says he wants it all
by the end of this week.

461
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,889
Does he now?

462
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:13,148
Well, you can tell that guy that
every month I put all my bills in a hat

463
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,926
and then I draw one out
and that's the one I pay.

464
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,986
And if he presses me up again

465
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,182
I ain't even gonna put
his damn bill in the hat.

466
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,322
All right.

467
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,811
The house is a push, essentially,
but you're out from under it.

468
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,814
And, well, here's the deposit.

469
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,924
$2,250, in cash.

470
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,207
It's all just a bunch of papers,
some green and some bloody.

471
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:44,036
I don't see what the problem is
or why it's taking so long or maybe...

472
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,596
You talkin' to that divorcing bitch?

473
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,099
Look, it's the Opry, Fred.

474
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,475
That's what I want.

475
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,631
I always wanted it.

476
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,675
Yeah, I get it, I get it.
But it's not in the cards.

477
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:02,387
Okay, I'm talking to those boys down there,
but we're gonna have to prove ourselves.

478
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,307
And not just musically, frankly,
but with reliability.

479
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,017
Well, the hell with them then.

480
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,853
They can go screw themselves
if they think they're better 'n me.

481
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,231
That's right. They can kiss your ass.

482
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,541
I'm not the enemy, Hank.

483
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:18,093
Now, I got things just about set up with
the Hayride down at Shreveport on KWKH.

484
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,382
- Okay.
- Okay?

485
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,868
Yeah, for the time being, yeah.

486
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,203
All right, good.

487
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,933
How's the family? How's Audrey?

488
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,707
- She's just fine.
- Good.

489
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,960
She's a demon, that's what she is.

490
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,310
Women can be vengeful
when they're not on your side.

491
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,049
Don't you worry, Fred. She's on my side.

492
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,359
She's on her own damn side.

493
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,652
We'll get to Nashville, son.

494
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:18,482
- Crecia, why don't you come back inside?
- Okay, Mommy.

495
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,859
I'll be in in a sec.

496
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:29,699
Audrey.

497
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,405
Hank.

498
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,499
I'm goin' to Shreveport for the Hayride.

499
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,335
I want you to come with me.

500
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,925
Did you get the papers?

501
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,641
Yep.

502
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,718
You get the house money?

503
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,235
Come on, Auds.

504
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,525
You're always, "Come on."

505
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,363
We're about divorced,
in case you didn't know.

506
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,644
It's too hard, this divorce thing.

507
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,454
Well, you should've thought about that
a long time ago.

508
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,632
Yeah, I probably should have.

509
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,254
I couldn't see that far.

510
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,263
I couldn't see that

511
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:32,297
fighting with you
was better than being apart.

512
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,219
People do divorce all the time.

513
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,523
Trust me, you can do it.

514
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:41,647
I know.

515
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,242
But,

516
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,160
I married the right woman
for a man like me,

517
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,619
and I ain't ready to say goodbye.

518
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:00,215
I don't exactly know what that means.

519
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,130
I need you with me, is what it means.

520
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:12,757
Besides, don't I look good?

521
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,814
You look okay.

522
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,604
I look okay.

523
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,897
Is Lillie goin'?

524
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,030
You think you could treat me right, then?

525
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:34,815
Quit drinkin'?

526
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,001
Yes, I do.

527
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:41,957
But you can't.

528
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,131
I can try.

529
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,586
Come with me, Audrey.

530
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,805
I'm afraid to.

531
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,176
I love you.

532
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,021
Yeah.

533
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,408
You gonna quit fighting me
about singing together?

534
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,987
Well, yeah. Yes, I am.

535
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,214
You mean it.

536
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,045
I mean it.

537
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,223
Hey.

538
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,390
Mornin', darlin'.

539
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,063
How'd the road go?

540
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,107
You all right?

541
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,266
I'm pretty beat.

542
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,358
I'm sorry I woke you.

543
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,898
You didn't.

544
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:18,745
I haven't been sleeping worth a damn.

545
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,851
I know about that.

546
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,331
Nah, I haven't.

547
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:40,973
Hank.

548
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,267
You listening?

549
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,692
Kinda.

550
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,534
I'm driftin' off, though.

551
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,526
Well, I was gonna tell you somethin'.

552
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,158
You hearing me?

553
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,011
You're gonna be a daddy.

554
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,071
Audrey Mae.

555
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:44,905
My God. We're gonna have a baby?

556
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,835
- Really?
- Really.

557
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,238
I can't tell.

558
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,958
Well, you will.

559
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,763
- Audrey, I love you.
- And I love you.

560
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,479
This is gonna be great.

561
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,440
It's gonna be great!

562
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,720
You know, he's gonna have a real dad.

563
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,846
Yeah.

564
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,616
No, not like I had.
Not like it was for me.

565
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,741
He's gonna have family.

566
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,395
Well, how do you know it's a boy?

567
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:34,705
Well, whatever it is,
he's gonna have a real family.

568
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,964
Fred wants me to head up Cincinnati
for a session.

569
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,366
Yeah, when?

570
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:43,534
Next week.

571
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,934
I'm good.

572
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:49,887
Look, thing is,

573
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:55,379
Fred wants me to try out some other boys
to back me up on this one.

574
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,649
What the hell... What'd you tell the man?

575
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:00,441
His call.

576
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,429
I don't like that much.

577
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:07,279
Well, I didn't figure you would,
but, that's the way it's gotta be.

578
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,954
Well, maybe you don't need us at all.

579
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:11,520
Look, it don't mean nothin'.

580
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,482
It's just that Red Foley's band's already up
there and Fred wants a record right away.

581
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,002
I see. It don't mean nothin'.

582
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,902
I don't need any shit, Shag.

583
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,462
Well, me neither.

584
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,704
What's he got in mind?

585
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,581
I wanna try Lovesick.

586
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,333
He ain't gonna like that.
You didn't even write it.

587
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,853
Well, that's true.

588
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,690
But I made it mine now.

589
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,767
All righty right.

590
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:44,386
Hey, Fred. We did a couple for you.
I got one for me.

591
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:47,026
I wanna do Lovesick. Right, boys?

592
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,101
Well, hell, screw you guys.

593
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,314
Hank, that song is painful,
and not in the right way.

594
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,523
It's out of meter.

595
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:59,253
You hang onto some of those notes
too damn long.

596
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:02,305
Well, when I find a note I like,
I like holdin' on to it.

597
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:05,219
Listen to me. I'm on the Hayride.

598
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:10,469
I sing that song, I walk off the stage,
I throw my hat back on the stage.

599
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,456
The hat gets an encore.

600
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,016
Come on, now.

601
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,399
All right. I'm getting a cup of coffee.
You got 15 minutes.

602
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,005
Thank you, sir.

603
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,591
All right, boys, Lovesick Blues.
Let's keep it simple.

604
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,111
No need to worry, Hank.
Isn't all this shit simple?

605
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:40,484
I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord

606
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,754
Since my baby said goodbye

607
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:47,258
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

608
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,536
All I do is sit and sigh...

609
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:51,829
I'll tell you somethin'.

610
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:52,969
I ain't buyin'.

611
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,085
Gonna have a burger there
with the ketchup?

612
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,395
Yes, I am.

613
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,856
- Hey, Sammy, you get there yet?
- No.

614
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,516
I didn't start from the back.

615
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:08,011
Well, I guess in high school
you still read front to back, huh?

616
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,430
That's funny, Hank.

617
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,014
You ain't that much older, you know.

618
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:13,324
I was born older than you, Sammy.

619
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,539
Take a look at this.

620
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,965
Look at it.

621
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,563
Now, I'll tell you somethin'.

622
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,548
And this ain't bull.

623
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,938
If this don't get me to the Opry,

624
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,243
I'm gonna give it up.

625
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:52,723
No shit.

626
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,934
They'll have to come find me on a boat
full of bass and come beggin'!

627
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:57,019
What they'll have to do.

628
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,119
- Hank.
- Oscar!

629
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,481
What, somebody been chasing you or what?

630
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:01,648
It's Audrey.

631
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,328
- She all right?
- Yeah, yeah. You comin'?

632
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:08,588
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Well, okay then! All right!

633
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,157
Hey, I told you I ain't buyin'.

634
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,257
Hey, Sammy,
keep a hold of that magazine, okay?

635
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:38,328
Doc. Everything all right?

636
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,312
Congratulations.

637
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,106
You have a son, Mr. Williams.

638
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,399
- I... I do?
- You do.

639
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,319
- How's Mama?
- She's good. She's strong.

640
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,445
- She all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

641
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,739
- And the boy, well, he's healthy, and...
- Yeah?

642
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:51,782
Big.

643
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:53,700
- He's big?
- Over 10 pounds.

644
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,202
- Well...
- Biggest this year.

645
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:56,412
He's a hoss, huh?

646
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,642
That's the truth.

647
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,124
Well, thank you, Doc. Thank you so much.

648
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,458
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

649
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,419
We'll have her ready for you
to see in about 15 minutes.

650
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:04,503
- Yes, sir. All right.
- All right.

651
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,797
- I'm gonna need my hand back.
- Okay, all right, I'll let you go.

652
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,647
- All right. Sure.
- Okay. Thank you, sir.

653
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,239
All right, now.

654
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,460
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

655
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,996
It's all right. It's all right.

656
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,327
It's all right.

657
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,967
Daddy's here.

658
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,980
I wouldn't let my dear savior in

659
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,632
Then Jesus came

660
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:54,152
Like a stranger in the night

661
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,515
Praise the Lord

662
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,945
I saw the light

663
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:04,938
I saw the light

664
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:08,038
I saw the light

665
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,669
No more darkness

666
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:15,129
No more night

667
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:19,144
Now I'm so happy

668
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:22,388
No sorrow in sight

669
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:27,169
Praise the Lord

670
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,979
I saw the light

671
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,111
He was sleeping pretty good there
for a few days.

672
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,124
I guess they finally put the batteries in.

673
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:50,126
He sure likes his mama.

674
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,885
I'm going to the Opry, Auds.

675
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,850
Of course you are, honey.

676
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,435
I mean now.

677
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,417
Well, how'd he get past
Jack Stapp and that gang?

678
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,392
Oscar and Fred swore
I'd keep my nose clean.

679
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,581
I've been sober.

680
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,601
Well, I ought to be there.

681
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,556
I ought to be there, Hank.

682
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:54,903
But I can't, can I?

683
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,398
This peanut's too little.

684
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,432
It's not right.

685
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:05,452
I know. I know, honey.

686
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:07,827
I know.

687
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,660
I'm sorry.

688
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:13,211
It suddenly just happened that fast?

689
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,752
Not fast enough for me.

690
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:23,086
I'm walking the floor over you

691
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:28,525
I can't sleep a wink, that is true

692
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,335
I'm hoping and I'm praying

693
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,405
As my heart breaks right in two...

694
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,610
Hank.

695
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:38,781
How you doing, son?

696
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,095
- Pretty fair.
- Don't worry,

697
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,865
they can kill you, but they can't eat you.

698
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,946
Strangely comforting.

699
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,726
I'm real proud of you, Hank.

700
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,603
I say that as a friend.

701
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:52,147
- Well, I wouldn't be here without you, Pappy.
- Well.

702
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,024
It's everything I ever wanted.

703
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:58,028
Well, soon as he's done, there's gonna
be three commercials, and then it's you.

704
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,155
Foley's boys are backing you.

705
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,965
They're down the hall.

706
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,410
- Jim.
- Fred.

707
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,870
Hank, Jim Denny, manager of the Opry.

708
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,970
Yes, sir. Thank you.

709
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,315
Sure. Good luck.

710
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,650
...just food and drinks and everything.

711
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,360
- You guys get a little hungry...
- Boys.

712
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,556
- Hey, Hank.
- Hey.

713
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:26,736
Hank.

714
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:30,835
Hank.

715
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,874
Jerry.

716
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:41,238
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's big-name
guest is making his first appearance

717
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:43,198
on the Prince Albert Grand Ole Opry.

718
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:46,535
Let's give a rousing welcome
to theLovesick Blues boy,

719
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,265
Mr. Hank Williams!

720
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,796
I got a feelin' called the blues

721
00:48:57,896 --> 00:49:00,896
Oh, Lord, since my baby said goodbye

722
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:05,105
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

723
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:08,766
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

724
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:12,656
That last long day she said goodbye

725
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,370
Well, Lord, I thought I would cry

726
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,527
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'

727
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:22,696
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me

728
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,699
Sweet daddy

729
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,969
Such a beautiful dream

730
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,854
I hate to think it all over

731
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:35,595
I lost my heart, it seems

732
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:39,349
I've grown so used to you somehow

733
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,300
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now

734
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,636
And I'm lonesome

735
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,736
I got the lovesick blues

736
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,934
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love

737
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,914
With a beautiful gal

738
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:56,709
That's what's the matter with me

739
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,816
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love

740
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,776
With a beautiful gal

741
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,956
But she don't care about me

742
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,198
Lord, I've tried and I've tried

743
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:07,658
To keep her satisfied

744
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:10,678
But she just wouldn't stay

745
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:14,604
So now that she is leavin'

746
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:18,502
This is all I can say

747
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,047
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord

748
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:24,517
Since my baby said good-bye

749
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:28,704
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

750
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:32,349
I lost my heart, it seems

751
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,603
I've grown so used to you somehow

752
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:40,107
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now

753
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:42,609
And I'm lonesome

754
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,549
I got the lovesick blues

755
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,268
Glen Burnie, Maryland, where local law
enforcement and the Air Force have turned up

756
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:18,270
some unusual evidence,
which may shed light

757
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,000
on the recent flying saucer sightings.

758
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,442
Baseball's greatest manager, Connie Mack,

759
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,570
was given a massive
ticker tape parade on Broadway.

760
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,130
Fifty years of managing!

761
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,744
And Grand Ole Opry performers
Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl

762
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,622
and young heartthrob, Hank Williams,
have been on a tour

763
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,432
of US airbases in Germany.

764
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:42,920
Here's Hank and his wife, Audrey,
moving into a new house

765
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,860
on Franklin Road in Nashville, Tennessee.

766
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,111
Good luck, young lovers!

767
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,548
Merry Christmas, Fred.

768
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,173
Jesus, Hank, I've been looking for you.

769
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,758
What are you doing out here?

770
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,778
I love this thing. I love it.

771
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,138
- Come over here, push my button.
- No, you're crazy.

772
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:17,848
I'm gonna go back inside.

773
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,683
All right, well,
bring me a drink, will ya?

774
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,351
Well, no, you don't need one.

775
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,621
Now, can you come back inside
before you get sick?

776
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:26,368
This is inspirational.

777
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,735
She builds me up, she brings me down...

778
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:32,654
Baby, I'm so thrilled
that you're inspired now.

779
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:34,615
Now, could you please
come back in and join the party?

780
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:35,949
Hey, honey?

781
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,618
Did you like that necklace I got you?

782
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,661
- Yeah, I love it.
- Do ya?

783
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:40,871
Yeah.

784
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,956
Well, come over here and push my button.

785
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:45,084
No way. It's freezing, baby.

786
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,544
- Forget it, then!
- What, so now you're gonna be mad?

787
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,630
- No, I'm not mad.
- Okay, well, good,

788
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,507
'cause I'm gonna go back inside,
and you, you just...

789
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,550
You keep on playing
with that button of yours.

790
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,951
- Well, good, 'cause I love my button.
- Well, then you keep on lovin' it!

791
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:08,116
You'll meet many just like me
Upon life's busy street...

792
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,916
Yeah.

793
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:14,988
Yeah, Luke the Drifter was a pseudonym

794
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,200
that Hank sometimes used
to record certain songs.

795
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,601
They didn't sell well, but they seemed
to offer some emotional relief for Hank.

796
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,999
Hank's first record for us
was Move It On Over.

797
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,586
And then in our second session,
he recorded I Saw the Light.

798
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:32,047
And Audrey Williams,
did you work with her?

799
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:34,017
How should I say this?

800
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:38,804
We were happy to have
Decca release her material.

801
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:40,364
Miss Ragland!

802
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,200
Could you take the child?

803
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,625
- Operator.
- Hi, Operator.

804
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,055
Sheraton Hotel, Oklahoma City, please.

805
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,881
Well, I had me a woman

806
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,401
Who done me wrong

807
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,303
I wish I had the words

808
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:22,743
To fix this song...

809
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,444
Sorry, ma'am, still no answer.

810
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:36,737
Care to leave a message?

811
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:40,115
Yes. Could you tell him,

812
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:43,585
"I need to talk to you,
you son of a bitch"?

813
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:48,916
- Did you get that?
- Yes, ma'am.

814
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,096
Good.

815
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,534
No, thanks.

816
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,871
Afternoon, Mr. Nowlin.

817
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,103
This ain't gonna cut it, fellas.

818
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,189
Yes, sir. I'm real sorry. I understand.

819
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:37,691
I... You see, Hank's come down
with something real bad,

820
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:42,711
and, well, he's just too damn sick
to perform up to our usual standards.

821
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,949
I don't know what's up with you, Williams,

822
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:50,037
but you're going up on that stage,
and you're gonna give these folks,

823
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:54,637
who've been waiting hours for your ass,
a fine piece of yourself.

824
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,062
You understand?

825
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,600
Thank you, sir.

826
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,940
That the doctor?

827
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:05,779
Or whatever he is
that does these kinds of things.

828
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,860
Well, come on in.

829
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,781
Let's get this over with.

830
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:15,834
I don't want to wait a whole lot longer.

831
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:26,925
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

832
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:28,966
Hank Williams is here!

833
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:35,165
And he is ready to give you the show
you've been hoping for.

834
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,225
Hank Williams, everyone!

835
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,781
Come on, Hank!

836
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,338
Any of you folks know
my half-brother, Luke?

837
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,171
My good friend, Luke the Drifter?

838
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,619
Hell, I don't know
where they got the Luke part,

839
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,469
but I can sure tell ya
where they got the Drifter part.

840
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,896
I'd like to tell you a story.

841
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,819
About a family I once knew.

842
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,869
Why don't we call 'em William and Mary

843
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,952
and their little daughter Sue.

844
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:45,131
Now, Mary was just a plain mother,

845
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,673
and Bill, well, he was a usual dad.

846
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:54,036
And they had their own
little family quarrels,

847
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,216
but neither one ever really got mad.

848
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:02,103
And then one day something happened.

849
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:06,189
And it was nothing, of course.

850
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:13,861
But one word led to another,
and the last word led to a divorce.

851
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:23,500
Now, here were two grown-up people
who'd failed to use common sense.

852
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,749
They strengthened their own selfish pride

853
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,627
at little Sue's expense.

854
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:46,863
...eight, nine, 10, 11, 12...

855
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:50,072
They sold me 13 roses.

856
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,902
You know, we'll save one for Hazel.

857
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:57,641
Thanks for doing all the driving, Don.

858
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,201
Sure. You want me to stick around?

859
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,082
Nah, you're fine.

860
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:06,583
Hank, I've been thinking.

861
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,737
We've been running pretty hard.

862
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,467
Maybe I've been too reluctant
to speak up about some things.

863
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:16,368
You've been fine.

864
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:17,928
Whatcha gonna do?

865
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,390
You know,

866
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:24,602
my uncle told me

867
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:28,102
Grant was drunk

868
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,360
every afternoon by 3:00.

869
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,855
But he still took Vicksburg.

870
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,281
Yeah, I guess he did.

871
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,356
I'll see ya, then.

872
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:47,956
I'll see ya.

873
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:06,846
Hey.

874
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,648
How long you been here?

875
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,358
A little bit.

876
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:15,186
It took you long enough.

877
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:20,165
I just got off the road.

878
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,411
- How are you?
- How'd you do?

879
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:29,371
We made out okay.

880
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,840
How's my boy?

881
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,591
He's okay.

882
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,072
How much?

883
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:36,448
Where's he at?

884
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:39,378
He's at the house. Where you think?

885
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:46,143
Billboard says we did
$11,000 paid last week.

886
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,020
I heard you and Luke
had some trouble in Texas.

887
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:53,590
Yeah.

888
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,900
Yeah.

889
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,543
What is it, baby?

890
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,357
You gonna be okay?

891
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,497
Am I gonna be okay?

892
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:16,759
Hell.

893
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,220
You know, you come home
from God knows wherever you are,

894
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:26,972
and then we sleep together.

895
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,777
You haven't a damn clue.

896
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:41,197
You did this to me, Hank.

897
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:48,835
You're the bastard
that caused me to suffer like this.

898
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,915
What are you saying?

899
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,917
God, you're barely even here.

900
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:03,888
You're barely even a father now.

901
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,310
And, well,

902
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:12,603
you couldn't have handled
being more of one.

903
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,279
What did you do?

904
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:25,974
You can't... You can't do that without me.

905
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,784
Well, it's done.

906
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,254
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

907
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:56,880
Thank you, friends.

908
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,070
And that about wraps it up for today.

909
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:05,055
All right, all right,
there a little more in store, isn't there?

910
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:09,560
I almost forgot about the man y'all
come to say hello to and rightly honor.

911
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,950
He's my very, very good friend.

912
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:15,924
One of the finest songwriters
I've ever had the pleasure to know.

913
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:20,320
So, let's welcome,
at his Montgomery Homecoming Day,

914
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,630
a great and loyal son of Alabama,

915
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,681
Hank Williams!

916
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,239
Hank Williams!

917
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:03,706
Hey, buddy.

918
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:18,727
Well, hello, Montgomery.

919
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:25,177
It's always good to be back here.

920
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,804
I thank y'all so much.

921
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:28,138
I thank you.

922
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:32,017
I much appreciate the warm welcome
you've given to me and my family.

923
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:33,447
My mother, Lillie.

924
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,119
My beautiful wife, Audrey.

925
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:42,376
My little lady, Lycrecia.

926
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,295
My big boy, Bocephus!

927
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:59,545
Now, right now,
I got a little song for ya.

928
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:01,630
It's been awful good to me and the boys.

929
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,216
It's bought us
quite a few beans and biscuits.

930
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:05,509
It's called

931
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,609
Good Looking, You Got Anything Cooking,
How About Cooking It Up With Me?

932
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,419
Hey, good lookin'

933
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,634
Whatcha got cookin'?

934
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,837
How's about cookin' something up with me?

935
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,143
Said, hey, sweet baby

936
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:36,136
Don't you think maybe

937
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:41,813
We could find us a brand-new recipe?

938
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,216
I got a hot-rod Ford and a two-dollar bill

939
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:49,356
And I know a spot right over the hill

940
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,972
There's soda pop and the dancing's free

941
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:55,267
So if you wanna have fun
Come along with me

942
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:58,327
Said, hey, good lookin'

943
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:01,497
Whatcha got cookin'?

944
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:06,542
How's about cookin' something up with me?

945
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:08,511
Don Helms.

946
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,310
I'm free and I'm ready

947
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,520
So we can go steady

948
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:31,815
How's about savin' all your time for me?

949
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,354
You think all hotels are good.

950
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,584
Yeah.

951
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,125
Here we are.

952
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:47,277
Where are you gentlemen going?

953
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:48,957
Perry Como Show.

954
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:51,990
Thank you, sir.

955
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,260
Thank you.

956
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:01,625
- It was a good show, man.
- It was.

957
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,461
You sure couldn't get
that damn jingle right, could you?

958
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,880
Don't you know there's 20 smokes
in a pack of Chesterfields?

959
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:10,175
I know damn well there's 20 smokes
in a pack of Chesterfields.

960
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:11,927
And I'll tell you something else.

961
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:14,805
Ol' Hank didn't come all the way
from South Alabama to New York City

962
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:18,455
to sing in a damn cigarette commercial,
that's for damn sure.

963
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,103
Gentlemen want another round,
or have you hit your limit

964
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,313
- on soda water?
- Yes, ma'am! We do.

965
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:24,913
Yeah, I'm good.

966
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,817
Have a damn drink, boys.

967
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,861
Babysittin' hour's about up.

968
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,154
Thank you.

969
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:31,572
Yes, please, ma'am.

970
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:33,115
Mr. Williams.

971
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,783
James Dolan from the Tribune.

972
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,473
Really sorry I'm late.

973
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,429
You don't like doing this much, do you?

974
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:44,139
Well, it comes with the job.

975
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:50,227
You know what I don't like

976
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:55,066
is people pretending one thing
and they got something else on their mind.

977
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,945
You do what I do, you get where I am,
you see plenty of that.

978
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:04,406
People thinking they'll make a nice pie
with a slice of me.

979
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:08,791
Well, I'm only looking to give people
some insight into you.

980
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:12,463
Why you write what you write,
sing what you sing.

981
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:17,971
I write what I write and I sing
what I sing 'cause that's what I do.

982
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:21,136
Ain't much choice, really.

983
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:23,290
As an artist.

984
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,100
That's your word.

985
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:32,132
You are offering your fans something.

986
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:34,322
What would you say that is?

987
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,834
Mr. Dolan,

988
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:53,134
everybody has a little darkness in them.

989
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:56,448
Now, they may not like it,

990
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:59,118
don't want to know about it,

991
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:01,088
but it's there.

992
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:05,517
Now, I'm talking about things like anger,

993
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:09,694
misery, sorrow, shame.

994
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:13,773
And they hear it.

995
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:16,109
I show it to 'em.

996
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,783
And they don't have to take it home.

997
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:35,339
You think that's
what they expect from you?

998
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,336
They expect I can help their troubles.

999
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:46,216
Now, the reason I know that
is 'cause they write.

1000
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:52,022
If their husband dies and they're left
with eight starving kids, they write.

1001
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:55,691
If their sweetheart's done 'em wrong,
they write.

1002
01:11:55,899 --> 01:12:01,535
I don't know, but I reckon they think
I'm some sort of Red Cross.

1003
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:07,332
You can write this down.

1004
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:12,042
Folk music, hillbilly,

1005
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,213
it's sincere.

1006
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:17,589
There ain't nothing phony.

1007
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:21,617
Man sings a sad song,

1008
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:23,297
he knows the sad.

1009
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:30,099
There's, well, a lot of speculation

1010
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:35,839
about the hard lives
that western or folk singers live.

1011
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,925
What do you mean, "hard"?

1012
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:41,345
Well, I mean,
more like the women, whiskey.

1013
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:44,615
If you're getting at something,
then get at it.

1014
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,949
There are a lot of rumors, Mr. Williams,

1015
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:52,455
that you have struggled with alcohol.

1016
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,193
I didn't know you were
in the rumor business, Mr. Dolan.

1017
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:57,736
I'm not. I don't mean to offend...

1018
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:01,490
But since you obviously are,
why don't you say they're all true,

1019
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,470
- every single one of 'em?
- Because that's not what I do.

1020
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:06,967
You can do whatever you want to do,

1021
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,561
but I'm done doing this.

1022
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:43,824
Hunt 'em up, now. Hunt 'em up.
There you go, Zeke.

1023
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:45,304
Hunt 'em up.

1024
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,912
Here we go. Hunt 'em up.

1025
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,312
Hunt 'em up.

1026
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:52,767
Sit.

1027
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,854
- Try gettin' birdy.
- Sit.

1028
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:03,218
- God blessed!
- Birdy.

1029
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,803
- Damn it!
- You're supposed to shoot 'em,

1030
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,555
- not scare 'em off.
- Yeah, I'm trying.

1031
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,075
Whoa, Zeke.

1032
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,869
He's onto something.

1033
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:19,651
Shit.

1034
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,171
It's a coon.

1035
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:25,219
Hank?

1036
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,343
Hey, Hank!

1037
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:28,838
Oh, God.

1038
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:34,465
What are you doing down there, man?

1039
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:36,885
- Here.
- No...

1040
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,980
Give me a second, Burr.

1041
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,774
My back is fucked.

1042
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:49,238
Mr. Williams?

1043
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,409
Your back's not broken.

1044
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,735
Well, I couldn't feel it if it was.

1045
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:05,255
Yes, you've got quite a bit
of morphine in your system.

1046
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:09,679
Have to get the recipe from ya.

1047
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,966
How much do you know about your condition?

1048
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,769
Always had that bump.

1049
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,905
Docs early on didn't want to
do much about it.

1050
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:24,842
Well, there's a name for that.

1051
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,844
It's called spina bifida occulta.

1052
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:30,114
It means your vertebrae
aren't completely closed.

1053
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:34,059
Now, people with the mildest form
of this type of spina bifida

1054
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,739
often don't even know they have it.

1055
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:43,291
Well, now I know it's got a name.

1056
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:45,946
It's chronic, Mr. Williams.

1057
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,364
It'll never go away.

1058
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:49,199
Now, we can operate,

1059
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:52,469
try and alleviate the pain
as much as possible.

1060
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,058
Cure me or kill me, Doc.

1061
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:03,517
I can't go on like
I've been doing anymore.

1062
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,460
Hey.

1063
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,174
How you doing?

1064
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:35,605
I suppose you've been out
with your friends?

1065
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,751
At a joint?

1066
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,311
No, I was at a house.

1067
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:44,437
Drinking?

1068
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,147
Yeah, a little bit.

1069
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,765
Exactly how sick would I have to be

1070
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:57,535
for you to stick around
and provide a little comfort?

1071
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:05,627
Well, a little comfort
is something that runs two ways.

1072
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:10,656
Not in your case.

1073
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:11,916
Damn.

1074
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:14,877
Screw you, Hank.

1075
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,663
Come over here and you can.

1076
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,183
Yeah, I doubt that.

1077
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:23,185
Professional like you,
I'm sure it'd be no problem.

1078
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:27,965
You son of a bitch.

1079
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,842
All you do is you go out on the road

1080
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:32,386
and you sleep with
a different woman every night,

1081
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,389
and then you finally get home
and criticize me?

1082
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,869
Well, you want it all, don't you, baby?

1083
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:42,447
You want to whore around
and still be Mrs. Hank Williams.

1084
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,121
You know what?

1085
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,878
You can keep
your great Mrs. Hank Williams.

1086
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:52,629
I'll give it back to you.

1087
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:02,499
Baby, what are you doing up?

1088
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:04,479
Come here. Let's get you back to bed.

1089
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:17,181
I know I can't make D.C.
or Baltimore, Jim.

1090
01:18:17,281 --> 01:18:20,225
Now, why can't we just
tell them the truth and live with it?

1091
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:22,394
I'm sorry, Hank,
but I think we got to do it this way.

1092
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,563
You're not hearing me.
I don't want to do it!

1093
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:27,399
And I sure as hell don't want
Audrey standing in for me,

1094
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:31,361
- or anybody else at the show.
- Hank, I don't see a way around it.

1095
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,961
It's simple.

1096
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:36,593
I can't make it 'cause I'm laid up.

1097
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:39,328
Now, I get the boys as soon as I can.

1098
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,663
I go down there on my own money.

1099
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,040
I'll make it right.

1100
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,751
Connie Gay is putting these shows on.

1101
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,377
Now, he and I go back forever.

1102
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:49,171
Now, there's nobody else available.

1103
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,757
I mean, I got the Opry spread
all over on New Year's Eve.

1104
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:53,937
Toledo, Baltimore, Raleigh.

1105
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:01,534
Says one every three hours.

1106
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:08,961
I figure three every hour
ought to be that much better.

1107
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:18,298
You good to go?

1108
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,842
- Hell.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:26,166
Look, you don't show, everybody
will think it's the whiskey talking,

1110
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:28,460
and Connie Gay will be stuck bad.

1111
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,630
And whether you like it or not,
I represent the Opry.

1112
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,634
And as fond of you as I am, if you want
to stay a part of this, you got to do it.

1113
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:37,761
You need to record this.

1114
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,763
We'll play it that night.

1115
01:19:39,863 --> 01:19:42,573
You always been a son of a bitch, J.D.

1116
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,335
Well, that may be,
but it's 'cause I have to be.

1117
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,410
But I always been solid by you.

1118
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:06,013
Give me a pen.

1119
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:11,065
I think I can write my own damn apology.

1120
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:18,283
I'd really been looking forward to
visiting you folks in Washington today.

1121
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:22,639
But, well, a couple weeks ago, I...

1122
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,579
I had to have an operation on my back.

1123
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,579
Fact is, I been in bed a couple weeks,

1124
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:36,878
and, well, I sure am sorry
I couldn't be there tonight.

1125
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:40,798
I hope y'all enjoy the rest of the show.

1126
01:20:42,134 --> 01:20:46,144
And thanks for buying my records.

1127
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:51,210
Audrey, I should've gone straight home.

1128
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:55,881
No, it's fine. We'll just have a drink,
and they will just have to deal with it.

1129
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,216
If you say so.

1130
01:20:57,316 --> 01:20:58,436
Yeah.

1131
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,243
Hank?

1132
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,412
Hank?

1133
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,964
Why don't you two wait in here,
and I'll go see where he is.

1134
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:18,695
Hank?

1135
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:20,955
Doesn't appear
anyone's here to greet Mommy.

1136
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,219
Yeah.

1137
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:28,038
Where the hell is he?

1138
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:29,308
What is he doing?

1139
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:48,832
What the hell are you doing?

1140
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:54,940
Killing bottles, waiting for
my loving wife to come home.

1141
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,670
Okay, well, I'm home now.

1142
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,170
Chri...

1143
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:02,593
Hi, ladies.

1144
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:04,575
Hello, Hank.

1145
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,243
What are you... Are you drunk?

1146
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:07,593
Are you?

1147
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:12,929
Do you think that you could wait till
we're alone before you start acting up?

1148
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:17,546
You really have no couth, do you?

1149
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:18,756
You son of a bitch.

1150
01:22:18,856 --> 01:22:20,226
I suppose you're right, dear.

1151
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:26,244
Now die, you God-awful tiki wiki shit!

1152
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:45,223
Hank Williams,

1153
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:49,549
I will never live another day with you.

1154
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:52,431
Never.

1155
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:05,302
That's when he moved in with Ray Price.

1156
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:09,306
Ray was a bit younger,
and innocent in many ways,

1157
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:13,616
and he really looked up to Hank,
as a lot of the guys did.

1158
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:19,459
And the house was a nice place
in the Natchez Trace area in Nashville.

1159
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,301
One thing's for sure.

1160
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:31,587
Ray wasn't ready
for what Hank was bringing.

1161
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:21,295
Hank, can you believe
I was gonna be a veterinarian?

1162
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:22,588
- Hey, Ray?
- Look at me now.

1163
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:24,339
I got the best party on the block.

1164
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:26,508
- Look at you now!
- I should write a song

1165
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,510
- called Look At Me Now.
- You should write...

1166
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:31,910
Look at me now...

1167
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:35,736
"His conduct was intolerable.

1168
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:39,201
"He became abusive, cursing me,

1169
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,524
"and even striking me
on numerous occasions."

1170
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,777
- That's a damn lie, Ray.
- I'm sure it is.

1171
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:47,029
Why'd she have to go that far?

1172
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:49,865
Well, Hank, that's divorce in this country,
as far as I can tell.

1173
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:52,576
This says I made 92 grand last year.

1174
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:54,453
Hell, I didn't make that.

1175
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:57,723
House at 55 grand, three Cadillacs.

1176
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:03,754
"In the past months,
defendant has been enjoying

1177
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:06,484
"a life of wild extravagance."

1178
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,686
Hey, Bobbie, come here.

1179
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,572
Come on, get a seat.

1180
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:24,957
I'm rich.

1181
01:25:26,293 --> 01:25:27,963
And I'm dangerous.

1182
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:36,546
Well, I guess there's worse things
you could be.

1183
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,915
Says that I had an affair
with a highway patrolman

1184
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,845
when he was on the road.

1185
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:44,962
And look at this.

1186
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,047
I insisted on singing with him

1187
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:50,527
when I had neither a voice
or musical ability.

1188
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:54,363
How you doing up there, cowboy?

1189
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:58,656
Just can't believe this place is yours.

1190
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:01,705
For about another hour.

1191
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:04,815
Was gonna build a house
over by that pecan grove,

1192
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,925
but that ain't happening now.

1193
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:10,463
Well, you'll get another
one somewhere else.

1194
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,720
Somewhere else.

1195
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:16,827
I've been there before.

1196
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:18,597
And it ain't much better.

1197
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:25,771
You know, sometimes I wish
I was back at WSFA making $12 a week,

1198
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:28,688
and knowing who my friends were.

1199
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:50,360
- Hey, you know this man?
- By telephone only. He's okay.

1200
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,750
I bet he's never heard one song.

1201
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:59,703
You gentlemen may go in now.

1202
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:02,393
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1203
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:04,917
Fred!

1204
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:06,293
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1205
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:07,711
- Welcome, welcome.
- How are you, Dore?

1206
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:09,311
I'm fine, Fred, you know.

1207
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:12,267
Hank, how are you?

1208
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:16,845
I'm all right, Mr. Schary.

1209
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:18,222
I'm all right.

1210
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:19,473
Well, take your hat off.

1211
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:21,533
Sit down. Just relax.

1212
01:27:25,454 --> 01:27:26,939
How was the flight in?

1213
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:28,565
It was all right.

1214
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:30,692
A little bumpy over Wichita.

1215
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:31,860
Yeah?

1216
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,500
Yeah, always is.

1217
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:39,034
Hank, I'm very sorry to hear about

1218
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:41,912
you and Audrey having troubles,
I mean, you know.

1219
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,642
The business, it's tough on marriage.

1220
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:47,893
Well, marriage is tough on marriage.

1221
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,441
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1222
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:54,685
Yeah.

1223
01:27:57,778 --> 01:27:59,763
What do you say we just cut to the chase?

1224
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:01,098
All right.

1225
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:03,642
I saw your press release
announcing our deals.

1226
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:04,852
You fellas played it up nicely.

1227
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:07,662
We were generally pleased
with the response.

1228
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,668
Well, we're thinking of a part
for Hank in Small Town Girls,

1229
01:28:16,046 --> 01:28:17,740
with Farley Granger and Jane Powell.

1230
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,658
My wife loves Jane Powell.

1231
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:21,178
Perfect.

1232
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,203
So does America.

1233
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:24,393
Yeah.

1234
01:28:25,264 --> 01:28:29,626
And as we discussed, Fred,
it would be no more than four weeks' work.

1235
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:30,669
Right.

1236
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:33,519
And a salary of $4,500 a week.

1237
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:36,072
That's quite a lot of money, isn't it?

1238
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:40,861
Well, it's not as much cash
as I can make on the road.

1239
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:42,609
Is it, Pappy?

1240
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:46,810
Well, I'm sure between Fred and I,

1241
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:50,790
we can come to an arrangement,
if we're all serious.

1242
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:52,671
So, Hank, how tall are you?

1243
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:56,128
About the same as my mother.

1244
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:00,991
Six feet, six-one, thereabout.

1245
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:03,786
Is that with or without the hat?

1246
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:05,796
Because I don't think
I've ever seen you without it.

1247
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:07,757
Well, me neither.

1248
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:12,386
Would you mind?

1249
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:16,363
I'd like to see, well,

1250
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:18,857
your general look.

1251
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:21,238
Your hair.

1252
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:23,525
You do have hair, right?

1253
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,569
Yes, sir.

1254
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,620
I got a whole drawer full of it.

1255
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:32,292
I'm serious, Hank.

1256
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:34,793
Me, too.

1257
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:44,548
You know, I read something today.

1258
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:46,393
It said I was a genius.

1259
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:51,347
Why do you figure that makes me fearful?

1260
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:54,811
Probably the load.

1261
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,305
I miss them so much, Mama.

1262
01:29:57,689 --> 01:29:58,966
So damn much.

1263
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,384
I know you do.

1264
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:01,885
- I know.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1265
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:03,887
let me just give you the lowdown
on this next fella's...

1266
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:06,407
But you are better off without her, son.

1267
01:30:07,324 --> 01:30:09,494
She was never worth a half of you.

1268
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:13,230
I got a little boy I worry about, too.

1269
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,420
...he's got a new song out there
that he wrote for us.

1270
01:30:30,514 --> 01:30:31,582
Yes, sir.

1271
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:33,500
I got a brand-new song,
ain't never been aired.

1272
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,544
Ain't never been aired?

1273
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:37,194
No, but it just might need it.

1274
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:38,939
Doggone it, Hank!

1275
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:40,731
All right, boys, let it roll.

1276
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:50,017
Well, why don't you love me
like you used to do?

1277
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:53,020
How come you treat me
like a worn-out shoe?

1278
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,398
My hair's still curly
and my eyes are still blue

1279
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:59,526
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

1280
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:02,613
I ain't had no lovin'
like a-huggin' and a-kissin'

1281
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:06,116
In a long, long while

1282
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:09,328
We don't get nearer or further

1283
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:12,718
Or closer than a country mile

1284
01:31:13,849 --> 01:31:16,919
Why don't you spark me
like you used to do?

1285
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:20,255
And say sweet nothings
like you used to coo

1286
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,132
I'm the same old trouble

1287
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:23,842
That you've always been through

1288
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:27,179
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

1289
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:28,319
Don Helms.

1290
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:41,037
Burt Hale.

1291
01:32:09,613 --> 01:32:13,350
Well, why don't you be
just like you used to be?

1292
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:16,812
How come you find so many faults with me?

1293
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:20,357
Somebody's changed
so let me give you a clue

1294
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:23,026
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

1295
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:24,653
I ain't had no lovin'

1296
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:29,553
Like a-huggin' and a-kissin'
in a long, long while

1297
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:32,911
I just laughed it off.

1298
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,391
I don't know.

1299
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:37,184
Hey, girl.

1300
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:41,879
You here with anybody?

1301
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:42,979
Faron Young.

1302
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,215
Boy guesting up in Shreveport?

1303
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:46,395
That's him.

1304
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:49,937
And that's him right over there
behind you.

1305
01:32:51,113 --> 01:32:52,055
Hey, Faron.

1306
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:53,140
Hank.

1307
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,160
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1308
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:56,986
Billie?

1309
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:58,996
You gonna marry this girl?

1310
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:01,774
Well, are you?

1311
01:33:01,874 --> 01:33:03,464
Well, not likely.

1312
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:06,251
She's far too good-looking for a wife.

1313
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,167
Well, if you ain't gonna marry her,

1314
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:12,344
ol' Hank just might.

1315
01:33:12,843 --> 01:33:14,593
- Is that right?
- That's right.

1316
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:17,289
Son.

1317
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:19,389
I hope I ain't causing you any pain.

1318
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:21,845
Don't worry about it.

1319
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,070
You're like an angel.

1320
01:33:32,446 --> 01:33:36,162
My two boys over there,
Alton and Sonny, big fans of yours.

1321
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:38,227
Pregnant at 16.

1322
01:33:38,327 --> 01:33:39,812
So, Jeri Lynn there.

1323
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,792
Married and pregnant, Mr. Jones.

1324
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:44,316
Well, I'm not selling her short.

1325
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:45,706
She is pretty tough.

1326
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,986
I bet she is.

1327
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,739
Nineteen years old,
what the hell do you know?

1328
01:33:50,839 --> 01:33:52,616
Yeah, I could barely tie
my own shoes then.

1329
01:33:52,716 --> 01:33:54,586
Well, heck, I wasn't even wearin' them.

1330
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:58,046
I like children a lot.

1331
01:33:58,347 --> 01:34:01,890
I got one of my own,
and my former wife had one, too.

1332
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:05,587
Well, you're handsome,
talented and love kids.

1333
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:07,057
How about that, Daddy?

1334
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

1335
01:34:21,954 --> 01:34:23,584
- Hey, Ray.
- Hank.

1336
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,291
Bobbie.

1337
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:28,708
Hank.

1338
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:33,548
You with him?

1339
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:35,129
Nope.

1340
01:34:35,676 --> 01:34:36,702
You with him?

1341
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:38,537
Bobbie, what are you doing here?

1342
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:39,830
What do you think, Hank?

1343
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,665
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

1344
01:34:41,765 --> 01:34:43,542
Billie, let me handle this, please.

1345
01:34:43,642 --> 01:34:45,002
Bobbie, we got to talk.

1346
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:46,102
Talk?

1347
01:34:46,645 --> 01:34:47,855
Get her out of here.

1348
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:49,768
I'm sorry, darling.

1349
01:34:50,357 --> 01:34:51,937
But who do you think you are?

1350
01:34:52,317 --> 01:34:53,844
Well, I was the woman he was gonna marry.

1351
01:34:53,944 --> 01:34:55,387
- Really? Lucky him.
- Billie.

1352
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:57,681
Maybe you should have told some
of your other girls that, Hank.

1353
01:34:57,781 --> 01:34:59,767
- Bobbie.
- Well, you are right about that, honey.

1354
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:00,867
Bobbie.

1355
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:02,352
Billie. Billie!

1356
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:03,452
Billie!

1357
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:06,023
Billie, there isn't anybody else,
I swear to God!

1358
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:07,524
She got it wrong about us, okay?

1359
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:08,817
They get it that way sometimes.

1360
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:09,902
"They"?

1361
01:35:10,002 --> 01:35:11,342
"They"?

1362
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:15,626
Boy, you're a real piece of work,
Hank Williams.

1363
01:35:16,133 --> 01:35:18,285
You know, I may just be
a Bossier City kid,

1364
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:20,370
but I got enough sense
to know you're trouble,

1365
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,890
and you're gonna tear me up.

1366
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:24,971
Billie.

1367
01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:28,018
Billie!

1368
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:33,383
We're gonna have a big ol' time
at the Grand Ole Opry tonight!

1369
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:35,719
That's right. We got quite a lineup.

1370
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:38,806
We've got Bob Mayfield,
we've got Minnie Pearl,

1371
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:41,276
and Hank Williams!

1372
01:35:43,035 --> 01:35:44,853
So, let's put our hands together.

1373
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:47,793
Let's do a live
and lively rousing welcome.

1374
01:35:58,675 --> 01:35:59,675
Hank?

1375
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:06,472
Hank.

1376
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:11,521
Hey, Jim.

1377
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:12,855
Hank.

1378
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:19,012
You want something? Cup of coffee?

1379
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:20,162
No, thanks.

1380
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:22,783
Where's Ray?

1381
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,870
He moved out.

1382
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,941
I don't want to know where you were
or why you weren't at the show.

1383
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,651
- I'm sorry, J.D.
- I'm sure.

1384
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:33,986
But sorry don't mean shit.

1385
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:35,154
We're grown men.

1386
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:36,280
I see.

1387
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,115
Should I be taking notes on this lesson?

1388
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:40,993
Opry's a brand
and you're pissing on it, Hank.

1389
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:43,412
It means something to a lot of people.

1390
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:45,289
Music, family.

1391
01:36:45,389 --> 01:36:46,599
Money?

1392
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:49,752
You want to play the artist on me?
All right, then.

1393
01:36:49,852 --> 01:36:53,046
An artist like you, a man who can
make folks forget their troubles,

1394
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:54,556
you have an obligation.

1395
01:36:57,442 --> 01:36:59,470
You been working me pretty hard, J.D.

1396
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:03,766
I mean, 100 out of 119 days on the road.

1397
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:05,768
I don't really need any more obligations.

1398
01:37:05,868 --> 01:37:07,078
Nobody does.

1399
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,980
I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Hank.

1400
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,023
I'm not trying to put you down.

1401
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:12,107
Don't you worry.

1402
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:15,194
I gave up giving a shit about what
other people think a long time ago.

1403
01:37:15,294 --> 01:37:16,653
All right, then.

1404
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:17,923
Here's the deal.

1405
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:21,283
August 9th in your regular Opry spot,

1406
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:24,553
and August 10th
an Opry-sponsored show in Knoxville.

1407
01:37:29,057 --> 01:37:30,767
Sure, all right, okay.

1408
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,400
I'm imploring you.

1409
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:35,690
Don't let me down.

1410
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:38,534
They'll get their money's worth, sir.

1411
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:40,109
Okay.

1412
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:44,279
Of course I mean, Cousin Minnie Pearl!

1413
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:52,617
Howdy!

1414
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:04,884
Jambalayahit number one today,
you know that?

1415
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:09,373
I had to do it, Red.

1416
01:38:09,473 --> 01:38:11,353
I had to let Hank go.

1417
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,620
Hello?

1418
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:35,607
Hey, it's Hank.

1419
01:38:35,707 --> 01:38:37,067
Hey, Hank, it's Sonny.

1420
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:38,902
Hey, Sonny.

1421
01:38:39,002 --> 01:38:40,342
Is your sister around?

1422
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:46,514
No, I don't know where she is.

1423
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:51,184
Hey, Sonny, help me out, will you?

1424
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:52,388
Sure.

1425
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:55,387
Thanks, man.

1426
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:14,373
Hello.

1427
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:19,384
Bobbie, it's me.

1428
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:22,995
Hey, Hank.

1429
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:26,884
Hey.

1430
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:32,581
Listen, I was thinking,
why don't you pack a bag,

1431
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:35,811
and I'll come by in about a half-hour?

1432
01:39:39,146 --> 01:39:40,516
Where are we going?

1433
01:39:41,815 --> 01:39:43,105
Lake Martin.

1434
01:39:43,525 --> 01:39:45,145
A lodge at Kowaliga Bay.

1435
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:47,397
It belongs to a pal of mine.

1436
01:39:49,364 --> 01:39:50,454
What do you say?

1437
01:39:56,205 --> 01:39:57,375
Make it an hour.

1438
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:17,426
Bobbie?

1439
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,280
Bobbie.

1440
01:40:29,446 --> 01:40:31,156
You're drunker than ol' Hank.

1441
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,079
Hank...

1442
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,490
I'm not drunk.

1443
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:39,621
- No?
- No.

1444
01:40:42,835 --> 01:40:44,505
I'm pregnant.

1445
01:40:47,923 --> 01:40:49,133
What?

1446
01:40:52,135 --> 01:40:54,595
What is it with me?

1447
01:40:56,765 --> 01:40:59,345
Every woman in my life has kids.

1448
01:41:00,435 --> 01:41:02,015
Every one of them.

1449
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:06,592
Before I even got to them.

1450
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:07,676
Man.

1451
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:10,816
You're obviously very
attractive to mothers, Hank.

1452
01:41:24,001 --> 01:41:25,541
Jesus, Bobbie.

1453
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:28,417
You're pregnant.

1454
01:41:32,509 --> 01:41:34,049
We could get married.

1455
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:38,560
Baby, you don't want to marry me.

1456
01:41:40,267 --> 01:41:41,387
I will.

1457
01:41:41,977 --> 01:41:43,227
That's different.

1458
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:50,691
Boy, I'm a professional
at making a mess of things.

1459
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:55,371
Hank,

1460
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:59,603
if we got married, things would be easier.

1461
01:41:59,703 --> 01:42:01,373
They'd be more stable.

1462
01:42:02,414 --> 01:42:06,208
And just think,
we'd have this little one right here.

1463
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:11,384
Bobbie.

1464
01:42:13,509 --> 01:42:15,179
I love you.

1465
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:21,223
But not like that.

1466
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:26,811
Not...

1467
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:29,361
Not that way.

1468
01:42:39,952 --> 01:42:42,292
'Sides, I'm gonna marry Billie Jean.

1469
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:46,419
She know that?

1470
01:42:49,878 --> 01:42:51,458
Not exactly.

1471
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:56,473
Listen, darlin'.

1472
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:01,434
I'm gonna look after this little baby.

1473
01:43:04,518 --> 01:43:06,138
I'll send you money,

1474
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:09,271
and I'll be its papa, even.

1475
01:43:12,609 --> 01:43:14,609
There ain't gonna be no marriage.

1476
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:27,464
Hank, you are really screwed up.

1477
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:30,957
I know.

1478
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:37,242
I pulled every string
to get him back where he started,

1479
01:43:37,342 --> 01:43:39,369
the Hayridein Louisiana.

1480
01:43:39,469 --> 01:43:41,663
It wouldn't be the same money or exposure,

1481
01:43:41,763 --> 01:43:43,373
but at least he wouldn't be idle.

1482
01:43:43,473 --> 01:43:44,917
Hank idle, damn.

1483
01:43:45,017 --> 01:43:48,337
Before long, he had
a Nashville showgirl with child.

1484
01:43:48,437 --> 01:43:51,840
And shortly after that,
he married Billie Jean Jones

1485
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:54,820
in the City Auditorium, New Orleans.

1486
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,703
It's not just my back, baby.

1487
01:44:21,803 --> 01:44:22,803
I feel...

1488
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:29,437
I feel like my chest is,
like, getting jumped on.

1489
01:44:56,046 --> 01:44:57,072
Who are you?

1490
01:44:57,172 --> 01:44:59,472
LeBeau, the promoter.

1491
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:02,411
And you?

1492
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:03,971
Dr. Marshall.

1493
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:07,124
What kind of doctor?

1494
01:45:07,224 --> 01:45:09,234
I specialize in alcoholism.

1495
01:45:10,769 --> 01:45:11,920
What does that mean?

1496
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,547
What you got, Doc?

1497
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:15,227
What's the man have?

1498
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:18,493
It means I've been there and back, ma'am,

1499
01:45:18,986 --> 01:45:22,106
and I will help Mr. Williams
to a speedy recovery.

1500
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:26,491
Let the man in!

1501
01:45:43,594 --> 01:45:45,604
It will be better, son.

1502
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:56,465
Chloral hydrate.

1503
01:45:56,565 --> 01:46:00,135
So powerful, they use it
to sedate circus animals.

1504
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:02,096
It's never supposed to be
administered with alcohol

1505
01:46:02,196 --> 01:46:07,309
or to someone with a heart condition,
which Hank likely had.

1506
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:09,019
Marshall,

1507
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:13,482
his diploma was from the Chicago University
of Applied Sciences and Arts.

1508
01:46:13,582 --> 01:46:17,252
He bought it off a salesman
at a gas station for $25.

1509
01:46:19,463 --> 01:46:23,263
And then Hank called me
and told me he was in Marshall's care.

1510
01:46:36,688 --> 01:46:38,398
How you doing, son?

1511
01:46:41,985 --> 01:46:44,145
How long we got left?

1512
01:46:44,613 --> 01:46:45,556
We can be done, Hank.

1513
01:46:45,656 --> 01:46:46,986
Just call it a day.

1514
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,377
I got something

1515
01:46:59,127 --> 01:47:00,997
I want to run past you.

1516
01:47:02,172 --> 01:47:03,552
You sure?

1517
01:47:10,138 --> 01:47:14,768
Your cheatin' heart

1518
01:47:17,187 --> 01:47:20,517
Will make you weep

1519
01:47:23,944 --> 01:47:29,244
You'll cry and cry

1520
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:33,750
And try to sleep

1521
01:47:35,372 --> 01:47:39,422
But sleep won't come

1522
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:45,093
The whole night through

1523
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:50,846
Your cheatin' heart

1524
01:47:51,555 --> 01:47:55,485
Will tell on you

1525
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:02,174
When tears come down

1526
01:48:02,274 --> 01:48:06,444
Like falling rain

1527
01:48:07,696 --> 01:48:13,102
You'll toss around

1528
01:48:13,202 --> 01:48:17,622
And call my name

1529
01:48:18,415 --> 01:48:21,835
You'll walk the floor

1530
01:48:23,879 --> 01:48:28,049
The way I do

1531
01:48:29,384 --> 01:48:34,724
Your cheatin' heart

1532
01:48:37,184 --> 01:48:43,194
Will tell on you

1533
01:48:57,579 --> 01:48:58,897
Hey.

1534
01:48:58,997 --> 01:49:00,417
I heard you got a new toy.

1535
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:02,359
It's a choo-choo train.

1536
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:04,361
Are you gonna play with me?

1537
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:07,091
I'll be right there just as soon as I can.

1538
01:49:09,633 --> 01:49:11,910
You know how much I miss you,
don't you, Bocephus?

1539
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,538
Than all the ants on the sidewalks,

1540
01:49:14,638 --> 01:49:17,308
and all the leaves in the trees.

1541
01:49:22,104 --> 01:49:23,046
That's right.

1542
01:49:23,146 --> 01:49:24,798
Hey, baby, can I talk to Daddy?

1543
01:49:24,898 --> 01:49:26,228
Thank you.

1544
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:28,552
Hey, Hank? We got to go now.

1545
01:49:28,652 --> 01:49:31,242
It's getting past his bedtime,
and I don't want him getting worked up.

1546
01:49:32,114 --> 01:49:34,725
Audrey, why don't you
bring him up to Shreveport this weekend?

1547
01:49:34,825 --> 01:49:36,285
Well, that won't work out.

1548
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,330
Well, why not?

1549
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:40,981
I mean, it'd just be for the Saturday.

1550
01:49:41,081 --> 01:49:44,876
You could leave him here and,
you know, we'll bring him back.

1551
01:49:45,252 --> 01:49:47,092
Well, we got plans Saturday.

1552
01:49:47,963 --> 01:49:49,198
Well, how about Sunday, then?

1553
01:49:49,298 --> 01:49:50,668
No, that won't work.

1554
01:49:51,508 --> 01:49:53,508
We're just gonna have to find
a better time, okay?

1555
01:49:54,595 --> 01:49:55,829
So, I'm gonna talk to you later.

1556
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:57,349
Okay, hon? Bye.

1557
01:50:41,391 --> 01:50:45,849
The first task of the new administration
will be to review and reexamine...

1558
01:50:50,609 --> 01:50:53,303
...we have a time-out
existing on the playing field

1559
01:50:53,403 --> 01:50:55,413
on the part
of the University of Alabama...

1560
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:02,580
Do you have to?

1561
01:51:05,582 --> 01:51:07,132
Yeah, I kind of do.

1562
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:20,058
Well, honey,

1563
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:24,350
I'm real glad you're skipping
some of them dates.

1564
01:51:25,769 --> 01:51:27,769
Taking some time.

1565
01:51:29,773 --> 01:51:32,323
And I'm real glad
we're getting out of Shreveport.

1566
01:51:33,443 --> 01:51:34,636
But to tell you the truth,

1567
01:51:34,736 --> 01:51:37,196
I don't really want to see your mother.

1568
01:51:37,948 --> 01:51:39,068
I know that.

1569
01:51:40,784 --> 01:51:43,244
Still, at least,
she'll be happy to see me.

1570
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:46,661
Lately, people see me coming,
they want to cross the street.

1571
01:51:47,124 --> 01:51:48,794
Well, that's just not true.

1572
01:51:54,047 --> 01:51:55,417
I'm sorry, baby.

1573
01:51:57,134 --> 01:51:58,514
For what?

1574
01:52:02,306 --> 01:52:03,766
Everything.

1575
01:52:07,102 --> 01:52:09,088
A.V. Bamford had booked Hank

1576
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:12,648
for two dates at the end of December.

1577
01:52:13,317 --> 01:52:15,761
New Year's Eve in Charleston,
West Virginia,

1578
01:52:15,861 --> 01:52:18,097
New Year's Day in Canton, Ohio.

1579
01:52:18,197 --> 01:52:20,487
Hank looked around

1580
01:52:20,824 --> 01:52:24,164
for someone to drive him in his own car.

1581
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,358
And when he couldn't find any friends
to take him up on that,

1582
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:33,278
he called a buddy of his at
Lee Street Taxi in Montgomery.

1583
01:52:33,378 --> 01:52:37,491
And that fella got his 17-year-old son,

1584
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:40,702
Charles Carr, to do the job.

1585
01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:44,142
Charles was a freshman
at Auburn on holiday break.

1586
01:53:01,782 --> 01:53:02,933
Can you take care of that for me?

1587
01:53:03,033 --> 01:53:04,243
Yes, sir.

1588
01:53:06,495 --> 01:53:08,295
Be careful with that, Charles.

1589
01:53:21,802 --> 01:53:23,432
Come here, baby.

1590
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,310
I'll call you when I get up to Charleston.

1591
01:53:32,771 --> 01:53:35,111
How come I can't come?

1592
01:53:38,569 --> 01:53:41,263
Go back to Shreveport,
I'll meet you in a couple days.

1593
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:42,743
You don't have to stay.

1594
01:53:43,949 --> 01:53:46,789
I don't see the big deal, me coming along.

1595
01:53:47,244 --> 01:53:48,544
Well,

1596
01:53:49,955 --> 01:53:51,715
it's a long-ass trip.

1597
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:54,583
And, truthfully,

1598
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:58,593
we might get real sick of each other.

1599
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,634
You might end up going at me, right?

1600
01:54:19,526 --> 01:54:21,526
One more for luck, huh?

1601
01:54:26,074 --> 01:54:28,624
- Watch your head, Mr. Williams.
- Thank you, sir.

1602
01:54:37,961 --> 01:54:39,780
What are you smiling about?

1603
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,170
Well, another reason
I think you shouldn't come,

1604
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:46,336
I could use the leg room.

1605
01:54:48,597 --> 01:54:50,499
Drive safe, Charles.

1606
01:54:50,599 --> 01:54:54,099
He's a real SOB, but I think I love him.

1607
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:56,310
Yes, ma'am.

1608
01:54:57,814 --> 01:54:59,824
Listen to the boss, Charles.

1609
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:08,779
I'll see you in Louisiana, darlin'.

1610
01:55:12,829 --> 01:55:14,249
Happy New Year.

1611
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:21,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

1612
01:56:23,317 --> 01:56:27,067
I've been in show business
for almost 20 years.

1613
01:56:30,324 --> 01:56:31,744
But today,

1614
01:56:32,618 --> 01:56:35,828
will be the most difficult task
I've ever had to perform.

1615
01:56:40,209 --> 01:56:41,789
This morning,

1616
01:56:42,085 --> 01:56:45,585
on his way to Canton to do this show,

1617
01:56:48,133 --> 01:56:50,513
Hank Williams died in his car.

1618
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:06,989
I wandered so aimless

1619
01:57:07,778 --> 01:57:11,908
Life filled with sin

1620
01:57:12,783 --> 01:57:16,145
I wouldn't let my

1621
01:57:16,245 --> 01:57:19,255
Dear Savior in

1622
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:23,902
Then Jesus came like

1623
01:57:24,002 --> 01:57:27,262
A stranger in the night

1624
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:31,160
Praise the Lord

1625
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,140
I saw the light

1626
01:57:34,805 --> 01:57:37,855
I saw the light

1627
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:41,378
I saw the light

1628
01:57:41,478 --> 01:57:44,798
No more darkness

1629
01:57:44,898 --> 01:57:47,818
No more night

1630
01:57:48,318 --> 01:57:51,555
Now I'm so happy

1631
01:57:51,655 --> 01:57:54,725
No sorrow in sight

1632
01:57:54,825 --> 01:57:56,518
Praise the Lord...

1633
01:57:56,618 --> 01:57:59,104
Montgomery, Alabama,

1634
01:57:59,204 --> 01:58:01,924
January 4th, 1953.

1635
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,569
Hank Williams laid to rest in Dixie.

1636
01:58:05,669 --> 01:58:08,864
I saw the light...

1637
01:58:08,964 --> 01:58:11,325
The top singer-songwriter died tragically

1638
01:58:11,425 --> 01:58:13,265
of severe heart damage.

1639
01:58:14,136 --> 01:58:16,256
He was 29 years old.

1640
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:21,085
In only six years of recording,
he had a remarkable 36 hit songs

1641
01:58:21,185 --> 01:58:24,025
and sold over 11 million records.

1642
01:58:25,564 --> 01:58:30,052
Fans, friends and family
gave the boy from Mount Olive

1643
01:58:30,152 --> 01:58:34,473
the state's largest send-off ever,
accompanied by the mournful sounds

1644
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:38,102
of his buddies' steel guitars
and weeping fiddles.

1645
01:58:38,202 --> 01:58:39,895
No more darkness

1646
01:58:39,995 --> 01:58:42,265
No more night...
