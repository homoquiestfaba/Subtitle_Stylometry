(SINGING) Look away from [inaudible]..

00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:40,819
I can take you anywhere.

00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:49,577
Spin the vision with me, [inaudible] with the wind.

7
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:56,426
Move closer to me, I can make you anyone.

8
00:02:56,529 --> 00:03:00,145
I think you're ready to see [inaudible]..

9
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:26,629
The power of what rises [inaudible]

00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:31,982
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away.

00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,951
You can see, but you're blind.

00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:56,798
[inaudible] but they can see in your mind,

14
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,970
the caves of Babylon.

15
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:15,984
[inaudible] getting as good as you gave.

16
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:25,959
Sleep with the devil, and [inaudible]

17
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:29,678
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away.

18
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,383
If he tries to get in, I head him off.

19
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,678
There's no way he gets past me.

20
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,693
I tried to reach him earlier.

21
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,605
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

22
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm standing here.

23
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:53,556
Here's here.

24
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,391
I got to go.

25
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,449
Yes, I will call you later.

26
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,444
I've been calling you all day.

27
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,390
Yeah, the phone's screwed up or something.

28
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,398
Come on, I gotta get in here.

29
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:09,371
Not tonight.

30
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,681
The guys took a vote.

31
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:14,758
It's nothing personal.

32
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,156
Yeah, they took a vote on what?

33
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,103
You're out of the band.

34
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,736
This is my band.

35
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,066
Not anymore.

36
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,421
Not tonight, Chris.

37
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,124
Nobody wants another scene.

38
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:29,461
The boys have been carrying your ass for months.

39
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,754
When you show up, if you show up, you're wasted.

40
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:34,569
Yeah, well, I'm taking care of it, all right, man?

41
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:35,820
Time is up.

42
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:36,968
We're going into the studio on Monday.

43
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:43,224
The guys love you, Chris.

44
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:47,221
But you gotta understand, this is business.

45
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:49,342
How can you do this, man?

46
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:51,079
Look, why don't you just give me some more time?

47
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,119
Listen, why don't you take a cab home?

48
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,753
I don't want you driving that thing.

49
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,059
I gotta go.

50
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,420
I'll find another band.

51
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:48,532

CHRIS: (SINGING) [inaudible] as I find my way home, spirits

00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:03,582
light in the dawn as I find my way home,

54
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,850
my dog likes milk bones.

[dog whines]

56
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,044
I guess you think you do a better job, huh?

57
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:30,936
[dog barks]

58
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,065
I think it sounds great.

59
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,609
Yeah, if I could ever finish it.

60
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:38,617
Hey, did you see this?

61
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,422
Third best selling record in the country.

62
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,296
It's not fair.

63
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,513
It was your band.

64
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,042
You made them what they are, and they

65
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:56,448
kick you out right before they get a big record deal?

66
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:59,784
Maybe they just needed somebody sober.

67
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,348
It wasn't me.

68
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,955
That's in the past now.

69
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,485
You're going to make it.

70
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:06,458
We both will.

71
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:51,780
[diner chatter]

72
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:56,265
Would you like a refill?

73
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:01,130
[inaudible] I sure love the way you smile.

74
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,007
You see anything, man?

75
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:04,259
I get a bad feeling.

76
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,476
Is that it?

77
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,047
You guys don't want anything else?

78
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,020
No, that's it.

79
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:10,098
All right.

80
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,037
Take it easy.

81
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,593
[gun shots]

82
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,271

[music playing]

84
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:48,052
What happened?

85
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:53,232
There was a shooting [inaudible]

86
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,907
Let's get out of here.

87
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,950
Come on.

88
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,604
[inaudible] The next thing I knew, I turned around,

89
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,725
and he was dead on the counter.

90
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:08,768
Jesus Christ.

91
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:16,031
So what do we do now about my job?

92
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:18,673
Yeah.

93
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:20,584
Well let's cruise in her for a start, grab a newspaper

94
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,662
and go through the classifieds, and I'll

95
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,809
get something to drink.

96
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,686
Chris.

97
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,910
Right, nothing to drink.

98
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,280
Hey, you need a place to stay?

99
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,843
The coalition can help you.

100
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,478
I know what it's like.

101
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:41,786
Six months ago, I was living out here.

102
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,759
Go on.

103
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:43,976
Take it.

104
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,713
Get yourself off the street for a little while.

105
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,522
Oh that's cool. I don't need it.

106
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,633
Thanks.

107
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,978
Take it.

108
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:58,332
Remember that.

109
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:02,224
What was that all about?

110
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,857
I don't know.

111
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,950
Do I look homeless?

112
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:11,052
No, of course not.

113
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:12,095
Come on.

114
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,577
Hey.

115
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:32,080
You OK?

116
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:36,356
Just had a dream about that boy

117
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,371
who was shot in the restaurant.

118
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:50,189
I used to have nightmares when I was a kid, all the time.

119
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,856
About Mom and Dad's accident.

120
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,947
I'd wake up all scared and cry.

121
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,778
And then Grandma'd hear me, and she'd

122
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,455
come in and make it all better.

123
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,470
What would she do?

124
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:17,334
She just sit with me and hold my hand and cry with me

125
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,428
and pray all her crazy prayers.

126
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,887
Did they work?

127
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,413
I think the prayers helped her.

128
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,228
Thanks, Grandma.

129
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:45,417
I'll have this back to you by Friday.

130
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,773
Of course you will.

131
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:49,623
You always do.

132
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,785
It's because I raised you right.

133
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,358
I did, didn't I, Chris?

134
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:57,339
So far so good.

135
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,146
Good news, there's some record guys coming

136
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,363
to hear us play tomorrow.

137
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,136
They really liked our demo tapes.

138
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,082
Oh that's marvelous.

139
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,403
Darling, I'll pray for it.

140
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,940
I always do, but tonight I'm going to pray

141
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:12,007
to God that you get a good gig.

142
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,466
Well, who knows.

143
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,448
Maybe after tomorrow, I'll buy you a big house in the hills.

144
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,853
Oh, Chris, you know what really would make me very

145
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,623
happy, really if you and Lila got married,

146
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:28,620
or else send her back to St. Louis where she'll be safe.

147
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,149
It's New York, Grandma.

148
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:32,791
What's so safe about New York?

149
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,112
Nothing.

150
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,892
It's just that I worry so much about the two of you.

151
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:45,060
Ever since, I've been having these dreams.

152
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:48,015
I don't know what in the world they mean.

153
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,150
But I know it's not something good.

154
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,271
Maybe what it means, Grandma, is that you haven't been

155
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,703
taking your medicine regularly. - That's true.

156
00:13:56,807 --> 00:14:01,743
Grandma, are you robbing banks again?

157
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:09,147
Chris, in this world, you must be as gentle as a dove,

158
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,197
but as wise as a serpent.

159
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,654
REPORTER: The media extravaganza presented by the Coalition

160
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:20,061
for World Unity will be telecast internationally.

161
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,902
Rock legend and outspoken supporter,

162
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:25,065
Colin Gramercy is headlining the concert.

163
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,532
Tomorrow's open audition for backup singers

164
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,792
is symbolic of Colin's effort to get everyone

165
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:33,580
involved in this movement.

166
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:34,589
Hey.

167
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,466
How's it going?

168
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,378
I got us some food.

169
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:39,490
What this time?

170
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:43,105
It looks like some poultry of some kind

171
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:49,221
or other, some fruit, and watermelon or pears.

172
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,620
I can't really make it out.

173
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,080
Did you find anything?

174
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,331
Yes, I did.

175
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,259
Want to be a test patient for rare diseases?

176
00:14:58,363 --> 00:14:59,683
Not really.

177
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,629
Actually, did you hear about the Colin Gramercy concert?

178
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,020
Mm-mm.

179
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:06,009
They need singers.

180
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,164
It's probably the new shit he's into.

181
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:12,057
Oh, like you've got a lot to lose?

182
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,108
Besides,what if they wanted both of us, and then

183
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,532
we could do it together.

184
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,132
Yeah, I need a life-sized picture

185
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:22,414

REPORTER: Senator Harlan, how can you

211
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,186
be so against a peaceful, one-world government?

212
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,888
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

213
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:27,739
Global government leads to global dictatorship.

214
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,824
Too many Americans have sacrificed their lives for us

215
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,040
to throw away our freedoms.

218
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,628
a loner on Capitol Hill.

219
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,158
Of course, I am.

Senator Wilbury dead in a so-called automobile accident.

224
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,585
Well, these were no accidents.

225
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,463
There is a force trying to stop us.

00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,609
REPORTER: Senator, don't you think

227
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,487
you're being a little paranoid?

228
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,058
You're paranoid only if you're wrong.

Sing, dammit.

247
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,284
I can't.

248
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:57,238
I said sing.

(SINGING) I'm not concerned with my mortality.

My ultraviolet resembles me.

Won't you come in my mind and see how I feel inside.

255
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:37,834
Look out through my eyes in the deep blue skies.

256

Tell me what you see.

00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:41,552

What happened?

269
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,980
Well, nothing, not yet exactly.

270
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:40,917
What?

271
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,274
Listen, Chris.

272
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:46,757
I had a vision, a terrible warning, a sign.

273
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:48,356
Let me get this straight.

274
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,622
You came here, here on one of the biggest days of my life?

275
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,839
But--

276
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:54,404
To tell me about a dream, Grandma?

277
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:55,967
She's in grave danger.

278
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:56,906
So are you.

279
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,053
No one's in grave danger.

Here's my damn future, all right?

281
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,302
All right, Christopher.

If you won't do anything about it, I will.

00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:12,720
All right, look, I'll talk to you when I get home, all right?

284
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:13,693
What's the deal?

285
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:14,736
It's my grandma.

humanity has to offer, the perfect world.

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,854
That's the goal of the Coalition for World Unity.

00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,354
Thank you.

You were wonderful.

00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,899
I mean the coverage is unbelievable.

295
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:09,617
You make me very nervous when you talk like a publicist.

296
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,850
Albert, please, we're expecting

297
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,692
wonderful things to happen.

You are fantastic.

You really think that, Megan?

301
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,887
Of course.

302
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:25,710
I mean, the media spoon feeds the public every word you say.

303
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:26,961
They love it.

304
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,387
It's not the words that's important.

305
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,847
It's supposed to be motivating people to change.

306
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,349
That's what this whole campaign's about.

307
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,635
Please.

308
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,095

Come on.

311
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:39,856
What about the people who went to school,

312
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,360
the educated people, the people who pay taxes, huh?

313
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,402
How are we going to move them?

314
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,583
Who's job is that?

315
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,043
This is for a bunch of kids.

316
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,962
This is crap.

317
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:53,133
We'll take care of them when the time comes.

Don't worry.

You're the only one I have ever loved.

Grandma shows up and has me arrested,

325
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,541
and I'll be forced to kill her.

326
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,481
That's enough.

327
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:43,565
Thank you.

328
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:44,886

You were great.

I can't believe it, not even a callback.

All right, thank you, but that's all we have time for.

Good night.

Screw this.

It's bullshit. I'm not going to do anything.

It's not fair.

Do the damn show.

(SINGING) Living without you never could be so alone.

370
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:25,906
Don't need to say it, I never waited so long.

371
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:34,040
Thinking about you in everything I do.

372
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,261
Love is forgiving.

373
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:43,980
You know I just live for you.

374
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:52,113
And I, I never made it tonight.

375
00:28:52,217 --> 00:29:04,765
[inaudible] it's lovely to see you're just the one for me,

377
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,789
Hey.

378
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,144
I though we came here to have fun.

379
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,219
What's the matter?

380
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:15,192
Nothing.

381
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,953
If you don't want me to go to the rehearsal, I won't go.

382
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:20,962
Come on, Lila.

383
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:25,827
You don't want me to take the gig?

384
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,435
That's not it.

385
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,068
If it was, would you tell me?

386
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,698
Would you?

387
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:36,671
Of course, I would, Lila.

388
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,479
I'm really happy for you.

389
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,834
I am.

390
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,997
I'm happy that you finally get your chance.

391
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:46,855
You'll get yours someday.

392
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,863
Yeah, someday.

393
00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:51,513
Hey.

394
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,812
You and me together?

395
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,481

Lila Ridgeway.

402
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,782
How do you do?

403
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:27,452
Mr. Gramercy, it's such an honor

404
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,633
to be able to work with you.

405
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,163
Lila, you got to call me, Colin, all right?

406
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:33,603
Mr. Gramercy sounds like your biology teacher.

407
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,784
OK.

408
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,435
Colin, that piece you're playing was beautiful.

409
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:39,894
You know, Lila, I'll tell you, ever since I

410
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,355
got hooked up with the coalition,

411
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:43,336
it's like I have a reason to write again.

412
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,621
I have a reason to live, really.

413
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,244
Am I late, because--

414
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,024
No, you're early. Nobody called you.

415
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:53,763
We pushed rehearsal two hours. I'm sorry.

416
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,604
Oh, it's OK. Should I just come back?

417
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,891
No.

418
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,212
So long as you're here, let me show you this place.

419
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,601
It's great.

420
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:00,540
OK.

421
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:05,023
You know what we're doing here, Lila?

422
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,692
We're planting seeds.

423
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:09,021
That's what the concert's all about.

424
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,428
What kind of seeds are you planting.

425
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:14,860
The kind of seeds that are going to help the planet

426
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:17,293
grow into a united world.

427
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,672
You know, Lila, the human race is still evolving, spiritually.

428
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,932
We're becoming the gods we were always meant to be.

429
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:30,918
This is for you.

430
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,831
Wake them up to the truth, because the truth

431
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,187
can change people.

432
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,211
It can change the world.

433
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,540
But there's one truth that is so powerful

434
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:53,128
and dynamic that the moment you hear it, it will change you.

435
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:56,986
And that truth is you are God.

436
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,619
We are God.

437
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:01,295
We are our own creation.

438
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,902
The world is our creation.

439
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,343
And we have the power to recreate this world.

440
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:10,645
You have the opportunity to take part in the making of history,

441
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:14,469
to radically intervene, to aggressively manage the world's

442

That was great.

00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,341
It's really cool.

452
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:34,940
Yeah, you think maybe we'll shake some people up with that?

453
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:37,998
Yeah, I'm going to go out and try and do everything I can.

Let us bring him up here now and let the Holy Spirit anoint us

461
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,627
and through him let us work to help heal our brother.

462
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,860

on the Holy Spirit for the one and only, the master Jesus,

467

Please.

No, no, nothing, nothing.

481
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,941
So, now let me get this straight.

482
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,861
You have this vision about this girl, Lila,

483
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:01,510
and Father Bailey sent you to see me?

484
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:04,952
Well, sort of.

485
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:07,210
I didn't know what to do.

486
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,400
I even went to the police.

487
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:11,590
You know what they told me, they said,

488
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:14,301
they do not have a Department of Visions yet.

489
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:25,458
Sister Kate could you please help me?

490
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:28,552
Look, what you want, what you need

491
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:30,741
is a spiritual deliverance.

492
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,617
In order for me to do that, I would

493
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:35,641
have to have that girl Lila standing right in front of me.

494
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:42,697
But she's a typical teenager.

495
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:45,200
I could never get her to come to your church.

496
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:51,908
Look, medical doctors do not do brain surgery long distance.

497

What I do is not voodoo.

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,731
I understand.

Sister Kate, listen to me.

500
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:06,194
If you do not try, a beautiful young girl will die.

00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,117

I'll come to your house tonight.

I'll be there at 8:30 sharp, OK?

550
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:35,263
You should have seen the way he was looking at you.

551
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:36,236
Excuse me?

552
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,407
Gramercy.

553
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,727
What about him?

554
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:46,280
He was foaming at the mouth.

555
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:50,903
Maybe he just knows good talent when he sees it.

556
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,441
You mean he knows a good body when he sees it.

557
00:43:05,987 --> 00:43:09,430
The message of the concert is united as one.

558
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:12,522
Mankind can accomplish anything it wants.

559
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,330
You are such an asshole.

560
00:43:14,434 --> 00:43:16,832
[interposing voices]

561
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:19,578
Hey, do you want me to ask Colin today if you can

562
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:23,123
come down and audition for him? He seems really nice.

563
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:24,548
I don't think he'd mind.

564
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:27,676
COLIN: But today, we have 100 million

565
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,388
members around the globe.

566
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:35,462
For the first time in history, mankind really has hope.

567
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:41,232
So please, join us in our worldwide celebration of unity.

568
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:42,240
[screaming]

569
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:45,924
What are you doing?

570
00:43:46,028 --> 00:43:48,982
[dog barking]

571
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,845
Lila.

572
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:04,692
Shit.

573
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:08,272
[music playing]

[tires squealing]

577
00:45:30,715 --> 00:45:34,505
Dr. Liden, call cardiology.

578
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:38,919
[inaudible]

579
00:45:39,023 --> 00:45:40,344
Chris.

580
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:44,583
They say I have a concussion, but I'm fine.

581
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:46,113
What were you doing?

582
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,818
Look, I'm sorry about this morning, all right?

583
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,182
No, it's not all right.

584
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:01,753
Why do you do this?

585
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,908
Which one of us are you trying to hurt anyway?

586
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:05,021
Well, it's not like that.

587
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,064
But it is.

588
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:11,798
I can't just sit by and watch you destroy

589
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,397
yourself day after day, Chris.

590
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:14,371
What are you saying?

591
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:21,704
I guess, I'm saying that I think you have a lot of things

592
00:46:21,808 --> 00:46:23,129
that you need to work out.

593
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,405
And maybe we need some time apart.

594
00:46:30,394 --> 00:46:31,957
Maybe you should talk to Colin.

595
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,695
What?

596
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,190
I just think he could help you.

597
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,789
He's been through a lot.

598
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,700
You want to help somebody, why don't you help Colin spread

599
00:46:38,804 --> 00:46:40,404
his bullshit around, all right?

600
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,837
I'm lying here in the hospital, and my girlfriend's reading

601
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,053
me my last fucking rites.

602
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:45,999
Well, what do you suggest?

603
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,989
I suggest you leave now.

604
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:50,066
Just get the hell out of here.

605
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,839
Chris, I want to help you.

606
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,230
I want to be with you.

607
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:55,280
Well, guess what, I don't want to be with you,

608
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:56,948
so why don't you get the fuck out of here?

609
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,383
Lila.

610
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:09,321
Shit.

611
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,115
Lila, you OK?

612
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,444
Why won't he let me help him?

613
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,962
Lila, Chris isn't as spiritually evolved as you are.

614
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:26,769
But I love him.

615
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:30,454
Lila, you have to let him go.

616
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,643
He's destroying himself, and he'll destroy you, too.

617
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,675
Why don't you stay at the coalition

618
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:40,082
headquarters for a few nights? There's dorm's there.

619
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:42,306
It will be very convenient.

620
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:43,939
Good idea?

621
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:44,877
[inaudible] right?

622
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:48,562
Good.

623
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:57,217
Lila, how's he doing sweetheart?

624
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:59,997
I raced here as fast as I could.

625
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,707
I just can't handle him anymore.

626
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,670
I don't know what to do.

627
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:11,223
Lila, I want you to know that I'm here for you

628
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:12,926
any time you need to talk to me.

629
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:14,109
Do you understand?

630
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:20,261
She'll be fine.

631
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:21,234
She's with me now.

632
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:37,117
Well, Chris, I've been keeping my eye on them

633
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:38,890
and what they're doing.

634
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:40,975
They sucker people in, people who

635
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,312
really care about their fellow human beings.

636
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:47,545
And then once they got them hooked, they brainwash them.

637
00:48:47,649 --> 00:48:50,396
Don't do this, don't say that.

638
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,774
You can take my word, they have their own agenda.

639
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:58,111
So that's what you do, you rescue people from cults.

640
00:48:58,215 --> 00:48:59,952
When I have to, I try.

641
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:08,086
But what I want to know is do you really love that girl?

642
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,014
Yeah, of course I do, more than anything in the world.

643
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,960
Then why don't you march in their right

644
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:16,949
now and tell her straight to her face?

645
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,409
Today?

646
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:22,197
What are you scared of today?

647
00:49:22,302 --> 00:49:23,449
You can walk, can't you?

648
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:24,699
Yeah, of course, I can walk.

649
00:49:24,804 --> 00:49:26,230
I just kind of like the idea of you

650
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:28,280
pushing me around in a chair.

651
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,053
Well, then do it.

652
00:49:30,157 --> 00:49:34,605
Child, rise up and toss aside those wheels.

653
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:35,892
[inaudible]

654
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:38,499
Hallelujah, Lord, thank you, he can walk.

655
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,333
I'm placing a lot of God's light

656
00:50:14,437 --> 00:50:16,175
around us, because I feel like we're

657
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,443
about to step into the very gates of hell itself.

658
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:20,833
Look, I don't get it.

659
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,918
Why are you helping me like this anyway?

660
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:24,065
I got my reasons.

661
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:29,453
Hello, gentlemen.

662
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:30,808
Hi, I'd like to see Lila Ridgeway please.

663
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,963
She's with the Gramercy show.

664
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:33,970
Your name?

665
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,535
Chris.

666
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,481
Chris D'Amico, D, apostrophe Amico, just like it sounds.

667
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:58,648
I am sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have

668
00:50:58,752 --> 00:51:00,142
to ask you to leave, sir.

669
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:01,151
What are you talking about?

670
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:02,368
I'm her boyfriend.

671
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,175
I want to see her. - I'm very sorry.

672
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,180
I'm really very sorry.

673
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:12,517
This is bullshit.

674
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,524
[screams]

675
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:14,984
Get your hands off of me, man.

676
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:15,922
Excuse me.

677
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:17,452
We have to go now.

678
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,390
Trust me.

679
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,341
[inaudible]

680
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:26,419
What?

681
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:27,393
What?

682
00:51:27,497 --> 00:51:28,331
Did you feel it?

683
00:51:28,435 --> 00:51:29,651
Did you taste it?

684
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:30,972
Taste what?

685
00:51:31,077 --> 00:51:32,779
I mean, yeah, maybe it's a little strange.

686
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,065
A little strange.

687
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:36,602
What is the Grand Canyon, a little ditch?

688
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:39,314
Ah, come on, Chris, come on.

689
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,021
Man, something's going on in there.

690
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:47,517
Woo, baby.

691
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,011
You don't know the half of it.

692
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:50,748
No, why don't you fill me in?

693
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,356
That coalition building, that's the blackest

694
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,267
pit of evil I've ever seen.

695
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,976
You know anything about the spirit world?

696
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,817
I take that as a no.

697
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:07,432
It's angel and demons, good versus evil.

698
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:09,275
Been going on since the beginning of time.

699
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:10,908
It's just like two rival gangs fighting

700
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:13,932
all around us, fighting over us, but we can't see them.

701
00:52:14,036 --> 00:52:14,905
Right.

702
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:17,094
Check please.

703
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,813
Chris, listen, it's just their essence vibrating

704
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,655
so fast you can't see them.

705
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,289
It's like a fan, you know?

706
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:26,340
You see the blade, you turn it on, and zoom, you don't see it.

707
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:28,356
Watch out, just because you can't see

708
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,102
it doesn't mean they're not there.

709
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:32,075
Right, right.

710
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:33,673
Amen, amen.

711
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:38,435
[laughs]

712
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,581
What is this, time for a sacrifice?

713
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:53,937
What's going on?

714
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,231
Home again, home again, jiggety jig.

715
00:52:56,335 --> 00:52:59,602
This is my home and where I work.

716
00:52:59,707 --> 00:53:01,201
Why didn't I want to hear that?

717
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:02,209
OK, it ain't my home.

718
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:03,252
It's not where I work.

719
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:04,539
Let's go inside.

720
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:06,136
I'll pretend I don't know my way around.

721
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,110
I'll make you some coffee.

722
00:53:07,214 --> 00:53:08,049
Come on.

723
00:53:11,732 --> 00:53:13,609
Should have known you're one of those religious freaks.

724
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:18,267
Hey, hey, I preferred to be called spiritually enlightened.

725
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:21,672
Come on, Chris, let's go inside.

726
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:23,967
What the hell is going on here?

727
00:53:24,072 --> 00:53:26,574
You really want to know?

728
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:28,417
Yes.

729
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:30,362
I have a gift.

730
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:33,178
It's called discernment.

731
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:34,533
What?

732
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:39,469
I see angels and demons, kid.

733
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:42,423
Right, right.

734
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,334
You couldn't just make something up, like we're

735
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,080
being chased by the mafia?

736
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,201
Chris, I could tell you stories that

737
00:53:49,305 --> 00:53:52,155
would make your eyes bug out.

738
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:54,240
Yeah, and I guess you've seen Elvis, too, right?

739
00:53:54,345 --> 00:53:56,222
And UFOs?

740
00:53:56,326 --> 00:53:57,160
Come here.

741
00:53:57,264 --> 00:53:58,133
Come here, Chris.

742
00:53:58,237 --> 00:54:00,427
Come here.

743
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:05,188
This is not just about trying to save your girlfriend's life.

744
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:08,352
This is about trying to save your girlfriend's soul.

745
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,009
Do you want my help or what?

746
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,613
I'll take the or what.

747
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:21,038
Chris, you need me.

748
00:54:21,142 --> 00:54:23,714
Like it or not, that place is bad news, bit time.

749
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:25,660
Someday they'll will be one world, but not

750
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,719
the one that Colin is selling. It's taken.

751
00:54:28,823 --> 00:54:30,145
His belongs to the devil.

752
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,405
(SINGING) This old man, he played one.

753
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:45,542
He played knick knack on my thumb

754
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:50,130
with a knick knack paddy wack, give a dog a gone,

755
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:54,266
this old man came rolling home.

756
00:54:54,370 --> 00:55:02,746
This old man, he played two, he played knick knack on my--

757
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:05,249
My god.

758
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:06,917
Hi.

759
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:07,750
What?

760
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:10,463
My stepfather had a devil.

761
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:13,452
I told you he did.

762
00:55:13,556 --> 00:55:14,981
He told me to pray.

763
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:17,969
Why didn't you help me?

764
00:55:18,074 --> 00:55:19,602
Did you think I was lying?

765
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:20,819
No.

766
00:55:20,924 --> 00:55:23,045
You thought I was making up a story.

767
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:25,477
I went home.

768
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:29,370
My step daddy was waiting, very angry with me.

769
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:32,011
But I knew it wasn't him.

770
00:55:32,115 --> 00:55:33,332
Not anymore.

771
00:55:33,437 --> 00:55:37,469
Something bad got in.

772
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,971
This is what happened to me.

773
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,647
And it hurts real bad.

774
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:46,887
[inaudible] You let me die.

775
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:47,826
God hates you.

776
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,868
He hates you.

777
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:54,916
You're not Elena.

778
00:55:55,021 --> 00:56:01,693
Unclean spirit, I command you by the authority in me.

779
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:02,702
Out.

780
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:07,221
In the name of Jesus, out.

Whoa.

You look delicious.

784
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:36,973
Let's get you inside.

785
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:38,606
Oh, you brought a friend.

786
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,648
Hi.

787
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:40,657
Wonderful.

[shouting]

789
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:51,813
Gramercy, Senator Holland alleges that World Coalition

790
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,308
is misleading the public.

791
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:55,290
That's a funny thing for a politician to say.

792
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:57,341
Why does he have it in for you?

793
00:56:57,445 --> 00:56:59,182
Well, I guess we're rocking the boat.

794
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:00,885
The United World would rob lot of politicians

795
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,415
of their livelihood.

796
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,473
I think politicians are the problem, not the solution.

797
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:07,662
That's a great sound bite, huh?

798
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:08,983
OK, thanks everybody.

799
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:09,922
Thanks.

800
00:57:16,074 --> 00:57:17,012
Oh this is beautiful.

801
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:19,376
These are my people, huh?

802
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:20,141
It's amazing.

803
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:21,357
They do love you, Colin.

804
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:23,895
They love you, don't they, Dominique?

805
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:26,501
[inaudible] you would not believe how many countries we

806

807
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:36,025
we have all the networks.

808
00:57:36,129 --> 00:57:39,257
This is one for the history books.

809
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:40,300
Good job, Dom.

810
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:41,273
Good job.

811
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:45,548
You want to get a cocktail, doll?

812
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:52,048
I'm glad for [inaudible] bastard.

00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:57,192
It appears she's the new little lady around.

[music playing]

816
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:28,855
(SINGING) The night closing, closing in on me.

817
00:58:36,919 --> 00:58:50,092
I watch the sun fall into the sea, and I think of you and me.

818
00:58:54,193 --> 00:59:03,612
When my tears are falling down, you're not around.

819
00:59:06,845 --> 00:59:12,371
The days are long.

820
00:59:12,475 --> 00:59:14,040
The night's eternity.

821
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,397
Is this seat taken?

822
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,370
No.

823
00:59:37,258 --> 00:59:38,091
No.

824
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:50,603
Excuse me.

825
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:53,941
Can I interest two in a hot meal?

826
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:56,026
Yeah.

827
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,069
On the bus.

[music playing]

829
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:22,997
(SINGING) But you will never see the pain inside of me.

830
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:30,678
Wow.

831
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:33,806
Shit.

This really is the best place.

836
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:03,445
This is outrageous.

837
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,113
Let me go.

838
01:02:05,217 --> 01:02:06,399
Let go, goddammit.

839
01:02:13,386 --> 01:02:14,636
FBI, my ass.

840
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,576
Welcome, Senator.

841
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,503
Who the hell are you?

842
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:21,796
Who I am is not important.

843
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,055
Let's just say I am one of those who have been chosen

844
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,862
to bring order to the world.

845
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:29,061
We fund organizations like the Coalition.

846
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:34,865
Oh, I know about you and your Orwellian new world order.

847
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:36,950
You rich guys create these groups,

848
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,515
and then through them, you just set up

849
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:42,129
your one world socialist super state, and then of course,

850
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:44,249
you're in charge.

851
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:48,316
We do have a small problem to discuss.

852
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,904
My investigation of the Global Peace Commission, I assume.

853
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:57,005
We must ask you to please, please leave them alone.

854
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,203
They are simply working for world peace.

855
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:01,871
What can be wrong with that, Senator?

856
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:04,825
Cut the crap.

857
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:08,996
They call it international peace,

858
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,680
but they are robbing us of our national independence.

859
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:17,095
You cannot alter the course of global events.

860
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,555
Just try and stop me.

861
01:03:18,658 --> 01:03:20,605
No, Senator.

862
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,483
You try and stop us.

863
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:29,641
Senator, you cannot imagine the power

864
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:30,650
that stands behind us.

How unfortunate, the Senator seems to have

868
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,556
suffered a heart attack.

869
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:21,361
Dominick, concerning those marketing concepts

870
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:22,924
we've been working at.

871
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:24,385
What about them?

872
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:27,131
Suppose someone against our agenda

873
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:32,483
decided to assassinate Colin during our little broadcast.

874
01:04:32,587 --> 01:04:33,803
What?

875
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:37,593
And what if the shooter isn't so sharp?

876
01:04:37,696 --> 01:04:44,161
Dramatically killing one of Colin's entourage instead.

877
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:47,393
Poor little bird, support and sympathy

878
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:51,773
will flow from all over the world for the organization,

879
01:04:51,877 --> 01:04:53,649
don't you think?

880
01:04:53,753 --> 01:04:55,353

01:07:43,299 --> 01:07:46,948
[screams]

918
01:07:49,138 --> 01:07:52,995
[gasping]

919
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:57,340
[chandelier rattling]

920
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:06,100
[gasping]

921
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:35,260
Lila.

922
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:41,134
I think we'll be safe here.

923
01:08:50,032 --> 01:08:54,237
Colin, it's so beautiful.

924
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:55,211
Think so?

925
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:07,167
For the day will come when the power shall destroy

926
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:12,485
our enemies, and their blood shall flow like rivers,

927
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,995
and their children shall lie dead in the street,

928
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,132
and so shall begin [inaudible].

929
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:21,904
Where did you get that, Lila?

930
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:23,016
On your desk.

931
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,789
What is it?

932
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:28,264
It's a very old book.

933
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:33,791
It's a book of prophecies that promises us a united world.

934
01:09:33,895 --> 01:09:36,745
But what about all that blood?

935
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:44,253
There are those, Lila, the spiritually unevolved,

936
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:46,130
who want us to fail.

937
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:48,563
You mean the people that don't want one world?

938
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:50,544
Exactly.

939
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:52,038
They would like nothing more than to see

940
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:55,584
mankind mired in anarchy.

941
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:56,835
They're the enemy.

942
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:01,075
So they're all going to die for that?

943
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:04,030
Everybody dies.

944
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,524
But it's for the better of the world.

945
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,607
But how is that right for all those people

946
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,101
to die for nothing?

947
01:10:13,205 --> 01:10:16,125
Lila, a person's born.

948
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:22,312
They live their life, they learn a lesson, and then they die.

949
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:26,830
But then they come back to begin again,

950
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:29,159
and they'll be our friends.

951
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:32,566
Do you understand?

952
01:10:32,669 --> 01:10:34,824
Don' you think it would be better for a few troublemakers

953
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:38,508
to die than the whole world to suffer?

954
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:39,724
I guess.

955
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:50,534
Colin, I can't.

956
01:10:50,638 --> 01:10:52,411
I'm sorry.

957
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:54,044
Sure you can, baby.

958
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:11,214
We're standing in front of the Colin Gramercy's Benedict

959
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,647
Canyon home, where the famed crusader

960
01:11:13,751 --> 01:11:17,888
is readying for tomorrow evening's world wide telecast.

961
01:11:17,992 --> 01:11:21,885
COLIN: The world is our creation and we have the power

962
01:11:21,989 --> 01:11:23,622
to recreate this world.

963
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:27,343
You have the opportunity to take part in making history

964
01:11:27,447 --> 01:11:31,340
to radically intervene, to aggressively manage the world's

965
01:11:31,444 --> 01:11:33,494
resources and its destiny.

966
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:36,831
This is our goal at the Coalition for World Unity.

967
01:11:36,935 --> 01:11:38,430
[dog whining]

968
01:11:38,535 --> 01:11:39,993
Axel.

969
01:11:40,098 --> 01:11:43,712
[dog whining]

970
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:55,113
[dog barking]

971
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:07,591
[roaring noise]

972
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:18,400
Aw, shit!

973
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,231
[screaming]

974
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:24,170
Chris!

975
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:30,842
Chris, no!

976
01:12:30,948 --> 01:12:34,979
[dog barking]

977
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:42,522
[inaudible] redeem us, servants of Satan,

978
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:49,195
out into the pits of hell by the name [inaudible] Lord God,

979
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:50,550
almighty, Jesus Christ.

980
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:58,405
[dog whimpering]

981
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:00,317
Lord, my God.

982
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:01,534
Thank you.

983
01:13:05,183 --> 01:13:06,052
I'm sorry.

984
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:09,146
Are you OK?

985
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,656
I tripped over a lot of things in my life.

986
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,410
Pretty scary stuff, huh?

987
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:19,259
Chris, do you understand what just happened here?

988
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:25,481
It's just it's weird.

989
01:13:25,586 --> 01:13:29,548
Everything's back to normal.

990
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:34,970
Chris, this demon is trying to destroy Lila.

991
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:39,071
He's trying to destroy you.

992
01:13:39,175 --> 01:13:43,033
Look, I don't know what happened here, all right?

993
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:46,127
This is just-- this--

994
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:47,100
Listen to me.

995
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:48,491
I'm trying to help out.

996
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:53,426
This is a winged roaring lion, and he's using

997
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:58,257
a possessed human being, Colin.

998
01:13:58,362 --> 01:14:02,184
Look, I don't give a shit about Colin, all right?

999
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:04,618
I just know that I don't want Lila in any part of it.

1000
01:14:57,622 --> 01:14:59,117
CHRIS (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hello, you've

1001
01:14:59,221 --> 01:15:00,159
reached Chris, Lila, and Axel.

1002
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:01,515
We're not home right now.

1003
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:04,399
But we left Axel at home to screen your calls.

1004
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:08,257
At the beep leave a message, thanks, bye.

1005
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:12,011
[beep]

1006
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:24,489
I knew you'd come, Chris.

1007
01:15:28,347 --> 01:15:30,016
Who the hell are you, man?

1008
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,414
I'm the man you could never be.

1009
01:15:32,518 --> 01:15:36,168
You see, Lila and I connect on a much higher plane.

1010
01:15:36,272 --> 01:15:37,349
I'm taking Lila with me.

1011
01:15:37,453 --> 01:15:38,358
Do you understand that?

1012
01:15:38,462 --> 01:15:40,859
You can't take her with you, Chris.

1013
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:42,285
She's one of us now.

1014
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:45,553
Just shut up and tell me where she is.

1015
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:48,333
The days of the spiritually unevolved will soon be over,

1016
01:15:48,437 --> 01:15:50,452
and mankind will finally be free.

1017
01:15:50,557 --> 01:15:52,155
You told me where she is, or I swear to God,

1018
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,292
I'll blow your fucking head off.

1019
01:15:56,396 --> 01:16:00,914
[door slams]

1020
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,618
It was self-defense, Officer.

1021
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:05,502
I was surprised by this armed intruder in my study,

1022
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:09,361
but I was miraculously able to surprise him with this poker

1023
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:12,106
sticking through his head.

1024
01:16:12,211 --> 01:16:14,470
Colin.

1025
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:15,477
Chris, what are you doing?

1026
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:16,693
What's going on?

1027
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:18,119
I'll get you the hell out of here.

1028
01:16:18,223 --> 01:16:19,510
Are you crazy?

1029
01:16:19,614 --> 01:16:21,560
They're planning on killing you tonight at the concert.

1030
01:16:21,663 --> 01:16:23,228
Chris, please put the gun down, please.

1031
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,861
Lila, don't struggle.

1032
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:28,476
If you cooperate, I'm sure he won't hurt you.

1033
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:29,450
Just go.

1034
01:16:29,555 --> 01:16:31,882
Here, here.

1035
01:16:31,986 --> 01:16:33,725
These are the keys to the gate.

1036
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:36,471
But if you hurt her, no one will be able to help you.

1037
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:46,724
[car starting] - That's right, Officer.

1038
01:16:46,828 --> 01:16:49,192
It happened just a moment ago.

1039
01:16:49,296 --> 01:16:51,798
Thank you.

1040
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:53,119
Chris told Lila we were going to try

1041
01:16:53,223 --> 01:16:55,796
and kill her at the concert.

1042
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,542
Why would he say that?

1043
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:02,747
That stupid little [inaudible] won't have the slightest idea.

1044
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:08,309
Chris, what the hell are you dong?

1045
01:17:08,413 --> 01:17:09,942
I saw Megan kill somebody, OK.

1046
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:11,437
I swear to God, Lila, and they're

1047
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,930
planning on killing you.

1048
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:14,600
Megan is not going to kill anybody.

1049
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:18,318
You are going to kill us.

1050
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:19,778
[sirens]

1051
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:21,238
Shit!

1052
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:22,906
Stop the car!

1053
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:31,630
[horn honking]

1054
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:33,298
God damn.

1055
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:34,654
They're not real, Lila.

1056
01:17:34,758 --> 01:17:35,801
I swear to God, they're not real.

1057
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:38,059
Have you lost your mind?

1058
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:43,065
Chris, stop!

1059
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:44,282
Chris, stop!

1060
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:57,628
Freeze!

1061
01:17:57,732 --> 01:17:58,879
Drop it!

1062
01:17:58,983 --> 01:18:00,826
Hands on the wheel.

1063
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:05,101
[inaudible]

1064
01:18:05,205 --> 01:18:06,630
I didn't think it was real.

1065
01:18:06,734 --> 01:18:10,419
- [inaudible] Chris! - Lila.

1066
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:11,184
Come on.

1067
01:18:11,288 --> 01:18:12,156
Spread them.

1068
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:13,547
Leave him alone.

1069
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:16,189
Chris!

1070
01:18:16,293 --> 01:18:17,300
On the ground, on the ground.

1071
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:19,247
Lila!

1072
01:18:19,351 --> 01:18:20,603
They weren't real!

1073
01:18:20,706 --> 01:18:21,993
Please, he didn't do anything! Leave him alone!

1074
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,001
Come on, lady. Let's go.

1075
01:18:23,105 --> 01:18:24,391
No, he didn't do anything!

1076
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:26,442
Come on, let's go.

1077
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:27,831
Please, help him.

1078
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,396
Leave him alone!

1079
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:30,821
He didn't do anything!

1080
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:34,123
No, please help me.

1081
01:18:34,227 --> 01:18:35,618
Colin Gramercy, I called this in, OK?

1082
01:18:35,722 --> 01:18:37,043
Colin, help him.

1083
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,058
He didn't do anything!

1084
01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:40,101
Lila!

1085
01:18:40,205 --> 01:18:41,387
Take it easy, calm down.

1086
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:42,325
Take it easy.

1087
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,862
Take it easy.

1088
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:46,428
You're lucky you're not hurt.

1089
01:18:46,532 --> 01:18:48,790
Whoa.

1090
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:50,494
What are you talking about?

1091
01:18:50,599 --> 01:18:52,474
CHRIS (ON PHONE): They're calling it kidnapping.

1092
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,177
Kidnapping?

1093
01:18:54,283 --> 01:18:56,403
Chris, what do you want me to do?

1094
01:18:56,507 --> 01:18:57,584
Bail me out.

1095
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,252
Get me out of here, and get me to that concert.

1096
01:18:59,357 --> 01:19:00,921
SISTER KATE (ON PHONE): All right, Chris, I'll

1097
01:19:01,025 --> 01:19:02,625
come and Do what I can, OK?

1098
