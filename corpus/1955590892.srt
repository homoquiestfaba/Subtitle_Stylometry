1
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,430
Are we there yet?

2
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,540
<i>Do you think we're there yet?
Has the plane landed?</i>

3
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,060
I'm so bored.

4
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,390
<i>Hmm, my heart bleeds
for you.</i>

5
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,240
<i>I would love to entertain you,
but I have to finish this paperwork.</i>

6
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,710
Your father needs it
as soon as we touch down.

7
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,320
Well, at least
he'll be happy to see you.

8
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,580
What did you do
this time, Nicole?

9
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,490
Oh, I love that. "What did I do
this time?" Real supportive.

10
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm sorry. I thought
we were talking about you.

11
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,310
Ouch! Catty.

12
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,860
You were tough enough to get
kicked out of three schools,

13
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,860
you're tough enough
to hear the truth from me.

14
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,306
Well, the truth being whatever
happens minus my side of the story, right?

15
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,155
Nicole, I've known you
since you were two years old.

16
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,476
I used to change your
diapers in the office...

17
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,492
<i>"when your mother and
father worked late." - Yeah.</i>

18
00:03:57,773 --> 00:03:59,828
You really got to get
some new material, Andrea.

19
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,997
You used to be this much of a
good kid and this much of a brat.

20
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:07,250
<i>What happened?</i>

21
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,300
Well, I used to have parents.

22
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,788
Now all I have is the
president and ceo of Teknacom.

23
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,610
<i>And still to this day,
people continue to talk</i>

24
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,590
<i>about how dehumanizing
the computer revolution is.</i>

25
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,420
Well, this is something
I could never understand.

26
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,250
You don't go from selling
accounting software door-to-door...

27
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,540
To becoming one of the largest
software providers in the world...

28
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,710
Without there being a very real,

29
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,770
very vital human presence.

30
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,237
The need for computers is human.

31
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,962
Our desire to enhance our lives...

32
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,488
through computer technology is human.

33
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,570
But computers aren't people.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,165
They're made for
people and by people.

35
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:57,112
But as accurate
and reliable as they are,

36
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,556
they're... they're
just tools, nothing more.

37
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:03,963
Now, with this major
expansion of Teknacom,

38
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:07,370
I'm striving to bring
the human factor...

39
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,890
to this cold world of technology.

40
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,220
Now, when my wife
and I started this company,

41
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,580
we had nothing but an old alegra
computer and a screaming one-year-old.

42
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,410
<i>Now we have facilities
all over the world,</i>

43
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,350
and we have a
screaming 13-year-old.

44
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,134
But, all kidding aside,

45
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,590
the human factor in all of this...

46
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,208
is family.

47
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,760
And it was the support
and patience of my family...

48
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,380
That allowed Teknacom to grow.

49
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,625
Soon people from
all over the world...

50
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:46,888
Will become part of
our Teknacom family.

51
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,620
And then, and only then,

52
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,610
will the real
computer revolution...

53
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,660
Begin.

54
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,880
Thank you all very much.

55
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,090
Nice to see you.
Very nice to see you.

56
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,350
Brilliant speech, Mr. Stone.
- Thank you, Martin.

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Would you mind checking on the
status of Nicole's flight? - Certainly, sir.

58
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,970
Hi, ray. Hi, Marilyn. Hi.
It's good to see you.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,220
"Brilliant speech,
Mr. Stone."

60
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,570
Family is everything, isn't it?
<i>Great speech, Ray.</i>

61
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,570
Great, great speech.

62
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,630
I wonder if anyone would have
liked your speech this morning.

63
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,850
I'm not the first man who's gotten into
a shouting match with his daughter. Mmm.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,850
Hi, Mr. Stone. Hi.
How are you? Nice to see you.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,480
True enough.
<i>- Hi, Mr. Stone.</i>

66
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,941
Still you have to admit,
it's a little bit strange...

67
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:49,044
To hear you speak about family
values when we can't even have...

68
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,924
A phone conversation with our daughter
without getting into a yelling match.

69
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,990
Watch<i> Oprah.</i> Families yell at
each other all the time. - <i>I enjoyed it so much.</i>

70
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,280
And besides, she started it.

71
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,380
Great. So you're both
four years old. Is that it?

72
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,475
Who cares if Roberto Clemente
was the greatest baseball player...

73
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,557
wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't... wait a minute.

74
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,640
Roberto Clemente was the
greatest baseball player of all time.

75
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,740
And second of all...
- <i>Super, super speech.</i>

76
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,610
You and I both know that this argument
had nothing to do with baseball players.

77
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,000
Hi.
-<i>Hi. Good evening.</i>

78
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,050
She's trying, Ray.
- No, she's not trying.

79
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,840
People who try don't get...
- Hi.

80
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,570
They don't get kicked out of schools
all over the world over and over again.

81
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,513
People who try,<i> try.</i>

82
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,350
I don't get it. On her reports
she used to get straight a's,

83
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,770
but over the last couple of years, now
that things are starting to go well for us,

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,178
it seems like all she wants
to do is annoy people.

85
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,070
Shh.
- Hi.

86
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,030
Don't say anything to me.

87
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,870
Why not? - Because if
you say anything to me,

88
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,539
it'll insult me,
and if you insult me, I'll get angry,

89
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,468
and if I get angry,
you'll know what will happen.

90
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:10,636
Nothing happens
when you get angry, Frank.

91
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,124
You just eat more.

92
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,244
Andrea, aren't you
supposed to be watching her?

93
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,701
Oh, I am watching her.
I'm watching her annoy<i> you</i> for a change.

94
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,385
Can you stop?

95
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,530
Thank you.

96
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,730
<i>I don't get it.</i>

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,678
I<i> really</i> don't get it.
What happened to you?

98
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,952
Well, people change.

99
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,438
Look, you used to be thin.

100
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,159
I suppose you think that's funny.

101
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,402
It's not.
It's just mean.

102
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,919
Look, I don't know if you've
heard, Frank, but I am mean...

103
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,215
and obnoxious...
and a disappointment.

104
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,458
You're only gonna be a disappointment if
you keep going down the path you're on.

105
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,072
<i>I don't want to see you turn
into some cold, selfish, rich brat.</i>

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,410
I hate what you're becoming.

107
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,810
Listen, honey.

108
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,080
You know your family's
the only family I've got.

109
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,890
And you're probably as close as I'm
gonna get to having my own kid.

110
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,530
You remember...
remember we took you first to the zoo?

111
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,830
Or when your dad and I
took you camping?

112
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,200
<i>Oh, my gosh!
We were such spazzes.</i>

113
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,870
<i>We had all that stuff
happen with the raccoons...</i>

114
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,270
And with those poles
falling down on us.

115
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,840
You remember the fun we had?

116
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
No.

117
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,220
No, sorry I don't.

118
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,425
Tower, this is flight 109.

119
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,770
Eta is in, um, 95 minutes.

120
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,020
Roger that, 109.

121
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,170
We've been bouncin' around up here,
catching the tail end of the storm.

122
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,940
Roger, 109.
I'm afraid that's not the last of it.

123
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,180
Beware you'll be
landing in snow.

124
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,100
We copy, tower.

125
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,620
Rain, sleet, lightning
and now snow.

126
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,920
Boy, these El nino
conditions are too weird.

127
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,120
It's freezing out there.

128
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,670
Hi, guys. - What do you mean?
You're from Quebec.

129
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,110
I thought you guys liked the cold weather.
- <i>Why do you think I left?</i>

130
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,610
Hello, night shift.
- Hi.

131
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,200
Hey, check it out. <i>- Can
somebody get me a weather update?</i>

132
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,150
<i>What are the conditions gonna
be like in the next few hours?</i>

133
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,820
<i>A new toy for Jeff!</i>

134
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,940
You're a real man's man,
aren't you, Jeff?

135
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,130
I got the training wheels
off my bike last week.

136
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,950
She digs me.
- Okay!

137
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,157
<i>Once again, we enter the exciting
world of air traffic control, people.</i>

138
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:42,150
Whoa, whoa. Donovan?
- <i>Yeah?</i> - Take a look at this.

139
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,840
What are all these switches
and buttons and knobs for?

140
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,102
Get rid of the toys.

141
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,036
Ah, you have such a
way with people, hmm?

142
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,010
It's a gift.

143
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,645
Before I forget... cell phone.
- Ah, thank you, sir.

144
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,773
It's getting pretty
rough out there. - Yeah, well,

145
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,860
it's not so good in here either.
- <i>Fourth floor: Toys and games.</i>

146
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,277
Third floor: Electronics.

147
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:17,597
Second floor: Women's wear.
First floor...

148
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Let's try to scoot around this.

149
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,966
Yes, sir!

150
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,895
I hate flying through storms.

151
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,540
I don't have the stomach for it.

152
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,006
What's Greg doing
with my father's plane?

153
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:52,863
He's a good pilot. Why don't you
just sit down and strap yourself in?

154
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,447
I don't feel like it.

155
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,740
There's some nasty
weather out there tonight.

156
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,240
Hey, take a look at this.
- What?

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,019
Flight 109.

158
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,746
<i>Cutting it pretty close
to that storm.</i>

159
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,813
Bickster, punch up
a profile on 109.

160
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,331
109.

161
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,193
<i>Yes, 109.</i>

162
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,287
It's a 727 private.

163
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,336
Those pilots
are always in a hurry.

164
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,712
You never see a commercial carrier
try to edge around a storm like that.

165
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,952
<i>1087, you are clear
for takeoff.</i>

166
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,051
I'm gonna kill her.
- Nicole, will you sit down?

167
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,652
Calm down.

168
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,384
I'm gonna be airsick.

169
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,985
Do you need something?
- Yeah.

170
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,303
Nicole, would you put that
stuff back, please? - Half a second.

171
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,396
Is that your father's Roberto
Clemente bat? How'd you get that?

172
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,562
He's gonna kill you. - Yeah? Well, he
loves the bat more than he loves me.

173
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:25,503
No, he's gonna love <i>using</i> that bat
on you when he finds out it's gone.

174
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,910
Come on!

175
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,620
We're supposed to be avoiding this.

176
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,797
<i>Nicole, would you stop playing with
the first-aid kit? We might need it.</i>

177
00:14:57,832 --> 00:15:00,789
Relax! I'm gonna do
a small impression.

178
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,910
Please!
Give me a break!

179
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,484
"Luke, feel the dark side."

180
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,720
<i>Oh, I'm scared!</i>

181
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,580
Something isn't right.

182
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,000
<i>1475, you must hold
your current pattern.</i>

183
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,120
Call 'em up. Find out
what the heck they're doing.

184
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,120
Done.

185
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,670
<i>109, 109, come in.</i>

186
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,200
109, 109, please come in.

187
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,650
Man, that thing's goin'
right through the tail end of that storm.

188
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,630
Any answer?
- Negative.

189
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,100
109, 109, come in, please.

190
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
Tower to 109.

191
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,420
Damn!
Always on my shift.

192
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,170
Give me a hard copy of
109's flight plan. - <i>Tower to 109.</i>

193
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,140
<i>Do you copy?</i>

194
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,320
<i>109, this is tower.
Go ahead.</i>

195
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,840
There, it's leveling out.
- Yeah, but it's still descending.

196
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,540
Heading out of the storm?
- No.

197
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,570
Something's still wrong.

198
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,740
<i>109, this is tower.</i>
- Any answers? <i>- Do you read?</i>

199
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,810
109, 109, this is tower!
Do you read?

200
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,680
Just got a message from downstairs.
A guy from Teknacom called,

201
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,032
wanting to know if 109
was landing on time.

202
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,974
It's the boss's plane.
And get this: His daughter's on board.

203
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
<i>Mr. Stone.</i>
Excuse me. - Yes, Martin.

204
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,830
We have a problem.

205
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,616
Hey, guys.
Andrea, Frank, are you okay?

206
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,281
Come on, Frank!
Frank! Come on, guys!

207
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,646
Andrea, please!

208
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,440
Oh, my God.
What happened?

209
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,422
There was an explosion.
I think it was lightning. I don't know.

210
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,536
My head.

211
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,191
Come on.
I'm worried about Frank.

212
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,743
He doesn't look too good.
He's really bleeding a lot.

213
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,783
What hit us?

214
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,627
The first-aid kit.
It got sucked right out of the hole.

215
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,825
I know it's my fault!

216
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,042
I'm sorry for playing around.

217
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,192
The pilot.

218
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,586
Okay. Stay here.

219
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Be careful.

220
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,295
Greg.

221
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:29,144
Terry.

222
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,999
Oh, no. Andrea!

223
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,192
They're both dead.
I think they're both dead. - Nicole!

224
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,066
Who's flying the plane?

225
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,110
<i>Jeff, stay on it up here.</i>

226
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,860
<i>Bickster, go down
and take care of our vips.</i>

227
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,130
Mr. and Mrs. Stone,
come with me.

228
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,020
What's happening with
our daughter? - At this point,

229
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,621
we're trying to figure
that out ourselves.

230
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,420
Tower to 109, please come in.

231
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,610
Whoa.
Give me your hand.

232
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,030
Hang on.
I think I've got something.

233
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,861
There. Try not to bleed
on my dad's bat.

234
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,890
Don't worry.

235
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,165
I'll tell him it's your blood.

236
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,800
This is unacceptable.
- I'm sorry, sir. That's all we know.

237
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,237
When you say there's no radio
contact, what exactly do you mean?

238
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:05,647
I mean, they're receiving,
but no one's answering.

239
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,445
But the plane is still
in the air? - Oh, yes, yes.

240
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,386
What happened?
- We don't know for sure.

241
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,196
It appears they were trying to
go around the tail of a storm.

242
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:17,673
The storm shifted.
It caught them by surprise.

243
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,113
Look, our best bit of luck is that
they're scheduled to land here,

244
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:23,830
not over at international.

245
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,136
They have way too much air traffic.
- Listen, you know who I am.

246
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:30,463
Whatever it costs to get that plane to
land here safely, I want you to do it.

247
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,533
Sir, right now it's not
an issue of expense.

248
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,965
There's not much we can do
until we get more information.

249
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,380
He's alive.

250
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,867
He's breathing.
They're both alive.

251
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Hello?

252
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,290
Hello?
Mayday!

253
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,381
<i>Sos. Is anybody there?
Mayday!</i>

254
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:13,968
Anyone? Sos?

255
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:16,357
Come on.

256
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,973
This is not working.

257
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,542
Hello!

258
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,781
<i>Mayday, please!</i>

259
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,709
This is insane. They've kept us
waiting here alone for ten minutes.

260
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,820
Ray, they don't know anything.
- Well, they've got to know something!

261
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,300
Ray, why don't you sit down?

262
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,140
Oh, God.

263
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,384
Maybe we should run
the projections again.

264
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,903
Already did it three times.

265
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,848
Look, unless flight 109
changes course, and soon,

266
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,960
we're gonna have a front-row
seat when it comes down.

267
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,679
It's gonna come down<i> hard.</i>

268
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,760
Mayday.

269
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,746
We have to figure
out how to land. - Yeah.

270
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,697
Okay.
Take it easy, okay?

271
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,553
You don't look okay.
- I'm fine.

272
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,802
I'll help out Greg,
get him secure.

273
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:44,549
I'll be back to
help you, okay? - Okay.

274
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,730
Okay.
Mayday.

275
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,878
Tonight, 300 people paid a thousand
dollars apiece to hear me speak...

276
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,520
Because I'm rich,

277
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,670
because I'm important.

278
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,725
I'm the man of the year.

279
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,566
For what?

280
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,148
Our little girl is up
there in trouble, and...

281
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,290
I can't do anything
to help her.

282
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,690
Man of the year.

283
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,130
Frank.

284
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,310
Come on, guys.
Stick with me here.

285
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,280
Please don't make me
handle this all on my own.

286
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,280
Please!

287
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,860
I tried the best I could.
How's it going?

288
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,260
Andrea!
Oh, my God! Andrea!

289
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,918
Oh, what'll I do?
Oh, um...

290
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,595
Hello?
Anybody there?

291
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:25,351
How does this thing work?

292
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:30,215
Hello? Anyone?
Help, please!

293
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,358
Hello!

294
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,703
Work, you worthless
piece of garbage!

295
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,553
Please!

296
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:40,131
Uh, 109, do you copy?

297
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,480
109, this is tower.

298
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,128
Yes, I copy.

299
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,368
What is your status?
- My "status"?

300
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,639
My status sucks,
that's my status.

301
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,383
Put this on the speaker.
- Listen to me.

302
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:57,055
There was an explosion in the plane.
There's a hole in the wall.

303
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,958
Everybody's hurt except me,
and no one's flying the plane.

304
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:03,315
My name is Nicole Stone.

305
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,837
I'm 13 years old, and I really
don't wanna be here right now.

306
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:09,802
Okay, Nicole, I hear you.
I understand.

307
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:11,604
Everything's gonna be
just fine, okay?

308
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,028
My name is Jeff,
and I'm gonna talk you through this.

309
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,967
Okay, keep talking to me, Jeff.

310
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,039
You know those scenes in the movies where
the stewardess has to fly the plane,

311
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,549
and somebody like Charlton
Heston has to talk them down?

312
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,453
Well, I'm gonna be
your Charlton Heston.

313
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:30,316
Can you be my
Brad Pitt instead?

314
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,933
Um, sure, but I'm
a lot better-looking.

315
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,621
Listen up. You've got 109.
Everything else is off your plate.

316
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:40,940
I'll have Carrie and Dave
pick up the slack, all right?

317
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,490
All right.
Good luck.

318
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,778
Jeff, I'm really scared.

319
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,482
Yeah, I know you are, Nicole,
but we're gonna get through this.

320
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,645
I want you to try
and stay calm, okay?

321
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,614
Okay.

322
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,053
Now, I want you to describe the control
panel to me. Start from your far left.

323
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:02,892
Look, I don't know what you want me to
tell you. There's rows of lights, gauges,

324
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,675
buttons and switches
and dials...

325
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,591
yeah, and in the middle here
there's this big thing with levers.

326
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:12,766
I don't know.
- Okay, Nicole, listen carefully.

327
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,340
Do not touch those levers
until I tell you to.

328
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,877
Don't worry.
I won't touch<i> anything.</i>

329
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,678
Nicole, those levers
are for landing the plane,

330
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:23,119
and you are not ready to
land that plane yet, understand?

331
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,392
Okay. And there's this
light with "autopilot."

332
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,728
Is that what's flying the plane?
- Yeah, so far.

333
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,520
Okay. But there's this buzzing sound
coming from it right underneath the panel.

334
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:38,944
"Buzzing sound"?

335
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:42,152
Oh, man.
The autopilot is scrambled.

336
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,506
What's going on?
Somebody talk to me.

337
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,194
Nicole, listen, we want
to test the autopilot.

338
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,845
What do you mean, "test"?
- Honey, it's real simple.

339
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,804
Just hit the switch
below the autopilot light.

340
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,207
If the light goes out,
turn it right back on, okay?

341
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:00,942
Okay.

342
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:08,851
It's not going out.

343
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,417
That's okay. Um, we...
want you to try something else.

344
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:17,505
I want you to grab the controls...
the steering wheel in front of you...

345
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,422
and pull back
as hard as you can.

346
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:21,716
It may fight you a little bit,
but that's the autopilot.

347
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,924
Pull it back as far as you can.
If you do, that light will go out.

348
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,426
It won't let me move it.

349
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,059
That's okay, Nicole.
Um, let it go.

350
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:38,851
Just let the autopilot do its job.

351
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,787
Just... sit back and try to relax.

352
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,907
Stay with her.
I'm gonna go talk to her parents.

353
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,354
<i>Nicole, you can call me Bickster.</i>

354
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,183
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Run that by me again.

355
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:06,448
I thought the autopilot
was a good thing.

356
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:08,997
It is. It's a great thing.
It saves lives.

357
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,774
In fact, it saved your daughter's life.
- So, why is it a problem?

358
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,789
After the accident,
the autopilot took control of the plane.

359
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:19,420
That's what's flying the airplane, and
it's bringing it down here to the airport.

360
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,445
But isn't that what we want?

361
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,578
The line of descent
is all wrong.

362
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,741
The autopilot's internal
guidance system is scrambled.

363
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,374
We cannot disengage the autopilot.

364
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,719
And the autopilot is telling
your plane to crash.

365
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,161
Oh, it's getting cold.

366
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,465
I guess it's a bad time to say
"I'm sorry for being such a jerk lately."

367
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,273
Listen, it's simple. We just get her
to try to reconfigure the wave points.

368
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,682
<i>That's insane. You need an
aeronautics engineering degree to do that.</i>

369
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,840
Maybe she can fight the autopilot
enough to take it over to lake Crenshaw.

370
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,054
Water landing.
- Crenshaw's too far.

371
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,637
She'll wind up
taking out a city block.

372
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:32,204
I wonder if they have
any chutes on board?

373
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,040
It wouldn't matter.
They're all unconscious.

374
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,243
And we still have
to land the airplane.

375
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,682
All right, listen.
How about this:

376
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,193
Nobody open their mouth unless
they have a good idea, okay?

377
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:44,528
Yes. We could
start that with you.

378
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,351
Shut up, Bickster.

379
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,654
Whatever, okay? We still have to
contain the fire when it crashes.

380
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,220
Listen, people.

381
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,856
We don't have
a learning curve here.

382
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:02,734
We've got to get this right
the first time. There is no second chance!

383
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,491
That's my little girl up there,
my coworkers, my friends!

384
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,836
There is no next time
for them. This is it!

385
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,509
Look, I...

386
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,268
I know you people
know your jobs, but...

387
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,225
That's our little girl.

388
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,177
I'm begging you.
Please!

389
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,265
Mr. Stone, I'm sorry, but it's
against regulations to have you in here.

390
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,553
Donovan, forget
your precious regulations.

391
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,345
He's right. We can discuss
strategies and options all we want to,

392
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,697
but time is
the real enemy here, folks.

393
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,140
Fine. Okay, fine.

394
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,340
Now, two things have to
happen within the next hour.

395
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,965
One: That plane has to
come down safely.

396
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,148
And two: Those people
have to get off the plane.

397
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,887
Wait a minute.

398
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,664
It doesn't necessarily
have to happen in that order.

399
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,445
We're going to have
another plane...

400
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,666
Wait. Say that again.
I can't hear you. There's static

401
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:22,995
Okay, Nicole, listen to me.

402
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:27,154
<i>I can't hear you.
I didn't get all that.</i>

403
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,034
Something about another plane.

404
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,081
Nicole, listen to me. We're going to
send another plane up there to meet you.

405
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,127
"Another plane."
Yeah, I heard that.

406
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,480
But the other plane
will be a refueler.

407
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:41,287
It looks like
a flying gas tank.

408
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:42,953
I copy.

409
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,985
Good. Out of the back of the plane, there'll
be something that looks like a long pole.

410
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,188
It's called a boom.
They use this to pump gas.

411
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,361
Pump gas?
Am I running out of gas?

412
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,891
No! No, Nicole.
Your fuel is fine.

413
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,367
You don't have any problems at all.
I want you to listen to me.

414
00:34:57,402 --> 00:35:00,752
The people that fly these
planes are very, very good...

415
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,753
at getting close
to other planes in midair.

416
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,878
That's why we're using one.

417
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:07,404
But instead of using
the boom to pump the gas,

418
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,516
we're gonna transfer you and
everyone else off of the plane,

419
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:12,629
and put another pilot
on the plane.

420
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,770
Do you understand?
- I can't hear you. I didn't get that.

421
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,621
Nicole, we're going
to use the boom...

422
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,259
To transfer you and everyone
else off of that airplane.

423
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:23,449
I can't hear you.

424
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:26,898
There's something wrong with
my microphone. - Nicole, can you hear me?

425
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,778
I didn't get that.
Something about a boom?

426
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,482
There's something wrong
with my microphone.

427
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:36,627
Nicole?
Can you hear me?

428
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,910
<i>Nicole?</i>

429
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,592
Nicole. Come in.

430
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:44,430
Nicole!

431
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,470
Nicole.

432
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,670
Nicole?

433
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,040
What happened? What happened?
- I don't know.

434
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,585
Well, how is she?
Is it anything serious?

435
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,240
Flight path is still holding,
for whatever that's worth.

436
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,774
It was just the communicator.
I'm sure it was nothing more than that.

437
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,519
I didn't even get
a chance to talk to her.

438
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,933
Why do you want
to transfer everyone?

439
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,877
That's dangerous.
Why can't you just land the plane?

440
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:19,197
We can't even be sure that the
autopilot can<i> be</i> disengaged.

441
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:23,680
<i>And maybe our men will have to make a
crash landing in some deserted area.</i>

442
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,120
Who knows what else
she's dealing with up there.

443
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,967
We know people are injured.
We know they're unconscious.

444
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:33,240
We cannot parachute these people.
Our options are extremely limited.

445
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,129
<i>I'm afraid this is
the way it has to be.</i>

446
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,601
Yes, we got
an emergency situation here.

447
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,465
<i>Jeff?</i> - Tell me you
have some good news.

448
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,190
We're lucky. There's a guard refueler at
Kensington, crewed up and ready to go.

449
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:50,838
<i>Night maneuvers.
There's even a medic on board.</i>

450
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:55,789
And, sir, fortunately,
this crew specializes in trouble.

451
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:58,693
Well, then, they've done
this sort of thing before.

452
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,900
Well, frankly, no one has
done this sort of thing before,

453
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:06,389
but their experience and
versatility make the odds a little better.

454
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:12,076
Okay.
The refueler's empty,

455
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:14,586
so it's gonna move a lot
faster than it normally does.

456
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,276
Flight 109 is moving
slower since the accident,

457
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,366
so they should be side by
side in about 15 minutes.

458
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,228
That doesn't give 'em
a lot of time.

459
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,157
Sir, this couldn't have
happened any faster.

460
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,250
We're just lucky Jeff here came
up with the idea when he did.

461
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,618
Let's not get
too excited just yet.

462
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,129
The hard part's still to come.

463
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,872
There's a midair transfer
about to happen...

464
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:42,322
That would be a challenge
to the best professionals,

465
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:44,462
and no one on 109
knows what to do.

466
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,183
Oh, this stupid thing!
Hello!

467
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,687
I can't hear anything.
Hello. Does anyone hear me?

468
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,608
Jeff, are you there?
Hello, Jeff?

469
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,094
Oh, this worthless
piece of junk!

470
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,477
Hey, Andrea, are you okay?

471
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,358
Please stay with me. Come on.
For once, I could use some adult supervision.

472
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,967
Ohh! Why couldn't you have passed out when
I was kissing Mike Adams last summer?

473
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,366
You were wide awake then.

474
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,612
And what about that time I
wanted to have that beach party?

475
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,231
I would have loved for
you to drop off, but no.

476
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,359
You're picking the worse times to
be unconscious, you know that?

477
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:41,049
I know you can hear me.

478
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,569
They're gonna rescue us.

479
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:45,055
You're gonna be okay.

480
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,113
We're all gonna
get out of this, I promise.

481
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,742
I just wish I knew
what to do next.

482
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,678
It's a good thing
I never grew up, huh?

483
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,118
Yeah.

484
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,430
Mr. and Mrs. Stone,
would it help you at all...

485
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,654
<i>If I showed you how
we're gonna pull this off?</i>

486
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,630
Yeah. Please.
- <i>Great. Come here.</i>

487
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,340
Okay. Let's say that
this is your airplane,

488
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,640
and this is the refueler.

489
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,260
Now the boom.

490
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,200
The boom is normally for
transferring fuel...

491
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,716
From one plane to another
while they're both in flight.

492
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,171
But we're gonna do something
a little bit different.

493
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,540
Instead of putting the boom at the
front of the plane for refueling,

494
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,141
we're gonna move the boom
over to the side door here.

495
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,827
There's a hatch in the back
of this refueling plane.

496
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,257
Now, someone's gonna
open up the door,

497
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,450
and we're gonna get a guy to
slide across this boom here.

498
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,684
He's gonna slide over
into your airplane.

499
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:57,454
<i>Once he's inside, he's gonna transfer
your daughter and everyone else...</i>

500
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,071
Back across the boom
and into the refueler.

501
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,504
Oh, God. - That'll take
care of our first problem.

502
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,268
Then he's gonna try to keep the
plane from wipin' out this airport.

503
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,230
That's the plan,

504
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:13,615
<i>and it can work.</i>

505
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:17,640
I just wish there was some way to
communicate this with your daughter.

506
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,271
I'm gonna check on the others. You're
in charge. You think you can handle it?

507
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:38,496
Okay, excellent.
I knew I could count on you.

508
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,750
Okay, guys.

509
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,020
I'm gonna tell you
like I told Andrea.

510
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,740
We're gonna be okay.

511
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,960
Everything's gonna be fine.

512
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,800
You hear me?

513
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,160
As soon as
the other plane comes,

514
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,570
all of our problems
will be solved, I promise.

515
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,550
It's okay.

516
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:25,958
We have a problem.

517
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:28,062
We've got to find a way
to get that side door open.

518
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,836
The refueler, channel four.
The pilot's name is Lopez.

519
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,276
Put it on speaker, Jeff.

520
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:39,354
Go ahead.
This is tower.

521
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:48,290
Tower, this is US ang 2-7,
captain Lopez.

522
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:52,794
Copy that, Lopez. - Am I talking
to the man who masterminded this plan?

523
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,115
Yeah, in the flesh.
You up for this?

524
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,875
We are state of the art, my friend.

525
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,707
But you've definitely made our
night a little more exciting.

526
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,499
My boomer tells me he should be able
to waggle the probe into position.

527
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,012
Wind shear allowing,
I can hold it there.

528
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,707
I just can't hold it forever.

529
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,552
<i>You</i> just need to get
that door open.

530
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:17,408
I copy that, 2-7. I've just
got to find a way to talk to her.

531
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:19,928
<i>Understood, tower.</i>

532
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:22,096
My guys are still rigging
the cabling,

533
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:23,953
and a medic is standing by.

534
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:27,024
It looks like the tail end
of the weather's behind you,

535
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:29,246
so I don't think mother nature's
gonna give us too many more problems.

536
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,861
Roger that.

537
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,846
<i>We are 300 meters
from target and closing.</i>

538
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,367
Tower, I have a visual
on 109 now,

539
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,238
and I'd say mother nature's
already done her worst.

540
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,869
Making our pass now, tower.

541
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,878
Visual survey of damage...

542
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,732
it's pretty much
what you expected:

543
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,515
Scoring along the fore end
of the outer fuse,

544
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,546
and there's a pretty nasty
hull breach in the main cabin.

545
00:43:11,074 --> 00:43:14,217
But there's no apparent fuel leak
and no apparent wing damage.

546
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,044
Oh, thank God for that.

547
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,549
You can say that again. See, if there
was wing damage, we couldn't do this.

548
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,339
The downwash from the refueler
would put too much strain on 'em.

549
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:25,459
They'd snap right off.
- <i> Tower, 2-7 moving into position.</i>

550
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:26,923
What's downwash?

551
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,250
<i>Now what?</i>

552
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,862
I'm seriously gonna lose it.

553
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,295
I'm just gonna strap myself in
before I get thrown out of this.

554
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,900
Oh, my!

555
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,855
Tower, we're holding position.

556
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,799
Copy that, 2-7.
Standing by.

557
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,694
My boomer's ready to go.
We're just waiting on the cabling.

558
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:51,454
Copy that, Lopez.
- It's time to get that door open.

559
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,942
We have got to find a way to get
back into contact with Nicole.

560
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:59,656
Well, I'm pretty sure she knows the
refueler is already up there by now.

561
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,287
<i>Yes, but if we don't get her
to disengage the lock,</i>

562
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:04,053
we have no way of getting
the people off the plane.

563
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:05,973
Why can't they just open it
from the outside?

564
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:09,317
Because it won't work. The airplane
doors are specifically designed...

565
00:45:09,352 --> 00:45:11,462
Not to open from the outside
during flight.

566
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:12,833
It's a safety feature.

567
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,797
<i>I know it's frustrating,
but normally safety features save lives.</i>

568
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:22,489
<i>This is a one in a bill... no, no.
Jeez, it's a one in a trillion situation.</i>

569
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:25,255
Yes, it's frustrating, but...
- Wait a minute.

570
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,280
I don't know much about aircraft, but why
does she have to open up the door at all?

571
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,056
Isn't there a hole already
in the side of the airplane?

572
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,391
Now we know why
you're the millionaire.

573
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:45,325
2-7, this is tower.

574
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,944
When your cabling is in place,
there's something I'd like you to try.

575
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:54,682
Hey, now where are they going?

576
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,313
Tower, we have cabling in place.

577
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,936
We're rigging our man
to go over.

578
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,752
It's in the hands
of the boomer now.

579
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,628
Roger that, 2-7.

580
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,830
Here we go.

581
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:24,532
I really wish I knew what
was going on over there.

582
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:43,173
Target coming in.

583
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,635
Rate:
One foot per second.

584
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,691
<i>Steady.
Go slow and steady.</i>

585
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,313
Even it up.

586
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,873
Keep it steady.

587
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,614
Come on.
That's it.

588
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,334
Pull back, Lopez!
Pull back!

589
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,355
Come on.
Help me out down here.

590
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,560
Uh-oh.

591
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,560
Pull back, Lopez!

592
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,804
We have to try it again.

593
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,444
We'd like to take another
go at it. Please advise.

594
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,184
2-7, we don't have a choice.
Give it your best shot.

595
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,417
Roger that. Go.

596
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:03,652
All right.
Here we go.

597
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,493
Oh, I can't take it! I have to
go see what's going on out there.

598
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,564
Wait a minute.

599
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,772
Slow and steady.

600
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,876
<i>Come on.
Keep it steady.</i>

601
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:32,532
All right.
Come to papa.

602
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,884
Pipe: Five by five.

603
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,709
Come on. Come on.

604
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,989
Tension rate's good.

605
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,860
<i>Steady.</i>

606
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:59,283
Come on.

607
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,552
Contact! It's in!

608
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,240
All right, Reynolds, get up here.
You're on. - On my way.

609
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:12,079
Excellent work, 2-7.
- Oh, that phone!

610
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,589
Tower!

611
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,317
2-7, can you hold position
for the transfer?

612
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,589
We'll make it happen, tower.

613
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,900
Never lost a man yet.

614
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,788
Jeff! Take the phone!

615
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:30,788
Hurry!

616
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,493
Yeah. - Do you know how
much lying you have to do...

617
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:37,672
To get an operator to connect
you to a control tower?

618
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:41,264
Nicole?
- What's happening, Jeff?

619
00:49:43,074 --> 00:49:43,840
How is she making this
phone call?

620
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,149
I thought the communications
were fried. - Andrea has a cell phone.

621
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,999
Nicole, hang on. I'm gonna
put you on the speakerphone.

622
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,200
Nicole! It's daddy!
- <i>Nikki, are you okay?</i>

623
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,424
Mom! Dad!

624
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,454
Nikki, are you okay?
- Nicole, listen to me! - Please!

625
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,262
Tower, we've got our man
ready to go.

626
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,214
2-7, we have contact
with 109.

627
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,602
Roger that.
Please advise 109:

628
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:08,545
Stay strapped in
until the cable's in place.

629
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,259
Our man will come to them,
once inside.

630
00:50:11,294 --> 00:50:14,603
Copy, 2-7. Nicole, we need you
to stay right where you are.

631
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:18,395
<i>Someone's coming over now.</i>
- Coming over on that pole thing?

632
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,084
That's right.
- I'm gonna get everyone ready.

633
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,137
No, Nicole, please.
Stay where you are, sweetie.

634
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:26,186
Let our man come to you.
Understand?

635
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:28,402
I can get everyone
out of here faster.

636
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:29,976
I'm the only one
that's not hurt.

637
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,047
I'm just terrified.

638
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,170
Just do what they say, okay?
- That's right, honey. You listen to Jeff.

639
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,445
Tower, we're catching
some bow wave from 109.

640
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,628
I need some time to stabilize
before I send my man over.

641
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,165
Roger that.

642
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,251
Yeah, the refueler's
getting jostled by...

643
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,877
The air your plane
is pushing ahead of itself.

644
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,559
Usually, this wouldn't
be a problem,

645
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,471
because when the refueler's full of gas,
it's heavy enough not to be affected.

646
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:59,880
I thought that no gas
was a good thing.

647
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,033
A few minutes ago it was.

648
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,535
What's going on?
Everything's getting shaky.

649
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,589
You're picking up turbulence. The two
planes are batting some air back and forth.

650
00:51:08,624 --> 00:51:12,006
Is that bad?
- It's not good or bad, Nicole.

651
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,742
It... it just is.
Hang in there.

652
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,420
Tower, come in.
- This is tower. Go ahead.

653
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:22,493
I don't know how much longer
we can maintain connection.

654
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:25,685
I want to try and stabilize
before I send my man over.

655
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,533
Understood, 2-7, but we
are running out of time.

656
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,981
<i>Tower, I have a suggestion.</i>

657
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,532
Right now the boom is just sitting
there in the breach of the hull.

658
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,613
There's a locking device
in the tip of its probe.

659
00:51:38,648 --> 00:51:41,323
Usually it's activated when
it snaps into the fuel port.

660
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:46,075
<i>If we can get the passenger to
activate the device manually...</i>

661
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:50,131
it would help hold the boom in place.
- F.A.B., tower.

662
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:53,203
That should buy us enough stability
to send our man over with the cable.

663
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,909
No. It's gonna be
too dangerous for the girl.

664
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:59,636
Yeah. He's right.
- As opposed to the situation she's in now?

665
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:03,334
Why can't they activate this thing
themselves by remote control?

666
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,966
Because they can't. It has to come
in contact with the fueling port.

667
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:09,277
In our case, we make it
think it has. - Let me guess.

668
00:52:09,312 --> 00:52:10,734
It's a safety feature.

669
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,590
Let me get this straight. First you tell me
not to move. Now you're telling me<i> to</i> move?

670
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,917
<i>Nikki, listen.
You can do this.</i>

671
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,610
Just do what they
tell you to do.

672
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,808
It's okay.

673
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,047
<i>Okay.</i>

674
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,718
Nicole, on the end of
the boom is a large nozzle.

675
00:52:38,753 --> 00:52:41,154
That's what's sticking through
the hole in the airplane.

676
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,561
Hit it as hard as you can.
If you do, it'll open up like an umbrella...

677
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,945
And help hold the boom
in place.

678
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,495
Hit it? You mean, punch it?
- Yes. No, no, no, no.

679
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,775
Don't hit it with your fist. Find
something stronger. Anything.

680
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,175
Don't sweat it.
I got something.

681
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:07,120
<i>Okay, I'm going in. You want me to
hit this thing as hard as I can?</i>

682
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,108
That is correct.
- Excellent.

683
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,382
Oh, my God.

684
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,540
Tower, things are getting very
unstable up here. - Copy, 2-7.

685
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,052
<i>Hold still.</i>

686
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,208
I can't stabilize.

687
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:12,775
We're lo...
Lopez, we're losing it.

688
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,127
I can't hold it.

689
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,311
We're losing it.

690
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,644
The boom's gonna shred the cabin.
- Get the girl outta there now!

691
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:23,485
Nicole, get out
of the cabin now!

692
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,549
I can't hold it.

693
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,117
We've lost it!
We've lost it!

694
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:48,350
They've separated.

695
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,940
Tower? Tower, do you copy?

696
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:14,436
Tower. Go ahead.

697
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,971
<i>We couldn't maintain
the distance.</i>

698
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:20,180
We got knocked out of range.
We've lost the boom.

699
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,026
<i>Repeat:
We have lost the boom.</i>

700
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,054
Oh, God.

701
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,622
<i>There's additional damage
to the fuselage of 109.</i>

702
00:55:30,657 --> 00:55:33,510
<i>And without the boom,
we can't do anything. Sorry.</i>

703
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,935
Hello? Does anyone hear me?
- It's mom and dad. We're still here.

704
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,400
Carrie, get coordinates and try to find
out where that boom's going to hit.

705
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:43,936
Already on it.
<i>- Nicole, are you all right?</i>

706
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:47,999
Yeah, I guess.
- We had a problem with the refueler.

707
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:51,047
The boom got pulled away
from the airplane and...

708
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,541
I know. I was in here.
But listen to me.

709
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,871
The hole is even bigger.

710
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:58,757
<i>That boom thing
tore it open even wider.</i>

711
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,583
<i>I'm afraid
we're gonna fall out.</i>

712
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,988
Did you copy that, 2-7?

713
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,740
Copy. Tower, we're
out of ideas up here.

714
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:13,509
Don't see how we can
facilitate a midair transfer now.

715
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,420
Uh, 2-7,
maybe you could, uh,

716
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,930
extend a man out over the breach,
set up the tether that way.

717
00:56:22,451 --> 00:56:24,728
It wouldn't hold for transfer.
We'd lose everyone.

718
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,311
That's why we were gonna
use the boom, for the extra support.

719
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,125
Hey, what's going on?
- Stand by, Nicole.

720
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:38,211
Somebody give me an idea,
please!

721
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:52,339
We have to initiate emergency
airport evacuation right now.

722
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,820
You can't leave
my baby up there.

723
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,796
I'm sorry, but there's a lot
more people in harm's way.

724
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,764
Thirty minutes from now, this airport becomes
ground zero, and I gotta worry about them.

725
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:06,509
I'm sorry, Jeff.
He's right.

726
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:08,659
<i>Bickster, alert
airport authority.</i>

727
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:12,177
Priority red one evac plan.
Dave, Carrie, alert all personnel.

728
00:57:12,212 --> 00:57:15,428
<i>We're closing down the airport.
Divert them to their alternatives.</i>

729
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:20,030
<i>Let's go! Operations, this is tower.
We have a code red.</i>

730
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:21,700
<i>Repeat: Code red.</i>

731
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:24,035
<i>Initiate evacuation
procedures immediately.</i>

732
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,843
<i>This is not a drill.
Repeat: This is not a drill.</i>

733
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,362
<i>Carrie, make sure
all inbounds are diverted.</i>

734
00:57:30,397 --> 00:57:33,540
<i>Dave, check the radar and make
sure we aren't missing anybody.</i>

735
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,354
Mr. Stone, we have a...
Situation here where...

736
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,243
Jeff.

737
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,754
Please.

738
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,251
<i>That is correct, sir.</i>

739
00:58:01,286 --> 00:58:03,653
<i>This airport's closed
until further notice.</i>

740
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:15,053
Uh, please repeat, tower.

741
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,566
If I heard right, then
whoever thought of this is a genius.

742
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:21,850
Okay, 2-7, if we can get
the landing gear down,

743
00:58:21,885 --> 00:58:24,195
we can have the man
crawl up into the nose wheel.

744
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,261
Literally have him crawl
through the lower fuselage.

745
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,651
If you still got the cabling on,
he can attach it in the wheel well...

746
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:33,212
And start pulling people through
the floor panel in the cabin.

747
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,057
<i>We'll give it a shot, but please be
aware the air is getting thicker.</i>

748
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,042
<i>There's more friction.
The ride is gonna get a lot rougher.</i>

749
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:44,022
Copy that, 2-7,
but we have to try.

750
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:47,975
This is only gonna work if
the landing gear is down. - Roger that.

751
00:58:49,832 --> 00:58:51,518
Nicole, do you understand
what you have to do?

752
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,646
Sure. First you tell me to
go in the cockpit, then in the cabin;

753
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,644
then you want me to go back into the
cockpit and then back into the cabin.

754
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,258
<i>I guess you want me to go in the
cockpit now, right?</i> - Right. You got it.

755
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:07,418
<i>I don't wanna leave these guys out here.
The hole is really big now.</i>

756
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:11,305
I understand, but the best thing
you can do for them right now...

757
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,375
Is to get
that landing gear down.

758
00:59:14,912 --> 00:59:15,890
Okay.

759
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,855
I really don't want to fall out.

760
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,096
Okay. I'm here in the cockpit.
Now what?

761
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,013
We're gonna try to do
something we've done before.

762
00:59:43,048 --> 00:59:45,467
I'm gonna talk you through
the control panel, okay?

763
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,332
I understand, yeah.

764
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,403
On the right-hand side,
I need you to find the control pillar.

765
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:53,449
Okay.
- You see it?

766
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,459
Yeah, I see it. - Now, there
should be six lights right above it.

767
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,040
Uh, I guess,
but they're not lit up.

768
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,641
That's okay. When the wheels
are down, the lights will go on.

769
01:00:05,676 --> 01:00:06,465
Okay.

770
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:10,497
Lower the handle,
and tell me if the lights come on, okay?

771
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,679
Keep something in mind
before you hit that switch.

772
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:16,469
If the wheels come down,
it will slow the plane.

773
01:00:16,504 --> 01:00:17,869
Okay.

774
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,358
That's the autopilot
reacting to it.

775
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,690
There's gonna be a lot
of turbulence. - More turbulence?

776
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,818
It should settle out.
We think once the wheels are down,

777
01:00:26,853 --> 01:00:30,410
the autopilot will compensate by
bringing your plane down faster.

778
01:00:30,445 --> 01:00:33,762
Faster? - Your angle of
descent will become steeper.

779
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,211
That's perfectly normal. I do not want you
to worry about that when that happens.

780
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:38,683
Well, it's worrying me.

781
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:43,771
Once the landing gear is down, we can
have you off that plane in ten minutes.

782
01:00:49,087 --> 01:00:50,182
Okay, here it goes.

783
01:00:55,343 --> 01:00:56,583
I can't.
It's not working.

784
01:00:56,618 --> 01:00:59,438
Well, try it again.
Make sure you press it all the way.

785
01:01:08,808 --> 01:01:10,280
I guess that's the turbulence.

786
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,423
Tower, I see the landing gear.
- Yes.

787
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,592
All right, boys.
We're gonna try this again.

788
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,711
Let's get it right this time.

789
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,344
All right. Okay.

790
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,440
All right.
Here he goes.

791
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,800
Here they go.

792
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:15,030
Close in about 20 feet.

793
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,254
Closing.

794
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:24,070
That's too fast.
Slow it down.

795
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,941
Yeah!
- So did it work? Hello?

796
01:02:41,976 --> 01:02:44,525
<i>Did it work?</i>
- Stand by, Nicole. 2-7?

797
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:47,089
We have contact.
- <i>Ya-hoo!</i>

798
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:50,953
Tower, we have contact.
- Nicole, we have contact.

799
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,273
Stay right where you are.
You're about to have some company.

800
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,743
Nicole?
Nicole, come in!

801
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,687
Nicole, come in!
- Why isn't she answering?

802
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,253
<i>I don't know.</i>

803
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,147
Ten minutes, huh?
Let's try and cut that in half.

804
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,879
Jeff said the rescue guy
was coming through here.

805
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,360
The faster I get these people ready,
the faster we get off this thing.

806
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,679
Hey, rescue guy.
- Yes?

807
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,537
Well, let's start rescuing.

808
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,320
There's three more, plus me.

809
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,753
Okay!

810
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,508
<i>We're ready
for the first transfer.</i>

811
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:10,485
Tower, we're ready
for the first transfer.

812
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,404
Is it Nicole?
- I... I don't know.

813
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:31,084
Coming down. Get up here!
Come on! Let's move it!

814
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,629
We have transfer.

815
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:42,661
Is it her?

816
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,997
<i>Adult female.</i>

817
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,324
Andrea.
It's Andrea.

818
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,988
All right.
She's clear.

819
01:06:08,706 --> 01:06:11,427
A-ask them... what happened
to my baby. Ask them.

820
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,513
2-7, what's the status
on the little girl?

821
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,330
<i>Can't say for sure, tower.
Female is unconscious.</i>

822
01:06:21,365 --> 01:06:24,457
<i>Possible head trauma.
She can't tell us anything.</i>

823
01:06:26,001 --> 01:06:27,196
What happened
to my little girl?

824
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,797
<i>There's two more, plus me.</i>

825
01:06:44,832 --> 01:06:45,765
All right.

826
01:06:48,725 --> 01:06:49,995
Let's not forget about me.

827
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,231
Ready for second transfer.

828
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:00,442
Lopez, it's getting
real bad out here.

829
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,194
Let's move!

830
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,609
Okay, we got him.

831
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,681
As soon as he's clear, take him
back there. This cable isn't gonna hold.

832
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,426
Tower, we have second transfer...
adult male.

833
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:28,954
<i>It's one of the pilots.</i>

834
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:35,451
Tower, it's starting to get
a little rough up here.

835
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:49,619
<i>There's one more, plus me,</i>

836
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,107
and I might need help
with this one.

837
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,138
He's coming down!

838
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:17,092
Frank, please!
Please wake up.

839
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,373
Help me! Please!

840
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,563
Please.

841
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,499
Okay. Unhook him.
We got two more, and that's it.

842
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:39,977
Come on. Frank.

843
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:58,265
Come on, Frank.
We're running out of time.

844
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:05,185
Nicole, we got to go now!
- We're not gonna make it.

845
01:09:07,483 --> 01:09:08,426
Tower, come in.

846
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:12,303
We have the little girl and one
last man still on board 109.

847
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:14,733
I don't think
we'll be able to get both.

848
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:18,983
2-7, can you transfer
both of them at once?

849
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,298
<i>Negative, tower.</i>

850
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:24,728
Cable won't hold.
It's barely holding as is.

851
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,231
Come on!
There's no more time!

852
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,912
We gotta go, now!

853
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,254
Frank! Frank, please!

854
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,468
Please wake up!
Help me!

855
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,574
I love you.

856
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,309
I remember.
I remember everything.

857
01:09:56,636 --> 01:09:58,277
Just please wake up.

858
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,030
Let's get out of here.

859
01:10:01,065 --> 01:10:03,286
Help me.

860
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,774
I'll never disappoint you
again, I promise.

861
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:11,725
Please!

862
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:19,605
I can't leave him.
- Come on! We gotta go.

863
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,927
I can't leave him here. Help me, please.
- We gotta go now!

864
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,914
We're losing it. Guys, we're losing it!
Release the winch!

865
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,527
Release the winch!

866
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,106
Reynolds!
- We gotta go, Nicole!

867
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,818
No!

868
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:53,569
Lopez, we've lost Reynolds!
- Tower, we lost a man.

869
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:55,522
<i>Repeat: We lost a man.</i>

870
01:10:58,617 --> 01:10:59,666
Damn it!

871
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:04,210
<i>Tower, I have a confirmed signal.
Our man opened his chute.</i>

872
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:08,523
2-7, what about the other
two passengers? What about the girl?

873
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,505
Negative, tower.
Our man doesn't have them.

874
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,299
<i>They're either
lost in transfer...</i>

875
01:11:15,334 --> 01:11:17,866
<i>Or still on board the plane.</i>

876
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,283
No.

877
01:11:28,259 --> 01:11:29,719
I wish there was
something more we could do.

878
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:32,181
We'll have to
abort the mission.

879
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:35,451
S-stand by, 2-7.

880
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,139
<i>Understood, tower.</i>

881
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:41,270
I'm sorry.

882
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,356
No. No, she's
still up there.

883
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:55,652
Nicole and Frank are still up there.
Nikki, pick up the phone!

884
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:01,040
<i>Nikki!</i>

885
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:07,967
Nikki, pick up that phone!

886
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,574
Nikki!

887
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,105
Nikki.

888
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,601
I really want to get off
this airplane now.

889
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,090
<i>Oh, my God.
Nikki. Oh, Nikki.</i>

890
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,851
What happened to you?

891
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:27,452
I was trying to speed things up.
I moved everybody over.

892
01:12:27,487 --> 01:12:31,357
I saw a man fall from the plane.
Is he all right? Is everybody okay?

893
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,588
Yes, honey.
You saved their lives.

894
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:38,479
You did great, honey.
I love you.

895
01:12:40,224 --> 01:12:41,501
I miss you, dad.

896
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,215
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I let you down.

897
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,975
No, you didn't let me down.

898
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,909
That never happened, Nicole.

899
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:54,054
I let you down.

900
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,294
I spent so much time trying
to make things happen...

901
01:12:58,329 --> 01:12:59,660
For all of us that...

902
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,372
no.

903
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:05,274
You never let me down.

904
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:09,600
And I've never been so proud...

905
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:14,736
Or loved anybody as much
as I do you right now.

906
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,832
I love you, dad.

907
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:20,449
I love you, Nicole.

908
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,186
I love you!

909
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,640
Jeff?

910
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,074
Yeah. N-Nicole,
I'm right here.

911
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:37,925
You said I could land this plane
like in the movies, right?

912
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,531
Right, but, Nicole,
you can't take over the controls...

913
01:13:41,566 --> 01:13:44,131
As long as the autopilot
won't disengage.

914
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:48,530
You try, but you just keep fighting
the autopilot, and the autopilot wins.

915
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:52,991
Well, the autopilot's
not as pissed off as I am.

916
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,977
Where's the autopilot located?
Near the window?

917
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:06,449
Actually, it's
in the rear of the plane.

918
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:10,536
It would take an expert to go through the
circuitry to disengage the autopilot.

919
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,144
Understand?
- Whatever.

920
01:14:22,455 --> 01:14:24,383
I figured out how
to disengage the autopilot.

921
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,639
You... you what?

922
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,870
I'm flying the plane,
but I don't know how to fly.

923
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,670
Something's up.

924
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:39,565
Abrupt change in 109's flight path.
- She's flying the plane.

925
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,059
She's flying the plane!

926
01:14:43,602 --> 01:14:46,067
Nicole, I want you
to grab the controls,

927
01:14:46,102 --> 01:14:48,484
the, uh, the steering wheel
in front of you,

928
01:14:48,519 --> 01:14:51,244
and pull back towards you
until the plane levels out.

929
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,106
Do you understand?
- Okay.

930
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,497
Nicole, to make this work,
you have to do exactly what I tell you to do.

931
01:14:58,532 --> 01:14:59,640
Tell me.

932
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,225
On the left side of the panel
in front of you,

933
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,122
there's a round ball with a
horizontal line running through it.

934
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:09,610
<i>Do you see it?
- Yeah.</i>

935
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:13,624
Right. I see it. It's like a small "w",
small, tiny plane type thing.

936
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:16,817
That's right.
I want you to move the steering wheel...

937
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:19,346
To keep the part of the ball
where black meets white...

938
01:15:19,763 --> 01:15:22,331
Even with the white horizontal
line that's in the glass.

939
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:26,250
Move the controllers
forward or back?

940
01:15:26,285 --> 01:15:27,939
Back, Nicole.
Ease it back.

941
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,322
Now what?

942
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:34,706
I want you to ease
the controls forward now.

943
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:38,811
The altimeter will change positions,
but try to keep the two lines even,

944
01:15:38,846 --> 01:15:40,850
even though they're not
together anymore.

945
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,867
Okay.

946
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,147
Now what?

947
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:53,169
Keep the wings of the little
plane lined up with the horizon.

948
01:15:53,204 --> 01:15:57,048
If one wing is higher, move the control
in that direction to level it out.

949
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,808
If the right wing's higher,
I move it to the...

950
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:05,021
to the right.
- Okay, the right. Okay, I got it.

951
01:16:05,056 --> 01:16:10,390
Good. Now, Nicole, once the wings
are level, start pulling the controls back.

952
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:13,560
Understand? That will mean your
wings are holding steady...

953
01:16:13,595 --> 01:16:16,230
And that you're lowering
the plane for landing.

954
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:18,591
Okay, I... I'm doing it,
I think.

955
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:29,185
You're doing great, Nicole. Now, remember,
there's gonna be some turbulence.

956
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,440
There's always turbulence.

957
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,208
Just remember, stay calm.
Ease the steering wheel back.

958
01:16:35,243 --> 01:16:36,976
Keep the altimeter even.

959
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,628
Okay. I got it,
I think.

960
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:43,182
You'll feel yourself,
see yourself getting lower.

961
01:16:43,217 --> 01:16:44,864
Yeah, I do. I am.

962
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,834
Good. Now, we should be able to
see you from here very soon.

963
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:54,090
<i>Any minute now, you should be
seeing a strip of landing lights.</i>

964
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,561
They'll look like they're almost
floating right in front of you.

965
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:09,098
I can see them. Oh, God, I can't do this.
Please don't make me do this.

966
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,377
Nicole... you can.

967
01:17:12,412 --> 01:17:16,071
You can do this.
You can do anything, if you don't quit.

968
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:22,368
We need you.
Do you hear me?

969
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,920
Okay, dad.

970
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,847
Okay.

971
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,986
Okay, Jeff, what's next?

972
01:17:36,578 --> 01:17:39,850
Nicole, I want you to aim the plane
right between the landing lights.

973
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:43,306
At the same time, I want you to
pull back on the steering wheel.

974
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:46,042
The lights won't fill your
windows anymore. Do you understand?

975
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,209
Yeah. Okay.

976
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:50,964
Now listen carefully.

977
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,323
As you're landing, I need you to hit the
three levers to your right-hand side.

978
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:59,515
<i>One, two, three. Left to right.
Then jam your foot into the brakes.</i>

979
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,362
I can't believe
I'm landing this plane.

980
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,467
Nicole, you're doing fine.

981
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,769
Jeff? Jeff?

982
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,665
I don't believe it!

983
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:15,593
Nicole? Nicole!

984
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:23,272
I have a visual!
- Where?

985
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,728
Fifteen hundred feet...

986
01:18:25,763 --> 01:18:27,296
And dropping.

987
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:33,633
<i>How many crash teams
did you send to the runway?</i>

988
01:18:33,668 --> 01:18:35,604
All of them.
<i>- Stand by.</i>

989
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,929
I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.

990
01:18:42,964 --> 01:18:46,866
<i>nine hundred feet.</i>

991
01:18:47,937 --> 01:18:48,922
She's a little uneven.

992
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:52,872
<i>Eight hundred feet.</i>

993
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:55,240
Come on, Nicole.

994
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:59,623
I'm not gonna crash. I'm not gonna crash.
I'm not gonna crash.

995
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:01,832
Oh, please, God.

996
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,416
350 feet.
She's still uneven.

997
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:12,637
<i>Come on.
You can do it.</i>

998
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,405
<i>Two hundred feet.</i>

999
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,581
Please, please.
At least for my mom and dad.

1000
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,741
Come on. Come on.

1001
01:19:32,346 --> 01:19:33,836
This is not gonna be pretty.

1002
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:37,844
I can do this. I can do this.
I can do this.

1003
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:39,926
125 feet.

1004
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:56,420
Please, God, just for my baby.
- She's gonna do it.

1005
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,490
A hundred feet, damn it.

1006
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,844
Eighty feet.
Prepare for impact.

1007
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:09,483
<i>Fifty feet.</i>

1008
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,816
Oh, shit!

1009
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,978
Yes, she's down!
She's going too fast. No reverse thrusters.

1010
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,783
She can do it.
- She has to hit those switches in order!

1011
01:20:36,818 --> 01:20:38,315
What did he say?
What did he say?

1012
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:41,015
Left to right.
Left to right.

1013
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,559
Left to right. Come on!
- She'll do it.

1014
01:20:43,815 --> 01:20:46,551
I told you, she'll do it.
Do it, baby.

1015
01:20:48,568 --> 01:20:50,593
Come on, Nicole.
Left to right.

1016
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:54,492
One.
- One.

1017
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,180
Come on.

1018
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:01,924
Two. Come on.

1019
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:03,570
Two.

1020
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:06,809
Three.
- Three.

1021
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,825
Yes!
- Yes!

1022
01:21:30,975 --> 01:21:33,200
<i>Yes!</i>

1023
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,410
All right!

1024
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:46,570
Hey!

1025
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,410
Oh, good.

1026
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,950
Good.

1027
01:22:59,853 --> 01:23:01,438
<i>Nicole!</i>
- Dad!

1028
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,397
Oh, honey!

1029
01:23:04,225 --> 01:23:06,680
Oh, Nikki!

1030
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,629
I love you, baby.

1031
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,490
Sorry, dad.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1032
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,925
It's okay.

1033
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,959
Shh!
Oh, it's okay, honey.

1034
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:23,702
It's okay. It's okay.
- No, dad. Dad.

1035
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:26,615
Shh, shh, shh!
- No, I need to tell you...

1036
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,014
What? What?

1037
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:32,135
Roberto Clemente really was the
greatest baseball player of all time.

1038
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,335
Oh, honey.

1039
01:23:33,485 --> 01:23:35,093
Oh, dad.

1040
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:38,741
<i>Hey, Nicole.</i>

1041
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:45,245
Sorry about the Brad Pitt thing.

1042
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,925
It's okay.

1043
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,835
My folks won't let me date
until I'm 16, anyway.

1044
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:05,562
Left to right?

1045
01:24:06,937 --> 01:24:08,678
Left to right.
