00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,077
Hi.

2
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,742
- Good morning.
- Hello, I'm Carla Norris.

3
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,283
I have an appointment
with Mrs. McEvoy.

4
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,217
Through the garden, please, miss.
I'll tell her you're on your way there.

5
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,481
Thanks.

6
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,247
Hello, Mrs. McEvoy? Douglas.
Your 8:00 is here.

7
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,763
- Good morning.
- Miss Norris?

8
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,923
Yes.

9
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,025
- Hello, I'm Evelyn McEvoy.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

10
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,866
This midtown traffic.
I swear, I'll never get used to it.

11
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,405
Shall we see the apartment?

12
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,940
Yes. Sure.

13
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,584
Central air conditioning.
Absolutely terrific kitchen.

14
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,791
- I love the view.
- Yes. It's an airy place.

15
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,371
What is it that you do, Miss Norris?

16
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,015
I'm a book editor at Sutton.

17
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,089
- What a strange tub.
- I like tubs myself.

18
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,524
This is a nice room for reading, isn't it?

19
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,924
For reading?

20
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,232
Yes, it is, isn't it?

21
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,535
<i>I've got two tickets for Pavarotti Friday.</i>

22
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,712
I hate Pavarotti.

23
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:52,350
I don't care if I ever go to an opera
for the rest of my life. Or the ballet.

24
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,878
What do you want me to do?
Meet another nice, charming man...

25
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,446
like Derek,
and wake up seven years later...

26
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,583
- and realize I have no life?
- God, Carly, please.

27
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,519
- Look, why don't you get tickets to...
- Who?

28
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,196
- Pearl Jam.
- Pearl Jam?

29
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,393
Yeah.

30
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,568
You know, you're really being a putz.

31
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,572
How am I going to meet any attractive
men if I have to do it by myself?

32
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,164
You love Pavarotti.

33
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,903
I am a putz.
I wasted seven years of my life.

34
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,274
- And I hate Pavarotti.
- Will you stop it?

35
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,908
You are ready for new adventures.

36
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,715
New horizons.
New lovers. New orgasms.

37
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,124
- Well?
- I'm 35, I'm not 25.

38
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,559
I don't need a date,
I need a relationship.

39
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,162
Preferably one
where something happens this time.

40
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,323
Sure, but in case you've forgotten
how it works...

41
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,765
first you meet somebody,
then you have a relationship.

42
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,393
Oh, thank you, Dr. Ruth.

43
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,962
Do you work here, or do you just go
from office to office, offering advice?

44
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,066
Oh, will you take a look at Chapter 6?
I think I might have cut too deep.

45
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,112
Well, you didn't show it
to the author yet, did you?

46
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,270
Yeah, I did.

47
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,372
And?

48
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,047
He said, "I'll discuss it with Carly."

49
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,050
You cut too deep.

50
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,714
Never show it to the author
before you give it to me first, okay?

51
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,553
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

52
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,655
I'm sure the cuts are good.

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,558
And the author's a pussycat,
so don't worry about it. This is good.

54
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,325
Where are you
with the James Dean bio?

55
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,059
Marketing wants to up
the publishing date.

56
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,930
I'll be done with it
by the end of the weekend.

57
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,229
You're a genius, Carly.

58
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,737
Sure, who wouldn't be
on your social schedule?

59
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,400
There's a Mrs. McEvoy on line 1.
She says it's important.

60
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,499
- Do you want to talk to her?
- Yeah.

61
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,545
And Mr. Parsons called. He wants
to take you to lunch at L'Adagio.

62
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,783
That means I'm not getting my raise.

63
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,680
- Mrs. McEvoy.
<i>- Good news, my dear.</i>

64
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,052
<i>- Your application's been approved.</i>
- Already?

65
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,454
<i>- Is that a problem?</i>
- No.

66
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,891
No, I... I just didn't think
it would happen this fast.

67
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,664
<i>Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

68
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,800
I am. I'm very excited. Thank you.

69
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i>we can get you in next week.</i>

70
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,667
- Next week will be fine.
<i>- Splendid.</i>

71
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,808
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

72
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,011
- There you go.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
Sure.

74
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,878
Sorry I couldn't get the door
for you, Miss Norris.

75
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,112
The movers will be here
in about an hour.

76
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,053
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,625
He didn't want a "thank you."
I think he wanted a tip.

78
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,788
Well, he didn't get the door for me,
now, did he?

79
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,534
Sure didn't.

80
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,094
- Can I take one of these for you?
- I'm okay.

81
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,661
Come on, I've got two free arms.

82
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,769
You want me
to take this other one for you?

83
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,835
- No, I'm okay.
- You're sure?

84
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay.

85
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,616
I know the neighborhood
real well, so...

86
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,088
if you want the lowdown
on stores and things like that...

87
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,388
- I could...
- How's the market across the street?

88
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,394
It's okay.
The one over on 39th is cheaper.

89
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,794
Thanks.

90
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,093
I'm not gonna ask you again
if I can bring this up for you.

91
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,694
- Good. Don't.
- Here you go.

92
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,072
Thank you.

93
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,869
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

94
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,040
I will. Thank you.

95
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,314
You're right. These are getting heavy.

96
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,620
- Sorry. I'll see you.
- Bye.

97
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,619
<i>I need a check okay, register 3.</i>

98
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,162
<i>Check okay on register 3, please.</i>

99
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,302
You only have one thing.
Why don't you go ahead of me?

100
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,575
Oh, well, good idea. Thanks.

101
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,174
I'm Gus Hale.

102
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,016
You're moving in today, aren't you?

103
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,717
- Well, welcome to 113.
- Thanks.

104
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,720
I'm in 23-B.

105
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,464
- I'll take that for you.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,662
Hey, why are you walking here?

107
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,841
Forgive me,
I don't usually follow women around.

108
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,279
I'm not a dirty old man, really not.

109
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,615
- Are you certain?
- Sometimes I wish I were, but I'm not.

110
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,950
- Why do you wish you were?
- 'Cause it's boring when you're not.

111
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,859
You just really...
Well, you look like someone.

112
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,522
Someone you like
or someone you dislike?

113
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,658
Oh, no. I liked her a lot.

114
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,929
What's really strange is...

115
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,495
she was in 20-B as well.

116
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,563
Naomi Singer.

117
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,572
- When did she move?
- Well, she didn't. She...

118
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,577
She jumped out the window.

119
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,049
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I've never had much goddamned tact.

120
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,887
I tell you what.
I'm about to go off to Japan.

121
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,157
Perhaps when I get back,
I can fill you in on all the gossip.

122
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,666
- What are you gonna do there?
- I teach a class at NYU.

123
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,066
The Psychology of the Lens.

124
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,563
- "The Psychology of the Lens."
- Yes.

125
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,274
I teach all aspects.
I mean, cameras, camcorders...

126
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,538
I'm going over
to look at the latest technology.

127
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,583
So, you like salacious gossip?

128
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,550
I make a great cappuccino, too.

129
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,112
Call me.

130
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,556
How can I call you
when I don't even know your name?

131
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,728
How can you not know my name
if you knew my apartment number?

132
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,959
Our doormen are spoiled.
$5 only gets you half the information.

133
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,268
Carly Norris.

134
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,033
You must have liked her an awful lot
to spend $5.

135
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,302
I did.

136
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,406
We were pals.

137
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,599
<i>- How's the market across the street?</i>
<i>- It's okay.</i>

138
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,106
<i>Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.</i>

139
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,236
<i>- Where do you live now?</i>
<i>- In the Village.</i>

140
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,735
<i>This will be quite a change.</i>

141
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,510
<i>Shall I show you</i>
<i>the rest of the apartment?</i>

142
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,846
<i>Have you grown tired of the Village?</i>

143
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,582
<i>Oh, I teach all aspects of it.</i>
<i>Cameras, camcorders...</i>

144
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,044
This way.

145
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,681
Now, why don't you talk
to Lynn Nesbit about him?

146
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,744
His last book didn't sell very well.
Perhaps he's getting itchy at Random.

147
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:07,019
Perhaps he's blaming their marketing
and not the thinness of his characters.

148
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,093
Perhaps you can convince Lynn
to alert him to the inadequacies...

149
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,824
- of their marketing department.
- Are we negotiating, Alex?

150
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,297
Oh, I wouldn't call it that.

151
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,136
He's an attractive man, isn't he?

152
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,568
Alex, I ask you for a raise,
and you take me out to lunch...

153
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,769
and try to set me up.

154
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,802
Jack Landsford.

155
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,644
<i>Shred of Evidence, Flesh and Blood,</i>
police procedurals.

156
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,877
He hasn't written anything
in five or six years...

157
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,648
but he made so much off of
<i>Flesh and Blood,</i> he doesn't have to.

158
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,754
He's got a ranch in Montana.

159
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,657
- And speak of the devil.
- Hello, Alex.

160
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,752
- How are you?
- All right.

161
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,491
I'm the devil.

162
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,226
- Carla Norris.
- Hello.

163
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,895
You look familiar to me.

164
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,901
Maybe that's because
I live in your building.

165
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,399
Oh, yeah.

166
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,777
Jack, Carly is a big fan of yours.
She just loved <i>Flesh and Blood.</i>

167
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,107
- Hey.
- I haven't read it.

168
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm sorry.

169
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,712
- Here you are, sir.
- She hasn't read me.

170
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,515
Alex, why is it she hasn't read me?

171
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,924
Everybody's read me. I'm easy to read.

172
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,020
Well, I haven't.

173
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,963
She has better taste than I thought.

174
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,036
She'll read me, though.

175
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,333
What if she doesn't like
what she reads?

176
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,839
- Hi, Jack.
- You'll read me.

177
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,112
I know you'll read me.
Because you have good taste.

178
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,153
You've lost her now, Jack.
She likes being in control.

179
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,952
So do I.

180
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,121
- See you around the neighborhood.
- Yeah.

181
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,757
Alex.

182
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,627
I spend seven years in a bad marriage,
and you say I like being in control?

183
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,173
But you ended it, didn't you?

184
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,046
No. No way.

185
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,113
No.

186
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,848
Fuck both of you. You said $700, Mike.

187
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,685
Yeah, I know it's not fucking <i>Vogue.</i>
So what?

188
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,821
Well, it's your choice.

189
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,768
Look, I'm hungry, I'm jet-lagged, and
I don't need this shit. Goodbye, Michael.

190
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,796
God, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get those
right out of your way.

191
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,398
- That's okay.
- I'm Vida.

192
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,635
- Carly Norris.
- Hi.

193
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,302
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

194
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,576
Damn doormen.
I really tip them well, too.

195
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,214
Everybody does.

196
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,377
That's why they're never around
when you need them.

197
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,251
You're right.
You should see them at Christmas.

198
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,052
Like flies on shit then.

199
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,852
Oh, yeah, this guy was here.

200
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,991
He left this for you.

201
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,336
- You're all moved in, then?
- Oh, God, no. I hate it.

202
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,347
I know. It's worse than anal intercourse.

203
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,779
- You know, you look like...
- Yeah, the girl that...

204
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,045
- Naomi.
- Yeah.

205
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,781
Somebody's already told you.
I guess they would have.

206
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,323
- Were you friends?
- Well, sort of.

207
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,856
I mean, she was only here about a year.

208
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,088
And most of that time, I was in Milan.

209
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,189
Ass-pinching Italians.
My bum is still blue.

210
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,431
I couldn't believe it, though.

211
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,528
I mean,
she just didn't seem like the type.

212
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,736
- Were you here when she...
- Yeah.

213
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,641
She came over
to borrow some coffee the night before.

214
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,544
- I didn't have any.
- Caffeine withdrawal.

215
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,040
That would do it to me.

216
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,010
That's my agent. He's a slimy bastard.

217
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,250
Just a goddamned second,
all right, Michael?

218
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,652
Hey. Thanks.

219
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,594
Right. So see you around.

220
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,132
If you ever need
any coffee or anything...

221
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,933
Just make sure you don't run out.

222
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,439
Mr. Brown. That's original.
And where's he staying?

223
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,737
<i>The Regency Arms?</i>

224
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,407
<i>Okay.</i>

225
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,015
<i>And what's his room number?</i>

226
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,547
<i>627, got it.</i>

227
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,193
<i>Yeah, well, they all say</i>
<i>they're producers or sheiks.</i>

228
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>Hi, putz. I'm giving you</i>
<i>your last chance for Pavarotti.</i>

229
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,656
<i>Hey, isn't Pearl Jam</i>
<i>some sort of oriental sex thing?</i>

230
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,963
<i>Yummy.</i>

231
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,005
<i>Carla, this is Zeke Hawkins calling.</i>

232
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,172
<i>I hope you remember me.</i>

233
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,503
<i>I live in the building, too.</i>

234
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,014
<i>We met in the lobby when you were</i>
<i>moving in last weekend?</i>

235
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,246
<i>Anyway, listen, I was just calling</i>
<i>to let you know that if you...</i>

236
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,887
<i>you know, need any help</i>
<i>with anything...</i>

237
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,286
<i>I've got some pull</i>
<i>with the manager, so...</i>

238
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,881
<i>don't be afraid to give me a call.</i>

239
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,860
<i>I'm at home most of the day.</i>
<i>My number's 555-3126.</i>

240
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,924
<i>All righty? Okay, bye.</i>

241
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,224
<i>Hi, it's Peter. We are moving up</i>
<i>the pub date on the Dean book.</i>

242
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,464
<i>Just thought I'd call</i>
<i>and let you know. Bye.</i>

243
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,020
<i>Yeah, but what about</i>
<i>the appointment with Sony in Osaka?</i>

244
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,816
<i>11:30 on Monday?</i>

245
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,721
<i>Oh, well, I'll do it anytime they will.</i>

246
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,486
<i>I mean, I have to see them.</i>
<i>They're state-of-the-art.</i>

247
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,894
<i>... defensive system</i>
<i>is extraordinarily developed.</i>

248
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,956
<i>Acute schizophrenic, non-paranoid.</i>

249
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,091
<i>Classic Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome.</i>

250
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,104
<i>Clearly a great danger to women.</i>

251
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,005
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

252
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,838
<i>... we could rent one.</i>

253
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,540
<i>Well, that's an idea.</i>

254
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,446
<i>Hi, Zeke. It's Carla Norris.</i>

255
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,315
<i>Thanks for your call. I...</i>

256
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,884
<i>If I ever get unpacked around here...</i>

257
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,654
<i>I was thinking of having</i>
<i>a cocktail party on Friday night.</i>

258
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,291
<i>Sometime after 6:00.</i>

259
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,791
<i>And I was wondering</i>
<i>if you'd like to come.</i>

260
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,634
<i>Okay, I hope that you do. Bye-bye.</i>

261
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,208
Brother!

262
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,852
- Oh, you think that was funny?
- Yeah.

263
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,685
I didn't think that was funny.
You scared the shit out of me.

264
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,054
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

265
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm sorry.
You're right, it wasn't funny. I...

266
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,864
It was a real dumb-ass thing to do.
Really, I'm sorry.

267
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,132
Can we start over again? Huh?

268
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,670
What for? I really don't see the point.

269
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,669
- Hey, did you get the books?
- Yeah.

270
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,575
- Did you read them?
- No.

271
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,410
Yeah, you did. You can't fool me.

272
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,973
I read a few pages of one of them.

273
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,144
You read both of them.
You couldn't put them down.

274
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,120
I'm right, aren't I? Tell me I'm right.

275
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,280
You're wrong.

276
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,983
What?

277
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,753
You don't like sex and violence?
It sells, you know.

278
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,387
It buys ranches in Montana, I'm told.

279
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,290
You've been checking on me. I like that.

280
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,197
- Thank you.
- For what?

281
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,794
For stopping.

282
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,642
Now, how about gossip?
About James Dean, for instance.

283
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,870
Doesn't that sell?

284
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,073
You've been checking on me.
I don't like that.

285
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,117
I hear you're very good at the tell-alls.

286
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,814
I guess that comes
from being married to a very boring guy.

287
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,719
You just like all the juicy talk.

288
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,122
- Fuck you.
- Would you like to?

289
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,651
I can try and make myself available.
Hey, look...

290
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,856
come on, I'm a writer.
People tell me their secrets...

291
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,764
and I just take notes.
Like Truman Capote.

292
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:46,003
- You could tell me your secrets.
- I don't have any secrets.

293
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,097
Sure you do.

294
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,232
What secrets do I have?

295
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,937
I'd never tell.

296
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,383
Did you send me the telescope?

297
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,557
- Telescope?
- Yeah.

298
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,527
Why would I send you a telescope?

299
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,687
Hey.

300
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,460
I can't keep up with you.

301
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,436
No, you can't.

302
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,403
Taxi!

303
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,994
Excuse me, Officers, let her through,
please. She lives here. Come on.

304
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,227
Come on, Miss Norris. Come on.

305
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,394
- Do you live here?
- Did you know Mr. Hale?

306
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,732
How long have you lived
in this apartment?

307
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,898
How do you feel
about all these accidents?

308
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,871
Yes, he was a lecturer at NYU.

309
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,475
He doesn't seem to have had
any family. That's about all I know.

310
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,582
Miss? Miss?

311
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:21,054
- Are you a resident here?
- Yeah. Carla Norris...

312
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,060
- 20-B.
- 20-B?

313
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,402
- What happened?
- The guy in 23-B...

314
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,601
the professor, Gus Hale...

315
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,769
apparently he fell in the shower
and broke his neck.

316
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,977
Did you know Mr. Hale?

317
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,746
- I talked to him.
- What about?

318
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:46,017
Well, not that much, really.
We talked about...

319
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,518
that he was going to Japan.

320
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,287
- We talked about Naomi Singer.
- What did he say about Naomi Singer?

321
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,092
That they were friends, and...

322
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,262
that I look like her.

323
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,764
You do.

324
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,236
I don't remember
giving you an invitation.

325
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,863
I have a nose
for smelling parties in progress.

326
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,910
Also, a bottle of Dom Perignon.

327
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,206
Come on in, honey. I like you already.

328
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,612
- You hold and I'll pop.
- Yeah.

329
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,242
Jack Landsford,
I'd like to introduce you...

330
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,751
to Judy, of course.

331
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,217
Hi. Remember me?
We met in the doorway?

332
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,986
- And Peter.
- Hi. How are you?

333
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,654
- Pete. Hey, Alex.
- Jack, how are you?

334
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,323
- Good. How you been?
- And you know Vida.

335
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,625
- Hi, I'm Vida Warren.
- Hello. Jack Landsford.

336
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,803
I'm sorry.
I thought you two knew each other.

337
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,261
Say "cheese."

338
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,805
Jesus!

339
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,507
- Oh, hey.
- Hello. Here you go.

340
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,945
- Is this Dom Perignon, too?
- California red.

341
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,747
Oh. I'm sorry.

342
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,654
Now, this is very interesting.

343
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,291
It looks like Lalique, but it's not.
It's a copy.

344
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,087
You're right about that, Alex.

345
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,293
Nothing in the haunted house
is what it appears to be.

346
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,259
They've remodeled it completely.

347
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,428
Who owns it?

348
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,505
I heard it was some law firm downtown.

349
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,405
No. That's a false front.
I checked on that once.

350
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,411
I bet I could find out who owns it.

351
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,946
I know some people.

352
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,141
I could make a few calls
if you really want to know.

353
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,307
Pete, don't.

354
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,451
It could be the Mob.
We could be supporting crack dealers.

355
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,915
Then what are we gonna do? Move out?

356
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,517
There's an idea.

357
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:14,987
Thank you.

358
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,894
- It's a great party.
- Thank you.

359
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,336
Hey there. Can I get you something?

360
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,034
I'm fine, thanks.

361
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,476
- So, how do you like the new place?
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,949
Did you know Naomi Singer?

363
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,115
Not really. I saw her around a few times.

364
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,310
I wonder why she did it.

365
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,181
Yeah. I don't know, I think I read
something about boyfriend troubles.

366
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,359
Oh, they're doing it!

367
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,532
Oh, they are! I can't believe it!

368
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,657
Something exciting happening.

369
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,203
I don't believe it. They are!

370
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,463
Let me see. Let me see.

371
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,211
Oh, they sure are.

372
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,718
Would you look at her?
She's a voyeur. She can't get enough.

373
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,481
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

374
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,525
That's why you have this telescope
out here.

375
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,787
- It's not even mine!
- You're a peeper! A peeper!

376
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,887
Somebody gave this to me.

377
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,024
- Right.
- Everybody has a telescope.

378
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,796
- I don't.
- I do.

379
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,565
- Thank you.
- I do, too.

380
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,833
I'm shocked. I'm truly shocked.
You people are shameless.

381
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,209
You're all shameless.
What is with you guys?

382
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,747
- Will you look at that?
- Come on, Alex.

383
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,578
- Hurry up, before they finish.
- Just a moment.

384
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,878
I wanna look, too.

385
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,476
Oh, my God!

386
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,678
It looks like they're being Rolfed.

387
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,190
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

388
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,227
- Goodnight. Thank you for coming.
- Thanks. Bye.

389
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,819
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

390
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,827
Goodnight. And thanks for the wine.

391
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,370
- Sorry about the California red.
- I like California red.

392
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,533
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

393
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,937
Listen, do you work out?

394
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,310
You mean,
like exercise bikes and stuff?

395
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,182
No, no. The real thing. Weights.

396
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,650
- You want to check it out?
- Oh. No, thank you.

397
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,249
You would have a great time.

398
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,551
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning, maybe?

399
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,595
You know, there are mirrors
all over those places.

400
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,731
There are no mirrors.

401
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,532
They're everywhere you look.

402
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,706
No mirrors. Promise.

403
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,204
What do you say? 10:00? I'll call you?

404
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,772
I'll call you. Bye.

405
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,916
That was a great party.

406
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,810
I thank you.

407
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,812
You're welcome.

408
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,550
Who knows, maybe next time
I'll even get an invitation, huh?

409
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,856
- Maybe.
- Oh, you got to be careful.

410
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,725
Maybe means "yes"
to an old ex-journalist like myself.

411
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,565
The operative word being "ex."

412
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,065
Yeah.

413
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,833
But us investigative reporters
never lose the instinct...

414
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,636
to jump in at the slightest opening.

415
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,008
That would explain you jumping out
at me in the park, then, I guess.

416
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,007
No.

417
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,818
That was a tactic I developed
in junior high school to get the babes.

418
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,780
It didn't work then, either.

419
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,119
You don't go out much, do you?

420
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,694
I thought...

421
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,296
maybe in lieu of the gym...

422
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,524
you might want to go to dinner with me.

423
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,662
Maybe.

424
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,865
I'll take that maybe as a yes.

425
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,676
- Goodnight, Carla.
- Goodnight, Jack.

426
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,378
<i>... should climb to about 69 degrees.</i>

427
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,350
<i>Humidity levels slipping to about 15%.</i>

428
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,752
<i>Clouds and rain to return</i>
<i>with possible showers on Monday.</i>

429
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,052
<i>Temperatures for that period</i>
<i>should span the 60s and 70s.</i>

430
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,457
<i>Now, here's the New York One</i>
<i>traveler's advisory...</i>

431
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,393
<i>with a look at conditions</i>
<i>and temperatures...</i>

432
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,522
<i>for selected cities across the nation.</i>

433
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:45,227
<i>Remember, weather on the One every</i>
<i>10 minutes, here on New York One.</i>

434
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,828
Hello?

435
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,868
Is somebody out there?

436
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,529
What's the matter? Jesus!

437
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,629
- You okay, Miss Norris?
- Yes.

438
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,530
I hear something in my office.

439
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,941
- What the hell happened?
- I was...

440
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,536
The lights went out, and...

441
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,876
the door was jammed,
and then I heard this sound. I just...

442
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,385
Look, it must have jammed.

443
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,787
Come on. I think all this
haunted house crap is getting to you.

444
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,997
I don't believe it. You're such a liar.

445
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,771
Well, well, well. Looks like they must
have put up a few mirrors in here, huh?

446
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,210
Yeah, overnight, right?

447
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,710
Come on. Come on.
The locker room's right over here.

448
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,443
You conned me into this.

449
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,589
It'll be fun. Trust me.

450
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,320
Okay. Your turn.

451
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,885
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

452
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,696
Come on. I'll teach you.

453
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:32,996
Okay.

454
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,539
Great. Great.

455
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,877
Just want to keep your hips straight.

456
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,122
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a very nice butt?

457
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,358
- I already know you're a liar.
- You do.

458
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,795
Nobody's told me that in a long time.

459
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,165
Well, that's because the wrong people
have been looking at it.

460
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,230
That's true.

461
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,353
- How often do you work out?
- Three, four times a week.

462
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,649
I'm starving. How about you?

463
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,319
Yeah.

464
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,662
How do you find the time?

465
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:38,367
I work at home.
I design computer video games.

466
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,698
Oh, yeah?

467
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,705
You think I'm too young for you,
don't you?

468
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,003
<i>What?</i>

469
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,408
<i>- You do, don't you?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

470
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,211
<i>- I wasn't thinking about that.</i>
<i>- Liar.</i>

471
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,806
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

472
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,377
<i>I'm not.</i>

473
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,270
You like it?

474
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,376
Yeah. I love it. I play it all the time.

475
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,815
- So you really do have the beer.
- I told you it wasn't a ruse.

476
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,459
Thank you.

477
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,765
- What's that?
- A volcano.

478
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,204
I've always loved them.

479
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,939
I'd like to fly into one sometime.

480
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,907
Why?

481
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,212
I don't know. It sounds like fun.

482
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,917
Don't you think?

483
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,115
I have to go.

484
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,657
- Please, I...
- It's okay.

485
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,299
You're so beautiful, Carly.

486
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,454
They'll see.

487
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,120
I want to see.

488
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,593
I want to see you.

489
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,644
It's okay.

490
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,442
It's okay. I'm here.

491
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,493
What are you worried about?

492
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,263
Somebody's watching you
like you watch them?

493
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,040
Why don't you come over here
with me and lie down?

494
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,911
Why? So you can talk dirty to me
some more?

495
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,548
Please?

496
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,271
Oh, I have to go.

497
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,772
It's my building, Carly. I own it.

498
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,782
I even helped redesign it.

499
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,322
My father owned
a bunch of hotels, so I...

500
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,649
I inherited a lot of money.

501
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,921
And I didn't want to be bothered
with a lot of hassles...

502
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,623
so I just don't tell people that I own it.

503
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,064
Did you tell Mrs. McEvoy
to give me special treatment?

504
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,595
No.

505
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,432
But I did approve
your application quickly.

506
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,401
You had me all plotted out, huh?

507
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,715
I just thought we would like each other.

508
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,478
You're not angry with me, are you?

509
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,307
<i>Boy, have I got something to tell you.</i>
<i>You're not going to believe it!</i>

510
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,952
<i>This is Judy. Will you call me?</i>

511
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,484
<i>Where have you been?</i>
<i>I've been trying to call you all day.</i>

512
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,552
<i>Something's going on, I can smell it.</i>

513
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,323
<i>You've probably been having</i>
<i>multiple orgasms.</i>

514
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,332
<i>You've probably been</i>
<i>fucking your brains out.</i>

515
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,163
<i>I have.</i>

516
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,101
<i>Carly, Alex is all over me</i>
<i>about the Dean book.</i>

517
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,734
<i>Please, please work on it</i>
<i>this weekend. Bye.</i>

518
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,236
Goodnight.

519
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,141
Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.

520
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,578
You do look like you fucked
your brains out. Look at you.

521
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,883
What are you smiling at?
That damn éclair?

522
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,753
- I'm just smiling. That's all.
- Tell me.

523
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,794
I want to know everything.
Every little grunt. Every little wiggle.

524
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,328
There's nothing to tell.

525
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,358
You've been spending too much time
with your vibrator.

526
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,767
I certainly have.
I'm getting a plastic yeast infection.

527
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,032
Who is he? Do I know him? Tell me.

528
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,630
- Tell me.
- You met him.

529
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,902
I met him? And I didn't pin him
to the wall and ravish him myself?

530
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,537
And you got him?
Now I'm pissed. Who?

531
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,307
It's Zeke. You met him at my apartment.

532
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,486
That gorgeous, young, incredible...
Oh, my God, I hate you.

533
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,052
I really hate you. How is he?

534
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:36,923
Give me the goods. Is he insatiable?
I bet he's insatiable.

535
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,587
They all are at that age.
Lead pencils, that's what they are.

536
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,427
I hate you. I really, really hate you.

537
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,725
I mean, I go away
with the other one, right...

538
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,235
for what I think is going to be
a hot, steamy weekend...

539
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,670
and you're reloading a lead pencil.

540
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,968
I must have done something terrible
in my past life.

541
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,375
- Wait. You went off with who?
- Jack Landsford.

542
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,142
Who's not even a sharpened pencil,
let me tell you.

543
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,150
We went to Montauk. Stayed in a cabin.

544
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:07,919
- What happened?
- Nothing. Not a damn thing.

545
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,849
The earth definitely did not move.

546
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,822
All he did was ask about you.
You know, you should go out with him.

547
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,968
Just to find out for me
if he's even got a pencil.

548
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,277
I'll bet it's something blue.

549
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,679
Something intimate.

550
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,544
Something lacy.

551
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,751
Something whorish.

552
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,253
How did you get in here?

553
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,016
The door was open.

554
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,722
I've lived in New York for 10 years
and I've never left my door open.

555
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,094
Well, maybe you did this time.

556
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,059
- Maybe the super did.
- I don't think so. I want you to leave.

557
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,137
He was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

558
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,138
Maybe she smelt like flowers, too.

559
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,182
Maybe you two
use the same spermicide.

560
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,408
- I'm calling...
- She was seeing a shrink.

561
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,788
She told the shrink about your boyfriend.

562
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,720
And after Naomi was murdered,
the shrink told the police.

563
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,260
He's not my boyfriend.

564
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh? Well, what the hell is he, then?

565
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:32,196
The neighborhood florist?
I saw you two in the lobby together.

566
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,702
I'm not blind.

567
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,139
My God, you really do look like her.

568
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,905
She died right here.

569
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,776
She went off that balcony.

570
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,246
You don't really know
what you're dealing with, do you?

571
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,286
He's fucked up.

572
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,063
He's so very, very sick.

573
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,593
You don't believe me, do you?

574
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,499
All right. Here.

575
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,905
You call Lieutenant Hendrix.
16th Precinct. Go on.

576
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,137
Go on. Ask her.

577
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,085
Your boyfriend owns the building.

578
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,193
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

579
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,424
I'll bet he didn't tell you, did he?

580
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,335
Yes, he did.

581
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,669
You know how difficult it was
for the police to discover that?

582
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,878
This guy has more false fronts,
more high-powered attorneys...

583
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,539
than Richard fucking Nixon!

584
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,775
You know what I think?

585
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,782
I think you can't write anymore.

586
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:02,588
And I think you're making this up
to hide the fact that you can't.

587
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,988
I'm sorry for you, Jack.

588
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,387
I really am.

589
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,797
But if I ever find you
in my apartment again...

590
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,633
I'm gonna have you
thrown out of the building.

591
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,978
Goodbye.

592
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,299
Are you hungry?

593
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,805
- I've already eaten.
- Liar.

594
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,377
You're afraid of me.

595
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:38,710
Do I look like a girl
who would be frightened of you?

596
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,386
<i>I did sort of come on strong yesterday.</i>

597
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,486
Well, I came on strong, too.

598
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,421
Do you want to go out for some truffles?

599
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,128
<i>Truffles?</i>

600
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:56,665
<i>- Now?</i>
- Yeah, why not? I love truffles.

601
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:02,207
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Wear what I sent you.

602
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,307
<i>Meet me downstairs in one hour.</i>

603
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,112
Hurry. One hour.

604
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,230
- Taxi!
- Did you think I wasn't coming?

605
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:28,930
No.

606
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,306
I knew you wanted me to think
that you weren't coming.

607
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,272
You look good enough to eat.

608
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,192
- Are you ready to order yet, sir?
- Not yet, thank you.

609
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,933
Very well, sir.

610
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,465
- Your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.

611
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,633
- What?
- Nothing.

612
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,940
You like playing games, don't you?

613
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,879
I like playing games
with people who like playing games.

614
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,013
What game do I like to play?

615
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,288
Scrabble?

616
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,984
I hate Scrabble
because I'm awful at Scrabble.

617
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,962
- I like poker, though.
- So do I.

618
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,466
- Would you like to play?
- Now?

619
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,236
Right now.

620
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,067
The police came to see me today.

621
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:47,073
Found out I owned the building
and were asking all sorts of questions...

622
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,241
about the wiring.

623
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,853
I had such a terrible day,
I couldn't get any work done.

624
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,424
Are we playing poker now?

625
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,824
We're about to start.

626
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,198
Did you like the bra and panties?

627
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,763
Yes.

628
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,733
Are you wearing them?

629
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:17,938
Maybe.

630
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,244
I think you are.

631
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,517
Show me.

632
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,421
- Right here?
- Right here.

633
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,034
I'm sorry. I can't see that.
I'm nearsighted.

634
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,759
Can you see this?

635
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,827
Yes.

636
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,235
What about the panties?

637
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,341
Panties?

638
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,638
Yes. The panties.

639
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,071
Are you wearing the panties?

640
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,608
Forget it.

641
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,944
I win, you lose, this game.

642
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,804
I can't tell.

643
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,638
I win, you lose.

644
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,078
This game.

645
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:37,650
Are you ready to order yet, sir?

646
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,394
Where are we going?

647
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,003
- Thirteen.
- It's an unlucky number.

648
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,167
It's an unlucky apartment building.

649
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,588
Good night.

650
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,451
Put these on.

651
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,656
I wouldn't want you to catch a draft.

652
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,697
I'm okay. I'm pretty warm down there.

653
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,132
See you soon.

654
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,246
Zeke?

655
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,789
Zeke?

656
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,362
Hello?

657
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,220
Damn you. You left the door open.

658
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,826
You knew I'd come.

659
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,398
I thought we came together.

660
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,466
Did you and Naomi come together?

661
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,131
I hardly knew her. I told you.

662
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,244
She told someone
you had an affair with her.

663
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,281
That's crazy. She came on to me once.

664
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,949
Maybe she fantasized.

665
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,287
I heard she had an affair
with your friend.

666
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,118
- What friend?
- Your writer friend, Jack.

667
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:13,760
- Who told you that?
- Your neighbor Vida.

668
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,429
She told me at your party. No big deal.

669
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,779
If you stay,
you could wake up in my arms.

670
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,114
We could kiss to start the day.

671
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,976
I could make you breakfast.

672
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,519
We could go for a walk in the park
and hold hands.

673
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,361
Am I scaring you again?

674
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,766
I don't wanna get hurt.

675
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,193
<i>Hi. This is Vida. Leave a message.</i>

676
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:55,395
<i>Vida? Vida, are you there?</i>
<i>It's Carly Norris.</i>

677
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,930
Vida, I need to talk to you
about something.

678
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,339
Can you give me a call?

679
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,876
It's really important.

680
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,780
- Hello?
<i>- Jack, it's Carly Norris.</i>

681
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:14,714
Hi.

682
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:19,558
Look, clearly this is
none of my business, but...

683
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,625
Vida told me that it was you...

684
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,930
that was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

685
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,964
That's bullshit.

686
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,871
<i>Vida tell you that?</i>

687
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,904
<i>No, I think your boyfriend</i>
<i>told you that, didn't he?</i>

688
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,811
<i>Vida didn't tell you that, did she?</i>

689
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,805
Hey, Vida.

690
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,071
Hi, I got your message.
I'll call you tonight.

691
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,840
I've got a job and I'm really late.

692
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,176
I just...

693
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,646
I just wanted to...

694
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,651
Look, I don't wanna get caught in there.

695
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,620
- Vida, I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah, I'll call you later, okay?

696
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,624
Well, okay.

697
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,185
Shit.

698
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,455
Fucking building.

699
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:32,611
You just lie there. Be still.

700
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,189
Are you happy now? Are you happy?

701
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,427
Carly?

702
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,489
Oh, Jesus!

703
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,636
Carly, don't run!

704
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,051
Did Miss Warren know Jack Landsford?

705
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,483
I think so.

706
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:41,253
Because I saw Jack and Vida
on the street.

707
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,684
- When was that?
- About a week ago.

708
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,127
Jack was giving her some money.

709
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,098
This isn't your knife, is it, Jack?

710
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,771
I don't think so.

711
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,240
Hey, Jack, you know Vida Warren?

712
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,705
No. I mean, yeah.

713
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,941
I met her once at Carly Norris' party.

714
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,074
You're somewhat of a player,
aren't you, Jack?

715
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:10,978
With the ladies, I mean.

716
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,820
I date, sure.
So do you, McCracken, you hump.

717
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,717
- Were you dating Vida Warren?
- No.

718
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,256
Oh, Jack. We got a problem.

719
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:27,097
We found these pictures of you
all over her apartment.

720
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,665
Those are my publicity photos.
I keep them in my desk.

721
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:37,772
He set me up.

722
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,441
- God damn it, he set me up!
- Who set you up, Jack?

723
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,179
Zeke Hawkins, the guy in 13-A.
You talked to him yet?

724
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,845
Well, why would he want
to do that, Jack?

725
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,084
A woman.

726
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,924
A woman. What woman?

727
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,620
Naomi Singer. Remember her?

728
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,688
- The suicide?
- Yeah.

729
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,133
You got any idea why this Singer
woman would wanna kill herself, Jack?

730
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,603
No. Hey, you guys know me.
I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.

731
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,108
Were you seeing her, Jack?

732
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,503
Yeah.

733
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,113
I mean, we got women dying all over
the place around you, don't we, Jack?

734
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,146
- Hey, fuck you, McCracken.
- Hey, fuck you, Jack!

735
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,687
Back off, McCracken, will you?

736
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,313
- Mac.
- Take it easy, Jack.

737
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,756
- Jesus Christ.
- You tell him to take it easy.

738
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,454
What's the matter with you guys?
You know me. I didn't do this.

739
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,220
- I want my attorney.
- All right.

740
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,358
You spent part of the year
up in Montana.

741
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,631
You got some kind of a ranch
up there, Jack?

742
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:35,795
Yeah, so what?

743
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,771
- What's the name of that place?
- The name?

744
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,705
- Yeah, the name.
- The Flying L.

745
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,398
The Flying L, huh?

746
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,811
You parking your horse
in Vida Warren's closet, pardner?

747
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,747
- I want my attorney down here now.
- All right.

748
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,377
- I want him now!
- You'll get him.

749
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,012
The D.A.'s gonna charge him.

750
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,823
He will make bail.

751
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,603
He's coming back here, isn't he?

752
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,369
We'll know it if he does.

753
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,278
How will we know?
He could be there right now.

754
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,981
Let's see if he is.

755
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,286
Come on.

756
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,800
You know my mother was an actress
on the soaps?

757
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,465
She used to spend
most of the year in LA.

758
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,805
I used to take a cab home from school
and watch her on TV.

759
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,608
That was just about my life with her.

760
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:56,648
I had it custom-built in Osaka.

761
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,245
It cost me $6 million.

762
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,117
He's not there.

763
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,153
We'll know if he is, though.

764
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,798
<i>Tomorrow night.</i>
<i>Yeah, I have to be in at 5:00.</i>

765
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,935
<i>No, it's just me. Can you believe it?</i>
<i>There must have been 600 girls there.</i>

766
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,177
Put my apartment on.

767
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,612
- There's nobody home there, either.
- Put it on.

768
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,315
<i>Aren't you gonna come meet us?</i>

769
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:35,516
<i>Yeah, we're gonna be there in</i>
<i>about a half hour, if I can get ready.</i>

770
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,689
<i>No, I think Henry will be there.</i>

771
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,854
<i>No, he just called me, like,</i>
<i>20 minutes ago.</i>

772
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,329
<i>What does that have</i>
<i>to do with anything?</i>

773
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:44,865
<i>My God, have you slept with her?</i>

774
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,826
<i>Did you sleep with her?</i>
<i>Simple question, Will.</i>

775
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,734
<i>You're making me do something</i>
<i>I don't want to do.</i>

776
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,896
<i>I know.</i>

777
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,734
You watch them?

778
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,346
- You watch these people?
- So do you, Carly, with your telescope.

779
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:03,111
- Oh, you...
- I just have better technology.

780
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:10,457
You want gossip?
I'll give you real gossip. Real life, Carly.

781
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:15,754
It's better than any book.
Better than any movie.

782
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:19,561
It's a soap opera. It's real life.

783
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:23,503
It's a tragedy, it's funny,
it's sad, it's unpredictable.

784
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,666
- Look for yourself, Carly.
- It's wrong.

785
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,741
It's the same as your James Dean book.

786
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,005
Only nobody gets hurt.

787
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,341
<i>- You ready?</i>
<i>- Yes...</i>

788
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,175
They don't even know.

789
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:38,814
Open the door, Zeke.

790
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,384
Look, Carly, don't...

791
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,061
I love you.

792
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,381
<i>Give me a little bit more time,</i>
<i>for God's sake!</i>

793
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:30,061
<i>You will ride with your dad, okay?</i>
<i>That's it. No more.</i>

794
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,827
<i>He's not my father, and I'm not riding</i>
<i>with him alone. I don't...</i>

795
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,032
<i>Jonie, get back in here!</i>
<i>Jonie! Come here.</i>

796
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,369
<i>You be nicer to him!</i>

797
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,706
<i>- He touches me.</i>
<i>- Stop it!</i>

798
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,209
<i>He puts his hands on me, Mom,</i>
<i>every chance he gets.</i>

799
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,216
<i>Don't start. I don't wanna hear it.</i>

800
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,718
<i>He is a decent, hard-working man.</i>

801
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,847
<i>I hate him! I hate him!</i>

802
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,882
<i>- Don't you...</i>
<i>- I hate you, Mom! I hate you!</i>

803
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:06,059
The little girl's right.
Every chance he gets.

804
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,227
<i>I hate him, Pony, I really do. I hate him.</i>

805
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,737
Whenever the mother's not around,
he's got his hands all over her.

806
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:37,794
Why don't you give it a try?
You just have to tap the touch screen.

807
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:54,843
<i>There are some alternatives.</i>
<i>I realize you're in a lot of pain.</i>

808
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,148
- Would you like something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

809
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,591
You haven't eaten anything all day.

810
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,089
You're like a kid with a new toy.

811
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,593
But it's not a toy, is it?

812
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:26,565
No.

813
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,966
Are you the one
that sent me the telescope?

814
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,204
Yes.

815
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,208
Why did you do it?

816
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,618
<i>Not now, honey.</i>

817
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,626
<i>What did the x-ray show?</i>

818
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:49,761
<i>Some kind of shadow, that's all.</i>

819
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,822
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>It could be anything.</i>

820
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,965
<i>Baby, please tell me everything.</i>
<i>What did he say?</i>

821
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:02,403
<i>- He said it might be a tumor.</i>
<i>- A tumor?</i>

822
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:05,472
Were you watching Vida
when she got killed?

823
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,540
No. The lights had gone down
in the stairwell.

824
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:11,949
What about the others?

825
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,516
I wasn't watching.

826
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,022
I did see Gus Hale
on the floor of the shower, though.

827
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,792
I was the one who called the police.

828
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:20,587
Do you tape these?

829
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,256
Yes.

830
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,028
Did you tape us?

831
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,466
Would you like to see?

832
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,502
Yes.

833
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,678
There's so much on this tape.

834
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,222
Come on, where is it?

835
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,223
You see, sometimes I just let it run
on record in one apartment for a while.

836
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,119
Like my own little soap opera.

837
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,800
I don't even have the time
to watch most of what I record.

838
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,467
It's amazing what I've found
on some of these tapes.

839
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,637
Good morning.

840
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,024
Oh, God. Are you all right?

841
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,457
- Carly.
- I'm fine.

842
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:08,792
We've been so worried about you.
Everybody's been calling.

843
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,331
Yeah, and to think I spent the weekend
with an impotent maniac...

844
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,630
hoping that he'd, you know...
The police even talked to me.

845
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:15,828
Carly Norris.

846
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,168
- Carly, will you come and see me later...
- It's Zeke Hawkins.

847
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,467
...and tell me the real skinny?

848
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,065
I wanna hear everything, darling.

849
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,403
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, guess what?</i>

850
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,382
<i>I called Ballinger at his office, you know</i>
<i>the guy who can't keep his hands...</i>

851
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,543
<i>off his stepdaughter?</i>

852
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,622
<i>I told him if he ever touched her again,</i>
<i>I'd kill him.</i>

853
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,554
- What did he do?
- He panicked, that's what he did.

854
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,759
I just wish you could have heard him.

855
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,029
<i>Hey, maybe we should</i>
<i>start wiring the whole town, huh?</i>

856
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:47,257
That way we could see everything.

857
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:52,863
<i>You there, Carly?</i>

858
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:55,574
I don't know what to do.

859
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,740
Just come home, you.

860
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,209
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

861
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:51,664
Don't you scream.
Don't. I'm not gonna hurt you.

862
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,696
He set me up, Carly. Zeke set me up.

863
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:58,606
I believe you. I do, I believe you.

864
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,510
It's okay. Let me go. Let me go.

865
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,275
He's sick. That man is sick.

866
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,684
His mother died when he was 17.
She was a soap opera actress.

867
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,778
Do you know how she died? She fell.

868
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,847
- She fell?
- She fell in the shower.

869
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,455
- Look!
- What?

870
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:22,724
Look, Carly. Thea Manning.
That's his mother, Carly.

871
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,823
- Who does she look like?
- Oh, she...

872
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,660
She looks like you, Carly.

873
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,670
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

874
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,040
Hey, are you coming down?

875
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,877
- Why don't you come over here?
<i>- Why? What's up?</i>

876
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:50,415
Well, because I have a surprise for you.

877
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,520
Great. I'll be right there.

878
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,393
Okay.

879
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,160
- Sit down.
- Okay.

880
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,845
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

881
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,844
A little dark in here, don't you think?

882
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,015
- He's got a gun!
- Sit down! All right, you bastard!

883
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,213
You tell the truth now,
or I'll blow your brains out.

884
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:23,416
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You killed Naomi Singer.

885
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:24,718
No, I didn't.

886
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,283
- How'd your mother die, Zeke?
- My mother?

887
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:29,795
Yeah, she fell in the shower,
wasn't that it?

888
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,364
She had an aneurysm and fell.

889
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,900
She fell in the shower
the way you killed Gus Hale.

890
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:37,030
- Gus Hale?
- Yeah, and he killed Vida, too.

891
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,130
Didn't you? Didn't you?

892
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,967
Three now, Jack? I killed three people?

893
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,535
First of all, I didn't
even know Naomi Singer.

894
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:49,639
But you did, Jack.
'Cause I saw you with her.

895
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,377
So I know
why you would want to kill her.

896
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,244
What do you mean, you saw us?

897
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:56,449
I also saw her give you a key
to this apartment, right, Jack?

898
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,088
Is that how he got in here
this time, huh?

899
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,696
- Is it?
- You still have the key, don't you?

900
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,993
- Why don't you show it to us, Jack?
- What the hell are you talking about?

901
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,036
I'm talking about the fact that you
just couldn't get it up, could you, Jack?

902
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:12,867
I saw that, too.
Is that why you killed her, Jack?

903
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:17,141
- Is it? Is it?
- He's lying, Carly. He's lying.

904
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,906
Jack, I don't know what to believe.

905
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,504
Just show me the key.

906
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,109
No, Jack! No.

907
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:46,704
Jack, let go! Jack. No!

908
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:53,337
Oh, my...

909
01:30:57,051 --> 01:31:01,920
Because he was already in this room,
but I didn't see him.

910
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:06,584
And when he came out,
I saw that he had a gun.

911
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,755
He started screaming at me.

912
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,427
And...

913
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,167
Sorry.

914
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:24,402
Then we wrestled around
on the ground.

915
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:26,844
And...

916
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,514
the gun skidded across the floor there...

917
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:35,454
and I picked it up.

918
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:39,018
How did he get in?

919
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:41,422
Your door wasn't forced.

920
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,456
He must have had a key.

921
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,900
I mean, it was just like before.
He was already in here.

922
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:51,871
He had these in his pocket.

923
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:54,366
Try them.

924
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:10,287
Jack Landsford's got a sheet with us.
He's a known offender.

925
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:14,795
Assaulted his ex-wife more than once.
She dropped charges.

926
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,325
I wish she hadn't.

927
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,093
Maybe we wouldn't
have two women dead.

928
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:23,799
He didn't get in with these.

929
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,666
- You guys about done here?
- Finished.

930
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:32,842
- Where?
- Floor, next to the counter.

931
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,113
This yours?

932
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:38,812
No.

933
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:53,663
Bingo.

934
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,192
Well, that wraps it.

935
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:59,265
The D.A.'s gonna need to see you both
tomorrow morning...

936
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,408
down at the precinct. Say, 9:30?

937
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,876
You know where it is.

938
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,041
Let's secure it.

939
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,570
I don't...

940
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:37,404
I don't want to stay here tonight.

941
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,213
Stay with me.

942
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,209
Stay with me.

943
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,014
Okay?

944
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,452
<i>Jonie, can we talk for a minute?</i>

945
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:04,302
<i>Have you told anyone that I...</i>

946
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:09,571
<i>- Just Mom.</i>
<i>- You're sure?</i>

947
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,749
<i>Jonie, I'm sorry.</i>

948
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,415
<i>It was just, I couldn't help myself.</i>

949
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:27,492
<i>It'll never happen again.</i>
<i>I swear it. Never.</i>

950
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:36,467
It's like playing God.

951
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:40,395
- We'll only do good things.
- I don't want to do this.

952
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:44,639
I want my privacy.
I want my own experiences.

953
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:48,611
Zeke, I want to have a real relationship.

954
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:52,215
Carly, I love you.
You can have anything you want.

955
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,513
I want my tape.

956
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:59,058
If I have you, I don't need them, right?

957
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,758
Hold on.

958
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,002
Erased.

959
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,240
- You okay?
- Yeah.

960
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:54,976
Tired.

961
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:57,579
And hungry, I guess.

962
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:02,053
I'll go get something for us.
What would you like?

963
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:03,418
Anything.

964
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:09,892
You're so beautiful.

965
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:19,529
Be right back.

966
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:15,287
<i>You're so beautiful, Vida.</i>

967
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:23,829
<i>You're so beautiful, Vida.</i>

968
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,935
<i>You smell so good.</i>

969
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,555
<i>You smell so good.</i>

970
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:54,995
<i>I love you, Naomi.</i>

971
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:01,138
<i>I love you. You smell like roses.</i>

972
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:36,367
Carly.

973
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:41,445
Come on. Come on, open the door!
Let's go. Open up!

974
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:45,746
Hey, come on!

975
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:06,301
<i>Carly...</i>

976
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,471
<i>you're watching me, aren't you?</i>

977
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,248
Are you looking at me?

978
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:23,618
You're looking at me.
I can tell, I can feel it.

979
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,923
I love you, Carly.

980
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,659
<i>Carly, let me in. Come on.</i>

981
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,630
<i>Peekaboo. You see me.</i>

982
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:43,303
<i>Come on, open the door. Now.</i>

983
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:46,302
Now, Carly! Open the fucking door!

984
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:50,181
Come on,
open this cocksucking door, now!

985
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:53,717
Open up! Come on!

986
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:57,884
Open up the fucking door, Carly, now!

987
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:21,707
You like to watch? Watch this.

988
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:26,214
Carly! No, stop!

989
01:40:34,895 --> 01:40:36,487
Those women meant nothing to me.

990
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:39,093
It was just sex, Carly.

991
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:42,893
I love you.

992
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,344
That was the past.

993
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:56,174
What we have is so powerful, Carly.
Can't you feel it?

994
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:58,783
It feels so good.

995
01:41:00,187 --> 01:41:01,779
You can feel it, can't you?

996
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,287
Give me the gun, Carly.

997
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:13,791
I love you, Carly.

998
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:50,596
Carly!

999
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,904
Carly, please! Please don't!

1000
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:59,007
Carly, please don't!

1001
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,407
Carly!

1002
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:12,124
Get a life.
