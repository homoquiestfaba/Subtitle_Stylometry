1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,668
How do you want me?

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,143
Right here?

3
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,824
NO!
PLEASE!

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,757
Sorry, that was crap. Can I
go again?

5
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,895
NO!

6
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,899
PLEASE! PLEASE!

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,831
(Screaming)

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,497
Again?

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,206
No, it's fine.

10
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,938
It's just that these are
really tight.

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,142
Please don't kill me.

12
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,011
Please don't kill me.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,712
Hey, wait.

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,014
(Starting chainsaw)

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,405
What are you doing?

16
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,077
What is that for?

17
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,716
What the fuck is this?

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,550
(Chainsaw and screaming)

19
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,245
Untie me right now.
I'M SERIOUS.

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,155
NO! PLEASE!
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME, NO!

21
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,091
(Screaming)

22
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,901
(Music)

23
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,278
(Music)

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,370
(Music)

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
(Music)

26
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,756
NO! PLEASE!

27
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,795
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME! NO!

28
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,570
PLEASE! NO!

29
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,532
STOP!

30
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,568
That's what I'm talking about.
Cut.

31
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,644
(Giggling)

32
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,743
You okay?

33
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,584
Great job, baby.
- Thank you babe.

34
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,551
You're amazing.

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,779
What are you doing?

36
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,924
Will you quit fucking around,
dude? Seriously.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,620
Well, my dream is

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,022
to go down as one of the
greatest filmmakers
that ever lived.

39
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,564
That's my dream.

40
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,559
I don't want to do what other
people have done.

41
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,291
It's boring. You know?

42
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,197
Something new, something
original.

43
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,129
Something a little bit
disgusting.

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,033
Albeit, but...

45
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,895
At the same time, it'll be
groundbreaking,

46
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,904
and you know, that's basically
it: to own the world.

47
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,896
Nothing more, nothing less.

48
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,738
I'm a humble guy.

49
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,583
Uncuff me right now.
I'm serious.

50
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,579
NO! PLEASE!

51
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,611
What is this for?
- Food Network.

52
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,417
(Screaming)

53
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,579
It ain't real.

54
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,317
It's not playing real enough.

55
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,223
FUCK, man. This ain't gonna
work.

56
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,015
So why don't we just cut away?

57
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,586
We can't cut away.

58
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,364
It we cut away, it'll look
produced.

59
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,093
It's got to play in one take.

60
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,357
Look.

61
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,196
Her fuckin' arm doesn't even
come unattached.

62
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,901
So we go again, then.

63
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,302
All right, so we throw a filter
on it, make it look like 8MM.

64
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,035
We'll take out the frames we
don't want,

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,770
put a digital cigar burn in
the corner.

66
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,505
Make it look like
we're changing reels.

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,310
You know what? We'll grayscale.

68
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,912
No... no, no, no.

69
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,653
De-saturate. We'll de-saturate.

70
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,549
If we pull down the color,

71
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,151
it's gonna make up for the fact
that our fuckin' blood looks
like tomato juice.

72
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,619
Eagle flew out of the night.

73
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,357
(Bird noises)

74
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,263
Will you quit fuckin' around,
mini man?

75
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,555
Seriously.

76
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,126
3, 2, 1.

77
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,903
Hi, I'm Paul Shunley.

78
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,632
And I'm John--

79
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,367
Let's do it again. I'm sorry.

80
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,043
Let's get it right this time.

81
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,940
Can we please? Dude...

82
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,672
Six.
- I'm in the zone.

83
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,738
(Laughing)

84
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,576
Mark, get the fuck out of there.

85
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,312
Go. Let's go.

86
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,817
I'm Thom Yorke.

87
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,318
Oasis, suck it.
- What are you doing?

88
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,917
Mark.

89
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,751
This is it. For real.

90
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,564
Hi, I'm Paul Shunley.

91
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,289
And I'm John Damato.

92
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,085
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like a young--

93
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,926
If we shot it like this?
What if we shot it like this?

94
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,301
We just Hitchcocked...
double Hitchcocked it.

95
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,431
Can we get a wrangler for
John's ego?

96
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,998
You know that this is the shit
they're gonna use on Leno.

97
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,467
Right?
- Mm, mm, mm, mm...

98
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,105
This right here. This is what
they're gonna use.

99
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,910
You would...
- They're not gonna use
the good stuff.

100
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,842
You would select Leno as the
talk show we go on.

101
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,482
Hi, I'm Paul Shunley.

102
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,124
And I'm John Damato.

103
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,849
And we're about to take you
on a journey.

104
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,054
A journey so shocking

105
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,216
that it's going to shake the
very foundation of your soul.

106
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,924
If we're successful in our
attempts,

107
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,386
by the end of this film,

108
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,464
you'll have experienced fear,
hatred, passion,

109
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,403
maybe even sickness,

110
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,398
in a way that's never been
presented before

111
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,030
on the big screen.

112
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,965
It's our intention to take you
inside the mind

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
of one of the earth's most
demented creatures.

114
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,699
On camera,

115
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,407
fully documented look

116
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,209
inside the real life of an
active serial killer.

117
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,311
Now we've just posted our
snuff film.

118
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,114
PHONY snuff film...

119
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,945
And a message...

120
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,051
on a site that's dedicated to...

121
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,493
fans of historical serial
killers.

122
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,519
And the question that
we have is:

123
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,564
Would a real serial killer
frequent a site like this?

124
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,331
And if so,

125
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,829
would that killer consider
sharing real footage of his
murders with us?

126
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,968
Let the games begin.

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,640
And now...

128
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,338
we wait.

129
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,907
John?

130
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,505
Yeah. One second, baby.

131
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,447
I love you. I'm gonna make you
famous. Just give me a second.

132
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,122
My relationship with John is
really good.

133
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,151
I mean, we're, you know...

134
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,886
on the same path.

135
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,433
We kind of both are really into
films and stuff.

136
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,189
I mean, he's more into the
horror genre.

137
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,198
But I think he's wonderful.

138
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,200
But, you know, sometimes it...

139
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,932
gets a little rough.

140
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,137
He's really, really dedicated
to his work.

141
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,099
And, you know, sometimes...

142
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,608
he...

143
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,911
forgets...

144
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,682
that I exist.

145
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,210
Don't worry about me, guys.

146
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,305
I'll just take a shower or set
myself on fire.

147
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,047
Love you, baby.

148
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,022
I met John in 7th grade

149
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,321
at McArthur McArthur Middle
School

150
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,193
when he saved me

151
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,921
from a

152
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,987
larger gentleman who was beating
me up at the time

153
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,756
for my lunch money...

154
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,195
which, that dude's loss,
because...

155
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,600
I grew up rich and I bought my
lunch with credit cards.

156
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,974
So...

157
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,302
Not gonna steal my identity in
7th grade.

158
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,007
I run the camera.

159
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,739
It's what I do.
It's my milieu.

160
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,006
I like to work on a lot of
cameras.

161
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,913
Lots of cameras.
Just give me...

162
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,305
You know,
just throw me a camera,
and I will use it.

163
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,049
So...

164
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,245
And I think they respect it.
They definitely respect it.

165
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,617
When I... tell them... things.

166
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:04,891
Paul.

167
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,885
He's witty. He's really witty,
you know?

168
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,557
I mean...

169
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,056
Sometimes he's just talking,
you know.

170
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,125
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get what you're saying.
I get what you're saying."

171
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,596
But I DON'T get
what he's saying.

172
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,895
At all.

173
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,606
I'm happy with everything
we've done.

174
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,568
I mean, why wouldn't I be?
I run the camera.

175
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,507
I mean, you have your art.
I'll have my art.

176
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,053
Some say my art's more,
I mean...

177
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,978
What if I didn't turn the
camera on?

178
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,424
You wouldn't be there.

179
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,219
Check, check. Check.

180
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,591
Hey Mark, cover that camera
better, dude.

181
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,621
I can't keep you in frame if I
cover it better, alright?

182
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,886
I'll get you a pygmy lift.
Just keep up.

183
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,885
Thanks. I get it. I'm small for
my age.

184
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,827
Gary.
- Haystack.

185
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,632
Hey. What are you guys doing
here? Mark?

186
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,604
John.

187
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,936
Hey John, what are you doing
in here?

188
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,898
Just getting my mail, Gary.

189
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,567
You guys can't film in here,
John.

190
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,605
We're not filming in here.
Mark's outside.

191
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,941
I can see Mark. He's got a
camera outside in the bag.

192
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,706
I don't want any filming
outside.

193
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,575
I don't want any filming
inside.

194
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,653
You guys have got to go. You
almost cost me my job last time.

195
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,122
Okay?

196
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,950
I need to get you guys out of
here. I'm locking up.

197
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,915
You know, what are you guys
getting into anyway?

198
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,894
It has nothing to do with
United States Post Office

199
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,392
or me, my friend...
- Rubix cube, too easy for me...

200
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,933
We'll just keep it that way,
okay?

201
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,829
Get us all killed, you...

202
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,401
OH SHIT.

203
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,904
Got five more.

204
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,606
Stop the presses.

205
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,308
What have we got?
- Let's see.

206
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,209
We've got hardcore bondage.

207
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,211
We have softcore bondage.

208
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,013
Run of the mill bondage.

209
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,905
We've got old men satisfying
donkeys.

210
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,747
Dick. Ass.

211
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,523
Titties. More titties.

212
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,048
Even more titties. The most
titties you've ever seen.

213
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,363
I think this one's actually
your mom.

214
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,789
Sir Cocks A Lot.

215
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,094
Cocks Mania.

216
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,585
Cocks A Plenty.

217
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,527
Fuck.

218
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,429
Got to be something.

219
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,099
Useless.

220
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,774
Garbage.
- What?

221
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,143
What's this?

222
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,069
Huh...

223
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,313
No return address.

224
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,912
Let me see it.

225
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,714
Man, this is... this is
ridiculous.

226
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,316
Like anybody's sending us
documented proof of a murder.

227
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,693
Am I Evil 66?

228
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,585
What?

229
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,991
Screen name.

230
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,733
I'll just be over here on the
edge of my seat.

231
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,928
This has got to be something,
man.

232
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,502
Big money.

233
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,465
(Exhales)

234
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,343
Something, baby.

235
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,341
(Music from video)

236
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,691
Sweet. More bondage.

237
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,856
It is pretty sweet.

238
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,834
What?

239
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,304
It takes guts to do art.

240
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,072
What the fuck was that?

241
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,335
I mean, really do art.

242
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,042
None of that passive aggressive
sculpting and painting

243
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,014
of inanimate objects.

244
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,282
I'm talking human art,
living art.

245
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,881
Art you can feel.

246
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,854
I'm going to show you beauty
like you've never seen.

247
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,024
Act for me, princess.

248
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,952
Show me what you got.
- (Muffled shrieking)

249
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,988
This is our creation,
our movie.

250
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,863
Shh! Look at the camera.

251
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,225
This is our 15 minutes of
fame.

252
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,034
This is our only chance

253
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,032
to create something real in
this world full of shit.

254
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,936
Are you ready for your
close-up?

255
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,868
(Screaming)

256
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,982
(Solid beep)

257
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,213
The hell was that, man?

258
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,145
Does this guy think that
shit's funny?

259
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,918
He can't go fuckin' with
peoples' lives like that.

260
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,750
I'm sure those screams are
fake.

261
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,615
I'm talking about us, you
jackass!

262
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,293
About our careers.
- Wait.

263
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,192
I thought we might've had
something.

264
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,994
Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

265
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,026
What? You'd be happier if
someone got killed?

266
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,301
Yeah.

267
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,199
NO, MAN! No, but...

268
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,401
You know, you just can't go
fuckin' with people like that.

269
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,103
Fuckin', how many of these
tapes do we got to watch?

270
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,136
Tape after tape after tape.

271
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,141
These people are just flat
out lying.

272
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,213
Yeah, and the movie we posted
was REAL honest!

273
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,682
Whatever, dude.

274
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,380
I'm GLAD it's probably fake.

275
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,911
Me too!

276
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,847
You know what? That's because
you're both pussies. Alright?

277
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,950
I'm going home.

278
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,954
At least the pussy there is
female.

279
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,686
Yeah, do me a favor.

280
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,461
Try not to kill anyone on your
way out.

281
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,389
If it gets me famous, I just
might.

282
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,194
(Static)

283
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,896
I don't know how to work this
fuckin' thing.

284
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,698
What the fuck are we even
talking about in there?

285
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,500
Is it real? Is it not real?

286
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,931
Who gives a fuck?

287
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,997
The bottom line is,
nobody killed anybody.

288
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,135
Nobody's sending us any fuckin'
footage of real murders.

289
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,841
The guys are just being pussies
right now.

290
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,913
And they're trying to fuck with
my 15 minutes of fame actually.

291
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,941
I mean, if we're gonna stick
to the fuckin' logic

292
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,637
that these guys are using...

293
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,578
Filmed executions, right?
Kill the executioner.

294
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,423
Every journalist that's ever

295
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,218
photographed a war, right...

296
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,520
They should go to prison.

297
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,918
This is Mr. Turtle.

298
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,886
Looks like a nice guy,

299
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,685
but when he sees the bait,

300
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,696
he becomes a monster.

301
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,498
Honey, zoom in on us.

302
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,030
Babe.
- Yes?

303
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,925
Where's the zoom button?

304
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,997
Can you not play with the
camera right now?
- Babe.

305
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,106
I have your next star.

306
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,038
Let's see what John's doing.

307
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,581
(Singing Jaws theme song)

308
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,481
Seriously. Come on.
- RAWR!

309
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,023
Okay?
- (Giggling)

310
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,918
Can you not tape right now?
Seriously.

311
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,650
Baby, come on. What are you
doing?

312
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,394
Are you still looking at
submissions?

313
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,990
But this is what people do
with their time, I mean.

314
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,892
Babe, I think you should turn
that off and hang out with me.

315
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,294
I'll be in there shortly.

316
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,025
I got like this, a few more
envelopes to go through.

317
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,000
Then I'm done for the night.
- Baby, come on.

318
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,899
Who is this?
- Are you kidding?

319
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,901
Who are these guys? Do you
remember these guys?

320
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,273
Please!

321
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,900
God, you're a fucking asshole.
- Callie, come back.

322
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,466
On the computer...

323
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,373
Staring at people dying.
- Working!

324
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,305
Hey, John. I love you.

325
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,681
Please!

326
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,050
Who the fuck even thinks of
this shit?

327
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,223
What is this guy talking about?

328
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,152
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

329
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,887
Waste my fuckin' time.

330
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,462
I'd bang her.

331
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,060
Nothing. No address.

332
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,759
Monkeys fuckin'.

333
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,704
Ass House Productions.

334
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,400
Animated assholes.

335
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,572
This is death by fuckin' DVD.

336
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,371
To my mother.

337
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,313
This is... this is from my
mother.

338
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,672
Not watching this. Not watching
this.

339
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,835
Four hours.

340
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,707
Two more.

341
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,284
I'm done...

342
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,053
I have a box of confetti.

343
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,722
Very pretty confetti.

344
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,517
And I will use it

345
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,252
in something.

346
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,918
(Beeping)

347
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,586
(Music)

348
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,209
(Music)

349
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,334
(Static)

350
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,886
Is your mic on?

351
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,598
Yeah. I don't understand why
you always make me wear it.

352
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,600
It's what we do, baby.

353
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,302
It's what we do.

354
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,404
Do they have to hear everything
that we do?

355
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,936
Oooh, John.

356
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,571
Your new boyfriend is cute.

357
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,380
Somebody didn't go home last
night.

358
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,108
Nice clothes.

359
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,914
Nice job stating the obvious.

360
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,406
Come look at this.

361
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,917
I've got to go.

362
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,479
You just got here.

363
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,316
This is some sick shit, John.

364
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,392
I don't know what you guys
plan on doing with this,

365
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,320
but I don't want anything to
do with it.

366
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,260
What's your problem?

367
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,832
(Sighs)

368
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,364
Anyway, come look at this.

369
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,396
So you remember the tape with
the flickers?

370
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,301
The guy with the pantyhose
on his head?

371
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,003
Am I Evil 66?

372
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,735
Yeah, he crushed your dreams.
I remember.

373
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,310
Whatever. The tape was rigged,
bro.

374
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,908
It was rigged.

375
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,910
We got ourselves a certified
fuckin' whack job.

376
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,242
Alright? And a pretty damn
creative one at that.

377
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,008
He didn't seem all that
creative to me.

378
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,777
Ah, before you go
judging the guy,

379
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,793
the more I watched the tape,
the more I started to notice
a pattern.

380
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,588
About every six frames or so,
it would jump.

381
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,361
So I went through,
and took them out,

382
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,190
and spliced them back together.

383
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,585
Nice job, Kubrick.
- Yeah, seriously.

384
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,527
Should we get out of here
before he starts splicing us
together?

385
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,073
Just watch the tape, Dumb
and Dumber.

386
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,944
I'm really glad to see that
you cracked my little code.

387
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,972
I apologize for the ruse,
but it was necessary.

388
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,435
The privilege of seeing my work
is not for just anyone.

389
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,148
It takes a symbiotic sort of
soul

390
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,080
to appreciate true art
in its own time.

391
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,318
Welcome to the real show,
my friends.

392
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,163
Act 1, Scene 1.

393
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,957
(Groaning)

394
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,893
Don't worry. Just relax.

395
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,498
It'll be fine.

396
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,842
(Screaming)

397
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,910
(Saw running)

398
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,409
Not yet.

399
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,311
What did I tell you? You have
to play against the fear.

400
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,083
Wait until I say action.

401
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,848
(Screaming)

402
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,321
Are you ready for
your close-up?

403
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,527
And action.

404
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,128
(Screaming continues)

405
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,506
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

406
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,108
PLEASE!
- Shh...

407
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,910
PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME!

408
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,441
PLEASE!

409
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,048
HELP! HELP!

410
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,951
HELP ME!

411
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:56,952
PLEASE!

412
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,123
(Slap)

413
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,091
Alright, come on.

414
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,990
Come on, baby.
You can do this for me.

415
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,921
Die for me.
You got to die for me.

416
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,586
Alright, this isn't...

417
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,225
Cut. Take 2.

418
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,904
(Flesh packing)

419
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,829
(Groaning)

420
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,666
Alright.

421
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,541
Just come on, baby. I need you
to look at the camera too.

422
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,582
Alright. This isn't working
for me.

423
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,877
We're gonna have to try
something different.

424
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,264
Oh, this is good.

425
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,059
We're gonna do a two shot.

426
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,400
(Screaming)
- GOD!

427
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,331
(Beeping)

428
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,701
(Garbled speech)

429
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,617
You really need to learn to
take direction better.

430
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,364
(Crunching)

431
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,956
Damn.

432
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,331
(Phone ringing)

433
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,876
(Ringing continues)

434
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,252
(Crunching)

435
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,591
God damnit.

436
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,062
Hello?

437
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,127
Hi, Mom.

438
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,129
No. I'm just finishing up
at work.

439
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,995
I'll be there in plenty of time

440
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,944
to watch the show for you.

441
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,609
Yeah, no.

442
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,538
But I really got to finish
up here. Okay?

443
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,043
I love you.

444
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,442
Bye bye.

445
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,984
Jesus Christ.

446
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,682
(Crunching)

447
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,857
(Groans)

448
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,199
(Beeping)

449
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,613
Is that it?

450
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,406
What do you guys
think about that?

451
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,578
I think this is it.

452
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,416
This is our ticket.

453
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,292
Wait. What does that mean?

454
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,990
Does that mean you think it's
real or it's fake?

455
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,759
I don't give a fuck if it is
or if it isn't.

456
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,891
You know, it looks real,
and we didn't make it,

457
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,896
so when we tell people it is...

458
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,598
we're not lyin'.

459
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,300
I mean, it's got to be fake.
It looked kind of fake.

460
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,802
I mean...

461
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,503
The guy looks pretty fuckin'
good, pretty trained, but...

462
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,406
Wait. You saw it, and you said,

463
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,008
"Jackpot, baby!"

464
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,779
And I said I'm worried that
it's real.
- If it's...

465
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,608
And then you said
it's probably fake.

466
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,213
If it's real.
Well, it probably is fake.

467
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,905
If it's real, then we have
something real.

468
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,617
Some whack job sent us a tape.

469
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,649
What did you think we were
gonna get, Paul?

470
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,515
Look, man.

471
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,593
I accept my responsibility for
this in that I asked for this
too.

472
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,192
Okay.
- But we have it now.

473
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,063
And I don't want it.

474
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,862
They're gonna take the fuckin'
tape as evidence, whether it's
real or not.

475
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,464
Then we have nothing.

476
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,156
Why would it be evidence if
it's fake?

477
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,797
Why would it be evidence
if it's fake?
- They have to investigate.

478
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,302
There's no way it's real.
- Don't even film it.

479
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,774
I don't want any...
don't film that.

480
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,472
You're right. We shouldn't have
it.

481
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,514
We should be sitting in this
fuckin' studio

482
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,909
making documentaries on fuckin'
local police departments.

483
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,911
There is nothing that you could
say to me right now

484
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,813
that would make me think that
it's okay

485
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,945
to work on that tape without
bringing it to the police
first.

486
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,850
In the event that it is real,

487
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,319
isn't it our job to expose
this guy?

488
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,022
Is that not our...

489
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,663
Do you want to expose him?

490
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,618
Or do you want to exploit him,
John?

491
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,927
You know what? A little bit of
both never hurt the pocketbook.

492
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,559
You know what I mean?
- Alright.

493
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,104
No. Hey. Look!

494
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,759
No, I understand. You're crazy.

495
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,467
Quit playing all fuckin' high.

496
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,199
Mark, will you please
talk to him?
- Why are you playing all high?

497
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,874
No! Mark, shut up.

498
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,502
I'm being serious, man.

499
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,468
Do you realize what we might
have here?

500
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,306
Yes, I do realize.

501
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,212
I realize that we're looking
at murder in the first,

502
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,913
and we're about to become the
two biggest accessories
since mood rings.

503
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,646
Dude. This is business.

504
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,321
Okay? This is business.

505
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,980
Hey, look. Listen to me.

506
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,917
John, we're not even gonna have
to worry about business
soon enough,

507
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,763
because we're not ever gonna
get a job,

508
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,458
we're not ever gonna see an
ounce of film stock ever again.

509
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,291
Because guess what? No one
hires convicts.

510
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,356
We've got to play this thing
right, Paul.

511
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,295
You know as well as I do
it's all about what sells, okay?

512
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,371
This is...

513
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,129
This is our golden ticket,
Paul.

514
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,197
Don't fuckin' blow this for me,
okay?

515
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,895
Our golden ticket to what?

516
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,667
Hey, look.

517
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,906
If we play this shit right,
Hollywood's gonna be kissing
our asses.

518
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,611
Oh, FUCK Hollywood.
- Fuck Hollywood?

519
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,213
Do you ever drop that act?

520
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,314
We didn't do it. We didn't
kill anyone!

521
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,947
Can you please not film for
once?

522
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,022
Paul... you got to...
Keep filming.

523
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,620
Get away from me.

524
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,192
Am I gonna do this shit myself?

525
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,790
Get away from me.
- Don't.

526
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,492
Don't set up blockades.
- Get away from me.

527
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,264
Paul! Paul! Paul!
Dude, slow down.

528
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,992
Look, listen!

529
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,657
He said she was an actress,
okay?
- If that girl's an actress...

530
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,296
It's all staged!

531
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,000
If that girl's an actress, then
she's the next Meryl Streep.

532
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,872
And last I checked, man,

533
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,041
every next Meryl Streep around
here was on the train to L.A.
or New York.

534
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,909
Look. It's fake.

535
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,908
That's all I'm saying. It's
fake. It has to be.

536
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,640
Like we'd ever get that lucky.
- Excuse me?!

537
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,705
Look, hey! Wrong choice of
words, man.

538
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,784
I'm just saying it's fake.
It has to be.

539
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,783
So you're not even the
slightest bit scared?

540
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,745
It doesn't bother you that we
sent out a message

541
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,423
to send us tapes of murders.

542
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,052
We were sent a tape,

543
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,586
which probably MEANS that
someone murdered someone.

544
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,193
And do you know what that
means?

545
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,894
It means that we're just as
responsible.

546
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,656
No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

547
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,504
And I guarantee you any jury
would agree with me.

548
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,200
I agree. I totally agree.

549
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,101
Just shut up and do your
fuckin' job.

550
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,903
Why do you got to talk to him
like that all the time?

551
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,735
Why did we even set this up?

552
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,110
I mean, did we just do this
whole thing for shits and
giggles?

553
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,709
Enlighten me.

554
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,411
No. I don't know what you...

555
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,913
Or no. How about this?

556
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,654
We're a couple of fuckin'
losers, right?

557
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,609
So our time's not that valuable
anyway. That's what it is.

558
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,581
I don't have daddy's money to
fall back on, all right?

559
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,887
Fuck you. FUCK YOU!

560
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,892
You're pathetic.

561
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,760
I'll do it myself.

562
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,757
I don't fuckin' need you
anyway.

563
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,226
FUCK YOU.

564
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,333
Pussy.

565
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,841
That was some fucked up shit.

566
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,010
I knew there was something
about that fuckin' tape that
was...

567
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,409
Still, it's...

568
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,411
There's no way anybody
sent us in

569
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,913
real footage of fuckin' murders,
but god damn, that guy was good.

570
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,575
The way he...

571
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,584
stuck that hook in her mouth
was...

572
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,589
(Screaming)

573
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,718
What the fuck, Callie?
God damnit.

574
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,253
What the fuck?

575
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,988
What are you doing?

576
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,893
What does it look like I'm
fuckin' doing?

577
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,255
I'm not doing anything now,
because you just fucked my
shit up.

578
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,304
Will you stop?
- All right.

579
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,359
Please.
- Dinner's getting cold.

580
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,098
Dinner's getting...
Okay, I'm coming in.

581
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,903
I'm coming in right now.
Will you move
so I can get out of here?

582
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,895
Why don't you turn the camera
off?

583
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,296
The camera's off.

584
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,667
(Saying Catholic grace)

585
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,553
Say it like you mean it.

586
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,745
Say it so Jesus can hear it.

587
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,347
(Saying Catholic grace)

588
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,894
FROM thy bounty.

589
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,693
Not THROUGH thy bounty.

590
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,763
Maybe I should do something.

591
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,591
What are you gonna do?

592
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,387
I'm gonna take him out in
the back.

593
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,728
That's what I'm gonna do.

594
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:24,933
Mmm...

595
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,301
Where did you get these?

596
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,003
These are really good.

597
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,595
I have to say,

598
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,267
you don't do things right very
often,

599
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,914
but this is good.

600
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,710
I'm gonna take that away from
you.

601
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,682
I'm drinking too much?
- Yes, you are.

602
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,450
You are an alcoholic.

603
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,209
Well, I can control it. You
can't.

604
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,948
I can control it.

605
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,953
I can stop any time I want to.

606
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,585
The minute I come in the house,
you start drinking.

607
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,561
I don't even know what you're
doing before.

608
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,590
I'm slaving here in the house.

609
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,285
Sit up straight!

610
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,626
If you don't behave,

611
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,132
if you don't do
what your mom says...

612
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,504
Okay,

613
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,502
you're not even gonna get
any bread.

614
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,304
Why does he have any bread?

615
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,935
Did you give him that bread?

616
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,611
Stop playing with your food.

617
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,309
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

618
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,910
Don't speak to me like that!

619
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,912
I hate you! I wish you would
die! Just shut up!

620
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,854
(Laughing)

621
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,547
You're both a disgrace to me.

622
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,849
A disgrace.

623
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,091
You make me sick.

624
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,086
It takes a symbiotic sort of
soul

625
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,985
to appreciate true art

626
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,857
in its own time.

627
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,099
Welcome to the real show,
my friends. Act 1, Scene 1.

628
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,402
Wake up, psycho.

629
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,903
(Crashing)

630
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,565
What the fuck?

631
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,274
Did you forget how to call
home?
- I was out with Paul.

632
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,305
This is what you stayed out
for?

633
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,410
Why are you watching this
again?

634
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,482
Yes. And because...

635
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,511
Yes, because it's my job,
Honey Bunny.

636
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,916
Okay?

637
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,648
And because,
the shit's fake, bro.

638
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,123
I've figured it out.
You've got to see this.

639
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,391
John.

640
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,889
You just have to listen to me
too sometimes.

641
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,621
All right?
- That's fair enough.

642
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,433
I mean, I know I can be an
ass sometimes,

643
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,532
and...

644
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm sorry.

645
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,859
I'm sorry too.

646
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,697
We're being set up, man.

647
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,103
The guy's a filmmaker and he's
using us to make him famous.
- You think?

648
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,795
John, I need to talk to you.
- Why not?

649
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,907
I mean, what kind of idiot
would send out tapes

650
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,809
of himself killing people?

651
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,411
It doesn't make sense.

652
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,142
You know, no one's that stupid.

653
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,907
And look.
- What have you got?

654
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,506
Watch. It cuts.

655
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,948
It cuts, dude.

656
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,023
If it was real, it would have
to play in one take.

657
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,552
And watch this.

658
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,920
Fake blood.

659
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,886
The guy uses fake blood...
- John, I was trying to
talk to you.

660
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,664
...to cover the head kick gag.

661
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,263
I mean, dude...

662
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,034
He's a filmmaker.

663
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,133
And he's trying to make a mark
just like us.

664
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,896
And he figures if he can
dupe us

665
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,604
into convincing the world that
this is real...

666
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,196
When it comes out
that it's not,

667
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,007
we look like shit,
and he gets...

668
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,709
A ton of publicity
for tricking us.

669
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,141
Exactly!

670
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,776
He gets famous.

671
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,581
Yeah, but...
even with the fake blood,

672
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,212
and all the cuts...

673
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,877
What about that bat?

674
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,616
Paul, Paul. Listen, man.

675
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,991
The guy's stacking up the
evidence with these tapes.

676
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,120
Now, he may be psychotic,

677
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,185
but he's obviously not stupid.

678
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,894
Alright, now look.

679
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,896
I'm in no mood to be watching
a real live human being

680
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,498
die over and over again,

681
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,359
And I know what you're gonna
say. I'm beating a dead horse.

682
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,128
If it's real, straight to the
cops. No questions asked.

683
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,896
We get this sick fuck sent
where he belongs.
- All right, fuck it.

684
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,765
Jail.
- Mark, do you want to go
have sex?

685
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,514
We get the fed interview.
You're not going anywhere.

686
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,208
You're just ignoring me.

687
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,910
Fine.
- Callie, come on.

688
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,682
You see I'm busy. Baby.

689
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,851
Baby, wait.
- Get away from me.

690
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,008
Will you slow down? Please?
- No.

691
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,146
No.

692
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,780
Come on!
- Leave me alone.

693
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,316
Look, I'm sorry.
- We need to get this.

694
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,950
On a roll.
- You're always sorry.

695
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,885
I'm sorry.
Baby, please. please.

696
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,561
Please, stop. Stop!
- Okay. Okay.

697
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,088
I'm stopped.
- Okay.

698
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,194
(Arguing behind camera)

699
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,257
You've got to get this.
- I'm trying!

700
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,925
You're not really listening.
- Yeah, I am listening.

701
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,704
I want us to be cool.

702
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,503
It's cool. I'm gonna go home.
Okay?

703
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,204
When you're ready to take a
shower, come home.

704
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,136
Oh, sure.
Pull the shower card on me.
That's messed up.

705
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,735
I can't believe I let you talk
me into this.

706
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,435
Oh, here we go.

707
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,506
When we get in there,
don't say anything specific
about the film.

708
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,875
Yeah. No shit.

709
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,053
Yeah, like no insider stuff,
no expose...

710
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,922
Just get what we need and go.
- Dude.

711
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,621
It's not a big deal.
It's an interview.

712
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,122
I'm sure they do them all
the time.
- Oh yeah.

713
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,994
Because kids are always
shooting documentaries about

714
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,922
social deviants who send them
snuff films in the mail.

715
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,488
You're retarded.

716
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,985
You're "brilliant".

717
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,897
Hey, the guard booth.

718
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,869
Just film this shit, okay?

719
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,398
Can I help you?

720
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,502
Yeah. We're here to see
Special Agent Morris.

721
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,504
And you are?
- Cattle Drive Productions.

722
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,136
Oh, right, right. The film guys.
- Right.

723
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,912
Make sure you check your gear
in at the front desk.

724
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,510
Yeah. No doubt.

725
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,511
Hey, Mark. He wants you to
check your gear.

726
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,213
I check it twice a day!

727
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,905
You guys are children.

728
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,847
Yeah, come on in. Which one
of you is...

729
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,623
I talked to who? Paul?
- That's me. Paul.

730
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,390
We talked on the phone.

731
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,019
Agent Morris. Nice to meet you.
You are...
- John Damato.

732
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,794
John. And you've got to be
Henry then.
- This is Mark.

733
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,663
You bringing in...
you going to use all this stuff?

734
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,661
Sorry about that.
- No, no, no. Bring it all in.

735
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,603
Where do you want me to go?
What do you want me to do?

736
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,829
The preponderance of serial
killers are white males from
middle class families.

737
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,903
76% of all documented cases

738
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,835
have been abused,

739
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,640
or suffered some sort of trauma
or abuse as children.

740
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,207
What can you tell us about
their intelligence?

741
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,912
Oh, well...

742
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,654
Most of the cases I study,

743
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,648
I find them to be very
intelligent.

744
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,020
Yeah.

745
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,119
See, that's the funny thing
about serial killers.

746
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,921
They appear to be normal.

747
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,553
They could be educated.

748
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,287
They could be family men.

749
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,193
They could come from good
homes.

750
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:20,885
But the thing is...

751
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,297
But they're still murderers,
nonetheless.

752
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,129
Well, yeah,
but they're more than that.

753
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,902
They're the archetypal misfits.

754
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,904
They're unsuccessful in life.

755
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,936
In some measure,
they've failed.

756
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,941
So... unsatisfied with their
place in life,

757
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,944
they turn to death.

758
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,806
It's the only arena where they
can feel in complete control.

759
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,146
So their only success is the
murders that they commit?

760
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,221
No, no, no.

761
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,590
No. Murder is not the ultimate
success.

762
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,488
These people brutalize their
victims.

763
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,420
The serial killer prefers
the...

764
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,393
the sadistic, hands-on

765
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,385
stabbing and mauling

766
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,097
and mutilating.

767
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,659
And then-- And then,

768
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,397
there's the ultimate thrill.

769
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,802
The real success is eluding
the police,

770
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,895
until, by their own admission,

771
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,707
they're caught.

772
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,568
By their... by their own
admission?

773
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,137
Right.

774
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,576
See, then it's fame.

775
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:14,048
It's the details of the
adventure.

776
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,450
It's the... real life horror

777
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,822
of what they, in the end,

778
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,891
wind up exposing millions of
people to.

779
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,621
Now, the movies,

780
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,115
or whatever it is
you guys do...

781
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,127
Well, you glamorize these
people.

782
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,130
And you turn them into
fictionalized onscreen heroes.

783
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,867
A real killer is something
so,

784
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,906
so much more terrifying.

785
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,939
All the effects in the world

786
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,914
cannot simulate the feeling
you get

787
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,843
when you're walking down the
aisle of death row,

788
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:49,145
and looking true soulless evil
in the eyes.

789
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,922
So, is that ever disturbing?

790
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,921
Or frightening to you?

791
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,653
Being so close to something
so demented?

792
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,417
Yeah, sure, sure.
Yeah. Very much so.

793
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,293
So you would say these killers
are out for recognition?

794
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,256
Ultimately, yes.

795
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,304
But isn't that
counterproductive?

796
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,700
I mean, doesn't society tend
to loathe these men?

797
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,402
Do they?

798
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,104
We write books about them.

799
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,796
We make movies about them.

800
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,607
They even have fan clubs.
- Exactly.

801
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,339
How do you spot one?

802
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,684
Short answer. You don't.

803
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,046
See, that's what makes these
people so dangerous.

804
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,979
They're not the boogey man.

805
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,224
They're not the monster under
your bed.

806
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,950
They're your friends, your
neighbors,

807
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,986
your father, your brother,

808
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,891
your husband.

809
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,623
Hell, it could be you.
Could be me.

810
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,585
(Static)
Oh no...

811
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,396
Sorry. Sorry.

812
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,098
It's alright. I'll take
care of it.

813
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,900
Hey listen, guys. I got to get
back to work anyways.

814
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,802
So, good luck with your movie.
Alright?

815
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,873
No. Just one more question
before we go.

816
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,342
Yeah. Sure.

817
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,907
Aren't these men
just really weak,

818
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,910
pathetic individuals,

819
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,942
looking to obtain power
any way--

820
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,908
the only way, probably--
that they know how.

821
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,746
What is power?

822
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,121
I... I'm not sure I understand
the question.

823
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,820
What do you think power is?

824
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,960
Control, I guess?

825
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,555
Overpowering another
individual.

826
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,885
I guess I don't know exactly.

827
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,597
Yeah. Most people don't.

828
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,759
It's a good question.
Let's see if I can answer it.

829
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,299
True power...

830
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:18,404
is giving the other person the
perception that they have it.

831
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,367
Now a serial killer

832
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,106
will allow people to go through
their daily lives

833
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,212
knowing that the minute he
decides to,

834
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,284
he can change every aspect

835
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,323
of any person's existence

836
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:31,218
that he so chooses.

837
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,950
It's all only allowed at the
discretion

838
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,845
of the people who are not
afraid to kill.

839
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,921
These guys do have the power
and they're quite aware of it.

840
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,756
So...

841
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,991
no, I don't believe that
weak and pathetic

842
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,798
are very accurate descriptions.

843
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,859
Do you?

844
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,404
Thank you for your time,
Agent Morris.

845
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,866
- My pleasure.
- Yes, Agent Morris.

846
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,903
It's been a real pleasure.
- Good luck with your movie.

847
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,608
Thank you very much.

848
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,605
(Music)

849
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,555
We should start making
a documentary about
us playing foosball.

850
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,658
I don't think this is a
regulation table.

851
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,728
Oh, let's get you
on the move.

852
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,400
Some action...
Let's get some action, guys.

853
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,898
Are you going to film AND play?

854
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,370
Oooh!

855
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,369
Red man is suppressed again!

856
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,401
Freebie, just like reservations.

857
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,336
Oh, suck it. One handed.

858
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,211
It's alright. At least
we still got the casinos.

859
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,914
(Music)

860
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,416
Come on!

861
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,618
Hey! Huh?
- What?

862
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,620
Oh, dude, I'm getting some
good stuff here.

863
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,052
I'm going to get you.

864
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,591
Hey, babe,
want to go to the game?

865
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,893
(Music)

866
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,395
Hey! That's valuable tape stock.

867
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,898
Quit fucking around.

868
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,029
Don't go into John's now.
I'm done with you.

869
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,170
(Music)

870
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,651
Just let me try one more thing,
baby.

871
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,222
Hey guys.

872
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,490
Guys, you've got to come see
this.

873
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,989
At the height of a country's
decadence,

874
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,928
lies its ultimate demise.

875
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,965
Why do we choose to do the
things we do?

876
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,935
Because we can.

877
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,505
Because choice makes us a
breed apart.

878
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,642
It gives us power.

879
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,914
A choice to create.

880
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,746
A choice to destroy.

881
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,449
A choice to watch

882
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,751
the world burn.

883
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,955
America has chosen.

884
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,558
I will be the hand.

885
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,069
He's got posts all over this
thing.

886
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,968
There's dozens of these.

887
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,398
This is one deeply disturbed
individual.

888
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,036
What the fuck?

889
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,954
What are you doing?

890
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,920
Game time is over.

891
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,918
Mark, get the sticks.

892
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,420
Get...

893
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,952
Come here.

894
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,787
Do you even know why you're
doing this anymore?
- Yeah.

895
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,492
For the movie.

896
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,494
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

897
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,596
What the hell else would I be
doing it for?

898
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,258
Well, see, why would you have
to say that?

899
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,297
Why would you say that?
That makes me not believe you.

900
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,402
I need you to tell me

901
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,274
that this has nothing to do
with fame.

902
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,213
I need to know that
this is about us

903
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,938
making the best movie
we can make.

904
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,712
Yeah. Yeah.

905
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,309
It is?
- Yes!

906
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,954
It is.

907
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:48,983
All right.

908
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,849
Well...

909
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,589
Anybody who wants to leave...

910
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,121
Leave now.

911
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,861
Will you come back?

912
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,703
Get back here!

913
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,637
Is it real?

914
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,677
Oh yeah,

915
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,352
this is gonna end well.

916
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,664
What does he mean?
The fuckin' body?
- Oh shit!

917
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,125
Here.

918
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,902
What are we doing?

919
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,604
This is ridiculous.

920
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,266
I'm gonna fuck with him.

921
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,965
Yes, John. Do enrage the
disturbed man.

922
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,414
It's not an hour from here.

923
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,046
It's, like, 15 minutes.

924
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,821
Seriously?
- Idiot.

925
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,589
Now the potential homicidal
maniac

926
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,448
thinks we live somewhere other
than where we do.

927
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,599
OH SHIT.

928
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,028
Log off! Log off!

929
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,999
What the fuck just happened?

930
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,731
This is so fucked up.
He knows your name.

931
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,296
What if he knows where we live?

932
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,195
Will everyone calm down and
let me think, please?

933
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,966
(Sighs)

934
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,309
Come on.
- WHAT?

935
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,911
Yeah, what?

936
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,612
We're going.

937
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,314
Oh, fuck that.

938
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,316
I can't even begin to tell you
how much I am NOT going.

939
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,018
There is no way in hell!

940
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,049
Not happening. There's no way.

941
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,754
Well, I am.

942
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,286
If you go, it's over.

943
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:39,092
John, I can't deal with this
shit anymore.

944
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,934
I can't. I'm serious.

945
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,629
You're becoming obsessed.

946
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,659
Guys...

947
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,772
Oh, fuck you.

948
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,241
Come on.

949
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,807
We are not going.

950
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,220
This is insane.

951
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,279
We need confirmation, man.

952
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,188
No. That is what we do NOT
need.

953
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,919
This guy's nuts.
If he knows who we are,

954
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,985
what we NEED is to go to the
cops and talk to Jack.

955
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,793
Yeah. Because he loves us.

956
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,685
That always works out well.

957
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,627
Will you just look for the
ribbon on the...

958
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,430
What's that?

959
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,196
Pull it over. Pull it over.
Pull it over!

960
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,144
(Exhales)

961
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,210
Red ribbon on a tree, baby.

962
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,938
I think it's too dark.

963
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,914
Oh god damn, man.

964
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,712
Quit being such a pussy!

965
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,584
I don't want to be involved
in this.

966
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,153
Well, you are!

967
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,645
Looks like we're all bound
by blood.

968
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,254
Let's go.

969
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,522
I have no idea what that means.

970
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,825
John!

971
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,998
I hate John.

972
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,773
I hate his face.

973
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,642
What part of his face would
you say you hate the most?

974
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,340
The face part.
- Yeah.

975
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,042
John! Yeah!

976
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,743
Will you wait up?

977
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,075
Hurry up!

978
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,810
I hate him because he told me
that Estelle Getty

979
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,045
was actually the youngest of
The Golden Girls.

980
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,380
John!

981
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,046
What is he doing?

982
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,123
I swear to God,
if he's hiding...

983
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,852
I'm gonna kill him.

984
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,685
John?

985
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,194
What the fuck?

986
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,255
Are you back here building a
god damn love nest?

987
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,933
What are you DOING right now?

988
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,202
What am I doing? Just give me
the fuckin' camera.

989
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,731
You are an IDIOT.

990
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,583
Hey, are you guys coming?

991
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,508
Shit.

992
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,392
OH SHIT.

993
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,034
God damnit.

994
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,257
Oh fuck.

995
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,625
Okay.

996
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,397
Alright. Is it...

997
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,903
OH SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK?

998
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,944
(Chuckling)
- Holy shit! Holy shit!

999
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,870
FUCK. FUCK. FUCK!

1000
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,313
OH FUCK.

1001
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,640
He just... he's out here.

1002
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,407
He's out here.
- Who is?

1003
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,479
What?
- Get down.

1004
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,224
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1005
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,878
You're not making any sense.

1006
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,517
Let's just get the...

1007
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,292
Let's go! Let's go!

1008
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,090
Come on, Mark.
- FUCK!

1009
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,692
OH SHIT.
- FUCK.

1010
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,831
OH SHIT.

1011
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,359
FUCK.

1012
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,034
FUCK! COME ON!

1013
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,497
Where the fuck are we?
- Come on, come on!

1014
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,903
Sorry, I saw something
so messed up...
- You are a DICK.

1015
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,395
What'd you see back there?

1016
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,036
That chick,
she was fucked up, man!

1017
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,511
What chick?
- SHE WAS FUCKED UP.

1018
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,710
Dude, you got to settle down
and talk to me!

1019
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,211
I DON'T KNOW! I don't know.

1020
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,212
What the fuck did you get us
into, bro? Marky, are you okay?

1021
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,314
I don't know. What the fuck did
you get us into, man?

1022
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,845
I saw a dead body.
- Alright, man.

1023
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,549
I saw a dead fucking body.
- Just when he gets in here,
you need to let me talk.

1024
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,123
That's fine. That's fine.

1025
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,991
And you need to keep that thing
out of my face.

1026
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,190
I don't want to be part of this
anymore. You will not put that
in my face.

1027
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,261
I thought I suggested

1028
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,189
that you NOT film in here.

1029
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,525
In our defense, it was only a
suggestion.

1030
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,261
A STRONG suggestion.

1031
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,025
Come on, Jack. Posterity.
- Posterity, my ass!

1032
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,034
Look. It's just what we do.
Okay? Can we please talk--

1033
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,596
I understand!

1034
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,895
I know what you do, son. I'm
quite aware of what you do.

1035
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,907
This is quite a bit of work
you've got here, Pauly.

1036
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,569
It's not work. It's murder.

1037
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,307
It's a murder, Jack.

1038
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,912
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1039
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,684
Where'd you get it?
- I told you. I got it in the
mail.

1040
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,382
No letter. No return address.

1041
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,223
No name. Just those tapes.
- No nothing?

1042
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,849
Stop it.

1043
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,524
Where's the envelope?
- See? I told you!

1044
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:28,893
I threw it away.

1045
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,560
I told you you shouldn't have
thrown it away.

1046
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,189
(Silently mouthing)

1047
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,993
Does Larry, Moe and Curly have
anything to do with this?

1048
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,755
Oh, Christ. Seriously, Jack.

1049
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,504
I'm not finished.

1050
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,029
This is serious shit.

1051
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,299
And I need to make sure that
you're on the up and up with
this, man.

1052
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,203
You've got some damn nerve,

1053
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,435
coming in here,
asking for help...

1054
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,912
Where are we supposed to go?

1055
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,680
That's it with that damn
camera.

1056
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,379
Get that camera off. Put it
down! Shut it off!

1057
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,110
Jesus Christ! We've got a video
of a murder! And footage--

1058
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,905
TURN IT OFF!

1059
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,917
GET IT OUT OF HERE!

1060
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,889
You want spend a month in the
hospital? Get it out of here!
Get it out of here!

1061
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,788
Jack, leave him alone!

1062
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,350
(Frantic argument)

1063
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:04,858
Pauly, listen to me!

1064
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,860
Mark, Jack's gonna kick my
ass. Come get this.

1065
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,492
Go get the door. Get the door.

1066
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,596
Those were good cops.

1067
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,559
And you guys twisted that shit.

1068
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,398
You guys flat out lied

1069
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:16,032
until you got one canned,

1070
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,897
a couple demoted,

1071
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:20,906
and one sucking on the wrong
end of a service revolver.

1072
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:22,939
That is serious shit, Pauly.

1073
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,884
You've got to realize that.

1074
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,750
(Static)

1075
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,593
I've seen Ellen around with
Officer Smith.

1076
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,492
And...

1077
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,560
So, what was that look?

1078
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,389
First of all, would you like
to be a part of this movie?

1079
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,294
A movie? Tell me a little bit
more about it.

1080
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,286
Let's just say Officer Smith...

1081
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,258
He likes his afternoon
delights.

1082
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,996
If you know what I'm saying.
- Afternoon?

1083
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,902
They look the other way. None
of us girls get in trouble.

1084
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,374
This is my alley.

1085
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,901
So you see the cameras, right?
- Yeah.

1086
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,637
Do you think you could engage
Officer Smith for us?

1087
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,412
Well, you're gonna pay me,
right?

1088
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,880
Absolutely.

1089
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,508
She said 10 minutes.

1090
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,384
Let's get this fucker.

1091
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,149
Officer Smith.

1092
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,491
Protecting and serving, I see.

1093
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,189
You motherfucker.

1094
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,291
You and your fucking ratfink
crew are dead.

1095
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,293
Do you wanna pull your pants
up when you talk to me or no?

1096
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,185
Because there's criminals on
the street. Are you above the
law?

1097
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,127
It looks like YOU got dicked.
- Not exactly.

1098
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,003
You're dead. Give me that
fucking camera. GIMME THE...

1099
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,931
Don't look over your shoulder,
buddy.

1100
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,567
You're fuckin' dead.

1101
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,071
You're fuckin' dead.

1102
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,506
You want a quote?

1103
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,508
I'm gonna give you one!

1104
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,610
Right between my eyes! Look in
front of this!

1105
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,383
If that wasn't my nephew,

1106
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,581
and this degenerate wasn't his
friend...

1107
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:39,021
There's a good chance they'd
both be on the back of a milk
carton.

1108
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,650
How's that for you?

1109
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,286
Real professional, sir...

1110
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,360
Shut up. Have you been on your
medication?

1111
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,889
Yes.

1112
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,834
I want a urine report from you
tomorrow. You understand?

1113
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,699
I want you peeing in a cup.
Do you understand?

1114
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,658
We got to get out of here.
- Just shoot!

1115
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,197
Just get in here.
- HEY!

1116
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,901
Get the fuck back! Turn that
fucking camera off!

1117
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,503
It's off.

1118
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:57,874
What the fuck did I just say?

1119
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,006
(Frantic argument)

1120
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,843
(Frantic argument)

1121
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,336
Get that camera off!

1122
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,978
Dude, we almost caused a
fuckin' riot.

1123
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:12,021
Zoom in. Zoom in. Zoom in.

1124
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,150
No, I'm on him. Can you hear
him?

1125
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,615
At all?
- Nope.

1126
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,021
Paul, are you getting this?

1127
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,126
Mark, Mark. Tuck that camera in
the bag, but keep it running.

1128
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,128
We didn't mean for this
to happen.
- Jack, listen. Listen.

1129
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,200
Please, please, listen.
- But you saw the tape
with your own eyes!

1130
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,129
You know that it's not bullshit.
You saw the tape yourself.

1131
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,204
All right. Don't give me that!

1132
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,373
You guys know better than
anyone else

1133
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,901
that what you see on camera is
rarely what it really is.

1134
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:34,408
Oh Christ!

1135
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,614
(Sighs)

1136
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:38,982
This is real.

1137
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,320
Show me the body.

1138
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,192
Your uncle Jack beat us.

1139
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,290
Well, yeah. This better be the
real deal,

1140
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,892
because he came out here.

1141
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,664
Who's your daddy?
- Right there!

1142
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,232
Right there! Right there!
- Oh, tight.

1143
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,530
With all due respect,
Uncle Jack...

1144
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,425
Right there.
- What did I tell you?

1145
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,197
Jerry, stay with the car.
- You sure, man?

1146
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,035
Yeah. Stay with the car.
- All right.

1147
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,911
Well, lead the way.
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

1148
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,009
Let's go, partner.
- Partner!

1149
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,911
Don't partner me.

1150
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,853
It's just around this bend.

1151
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,920
Come on, you guys.

1152
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,918
She might get up and fuckin'
leave. I'm serious.

1153
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,920
I don't think this was the
way, man.

1154
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,822
This is the way.
It's down here.

1155
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,324
Where?
- Right down here.

1156
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,025
It was right there.

1157
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,800
God damnit, Pauly.
- I swear!

1158
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,899
I swear it was there!
- Jack.

1159
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,631
Right there.

1160
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,703
John. No more.
- Look.

1161
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,404
Alright? I don't want to here
any more.
- Hey, Jack.

1162
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,306
Look what I got here.
- What?

1163
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,208
That's my flashlight.

1164
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,910
That's... this is my
flashlight.

1165
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,512
I dropped it when I saw the
body.

1166
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,283
I told you I wasn't lying.
I told you!

1167
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,112
Where's the body?
- It was right here.

1168
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,877
Right where I dropped it.
- Um, guys...

1169
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,416
Holy shit!

1170
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,220
I don't know how that got
there, Jack.

1171
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,252
You see? That ribbon wasn't
there.

1172
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,887
It was right across the river.

1173
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,833
It was tied on the tree by the
body.

1174
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:01,488
God damn! He's fuckin' with us.

1175
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:03,086
It's syrup.

1176
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,698
You are worthless.
- No, no.

1177
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,099
That's bullshit.

1178
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,771
FUCK.
- Oh Jesus.

1179
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,429
Get the fuck out of here.

1180
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,538
The fuck is this?

1181
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:14,207
(Frantic argument)

1182
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,309
SHUT UP!

1183
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,380
What the hell is this?

1184
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:20,208
Am I on the World's Most
Stupidest Cop or something?

1185
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,305
Why do you guys keep doing
this?

1186
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:25,017
Are you PURPOSELY trying to
RUIN my career?

1187
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,920
We're screwed.
- Wait! Where are you going?

1188
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,892
Don't forget your girlfriend.

1189
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,590
It's probably the only pussy
that would tolerate you
scumbags.

1190
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,592
Set up some more cops.
- IT WAS REAL!

1191
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,294
He must have moved the body.

1192
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,026
Save it, Pauly.

1193
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,902
I don't want to see you until
the holidays.

1194
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,200
Don't come down to the station
or I'll have you all arrested.

1195
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:42,902
Family or not.

1196
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:44,704
That goes for you too, Pixie.

1197
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,765
It's a good thing your father's
not around to see what

1198
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,414
an over ambitious,

1199
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,509
lying scumbag you've become.

1200
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,141
It's a damn shame, son.

1201
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,247
Thank you.

1202
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,476
JOHN!

1203
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:59,415
Body hunting, Pauly.

1204
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,189
FUCK.

1205
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,616
FUCK.

1206
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,057
Damnit!

1207
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,569
(Static beep)

1208
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,770
Marcus?

1209
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,195
Coming.

1210
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,939
Coming.

1211
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,254
(Leaves crunching)

1212
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,194
Detective Stanley.

1213
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,090
Yes, Jack Stanley.

1214
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,592
I'm his nephew.

1215
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:41,187
What? What about dogs?

1216
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,826
No dogs?

1217
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,131
What? Is the canine union on
a strike right now?

1218
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,903
You know, man...

1219
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,502
These cops.

1220
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,203
Always around to write you a
ticket.

1221
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,895
They're never around when you
need them.

1222
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:53,737
Will you stop watching that,
please?

1223
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,939
Looking for clues.

1224
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,044
What are you? Nancy fuckin'
Drew now?

1225
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:00,046
I like to think of myself more
like Scooby Doo.

1226
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,948
Does that make me Shaggy?
- Scooby Doo...

1227
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,920
I guess I'm Scrappy then.

1228
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:05,619
No. You're more of a Velma.

1229
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,720
Yeah. Definitely Velma.
- I'm alright with that.

1230
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:09,652
Do you think I made it up?
- No.

1231
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,324
I don't.

1232
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,933
What do we do next?

1233
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,590
I don't know.

1234
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,298
That chick's head was all
caved in, man.

1235
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,000
(Strange music)

1236
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,232
What?

1237
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,500
Sorry?

1238
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,507
What for?

1239
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,880
I don't know.

1240
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:32,782
Ask him.

1241
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,916
He knows about the cops?

1242
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,864
Because he was probably out
there the whole time.

1243
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,429
One time appearance.

1244
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,401
What?

1245
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,403
I don't know.

1246
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,195
I don't know.

1247
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,907
Answer him.
- He's impatient.

1248
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,316
Tell him his videos suck.

1249
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,621
What?
- Yeah.

1250
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,192
Tell him he's not living up
to our standards,

1251
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,891
and he's been nothing but a
huge disappointment.

1252
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,592
I don't want to piss him off,
man.

1253
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,964
Come on.
- Alright.

1254
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,234
For the love of God.

1255
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,636
Constructive criticism.

1256
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,238
That wasn't clear enough.

1257
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,240
So...

1258
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:39,943
Gotcha.

1259
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,907
Persistent and nuts.

1260
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,546
You think?

1261
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,894
We have no contract.

1262
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,639
Damnit.

1263
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,079
What if it's a 13 year old
girl?

1264
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:18,852
(Phone ringing)

1265
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,354
Hello?

1266
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,122
OH SHIT.

1267
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,487
IT'S HIM!

1268
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,096
IT'S HIM!

1269
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,728
What the fuck's going on?
- Hello? Uh huh.

1270
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,132
Alright.

1271
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,831
He said turn on the computer!

1272
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:40,208
Dude, this guy knows every
fuckin' thing about us.

1273
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,038
The least he could do is
introduce himself.

1274
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,773
Get in tight.
- I am!

1275
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,414
(Clicking)

1276
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:50,476
I'm gonna check the fuse box.

1277
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,315
I'll come with you.

1278
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,780
Hurry.

1279
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,763
(Moaning)

1280
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,791
Yeah. Right there.

1281
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:05,898
Number 13.
- Man...

1282
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,500
13?

1283
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,332
I don't know what's going on,
man. The power's out.

1284
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,697
How could the power be out?

1285
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,336
(Clicking)

1286
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,341
Dude.

1287
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,140
What the fuck just happened
with the lights?

1288
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:20,306
This shit is real, and he's
fuckin' with us.

1289
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:21,945
Alright, we got to go.

1290
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,709
We'll go to... the FBI.

1291
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,378
God damnit.
- Morse.

1292
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,916
Morris. He'll help us.
- Morris!

1293
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,551
We're so fucked, bro.

1294
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,616
Look man, we just got to go
to the cops. Okay?

1295
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,285
And turn him in. We don't have
a choice.

1296
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,993
What if he's trying to set
us up, bro?

1297
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,894
I can't go to fuckin' jail!
- He knows who we are.

1298
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,896
He knows our names. I just
wanted to make a movie, man.

1299
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,828
Well, this ain't a fuckin'
movie, man.

1300
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,404
This is real.

1301
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,202
And we're involved whether
we like it or not.

1302
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:46,996
What the fuck?

1303
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,637
It's midnight.

1304
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:50,313
Just turn off the lights.

1305
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,211
I mean, should I still tape
or what?
- Hell yes!

1306
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,583
Evidence.

1307
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,614
Who is it?

1308
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,650
Police.

1309
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,152
Oh shit. What do they want?

1310
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:00,594
I don't know.
- Up, up.

1311
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,518
Paul Shamely, John Damato.

1312
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,663
It's Shunley, but...

1313
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,119
Whatever.
- And Mark, the all forgotten
cameraman.

1314
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,987
Is something wrong, sir?

1315
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:10,025
No, somebody just called.

1316
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,100
Said they saw a prowler around
the building.

1317
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,029
I looked. Nobody here.

1318
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,904
You expecting someone?

1319
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,643
No, not at all.

1320
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,298
Are you sure there's nobody
out there?

1321
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,037
Yeah. Could you check again?

1322
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,141
I checked three times. There
ain't nobody here.

1323
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,911
You guys work a little late?

1324
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,913
Yeah, it's a new project.

1325
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,905
We're sort of burning the
midnight oil here.

1326
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,917
Special about the fire
department this time?

1327
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,519
Hey.

1328
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:35,621
That's funny. That's good.

1329
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,223
This yours?

1330
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,615
No. I don't think so.

1331
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,457
Got your address on it.

1332
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,932
Really?

1333
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,460
Well, thanks.

1334
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,355
You can just leave it by the
dumpster over there.

1335
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,127
Sure thing.

1336
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,996
Just stop making movies about
cops.

1337
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,935
No problem. You have a good
night, sir.

1338
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,710
Goodnight, sir.
- Be good.

1339
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,870
Thank you.

1340
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,675
Yeah, you should probably go
get that.

1341
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:00,980
Yeah.

1342
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,851
That's not happening, buddy.

1343
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,520
This is too fuckin' weird.

1344
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,279
First the lights,
now this shit.

1345
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:07,887
A cop shows up at our fuckin'
door to help us.

1346
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,548
Come on, man.
- Just go get it.

1347
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,287
I'm not getting it.
- No. Fuck that.

1348
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,892
John, go get that tape.
- I'm not getting the tape.

1349
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,363
Just go get it.
- I'm telling you.

1350
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,192
You go get it. You want the
tape so bad? You go get it.

1351
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,297
When it comes down to it,
you should go get it.
- You go get it. No.

1352
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,929
You need to take care of
business and get that tape.

1353
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,704
Fuck that. I'm not getting it.
- Right now.

1354
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,502
Just go get the freaking tape.
- You go get the tape.

1355
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,404
You want the tape so bad?
You go get the tape.

1356
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,196
That's a good point.
You should go get the tape.

1357
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,908
Let's take a vote.

1358
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,509
Who thinks John should go get
the tape?

1359
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,311
Mark.
- John.
- This is bullshit.

1360
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,883
Democracy. Go get it.

1361
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,945
What are you doing?

1362
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,249
Go.

1363
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,651
GO, GO, GO!

1364
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,657
Get it! Get it!

1365
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,659
Come on! Come on!
- Get it! Get it!

1366
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,061
OH FUCK.

1367
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,873
DVD. Nice.

1368
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,643
Today's Murders.

1369
00:53:58,135 --> 00:53:59,795
What the...

1370
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,854
(Exhales)

1371
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,485
(Static)

1372
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,912
Hi.

1373
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,947
I saw the sign that said
'Come In', so...

1374
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,922
I came in. I'm Kristen.

1375
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,621
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1376
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,819
So, this is it, huh?
- Yeah.

1377
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,355
Creepy.

1378
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,260
Are you filming me right now?

1379
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,891
Yeah.

1380
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:57,596
Your agent didn't tell you this
was gonna be a screen test?

1381
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,928
No, I mean...

1382
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,673
Don't worry about it. Don't
worry about a thing.

1383
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,568
Can I offer you anything?
Coffee? Water? Tea?

1384
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,300
Water's good. Yeah.

1385
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:05,935
Water? I've got some water in
the green room.

1386
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,010
Indulge me. Just step right in.
- Okay.

1387
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,668
We'll be right with you.

1388
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,307
Why don't you try on that
little blue thing?

1389
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:14,712
Oh yeah. I got it,
but it doesn't fit.

1390
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,605
It's okay.
What you have on is fine.

1391
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,217
Is your mic on?
- Yeah. I think so.

1392
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,948
Wait.

1393
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,854
So how many other women you
said that were up for the part?

1394
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:23,816
Seven.

1395
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,694
But you're the first today!
- Well...

1396
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:28,533
I can assure you
that you won't need to see them
after you see me.

1397
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:31,226
Oh, confidence. I love that!

1398
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,829
Well, let's hope for their sake,
you're right.

1399
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,196
Are you ready for your close-up?

1400
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,895
Yep, sure am.

1401
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,407
Wow.

1402
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,139
Hope you know how to scream.

1403
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,941
(Screaming)

1404
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,576
Okay, okay. That was good for
a first try.

1405
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,219
(Screaming continues)

1406
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:52,918
Pretend.

1407
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,550
Let's think.

1408
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,585
You just watched your mother
jump off the top of a building.

1409
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:58,121
Okay?

1410
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,685
Okay.

1411
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:01,294
I need more volume.

1412
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,055
More volume.

1413
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,703
Louder.

1414
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,199
Cut.

1415
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1416
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:09,502
My throat is hurting.

1417
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,004
I really have to go.

1418
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,895
I have, like, another audition
to go to.

1419
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:14,637
We'll be quick.

1420
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,312
What the hell is this?

1421
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,080
Look. He's acting like a
fuckin' director.

1422
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,276
She thinks she's in a movie.

1423
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,051
Please, could you just...?

1424
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,520
Untie me?
- Okay.

1425
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,919
Really. What--

1426
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,651
What are you doing?!

1427
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,346
What are you doing?

1428
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,387
We're going to try to make
this natural.

1429
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,023
Just don't.

1430
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,888
Sit back, sit back.
Look at the frame.

1431
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,696
Look at the frame.
Look at the frame.

1432
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,528
(Sobbing)

1433
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,630
Please let me go.

1434
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,396
Now, cut.

1435
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,104
More intensity.

1436
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,895
You're about to die.
Act like it.

1437
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,907
(Gibberish)

1438
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,480
CUT!

1439
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,309
No, no, no.

1440
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,083
No, no.

1441
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,847
That is NOT what I want.

1442
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,218
(Gibberish)

1443
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,293
(Gibberish)

1444
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:07,362
(Screaming)

1445
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,891
YES! That's it!

1446
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,657
That's what I'm looking for!

1447
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,772
Genuine fear and total
surrender!

1448
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,670
How can you keep watching this?

1449
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,142
There you go.

1450
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,639
That's it.

1451
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:22,241
Are you getting this?

1452
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,813
Yes! Beautiful!

1453
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,682
Do it for me! More!

1454
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,847
More! More!

1455
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,619
More! Come on!

1456
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:34,849
(Screaming)

1457
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,486
DON'T! NO!

1458
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,303
(Scuffling)

1459
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,397
(Gibberish)

1460
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,637
NO!

1461
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,769
NO! DON'T DO IT!

1462
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,076
(Heavy breathing)

1463
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,922
Okay.

1464
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,234
Now where were we?

1465
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,927
Have you ever wondered what
it's like

1466
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,873
to stare death straight in
the eye?

1467
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,298
Well, here you are.

1468
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,373
An up close and personal look,

1469
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:28,312
minus the guilt of actually
having to do it yourself.

1470
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,239
You can't beat that.

1471
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,754
(Screaming)

1472
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,723
NO!

1473
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,789
NO!

1474
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:43,046
NO!

1475
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,257
No. NO!

1476
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,059
(Gunshot and screaming)

1477
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,058
Aren't guns boring?
Let's try something else.

1478
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,497
Who's next?

1479
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,459
I can't... I can't film this.

1480
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,228
He just shot her.

1481
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:01,265
(Babbling and crying)

1482
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,610
(Screaming)

1483
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:11,576
You've got to believe in
something.

1484
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:13,516
Please!
- No!

1485
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,450
You're doing great.
Just stay patient.

1486
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,221
(Screaming)

1487
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,727
I thought you were gonna be
home tonight.

1488
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,466
I was.

1489
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,200
I'm... look.

1490
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,136
We got this delivery.

1491
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,111
Is that why Mark's puking?
- He's puking?

1492
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,740
Yeah.

1493
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,205
Look at...
- BY ALL MEANS, don't let me
interrupt your work.

1494
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,914
I was just leaving. I swear.

1495
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,806
No, I mean it. Press play.

1496
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,918
I want to see what kind of
sick shit caused me to lose
the love of my life.

1497
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,850
(Screaming and babbling)

1498
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:49,648
NO!

1499
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,420
(Metal clanging)

1500
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,225
(Babbling continues)

1501
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:00,873
Run, little pumpkin. Run.

1502
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,435
(Plastic rustling)

1503
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,438
(Screaming)

1504
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,209
(Crashing)

1505
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,447
I said... run.

1506
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,994
(Screaming)

1507
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,388
(Gurgling)

1508
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:43,838
(Debris rustling)

1509
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,651
This is what you do?

1510
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,594
No.

1511
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:00,222
No, I mean...

1512
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,927
I'll have my stuff out by
tomorrow.

1513
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:04,029
Callie, no, stop.
Baby, please. Come here.

1514
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:05,831
Baby. Come here.

1515
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,671
Callie. Callie.

1516
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,299
Baby, stop. No.

1517
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,104
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1518
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,696
I'm sorry. Okay?

1519
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:15,408
And I didn't mean to not be
there.

1520
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:17,269
I didn't, but I just...
- What were you doing?

1521
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,907
I'll leave right now. You want
me to leave right now?

1522
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,613
Yes. I want you to leave right
now.

1523
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,414
We'll leave right now.
- Okay.

1524
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:23,946
Let's go.

1525
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,621
I've got to...

1526
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,319
(Frantic argument)

1527
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,921
It's about us making it and us
doing what we planned on doing!

1528
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:31,994
We're not gonna make it if you
go to fucking jail!

1529
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,022
I'm not even part of it
anymore.

1530
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,088
It's some sick fuckin' shit,
I know.

1531
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,896
If I'm not in your life
anymore,

1532
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,598
are you gonna succeed?

1533
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,299
Fuck you, John. Fuck you!

1534
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,131
Come here. Stop, just stop.
- NO!

1535
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,997
Stop, stop, stop.
- No. I can't do it anymore.

1536
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,895
Don't take this away from me.

1537
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,867
Please! Just look at me.
- I'm looking at you.

1538
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,506
You're not looking at me.

1539
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,410
I'm looking right in your eyes.
- You don't see me.

1540
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,942
Callie, don't!

1541
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:55,508
CALLIE!

1542
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,205
You can't ask me to choose!

1543
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,145
You already did.

1544
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:13,128
I can't watch any more, man.

1545
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:15,931
I can't do this.

1546
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,867
Turn the fuckin' camera off.

1547
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,337
Mark left a long time ago.

1548
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:29,154
What do we do, man?

1549
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,619
Agent Morris.

1550
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,048
Tomorrow.

1551
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,957
What do you think he does
to her?

1552
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:45,428
You serious?

1553
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:54,069
(Clicks)

1554
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
(Screaming)

1555
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,079
We're fucked.

1556
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:07,079
We are FUCKED.

1557
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,359
These women are...

1558
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,088
are dead.

1559
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,663
They're dead because we had the
brilliant idea of baiting him.

1560
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,392
They're dead because of us.

1561
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,197
They are dead because of me.

1562
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,899
I'm disgusting.

1563
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,501
The cops don't think we exist.

1564
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,332
My own uncle does not think
I exist.

1565
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,243
We're still making a movie.

1566
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,781
THIS is the word of the Lord.

1567
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,310
You pig.

1568
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,305
The voice coming down from
the throne said,

1569
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:39,247
"Praise one God."

1570
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,620
The dragon gave its own power
and throne.

1571
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,552
"Are you his servants?"

1572
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,186
Let us rejoice and be glad.

1573
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:49,955
Give Him glory.

1574
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,327
For the letting day of the lamb
has come.

1575
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,830
Ten roars and seven heads.

1576
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:58,696
(Inaudible)

1577
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,606
The beast I saw was like a
leopard.

1578
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,168
Like a leopard...

1579
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,543
The beast I saw was like a
leopard.

1580
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,742
LISTEN TO ME.

1581
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,477
Listen to me when I read this
to you.

1582
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,324
Here. Learn it.

1583
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,919
Learn it.

1584
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,891
You better hope they come and
wash your sins away.

1585
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:18,821
(Screaming)

1586
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:21,363
You're not an artist...

1587
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,291
(Phone ringing)

1588
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,713
You okay?

1589
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,408
Yep.

1590
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:46,979
What's that?

1591
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:50,192
It's a bunch of old horror
movie reviews.

1592
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,120
They've been spewing out all
morning.

1593
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,459
It's him.

1594
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:56,091
So what now?

1595
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:57,656
We make a movie.

1596
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:00,433
Mark?

1597
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,538
Hey. What'd Agent Morris say
when you called?

1598
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,645
Paul.

1599
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:18,977
Hey Paul.

1600
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,691
Yes, sir?

1601
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,094
Cattle Drive Productions,
for Agent Morris.

1602
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:27,893
Agent Morris isn't in.

1603
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,934
Did you guys make an
appointment?
- Idiot!

1604
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,400
No.

1605
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,098
This is sort of last minute.

1606
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,900
You both need to make an
appointment.
- Told you!

1607
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,501
I understand that, sir.

1608
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,273
Is there anyone else that we
could talk to?

1609
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:39,902
No.

1610
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,206
Maybe a manager or a supervisor?
Anything like that?

1611
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,969
I am the supervisor.

1612
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:47,011
Real good... REAL good.

1613
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:48,614
Thank you.

1614
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,405
What now?

1615
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,347
I don't know, man.

1616
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,494
We could always try to take it
back to the cops.

1617
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,560
Yeah, and I could always take
off my pants,

1618
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,118
and watch an episode of
'Queer As Folk',

1619
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,827
but that don't mean
I'm gonna do it.

1620
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:03,528
I'm being serious with you,
man.

1621
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,200
Uncle Jack can't deny this
shit.

1622
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:06,859
That's all I'm saying.
- Yeah.

1623
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,496
It's worth a shot. Right?
- We got to do something.

1624
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:10,202
I mean, we get denied at the
fuckin' feds.

1625
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:12,104
Let's take it back to Uncle
Jack. What's he gonna do?
Kill us?

1626
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:13,596
The fuck is you doing, man?

1627
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,137
OH SHIT. Gang squad.

1628
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,142
What the fuck is you doing,
man?

1629
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,481
I know you.
You the motherfucker that got
my homeboy in trouble, man.

1630
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,209
We're just leaving, officer.

1631
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22,905
You ain't going nowhere, man.

1632
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,906
SHUT UP! TURN AROUND!

1633
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,918
What the fuck is y'all
shooting?

1634
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,490
It has nothing to do with you?
- I don't want to be in a movie.

1635
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,789
Why is your mother fuckin'
camera on my god damn car?

1636
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,491
It's not. It's on us.

1637
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:34,823
What the fuck?

1638
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,026
Don't you dare talk back to
Officer Mathis, you little
fuckin' girl.

1639
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:39,562
I'm sorry.
-Give me your fuckin' donut,
faggot.

1640
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,596
Your homeboy got a fucking
camera on me, man.

1641
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,632
Guys... guys, look.

1642
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,668
Man, get your mother fuckin'
ass on the car, man.

1643
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,373
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1644
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:51,205
(Frantic argument)

1645
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,081
You see this? You taping this
shit?

1646
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:56,483
(Frantic argument)

1647
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,383
Have a good day. SHIT.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1648
01:06:58,415 --> 01:06:59,945
You got three... two...
- Get out of here!

1649
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,823
(Frantic argument)

1650
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,289
(Frantic argument)

1651
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:08,293
You ever get the feeling
everyone hates you?

1652
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,085
Yeah. Pretty much all the time.

1653
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:11,797
You can't make the meeting?

1654
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,428
Well, can we reschedule?

1655
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,925
Yes. Yes, I understand.

1656
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,644
Thank you for your time.

1657
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,239
Goodbye.

1658
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,908
Apparently Agent Morris got
wind of our reputation

1659
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:26,911
as filmmakers.

1660
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:29,083
He's a little too busy to play
movie star now.

1661
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,288
Where are you going?

1662
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,190
Take a nap. I need a couple
hours.

1663
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,922
Hey, did you see these?

1664
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:41,386
What?

1665
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:44,385
No, I turned the TV off right
away last night.

1666
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:46,228
I didn't even notice this.

1667
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:48,901
What do you think?

1668
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:50,902
Well...

1669
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,904
I think I'm desensitized.

1670
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,696
Go for it.

1671
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,208
Mark.

1672
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,910
Mark, what the fuck?

1673
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:00,141
Do I need to sprinkle fuckin'
fairy dust on you?

1674
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,877
Frame the shot please.

1675
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:07,849
There you go, BOSS.

1676
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,885
Dude, I was just kidding.

1677
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,620
You're kidding?

1678
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,716
Where'd the new found kindness
come from?

1679
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,488
Dude, we put this kid through
hell the past couple weeks,
man.

1680
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,569
Autumn Pig Roast?

1681
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,301
Autumn Pig Roast.

1682
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,337
(Radio static)

1683
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,479
Get up.

1684
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:39,654
(Groaning)

1685
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,593
Put your clothes on.

1686
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,051
(Mumbling)

1687
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:46,388
Run...

1688
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,060
Run.

1689
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,392
Just stop, man. Just hold up!

1690
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:52,497
Just hold on a second.

1691
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,429
Please! Please stop. Stop!

1692
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,901
Just put the gun down. Please.

1693
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,573
Just put the gun down.
Whatever you want.

1694
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,642
Whatever the hell you want,
I'll do it. Please. STOP!

1695
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,440
STOP! What do you want from me?

1696
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,142
To eat.

1697
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:05,844
God damnit!

1698
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:08,043
FUCK!

1699
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,578
Fucker!

1700
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,548
(Groaning)

1701
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:19,187
(Metal clanging)

1702
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,859
OH FUCK.

1703
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:24,392
(Groaning)

1704
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,331
OH FUCK.

1705
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,056
FUCK!

1706
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,397
Fuck.

1707
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,213
Fuck.

1708
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:37,235
God damnit.

1709
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:40,782
God damnit!

1710
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,808
You motherfucker! God damnit!

1711
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,817
What do you want from me?

1712
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,419
What do you want?

1713
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,992
(Fire crackling)

1714
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,860
(Faint police radio)

1715
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,094
Don't say a word.

1716
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,229
You ever wonder how you're
gonna die?

1717
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,200
I've been thinking about it a
lot lately.

1718
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,938
I used to make fun of the Goths
in high school.

1719
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:48,014
Why would you want to walk
around looking like you're
dead?

1720
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,614
You know?

1721
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:51,646
Dressed in black, never smiling.

1722
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,251
Reading Poe.

1723
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,450
I fuckin' hate Poe.

1724
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,116
I guess we're all heading
towards the same finale,

1725
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:00,615
you know?

1726
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,357
Death.

1727
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,132
We're all traveling on the
same path

1728
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,061
whether we like to admit it
or not.

1729
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,901
It doesn't matter who you are

1730
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,843
or what you look like.

1731
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,969
I heard this saying once.

1732
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,205
"For the living know that
they will die,"

1733
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,875
"but the dead know not a
thing."

1734
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,517
Sometimes...

1735
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,818
Sometimes I wish I was dead,

1736
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,590
so I wasn't so damn afraid of
dying.

1737
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:44,866
(Static)

1738
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:47,068
You're not an artist.

1739
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,038
I found an...

1740
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,114
animal in the backyard.

1741
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,882
Did you see him do it?

1742
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,684
No.

1743
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,950
You're blaming ME for this?

1744
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:00,752
Your son...
- Yeah?

1745
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:02,824
...has taken to killing
animals now.

1746
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:05,822
I saw him going in the backyard
with a knife.

1747
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,890
And then I found the knife
later.

1748
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,825
Yeah, well, he's YOUR SON
as well.

1749
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,930
(Piano)

1750
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,940
(Piano)

1751
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,591
(Bird chirping)

1752
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,132
Are we to perish in the
flames of Sodom?

1753
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:53,765
And lie buried in the ashes
of Gomorrah?

1754
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:57,738
Or will we go quietly as shades
in the night,

1755
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:01,482
...in the laughing
face of madness?

1756
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:05,082
(Static)

1757
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,020
What is that?

1758
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,752
It's directions.

1759
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,591
To this place.

1760
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,293
For what?

1761
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,134
How would I know that?

1762
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,230
(Strange music)

1763
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,066
How was the movie?

1764
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,210
Dude, what the fuck are you
doing?

1765
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,138
I'm through fuckin' around
with this guy.

1766
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,450
What do you think he wants?

1767
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,933
Same thing we want. Yeah.

1768
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,528
Yeah... doubtful.

1769
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,998
Bastard.

1770
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,909
Did you type 'bastard'?

1771
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,314
No.

1772
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,816
Oh fuck.

1773
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:13,518
Dude, he's watching us!

1774
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,093
Fuckin' watching us.

1775
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:37,338
WELL, THEN STOP!

1776
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:39,941
JUST LEAVE US ALONE!

1777
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,980
PLEASE!

1778
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:44,245
Look, we're not gonna say
anything!

1779
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:46,854
We'll throw everything out!

1780
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,793
You just leave us alone!

1781
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,462
What?

1782
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,490
Look. Let's just play his
game.

1783
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,026
WHAT?

1784
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,801
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1785
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:04,131
I have an idea.

1786
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,844
We're gonna get this son of
a bitch.

1787
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,336
It's not polite to...

1788
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:20,146
(Inaudible)

1789
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,126
We need the perfect shot?

1790
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:31,058
No, we don't. No, we don't!

1791
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,500
We want to shoot it.

1792
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,132
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1793
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,937
Just calm down!

1794
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,869
(Muttering)

1795
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,220
(Music)

1796
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,570
Come on.
- What?

1797
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,299
Smile.

1798
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:12,904
I'm smiling.

1799
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:14,396
Babe.

1800
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:16,607
Yes? Yeah...

1801
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,210
You look good.

1802
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,911
Why do you have to? What are
you taping me for?

1803
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:22,914
It's just been a fucked up
day. That's all.

1804
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,946
You finally ate something.
I love you.

1805
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,921
I love you too.

1806
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,650
Look at me.
- I do. I love you.

1807
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,915
I love you and I know I haven't
been showing it lately,

1808
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:32,994
but if you don't turn that
fuckin' camera off...

1809
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,122
Thank you for dinner,
because this is...

1810
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,989
It's just been a fucked up day.

1811
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,897
This is what I needed.

1812
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,829
And I'm just happy to be here
with you and...

1813
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:43,865
Blah, blah, fuckin' blah.

1814
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,895
You ran out of the car fast
enough.

1815
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,807
Give me your purse. Give me
your purse. Give me your purse.

1816
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,569
(Inaudible)

1817
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,407
Let's not. Not tonight.
- I'm following you.

1818
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,342
Not me, you and the camera.
Just me and you.

1819
01:16:55,879 --> 01:16:58,049
I'm trying to learn your
language.
- Turn it off...

1820
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,081
Show me how to use this thing.

1821
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,916
Put the camera down. Okay?

1822
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,351
I will, in a second.

1823
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,186
OH FUCK.

1824
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,925
Give me the camera, Callie.

1825
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,860
(Phone ringing)

1826
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:17,765
(Inaudible)
(Phone ringing)

1827
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,938
Did you get this on camera?
- What?

1828
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,670
Did you see what this is?

1829
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:24,406
The fuck is that?

1830
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,280
It's my fucking head, John.
GOD!

1831
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,909
Here, take this.

1832
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:29,414
It's my fucking head on a
stick.

1833
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,145
You think that isn't symbolic?!

1834
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,220
Is it him? Is it him, John?

1835
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:35,019
Callie, put the camera down.
Okay?

1836
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:36,991
John... what...

1837
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,390
What?

1838
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,491
Our fucking life is on the
fucking ground.

1839
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:41,893
Yes.

1840
01:17:41,925 --> 01:17:44,385
Is it him, John?
Is it him, John?

1841
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,297
I'm on my way.

1842
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,129
What was that, John?
- It was nobody.

1843
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,134
Who was on the fucking phone?
- It was nobody.

1844
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,896
It was him, wasn't it?
- You've got to trust me.

1845
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:53,895
You have to trust me.
- No, I don't trust you.

1846
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:55,597
Fucking tell me who it was.

1847
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:56,868
NO!

1848
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:58,606
Get me out of this shit.

1849
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:01,181
You got your FUCKING girlfriend
involved.

1850
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:03,477
GET ME OUT OF THIS!

1851
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,050
(Frantic argument)

1852
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,350
You are a fucking accomplice!

1853
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:12,056
TO MURDER!

1854
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,762
I don't want to go to this
guy's house.

1855
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:18,462
I'm sure he doesn't have
welcome mats rolled out for us.

1856
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,364
What makes you feel safe
about this?

1857
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,096
Here's your fuckin' answer.
- What the FUCK?

1858
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:23,901
Fuckin' running your mouth,
all of you.

1859
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:26,203
Fucking king on the mountain,
all the time. Both of you.

1860
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,935
I don't want to go in there
with a gun.

1861
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,741
So what do you want me to do?
- Take the lens cap off.

1862
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:32,313
Would you fuckin' listen to
yourself?

1863
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,411
You're the one who started
this whole fuckin' shit?

1864
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,053
(Frantic argument)

1865
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,150
I'm gonna fuckin' walk,
alright? You fuck.

1866
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:41,022
It's 15 miles!
- I don't care!

1867
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,790
I fuckin' need the exercise.
- Mark. MARK!

1868
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:47,864
(Car doors closing)

1869
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,325
Jesus.

1870
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,843
This ain't right, Paul.

1871
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,082
(Door creaks open)

1872
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,285
Hey.

1873
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:20,121
This place is a fuckin'
studio.

1874
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:21,716
Hello?

1875
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,457
Paul. Paul, keep it down.
- We're cool!

1876
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,932
Keep it down.

1877
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,901
Oh Jesus!

1878
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,830
Welcome to the freak show.

1879
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,507
Dude, don't touch the shit.

1880
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:38,139
Do you want your fingerprints
all over this shit?

1881
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,914
What's wrong with you?
- It's official.

1882
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:42,613
This dude's equipment is ten
times better than ours.

1883
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:44,205
Yeah, well. Great.

1884
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:46,317
Great. I think it's time to...

1885
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:47,919
PAUL, PAUL, PAUL!

1886
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:49,651
Paul. Hey bro. Come on.

1887
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:51,385
I'm serious. Slow the fuck
down.

1888
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,860
John.
- Just slow down!

1889
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:54,359
I've got a gun.

1890
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,830
And I have a camera, man.

1891
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:01,503
OH SHIT.

1892
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,130
This place ain't right, bro.

1893
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,126
Oh shit, shit, shit.

1894
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,898
Just keep that light on me.

1895
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:08,396
Keep that light on me.

1896
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,137
I like you less and less
every day.

1897
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:11,443
Oh shit.

1898
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,911
Man.
- Dude.

1899
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:15,683
Dude, dude, dude...

1900
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:17,811
It's the basement.
- No shit!

1901
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:20,647
And we're not going down there,
right?

1902
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:22,653
You're not seriously
considering going down there.

1903
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,485
Yeah, you're right. Let's just
get out of here.

1904
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,920
Thank you.

1905
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,715
YES, I'm seriously thinking
about going there. Jesus.

1906
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:29,586
Well, you have fun, because
I'm leaving.

1907
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,585
I'm fuckin' out of here.
See ya!

1908
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,397
Thanks buddy.
- Gotcha.

1909
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:35,029
Yell if you need me.

1910
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:36,804
Paul, I'm serious. Are you
coming?

1911
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,402
ONE SECOND!

1912
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,044
Well, fuckin' hurry up!

1913
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,745
Paul.

1914
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,354
The Blue...

1915
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,086
Paul, we got it.

1916
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:00,692
Hey! Paul?

1917
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:02,133
Paul!

1918
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:03,728
Fuck me.

1919
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:05,489
Hey Paul, remember when I said
I love you?

1920
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,928
I don't love you!
- GET THE--

1921
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:08,363
HOLY SHIT!

1922
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:09,997
You scared the shit out of me!

1923
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:12,003
Come on. Can we get out of
here?
- Get it together.

1924
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:13,465
I'm together, man!

1925
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,402
Dude, yeah. Upstairs.

1926
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:17,308
That's smart! Let's do that!

1927
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,406
Just, Paul... dude...

1928
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:21,606
Hey.

1929
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,145
No, no. Paul...

1930
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,220
Paul, Paul. Nothing about this
is right, bro.

1931
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:27,849
Oh, this is fucked.

1932
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,493
Yeah. You're right. This is
fucked.

1933
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:31,388
You do not tell me that light
is going out right now.

1934
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,020
Dude, I'm not Mark.
I don't know what the fuck.

1935
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:34,556
FIX THE LIGHT.

1936
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,130
I'm trying.

1937
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,029
Fuck the light! Let's go!

1938
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:40,201
Dude, that's... I think...

1939
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,299
That's blood in there.

1940
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,131
John, just stay with me.
- Dude, I'm leaving.

1941
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,643
You stay with me.

1942
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,906
Come on. Get in here. Get in
here.

1943
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:51,939
No. Paul, everything about
this is wrong, bro.

1944
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:53,675
It's not wrong.

1945
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:55,509
This fuckin' light.
Dude, it's...

1946
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,414
John, this is what you've
been pumping.

1947
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:59,046
I'm doing this for you.

1948
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,582
I've given you everything
you want.

1949
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:02,186
Look. Let's just get out of
here.

1950
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:03,818
Okay? Can we do--

1951
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:05,492
Fuck this light!

1952
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,561
This is your movie!
- FUCK THE MOVIE. Okay?

1953
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,030
Fuck the movie!

1954
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,355
Will you turn that light on?!

1955
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:12,864
Wait.

1956
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:14,495
(Creaking)

1957
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,000
OH SHIT! PAUL!

1958
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,202
(Gunshots)

1959
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,803
Behind you!

1960
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:20,374
OH SHIT. OH MY GOD.
PAUL, COME ON! FUCK!

1961
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,413
PAUL, COME ON!
- JOHN, HELP ME!

1962
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,268
JOHN!
- FOLLOW ME, DUDE!

1963
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:25,807
JOHN!

1964
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,241
John!

1965
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,210
OH FUCK.

1966
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:30,775
FUCK YOU!

1967
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:32,523
Oh shit. Okay... okay.

1968
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,478
(Incoherent rant)

1969
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:36,187
JJJOOOHHHNNN!
- Okay, okay.

1970
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:37,949
Fuck. I'm coming.

1971
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,461
Paul?

1972
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,259
Paul, I'm coming to get you.

1973
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,031
I'm coming to get you!

1974
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:45,997
Paul!

1975
01:22:46,029 --> 01:22:47,499
Oh my god.

1976
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,330
Dude. Dude, where are you?
Don't fuck with me.

1977
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,265
Fuck.

1978
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,140
(Babbling)

1979
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,299
(Clunking and shattering)

1980
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:55,937
JOHN!

1981
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,511
OH FUCK.

1982
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,010
FUCK YOU!

1983
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,442
HOLY SHIT.

1984
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,376
(Groaning)

1985
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,778
(Whimpering)

1986
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,022
Who's there?

1987
01:23:12,055 --> 01:23:13,485
OH SHIT.

1988
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,833
You're not an artist.

1989
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,061
You're not an artist.

1990
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,930
Oh fuck.

1991
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:24,765
You're nothing to me.

1992
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,200
WHAT THE FUCK.

1993
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:27,935
Nothing.

1994
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:30,367
(Whimpering)

1995
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:32,306
You make me sick.

1996
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,241
You make me sick.

1997
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:39,579
You. Make. Me. Sick.

1998
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:41,422
FUCK.

1999
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:43,818
FUCK.

2000
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:49,233
Who is it? Who is it?

2001
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,388
OH FUCK.

2002
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:53,995
OH FUCK.

2003
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,859
OH GOD, SOMEONE HELP!

2004
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:58,369
SOMEBODY HELP!

2005
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:01,001
Come on, John.
Don't be such a wimp now.

2006
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:03,637
This is your moment in the
spotlight.

2007
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:05,612
This is what you always wanted,
right?

2008
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:06,911
To be famous.

2009
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:08,912
Sorry I can't help you with
the rich part.

2010
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:10,854
(Babbling)

2011
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:12,917
John.

2012
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:14,578
Look over here.

2013
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:15,877
(Hollow thud)

2014
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,288
OH FUCK.

2015
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:20,962
You motherfucker.

2016
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:23,434
John, John...

2017
01:24:23,759 --> 01:24:25,929
We're just about to get the
perfect shot.

2018
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:27,861
I couldn't have done it
without you.

2019
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:30,471
Un-fucking-tie me.

2020
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,339
What the fuck? I learned my
lesson.

2021
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,735
You know I can't do that,
John.

2022
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,540
Behind all great art lies
great sacrifice.

2023
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,609
This one's gonna be yours.

2024
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,315
Don't be such a baby, John.

2025
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:50,647
Most people live their entire
lives

2026
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,786
in total obscurity.

2027
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,561
You're going to be the star
of my film.

2028
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:57,858
It's time to make history.

2029
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,827
Are you ready for your close-up?

2030
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:02,633
STOP! STOP, PLEASE. STOP!

2031
01:25:02,665 --> 01:25:04,225
Stop, please. Please.

2032
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,900
We can do this together. Okay?

2033
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,935
We can do this together. I...

2034
01:25:08,971 --> 01:25:10,671
MY FOOTAGE!

2035
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:12,306
You can have all my footage!

2036
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,041
We'll make the movie together,
man!

2037
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:15,736
I'll make you famous. I swear.

2038
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,608
I'm already famous, John.

2039
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,476
The world just doesn't know
it yet.

2040
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,345
Please. PLEASE! No don't.

2041
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,887
John, stop being so weak
and PATHETIC.

2042
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:25,889
Look! Can't you see you're
just like me?

2043
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:27,591
We're the same, man!

2044
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,493
We could do this together.

2045
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:31,625
Call me unethical if you like,
John,

2046
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,300
but I'm not gonna be sharing
credit with you.

2047
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,200
Or your dead colleagues.

2048
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,025
You killed my fuckin' friends!

2049
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,197
OH FUCK.

2050
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:41,896
No, no, just...!

2051
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,907
Look! Look! I'll give you
final cut, man!

2052
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,609
And you can have all the
fuckin' rights!

2053
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,281
I don't want a dollar!

2054
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:49,280
I will always have final cut.

2055
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:51,152
John, I won't hurt you.

2056
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:54,477
Not as long as you tell the
audience why we're here.

2057
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:56,187
I just...

2058
01:25:56,219 --> 01:25:57,889
I just wanted to make a
movie.

2059
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,820
(Crunching)

2060
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:01,685

2061
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:09,229
(Crunching)

2062
01:26:29,652 --> 01:26:31,122
(Beep)

2063
01:26:34,557 --> 01:26:36,587
I don't understand what's
the matter with you.

2064
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,125
I just don't.

2065
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,727
I've given you everything,

2066
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:42,673
And is this all you can do
for me?

2067
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,226
Is this it?

2068
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,843
Cut.

2069
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,865
Print.

2070
01:26:57,413 --> 01:26:58,883

2071
