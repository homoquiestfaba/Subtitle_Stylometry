- [Hitchhiker] Live here?

31
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,858
- I'm staying here.

32
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,614
I bid you enter of your own free will.

33
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,615
- Okay.

34
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,845
Really, you live here.

35
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,806
- I told you I was staying here.

36
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,349
- Alone?

37
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,643
- You ask a lot of questions.

38
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,521
- I just wanna know who
all the players are.

39
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,855
- Are we playing?

40
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,856
- You know we are.

41
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,986
- Would you like to clean up?

42
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,487
- Sure.

43
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,573
- What size are you?

44
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,700
- Excuse me?

45
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,077
- Shirt size, pant size?

46
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,078
The owner left some clothes,

47
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,790
and I'm sure he wouldn't
mind if we used them.

48
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,792
- Large shirt, 38 waist.

49
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,919
Just like high school.

50
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
- I believe we can accommodate.

51
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,637
(foreboding music)

52
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,279
- Sorry.

53
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,702
Why did you pick me up anyway?

54
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,122
- Seemed like the thing to do.

55
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,170
- When I'm standing there,
I just watch the cars go by.

56
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,964
There's nothing much else
to do but that or think,

57
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,300
and I don't like to think.

58
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,764
Then your car passed by.

59
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,810
A few minutes later you
came back and picked me up.

60
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,811
Why?

61
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,066
- I liked the way you looked.

62
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,318
- So you picked me up to fuck me.

63
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,571
- [Theodora] I picked
you up to bring you here.

64
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,990
Whatever happens after that...

65
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,539
- Doesn't happen a lot, but it happens.

66
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,332
- [Theodora] Does it?

67
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,127
- Some chick drives by, sees the package,

68
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,130
starts to ask herself what it'd be like.

69
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,175
What it'd be like to
pick me up, take me home,

70
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,844
have her way with me.

71
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,929
Oh yeah, it happens.

72
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,514
- Now you're hurting my feelings,

73
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,475
I thought I was going to be your first.

74
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,898
- You're too late to be my first.

75
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
I'm not yours either.

76
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,738
- My what, my first hitchhiker?

77
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,031
- Sure, am I?

78
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,705
What are you?

79
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,791
- What am I?

80
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,252
- Nationality, Italian?

81
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,386
What is this stuff?

82
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,181
- It's wine.

83
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,526
- [Hitchhiker] Where's the bedroom?

84
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,447
(unsettling music)

85
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,941
(serene piano music)

86
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,493
(ominous music)

87
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,222
(gun fires)

88
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,433
(woman yelps)

89
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,770
(screeches)

90
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,404
(screams)

91
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,249
(crickets chirp)

92
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,848
(wolf howls)

93
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,937
(gasps)

94
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,522
- Somebody's out there!
- What the fuck?

95
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,523
What?

96
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,568
I don't see anything.

97
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,032
- [Sky] Where are you going?

98
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,785
- [Morrissey] I'm gonna go look about.

99
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,913
- Be careful.
- I'll be all right,

100
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,914
stay here.

101
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,521
(door opens)

102
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,356
There's nothing.

103
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,564
What did you see out there?

104
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,943
- A hand, a bloody hand
hitting the window.

105
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,736
- [Morrissey] There's nothing.

106
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,863
- I definitely saw something.

107
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,782
- [Morrissey] Were you dreaming?

108
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,617
- Don't start.

109
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,621
- I'm not starting, I'm just asking.

110
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,169
So you saw a hand hit the window.

111
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
- [Sky] Yes.

112
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,131
- Man's hand, woman's?

113
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,507
- I don't know, what does it matter?

114
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,633
- [Morrissey] You said it was bloody.

115
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,510
- Yes, that I know.

116
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,595
- Well, there's no blood on the window.

117
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,974
There's nothing on the window
except for some bird crap.

118
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,727
Just a big damn bird.

119
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,603
- You think I was dreaming?

120
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,605
- Bird crap.

121
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,653
(Morrissey sighs)

122
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,533
- I dreamed that two
women were making love.

123
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,954
- I could use a dream like that.

124
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,999
Sorry.

125
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,502
- I shot them.

126
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,298
- [Morrissey] Well, it's a good thing

127
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,379
I don't subscribe to Freud.

128
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,719
- Then I woke up, I heard a sound,

129
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,598
I looked out the window,
and a hand hit the glass.

130
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,934
- Is that kinda like the
shit hitting the fan?

131
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,020
- You are so not funny.

132
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,855
- Come on.

133
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,231
Come on, Sky, I'm sorry.

134
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,233
- No.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,861
Baby, I'm sorry.

136
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,281
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

137
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Hm?

138
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,455
You want to...

139
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,541
- You are impossible, no.

140
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,753
Early to bed, early to
get started, remember?

141
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,129
(phone rings)

142
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,590
- Saved by the bell, great.

143
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,842
- [Sky] Hold onto that for me, won't you?

144
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,888
- Oh, well, it's always
there if you need it.

145
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,394
(sighs) So you're just gonna
leave me just like that, huh?

146
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,814
- [Sky] You can always
take things into hand.

147
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,441
- Nice.

148
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,943
Thanks.

149
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
So you wanna fuck or what?

150
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,260
Cause I think that's a yes.

151
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,139
Cause I'm feeling yes.

152
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,685
Yeah, no?

153
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,229
Oh.

154
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,524
I see.

155
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
(foreboding music)

156
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,126
- It is just memory.
(cries)

157
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,129
It is just time.

158
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,090
Taste the past.

159
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,966
- No.

160
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,637
It was Bulgaria.

161
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,850
How they would burn, kill,
violate women and children.

162
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,102
And nail the prisoners' ears to fences

163
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,480
where they would hang them in the morning.

164
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,572
- Don't do this to yourself.

165
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,161
- I can see the bodies
hanging from the trees.

166
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,749
I can hear the rope scratching the bark.

167
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,465
- They're humans.

168
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,800
They're animals.

169
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,891
- Imagine a baby in the
arms of a trembling mother,

170
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,811
surrounding by men who
have just entered her home.

171
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,065
They're having great fun.

172
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,902
They fondle the baby and
they try to make it laugh,

173
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,073
and they are successful, yet lax.

174
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,576
That moment a man pulls out a pistol,

175
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,121
points it inches from the baby's face.

176
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,501
The baby stretches out its
fingers to touch the pistol,

177
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,628
and it laughs.

178
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,715
And suddenly, the man pulls the trigger,

179
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,552
and blows the baby's brains out!

180
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,305
(gasps)

181
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,350
Artistic, isn't it?

182
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,108
- Time to sleep.

183
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,918
- Just look at this.

184
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,007
Whoa.

185
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,138
There's gotta be 30, 40
years of history here.

186
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,683
It's just the top layer.

187
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,785
- [Morrissey] Will you be
all right here for a while?

188
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,871
- [Sky] Yeah.

189
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,314
- [Morrissey] Sky, come here!

190
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
- What is it?

191
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,079
Well that would put an
end to the festivities.

192
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,539
What do you think it means?

193
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,542
- I saw this in Bosnia.

194
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,294
This is what was written on the wall

195
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,089
where I found my grandfather's body.

196
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,551
It's the Jan Kantas, the symbol
for the castrating mother,

197
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,845
the all-consuming female.

198
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,066
- I'm sorry.

199
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,067
- It's all right.

200
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,195
That was a long time ago.

201
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,036
- Hey, sorry.
- What?

202
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:38,207
- [Sky] What's this?

203
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,376
- What?
- This.

204
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,692
- This looks like cuneiform.

205
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,028
It's a little bit different,

206
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,363
what the hell is this doing here?

207
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,657
- [Sky] Shouldn't be here.

208
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,787
Didn't really want too many
to be here, a collector?

209
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,205
- I don't know.

210
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
I'll take it to the lab.

211
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,474
- [Sky] There can't be any more.

212
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,565
- This just might be graffiti, but...

213
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,404
(camera shutter clicks)

214
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,052
God damn it!

215
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,807
- [Sky] Are you all right?

216
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,768
- [Morrissey] Not really.

217
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,769
- Let me see.

218
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,064
I said let me see it.

219
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,899
- Ow.
- You may need stitches.

220
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,734
- [Morrissey] Come on.

221
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,027
- Or at least a good cleaning.

222
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,403
What did you do?

223
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,322
- Uh, I cut it.

224
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,949
- No shit, Sherlock.

225
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,700
Let's get you back to camp.

226
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,701
Here, go.

227
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,706
- [Morrissey] It hurts.

228
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
- [Sky] Deserve it.

229
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,880
(rumbling)

230
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,389

(serene humming)

232
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,338
- This is fantastic.

233
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,339
You live here?

234
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,887
Is there someone else here?

235
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,056
- Only you and I.

236
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,891
Perhaps a ghost or two.

237
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,060
(foreboding music)

238
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,565
Would you like to take a shower, clean up?

239
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,993

I knew a long time ago.

246
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,969
- Wasn't me.

247
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,599
I would've remembered.

248
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,102

- [Dietrich] How so?

250
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,981

that I should remember,

251
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:17,987
and sometimes I remember
things that never happened.

252

- No, I don't have to be anywhere at all.

300
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,736
- You say that with such sadness.

301
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,739
- It's sad, isn't it?

302
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,954
Nobody's waiting for me.

303
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,207
No one's expecting me.

304
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,714
And if I died right
now, nobody would know.

305
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,592
Or care.

306
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,678
Christ.

307
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,640
Listen to me.

308
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,185
How melodramatic can you get?

309
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,686
- I would care.

310
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,855
- Why would you care?

311
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,608
- I don't know.

312
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,697
- In the morning, can we explore?

313
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,743
- You can do whatever you
want, I won't stop you.

314
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,744
- Anywhere at all?

315
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,789
- Through any door that isn't locked.

316
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,832
- Locked doors?

317
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,630
- There are always locked doors.

318
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,119
(foreboding music)

319
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,888
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

320
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,432
Are you the owner?

321
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,766
- [Dietrich] No, I'm just visiting.

322
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,727
- [Sky] Visiting, does
somebody live there?

323
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,733
(train horn blares)
- You know, I'm not sure.

324
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,735
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right.

325
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,236
I'm Dietrich.

326
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,031
- [Morrissey] Morrissey.

327
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,573
- Nice to meet you.
- Sky.

328
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,700
- Nice to meet you, Sky.

329
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,701
- Don't ask.

330
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,788
- [Dietrich] So this is, so
what are you guys doing here?

331
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,957
This is a strange place to be camping.

332
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,043
- Yeah, well, we're starting
a new fad, you know?

333
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,919
Urban camping, maybe you heard of it.

334
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,464
- Really?
- No, no, not really.

335
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,299
- Ignore him, the thinks he's funny.

336
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,219
We're from the university,
Department of Urban Archeology.

337
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,557
- [Dietrich] What are you
guys doing on the terminal?

338
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,142
- Unfortunately we're not.

339
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,602
We're not allowed in.

340
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,854
- Private owner, refuses all requests,

341
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,356
won't return phone calls.

342
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,108
Just lets it sit there rotting.

343
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,360
We were hoping you were him.

344
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,444
- Sorry.
- Hey, hey,

345
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,446
is there any coffee?

346
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,989
- I was just gonna make some fresh.

347
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,159
Would you like a cup?
- Please, thank you.

348
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,748
So what do urban archeologists do?

349
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,834
- We preserve future history.

350
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,836
- Future history?
- Mm-hm.

351
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,255
It's a term my grandfather used to use.

352
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,882
He'd say that most
people think that history

353
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,593
is something that
happened a long time ago.

354
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,137
But actually, history's
an ongoing process.

355
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,514
Every second history's being formed,

356
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,724
even right now as we speak.

357
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,062
And all this, all these
buildings, they are history.

358
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,648
One day they won't be here, but
the records of them will be.

359
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,359
Or at least we hope they'll be.

360
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,569
- Thank you.

361
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,739
- Just grab that, so yeah...

362
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,493
The warehouse, it predates the terminal

363
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,494
by what, 30 years?

364
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,205
- [Sky] More than that.

365
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,332
Terminal was built in 1930,

366
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,669
warehouse was built around
the turn of the century.

367
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,547
- That's the turn of the 20th century.

368
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,883
- [Sky] Warehouse was built for cattle.

369
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,261
- Cattle?
- Beef cattle.

370
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,470
- Yeah, this whole area used to host

371
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,515
a huge slaughter industry in the 1800s.

372
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,475
It was only second to Chicago.

373
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,185
Tens of thousands of cows
were slaughtered here

374
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,063
and shipped all across the east coast.

375
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
- Yeah.

376
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,075
(sighs)

377
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,744
In 1918 it was turned
into a hospital ward.

378
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,121
- [Dietrich] Hospital ward?

379
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,166
- The great influenza pandemic of 1918.

380
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,625
More Americans died during that

381
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,294
than the whole of World War I.

382
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,046
Literally thousands of
patients were isolated here.

383
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,840
- They ended up burying most.

384
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,758
- 90 something plus mortality rate.

385
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,759
- [Dietrich] Man.

386
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,386
- You're sitting in a graveyard.

387
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,346
- [Morrissey] They
moved most of the bodies

388
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,055
to Forest Lawn in 1930.

389
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,307
- [Dietrich] Most of the bodies?

390
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,475
- [Morrissey] Most.

391
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,312
- And in 1930 they built the terminal.

392
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,147
And it ran till what, the early 70s?

393
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,443
- 72, the time in between,

394
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,739
the terminal and the warehouse
used to house psych patients.

395
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,742
- Most violent in the warehouse.

396
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,369
- Whoa, I didn't know that.

397
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,039
- It's another interesting story.

398
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,125
- What?
- Well, supposedly,

399
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,920
when the warehouse was used
to store psych patients,

400
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,881
there was a separate ward
for deformed children.

401
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,133
I'm talking serious deforms, like kids,

402
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,969
by no rules of nature should
have survived childbirth.

403
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,888
For whatever reason they did.

404
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,599
There's no proof of that, though, however.

405
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,185
- Wow, someone just walked over my grave.

406
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,562
- [Morrissey] Yeah, well...

407
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,272
I gotta get back to work.

408
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,482
(sighs)
- I should join you.

409
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,151
- [Morrissey] Mm-hm.

410
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,657
- Um, the private owner.

411
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,992
- What about her?

412
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,868
- [Sky] Are you gonna see her later?

413
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,869
- I think so.

414
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,831
- [Sky] Could you ask if we
can visit, just to look around?

415
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,792
- Assuming I see her again.

416
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,126
- [Sky] Thanks.

417
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:27,962
- No problem.

418
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:31,924
- [Morrissey] All right, take
it easy. (serene piano music)

419
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,066
- You monsters, you
bring me back my child!

420
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,800
(chatting)

421
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,024
- Mysterious.

422
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,234
- Yeah, I guess so.

423
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,571
- I'm so glad you're still here.

424
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,198
- You have my backpack
and the door is locked.

425
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,242
- I'm so sorry.

426
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,288
I had to leave early, forgive me.

427
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,999
You were sleeping so soundly.

428
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,298
This is Elenora, my old friend.

429
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,800
And her friend...
- Griffin, how are you?

430
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,136
- Dietrich, hi.
- Charmed.

431
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,690
- The door was locked.

432
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,233
- Well, the door might have swollen.

433
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,527
You know, changes in the
temperature and all that.

434
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,112
It's a natural fucking phenomenon.

435
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,113
Come on.

436
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,197
- This is pure wine.

437
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,992
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You'll love it.

438
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,587
Cheers.
- Cheers.

439
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,095
So Dietrich, yeah?

440
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,096
- Right.

441
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:29,475
- So what do you do?

442
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,770
- I'm in-between doing,
I guess you could say.

443
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,272
- (chuckles) I hear you.

444
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,440
Yeah, I've been there.

445
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,441
- What do you do?

446
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,318
- Oh, me?

447
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,486
I'm a writer.

448
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,487
- Really?

449
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,365
What have you written?

450
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,575
- A little bit of everything.

451
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,744
Copy, blogs, screenplays.

452
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,329
You name it, I done it.

453
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,915
- [Dietrich] Anything I might
have seen or read about?

454
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,292
- Oh, you?

455
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,585
You, no.

456
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,753
I doubt that, probably not.

457
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,255
My publisher says my work tends to lean

458
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,550
towards the esoteric.

459
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,595
But, you know, it pays the bills.

460
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,682
(chatting)

461
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,811
- Elenora.
- Yes.

462
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,856
- [Dietrich] How do you know Theodora?

463
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,691
- Where do I begin?

464
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,778
(laughs)

465
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,324
- Elenora and I have known
each other for a long time.

466
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,578
(ominous electro song)

467
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,499
- Oh, I love that song.

468
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,544
(giggles)

469
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,127
- Yes.

470
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,243
Did you find anything?

471
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,327
- Find anything?

472
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:57,456
- I assume you did some
exploring this morning?

473
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,457
- A bit.

474
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,668
I was tired.

475
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,880
Hey, did I break a glass last night?

476
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,465
- There's tons of broken
glass in this building.

477
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,800
Why do you ask?

478
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,011
- Cause I cut my arm, I think.

479
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,012
- Show me.

480
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,269
- [Dietrich] Well, it was
so much worse this morning.

481
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,649
- Every time you look at
it, you will think of us.

482
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,818
- Imagine so.

483
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,484
(foreboding music)

484
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,529
(chuckling)

485
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,538
- So...

486
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,252
What's all this about then?

487
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,796
- Vanity.

488
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:37,057
- Sorry, that wine must have
gone straight to my head.

489
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,309
- It will do that.

490
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,310
Come.

491
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,195
(chuckles)

492
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:55,491
- So is this leading

493
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,869
to where I think it's leading?

494
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,624
- And where do you think
this is leading to?

495
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,005
- Me.

496
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,675
And you.

497
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,720
(laughs)

498
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,887
Naked.

499
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,684
Fucking.

500
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,769
- Well.

501
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,774
Let's find out, shall we?

502
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,530

(tense music)

524
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,458
- [Elenora] You have to kill him.

525
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,293
- I will.

526
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,503
- [Elenora] When?

527
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,754
- When I'm done with him.

528
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,924
- [Elenora] You've
played this game before.

529
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,427
- I know.
- And you lost.

530
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,887
- That was a long time ago.

531
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,931
- You lost everything.

532
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:07,933
- I know.

533
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,479
- [Elenora] If you love me,

534
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,817
you'll kill him.

535
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,007
- I will.

(shuffling)

538
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,493
- [Sky] Hello.

539
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,456
I'm with the university.

540
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,417
Do I know you?

541
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,088
- Perhaps we were sisters
in some past life.

542
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,050
- [Sky] What?

543
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,928
- I always knew we'll meet again.

544
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,057
- [Sky] I don't understand.

545
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,228
- I won't hurt you.

546
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,862
Protect you.

547
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,534
- No.

548
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,157
(unsettling music)

549
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,759
- [Dietrich] Finally.

550
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,094
- [Theodora] What happened?

551
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,637
- Come on, get me out of here.

552
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,181
I've been here, I've
been down here all day.

553
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,518
- Oh, poor baby. (giggles)

554
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,311
- Come on, get me out of here.

555
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,855
- [Theodora] Why should I?

556
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,356
- Please.

557
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,066
I feel really weak right now.

558
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,068
Get me out of here.

559
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,070
- You don't deserve it.

560
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,905
- Get me out of here, Theodora.

561
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,825
- Why should I, what
are you gonna do for me?

562
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,660
- [Dietrich] This is not
funny, get me out of here.

563
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,412
I've been down here all day.

564
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,038
(moans)

565
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,874
- [Theodora] Poor baby, suffer for me,

566
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,042
just a little bit more, come on.

567
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,336
(laughs)
- Let me out!

568
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,965
- [Theodora] Did you miss me?

569
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,717
- Just get me out.

570
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,552
Come on, open this door.

571
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,553
Open it.

572
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,106
God, get me out of here.

573
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,625
(foreboding music)

574
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,842
(cup clatters)

575
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,887
(gasps)

576
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,314
- [Theodora] Stop!

577
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,775
You're killing him!

578
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,152
Stop it, Elenora, that's enough!

579
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,321
That's enough!

580
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,573
- What do you want me to do?

581
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,701
Suck the rats in the basement?

582
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,273
(foreboding music)

583
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,091
(garbled voices)

584
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,512
(suspenseful rock music)

585
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,595
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

586
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,679
What are you doing in here?

587
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,139
- There's two women down there sleeping,

588
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,224
well, I think they're sleeping.

589
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,977
But they're in some sort
of placenta membrane sac.

590
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,187
- Did they invite you in?

591
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,271
- What?

592
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,440
- Did they invite you in?

593
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,858
- What does that have to do with anything?

594
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,735
They're down there...
- I don't give a shit, Sky!

595
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,112
This is their property, it ain't yours!

596
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,864
- There's something wrong with them.

597
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,115
- I don't give a flying fuck in a tree,

598
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,367
what's wrong with them isn't the issue!

599
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,576
What's wrong with you is.

600
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,119
- How dare you talk to me like that.

601
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,871
- How dare you break in.

602
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,040
- Yeah, and what are you doing here?

603
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,000
- I'm looking for your stupid ass.

604
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,877
I got back early, I went to the warehouse,

605
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,671
I called your cell phone,
I called your name.

606
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,965
I was gonna call the cops!

607
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,342
Jesus Christ, I...

608
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,887
I said to myself, she
wouldn't go in there,

609
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,888
she wouldn't go in there.

610
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,182
But you know what, I knew that you would.

611
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,642
And look, here you are.

612
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,562
- Right, good deal, you found me.

613
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,704
(man whimpers)

614
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,274
- What an amazing place.

615
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,610
- The phone is over here.

616
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,030
- Phone's over there.

617
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,574
Phone's over here, phone's over here.

618
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,244
Rotary, what the frick?

619
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,873
Come on!

620
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,874
What the...

621
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,252
Aw, come on!

622
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,422
There's no dial tone!

623
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,842
- This is an old building,
sometimes the lines can be funny.

624
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,136
- [Moby] (groans) Damn it!

625
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,221
- Would you like a drink?

626
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,807
- You and me, yeah, sure.

627
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:38,808
Oh, why not?

628
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:46,816
Oh yeah.

629
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,280
- Take the edge off a little bit.

630
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,119
Perhaps you can try again
later and the lines will work.

631
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,748
- Oh, this is good.

632
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,834
- I'm glad you like it.

633
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,544
- Yes.

634
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,130
Yes, I do.

635
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:11,591
Tell me.

636
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,059
Do you really live here?

637
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,354
- We're staying here,
just for a little while.

638
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,563
- [Moby] Oh, who's we?

639
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,357
- Myself and my friend.

640
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,234
- Oh really, yes.

641
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,694
- Am I interrupting?

642
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,071
- Not at all, Mr. Moby
here was telling me.

643
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,990
- Oh, please, please!

644
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,075
Mr. Moby, Mr. Moby's like my dad.

645
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,076
- Moby?

646
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,162
- [Theodora] Found him
on the side of the road,

647
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,415
his car broke down.

648
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,666
His cell phone doesn't work,

649
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,085
and apparently our lines are down too.

650
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,713
- That's too bad.

651
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,715
If you call again

652
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,048
after a while...
- Oh, they might be up,

653
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,426
yes, yes, I know.

654
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,635
Damn it!

655
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,432
That is so nice.

656
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,433
- Have some more.

657
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,604
- Where were you going?
- To a party.

658
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,733
- What's the old saying?

659
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,985
The party's where you at.

660
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,236
- Something like that.

661
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,447
- My sentiments exactly.

662
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:24,790
Oh yeah.

663
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,084
Oh yeah.

664
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,085
1940.

665
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:30,962
- Pardon me?

666
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,511
- This vintage.
- Oh.

667
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,264
Much, much older.

668
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,350
- (gasps) What was that?

669
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,313
(suspenseful music)

670
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,450
- What's wrong?

671
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,497
- I had the tablet translated today.

672
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,040
- Really?

673
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,000
Why didn't you tell me?

674
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,336
What did it say?

675
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,299
- It translated to, "With silver"

676
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,385
and "At the eater of flesh".

677
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,386
(pounding)
(gasps)

678
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,512
What the hell?

679
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:03,430
- Oh my god.

680
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,598
(gasping)

681
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:06,850
- Jesus.
- Oh my god!

682
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,687
(Dietrich coughs)

683
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,105
He looks like he lost a lot of blood.

684
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,648
- Fuck, there's no signal.

685
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,483
- [Sky] We have to get him to a hospital!

686
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,234
- [Morrissey] Start up the car.

687
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,069
- [Dietrich] Theodora!

688
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,444
- Who?

689
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,280
- [Sky] One of the women.

690
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,488
- [Morrissey] Aw, they're
probably hurt too.

691
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,115
I better go up there and check.

692
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,491
- [Sky] You can't leave me here.

693
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,492
- [Morrissey] They might
have a phone up there,

694
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,870
I have to go check at least.

695
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,246
- Please!
- Fuck.

696
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,707
Christ, Sky, the man's
dying and you wanna argue?

697
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,833
What's the matter with you?

698
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,834
I'll be right back.

699
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,798
(serene piano music)

700
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,157
(tense music)

701
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,631
Hello!

702
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:02,234
(ominous classical music)

703
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:09,116
(banging)

704
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:14,204
(suspenseful rock music)

705
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,004
(screams)

706
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,573
(Morrissey coughs)

707
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,659
(groans)

708
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,980
(Elenora screams)

709
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,740
(groans)

710
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,653
- Morrissey!

711
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,041
God, please no.

712
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,042
No.

713
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,961
God, no.

714
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:29,881
No.

715
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,887
(suspenseful rock music)

716
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,521
(whimpers)

717
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,081
Oh god, oh god.

718
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,133
(ominous music)

719
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,135
Oh god!

720
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,178
Stop!

721
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,179
Okay, stop!

722
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:20,806
Stop!

723
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,019
Hey!

724
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,020
Stop.

725
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,280
(Elenora wails)

726
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,990
- [Theodora] Wanna see you dead!

727
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:40,576
Come on, pretty lady, come out here!

728
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,577
- Leave me alone!

729
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,287
(women laugh)

730
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:44,288
Please!

731
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:47,625
Leave me alone!
- Oh, Sky!

732
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,044
- Leave me alone!

733
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,212
Stop!

734
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,341
Leave me alone, please.

735
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,634
Please!

736
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,097
- [Elenora] Come on!

737
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:09,856
(yelps)

738
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,108
- What are you doing?

739
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,442
Why are you doing this?

740
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,861
Why are you doing this to me?

741
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,947
How can you be so cruel?

742
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,366
- [Theodora] We're vampires.

743
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,704
- Please, please don't kill me.

744
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:28,165
You made that sign on my forehead.

745
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,333
You said it would protect me.

746
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:30,669
- Not against us.

747
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,754
There are options.

748
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,884
Shall I turn you, make you one of us?

749
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:40,595
A sister in darkness?

750
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,680
A sister of sorrows.

751
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,350
We've long sought a third
to complete our triumvirate.

752
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,977
Or you could come back here in 1,000 years

753
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,271
and discover this place all over again!

754
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,564
Wouldn't you like that, huh?

755
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,566
You would, wouldn't you, you little bitch!

756
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:56,611
Oh, don't you wanna
know what it feels like

757
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,446
to taste the blood?

758
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:02,241
To feel the hot flesh melt like butter.

759
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:04,452
And taste the blood and feel
it rush up into your mouth

760
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,579
and down your throat.

761
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,831
Taste the life within that blood!

762
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,876
Taste the memories, taste the pain.

763
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,963
Taste the love and the lust
and the hate and the fear!

764
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,090
And the regret?

765
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,093
The regret that the pleasure
you feel as we suck you dry

766
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,596
will not last forever!

767
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,972
(giggles)

768
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,976

769

770

(screeches)

771
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,047
She would have joined us!

772
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,300
- She was soiled with child.

773
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:12,061
Enough games, end it now.

774
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,062
Kill him!

775
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:22,947
- Too late.

776
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,417
- Damn you!

777
