1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,401
No one claps, 'cause...

2
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,099
- I clap.
- Well, you...

3
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,538
Well, no one can hear it right
because it doesn't sound right.

4
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:19,802
It's off.

5
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:22,326
Fred's audio isn't modulated properly.
That's the problem.

6
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,459
Yeah, but if he gets a better system,

7
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,504
he might start
charging us for drinks.

8
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:31,727
He's giving me shit about new songs.

9
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,966
He can't even get a monitor
that doesn't cut out every two minutes.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,079
You gotta maintain
your equipment.

11
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,390
- You gotta point your toe.
- Okay.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,783
He wants new songs?

13
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,437
Ow!

14
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,352
Oh, no!

15
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,789
I can't just
crank them out like pancakes.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,664
Hey, let's make pancakes.

17
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:18,816
Hello?

18
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,126
Yes, this is he.

19
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,070
What, Marcus?

20
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,334
- Why haven't you picked up the phone?
- I'm sleeping.

21
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,423
What if it was serious,
and you're not answering?

22
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,947
But I did answer.

Hi.

58

Bill Tully, Alex's dad.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,788
Oh, sorry.
It's been a while.

00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,703
I'm sorry about your folks.

How are you?

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,689
I'm sorry. "How are you?"
That's a dumb thing to say!

68
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,300
Aw, I'm sorry, buddy.

00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,433
How are you holding up?

70
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,002
I'm fine.

71
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,831
Really. I mean, the truth is
I barely knew them, so...

72
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,485
things are much easier.

73
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,923
I could see that
making it much harder.

74
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,448
No, it's easier.

75
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:23,671
Where are we putting this stuff?

76
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,282
Oh. Um,
just find somewhere to stash that.

77
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,588
Okay.

78
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,078
- We'll see you in there.
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,425
Hi.

80
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,869
So, now that you're here,
I can probably take off, right?

81
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,132
- You got this?
- Oh, yeah.

82
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,240
If you wanna go, let's get the fuck out
of here. I don't have to go in there.

83
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,919
You can't go anywhere.

84
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,532
I mean, someone has
to stay and comfort these... people.

85
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,498
Still waiting for it to hit me.

86
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,804
What if it doesn't?

87
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,851
Oh, God! Look at these.

88
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:16,982
You remember those? They brought those
home for Christmas when we were kids.

89
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,467
I remember.

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,993
Michelle dear, oh!

91
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,692
- And, Marcus.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,825
Marcus dear!

93
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,612
I'm so sorry for your loss.

94
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,136
And both at the same time!

95
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,573
Yes, it's very sad.
Thank you...

96
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:40,704
Yes.

97
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:41,966
For coming.

98
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,621
They would have truly
appreciated it.

99
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,669
You know, they were saints.

100
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:50,975
They really were.

101
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,412
Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:53,587
Saints.

103
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,023
That's what I hear.

104
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,681
Are we terrible people?

105
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,596
We can't be.
We're the children of saints.

106
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:07,557
When Andy and Marian Brinks
first came to my village,

107
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:08,863
I was 11 years old.

108
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:15,435
And to me, they were more
than doctors or aid workers.

109
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,002
They were family.

110
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,618
I biked here
from Silver Lake tonight.

111
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:28,491
And to this day,
every time I ride a bicycle,

112
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:29,927
I remember these two people...

113
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,281
these two beautiful people

114
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,678
who taught me how to ride, who taught my
whole village how to ride bicycles.

115
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,288
Oh, my God!

116
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,248
Most of us will truly touch
only a few lives.

117
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:51,732
Andy and Marian touched
thousands and thousands of lives.

118
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:52,863
Thank you.

119
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,740
At this time, we invite
the next of kin to speak.

120
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,796
You're gonna be great.

121
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,498
I know.

122
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:40,694
Well, thank you
for being here... today.

123
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,185
My parents...

124
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:07,634
they would have just loved
to see all of you here.

125
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,943
They would have just loved it.

126
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,738
A moving and concise tribute.

127
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,835
Yeah, yeah, you used to ask me
to give you a massage during pre-calc.

128
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,117
- How do you not remember that?
- I don't remember that at all.

129
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,753
- You're lying! You're lying.
- I'm not.

130
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,885
So, your mom never showed.

131
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,279
She doesn't wanna see you.

132
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,890
Well, I'm not exactly
dying to see her either,

133
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,500
but I came.

134
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,982
She called. She talked
to Marcus for a while.

135
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,593
Well, did she send anything?

136
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,246
Yeah, the orchids.

137
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,989
- Typical!
- Stop!

138
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,339
Let me tell you something.
They were angels on Earth.

139
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,211
They were such
spectacular people.

140
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,655

141
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,614

142
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,006

00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,791

a bike with Dad.

144
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,010
I never once rode a bike
with Dad. Did you?

145
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,361
We had Big Wheels in Haiti.

146
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,190
They're off fixing harelips,
teaching mandolin to UNICEF kids,

147
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,889
and we're at home,

It's your turn.

199
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,645
The two of you have been named

200
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,214
as the, uh,
equal benefactors in the estate,

201
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:46,303
which should be really simple,

202
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:49,698
but your parents' finances,
unfortunately, are a mess.

203
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,570
Did they confide in you at all
about their finances?

204
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,181
They haven't.

205
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,009
No, me either.

206
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,499
They've been living
all over the world for the last 15 years

207
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,318
in the developing countries.

208
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:08,151
I could not find
any money in any bank.

209
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,414
Their records are
in nine different languages.

210
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,764
So, what are we supposed to do?

211
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,203
Well, if we had some paperwork,
that could certainly...

212
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:18,901
Sorry.

213
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,563
Uh, I've been
on the phone to Sri Lanka,

214
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:32,088
and I got a tracking number for a
delivery that's coming to your house.

215
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,221
What are they sending?

216
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:37,354
They're sending paperwork
and personal belongings.

217
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:40,314
I... don't want
any of their belongings.

218
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:44,274
No, you don't
want your parents' personal belongings.

219
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,016
But you might want
that paperwork,

220
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:50,150
because if you don't
have the paperwork,

221
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,587
it would take a very long time

222
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,546
for those assets
to change hands.

223
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,375
So, you want the paperwork.

224
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,724
Okay.

225
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,598
Okay.

226
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:06,340
So, get the paperwork,

227
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,777
and I'll divvy up the assets
between the two of you.

228
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,607
Right now, the only thing
that I have confirmed, um...

229
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,305
the, uh, California property.

230
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,394
Wait. The land in Joshua Tree?

231
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,744
That was promised to me,
so we're not divvying that up.

232
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,444
Yes, the land in Joshua Tree
and, uh... your house.

233
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,750
- Whose house?
- Your house.

234
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,579
The house you live in
in Highland Park.

235
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,495
No, that's my home.

236
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,367
Alex and I bought it from them.

237
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,543
That's not what it says here.

238
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,763
What it says here is that you are the
guarantor on the mortgage agreement,

239
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:42,028
and that the house is still
in your parents' name.

240
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,725
So your house is
Mom and Dad's house?

241
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,380
It's not Mom and Dad's house.
It's my house.

242
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,338
They helped us out
on the down payment.

243
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,189
Alex and I pay the mortgage.
It's our house.

244
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,168
Doesn't sound like it.

245
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,648
Why don't you come back...

246
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,607
when you have the paperwork?

247
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,612
- So, we're renters?
- We're not renters.

248
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:05,007
Mom and Dad's names
are still on the house. That's all.

249
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,400
Oh, my God!

250
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,010
I just think it's amazing.

251
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,770
I haven't gotten
a birthday present since I was 10,

252
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,144
but you, they get a house.

253
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,406
It was a wedding present.

254
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,731
I thought their present
was the Vitamix.

255
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,104
It was both.

256
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,237
Of course they got you
a Vitamix too.

257
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,239
I said we weren't ready
to buy a house.

258
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,632
Listen, they gave us
a down payment.

259
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,331
We took over the mortgage.
We pay it every month.

260
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,246
It's our house.

261
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:29,118
But they never put
your names on the deed, so it's our house.

262
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,208
Should we paint a line
down the middle?

263
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,775
Your half? My half?

264
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,709
Maybe that's what Mom and Dad
would have liked.

265
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,953
Mom and Dad would have
bought you a house

266
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:41,391
if you ever stuck around
or kept in touch with them.

267
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,393
Kept in touch?
You hated Mom and Dad.

268
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,700
But I e-mailed them.

269
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,139
I am learning a lot
about the Brinks family.

270
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,054
You're in the Brinks family.

271
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:58,060
All right,
these top shelves are for you.

272
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,192
You can unpack.

273
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,845
I'm not staying that long.

274
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,371
Look, it's not a problem.
I can move all this stuff, okay?

275
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:07,156
I want you to unpack, settle in.

276
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,637
That's nice, really,

277
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,465
but I'm not gonna
be here that long.

278
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,075
I can just live
out of my suitcase.

279
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,294
Let's get you unpacked.

280
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,385
Hey, Marcus...

281
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,169
- Come on.
- Come on.

282
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
- Give it to me.
- Marcus.

283
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,826
- Ow!
- Let go.

284
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,523
You got a problem?

285
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,414
- Come on. Come on.
- Marcus, give me my bag.

286
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,937
Marcus, give me my...
I don't know what's in it.

287
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,659
- Just let me...
- Give me my stuff!

288
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,879
God damn it! Come on!
Just let...

289
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,928
Ow! Come on!

290
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,845
Ow! Not the...
You know my back is sensitive.

291
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,717
Let go! Get off me!
Get off! Get off!

292
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,772
I put the good pink towels
in the guest bath,

293
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,730
but I forgot shampoo and stuff.

294
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,541
- Okay.
- You think Michelle needs shampoo?

295
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,387
I don't know.

296
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,736
I'll ask her in the morning.

297
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:14,702
You know, you look very sexy when you put
on that green, crazy face.

298
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,878
Yeah, I bet.

299
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:20,360
It's like this is your true,
alien lizard face

300
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,666
under your human lady skin mask.

301
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:30,718
Let's breed a half-human
half-lizard super-race...

302
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,676
- Babe, come on.
- to rule the world.

303
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,504
Come on! Come on!

304
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,463
Hey. Hey! Stop! Stop.

305
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,471
Aargh!

306
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,649
Sorry. This just
doesn't feel right.

307
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,085
I mean, you're grieving.

308
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:54,568
Grieving? Screw that!
We're here. They're gone.

309
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,483
Fuck them!

310
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,225
Hey, don't say that.

311
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,143
I'm just trying to make love
to my beautiful wife.

312
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,147
Can't we just do that still?

313
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:21,856
My lizard planet has sent me here

314
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:26,295
to study human mating rituals,

315
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:31,213
and I must beam back
a thorough report

316
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,563
on the subject very soon.

317
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,479
Okay.

318
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,570
- Just don't say, "Fuck them."
- Okay.

319
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,922
You don't really feel that way.

320
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,712
- Okay.
- Okay.

321
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:52,842

I don't keep my eye on the ball,

- Whatever. They're wrong.

338
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,450
You gotta show me
that western grip. It's beautiful.

339
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,103
And that backhand...

340
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,236
I love that follow-through.
It's perfect.

Okay, now stop.

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,244
Now, slow. Slow.

345
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,767
Slow.

346
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,292
Good. Okay, little circles.

347
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,815
Little circles.

348
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,469
And now, faster, faster, faster.

349
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,601
Faster, faster.

350
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,300
Okay, actually...
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

351
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,475
What's the matter?

352
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,868
I just... This is wrong.

353
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,308
Ugh! This is totally...
This is terrible. Let me fix the angle.

354
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:53,094
Why don't we move the seat back, and I
can recline it, and then I'll be able to...

355
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,115
- No.
- We can get in the backseat. Wanna get in the backseat?

356
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,619
No, the whole thing is just...

357
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,534
just wrong.

358
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,057
Oh, I thought you wanted...

359
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,103
Yeah, it was an idea I had.

360
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,584
It was a good idea.

361
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,716
- It was a real good idea.
- Ugh!

362
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:10,851
"Ugh"? What do you mean "ugh"?

363
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,679
Sorry. I'm not feeling it.

364
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,849
You're not feeling it, okay.
I did not instigate it.

365
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,963
Don't give me a hard time.
You picked me up at a funeral.

366
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:19,338
I didn't pick you up.
I thought we were playing tennis.

367
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,251
Can you take me home?

368
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:50,673
Holy shit!

369
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,852
Oh, my gosh!

370
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,550
Babe!

371
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,552
Check it out!

372
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:00,683
Holy shit!

373
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,772
I know! Damn right!

374
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,862
Yeah, we grew it from seed!

375
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,627
- Marcus Brinks?
- Yeah?

376
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:34,108
I got a lot of shit
for you, man.

377
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,682
All right, so I'm confirming
delivery of 24 parcels,

378
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,641
including one bio-shipping crate with
live animal contents,

379
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:46,903
and that is everything.

380
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,209
Live animal contents?

381
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:50,037
Yeah, one live mammal,
30 pounds.

382
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,039
A mammal?
Nobody said anything about an animal.

383
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,650
Your parents had
a thirty-pound monkey?

384
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:55,912
It's not a monkey.

385
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,175
Oh, hi, little guy.

386
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,829
Don't be scared.

387
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,459
If I could just
get a signature, I'll be on my way.

388
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,138
You can delivery animals
to people who don't want them?

389
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:06,880
No, if you refuse delivery,
it just goes back on my truck.

390
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,161
Great. Thank you.
Take it away.

391
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,536
No, I mean it all goes
back on the truck.

392
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,586
What are we gonna do with this thing?

393
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,241
It's cute.
He looks like a bear.

394
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:21,547
Shouldn't be too hard

395
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,940
to find a home
for a cute-looking bear.

396
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,552
We can't get rid of him.
It's your parents' pet.

397
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,902
This is not a pet.
They didn't keep pets.

398
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,686
This is some kind
of jungle beast.

399
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,166
It probably lived
under their car.

400
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,081
What the fuck is all this?

401
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,875
Were you guys expecting
this much stuff?

402
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,878
I wasn't expecting any of this.

403
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,880
I was expecting, like, one box

404
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,163
with some fucking jewels,
and bank statements, and financial forms.

405
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,667
I don't know
what any of this shit is.

406
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,193
It's like every stupid thing
they ever owned.

407
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:03,153
Oh, good!
Their disgusting toiletries.

408
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,113
Here, look, I've inherited
Dad's denture bath.

409
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,071
You've inherited?
That's half mine.

410
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,945
Jell-O mold. That's cool.

411
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,077
Hey, focus up.

412
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,646
We're looking
for documents, okay?

413
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,430
No paperwork, Paul.

414
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,408
I don't know who you talked to,
but they didn't send any documents.

415
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,870
They managed to ship
a goddamned pet dog,

416
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,959
but not a single piece of paper.

417
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,806
Oh, and, yeah, my parents'
ice cube tray, too.

418
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,286
Oh, hey, listen,
just make yourself at home.

419
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,853
I'm sorry we're leaving you
here by yourself.

420
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,226
Oh, please, I'll be fine.

421
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,073
We have all the movie channels,
and if you want...

422
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,926
Honestly, I'm glad
to finally be rid of you two assholes.

423
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,319
I don't doubt that.

424
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:40,451
Hey, come on.
Let's go. I'm late.

425
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,715
Yeah, I know it doesn't help.
That's what I'm saying.

426
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,368
Just send me the phone number.

427
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,283
I'll call over there
in the morning.

428
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,024
See what this is all about.

429
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,410
They do have phones, right?

430
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,074
Is any of this shit yours?

431
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,556
You got, like, a toy or a bone
or something in here?

432
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:37,291
- Hello.
- Hi.

433
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,949
There's a dog
in your front yard.

434
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,909
Oh, yeah.
It came in the mail.

435
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,695
Along with the rest
of this shit.

436
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:50,825
What is all this?

437
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,002
My parents' stuff.

438
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,133
Oh, yeah?

439
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,006
Wow!

440
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,704
It's, like, everything
they ever owned.

441
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,143
- I'm looking for Alex.
- Everybody is working tonight.

442
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:06,015
No one is home
to appreciate this look I'm cultivating.

443
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:08,365
Classy.

444
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,107
Is this look working?

445
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,631
Yes, against you.

446
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:20,290
All the best people
are from La Jolla, Michelle.

447
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,205
Gregory Peck was
from La Jolla, you know.

448
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:23,656
Have you looked
through all these?

449
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,819
- What are those?
- Home movies.

450
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,691
"Maury's wedding."

451
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,216
"Fourth of July
on Erdman Avenue."

452
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,958
A bunch of cousins I never met.

453
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,397
Hmm. That must
have come in handy during monsoon season.

454
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:45,359
Which children
need malaria pills?

455
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,927
Line them up.
I'm here to save them.

456
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:52,671
In my pink caftan
and my blue eyeshadow.

457
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,284
I better go.

458
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,068
Tell Alex I stopped by,
all right?

459
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,287
Don't go.

460
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,724
I'm alone here with all this...

461
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,163
Stay and have a drink with me?

462
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,643
Will you?

463
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:09,774
One drink.

464
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:11,690
Sit.

465
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,693
Wait over there.

466
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,942
Yeah, Michelle, I think
I'm gonna get going.

467
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,466
I'm gonna take a rain check
on that drink, okay?

468
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,304
Oh, honey, no!

469
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,742
What in the world are you doing?

470
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:09,791
You always do
the right thing, don't you?

471
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,228
Not always, but now.

472
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,903
How about now?

473
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:11,171
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Are you sure they're not gonna come home?

474
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,202
They're out for the night.

475
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:22,124
This is such a bad idea!

476
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,386
I know.

477
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,960
It's Dr... Hmm?

478
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,614
No, no, no!

479
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:38,401
I've been on hold for...
three hours already, basically.

480
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,970
Brinks!

481
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,327
Look, I've been through
everything, every box. It's all junk.

482
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,155
I need paperwork.

483
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,853
No, don't put me
on hold again. Damn it!

484
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,376
Morning.

485
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,944
I've been on the phone
for an hour. This is insane.

486
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,293
Do you want me to talk to them?

487
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:01,424
Hello? Yes?

488
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,341
Yes? Hello?

489
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,171
No, this is Marcus Brinks. Where's the
person I was just talking to a minute ago?

490
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,607
The last person!

491
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:13,045
No, don't put me on... Fuck!

492
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,438
Hey, it's okay.
We'll get it taken care of.

493
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:16,439
It's not okay.

494
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,138
I'm stuck in a loop.

495
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:22,141
This is gonna take
the pressure off.

496
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,273
It's gonna give me
some fucking breathing room.

497
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,493
I need this! Aah!

498
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,060
Ow!

499
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,018
Are you okay?

500
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,499
I'm stuck in a loop.
Oh, fuck!

501
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:37,156
It's not exactly
a pain in the ears,

502
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,550
but there are balance issues.
That's the ears, right?

503
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,900
Balance issues?

504
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,556
I just feel like
I wanna lie down a lot of the time.

505
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,558
That doesn't really sound
like a balance issue.

506
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,560
It sounds like fatigue.

507
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:53,346
Are you experiencing
any dizziness or vertigo?

508
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,217
Yes, totally,

509
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,306
and disorientation,

510
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:01,963
and something that
has located itself in my glands.

511
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,880
Those are your lymph nodes.

512
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,099
Oh.

513
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,362
There's no swelling.

514
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,799
Is there tenderness?
Does this hurt?

515
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,717
Not so much tender
as, like... I'm aware of them.

516
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:21,417
I just feel like one shouldn't be so
aware of their own lymph nodes.

517
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,680
There's no cure
for lymph node awareness.

518
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,205
Once you know they exist,
the knowledge is permanent.

519
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,470
I just don't feel right, Doc.

520
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,624
Hey.

521
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:57,323
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see you.

522
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,653
You can't come here to see me.

523
00:32:58,715 --> 00:32:59,779
They're gonna be
back any minute.

524
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,153
I come here all the time.

525
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,329
Let me take you out to lunch.
Come on. Let's go.

526
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,085
Last night was a random act

527
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,652
of horrible,
self-indulgent behavior.

528
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,134
It was wonderful.

529
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:27,396
Once.

530
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:38,233
God! You're so beautiful.

531
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:39,756
Take off your shoes.

532
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,628
No, thank you.

533
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,325
Come on.

534
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:47,112
You get nutrients
through your feet. Walk with me.

535
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,548
I'm not taking
my shoes off here.

536
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,594
All right.

537
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:56,251
But, you know,
the Earth gives you all of its electricity

538
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:57,782
into your body
up through your feet.

539
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,343
It's electric.

540
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:04,085
It's cosmic.

541
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:06,522
You are a goofball hippie

542
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:10,178
with a head full
of half-baked bullshit.

543
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,442
Well, you're a hairy,
fire-fighting ape

544
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,401

Uh-huh. Hello?
Can you hear me?

554
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:55,397
Okay, folder, yellow folder.
Folder is good.

555
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:59,706
Does it have forms, like, financial-type
bank statement things?

556
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,664
Fax! Yes!

557
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,536
Yes, I have
the lawyer's fax number.

558
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,066
I will send you his fax number... Yes!
to send the papers.

559
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,628
- Alex!
- What?

560
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:11,587
The clinic has the...

561
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:14,982
papers!

562
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,550

563
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,118
- The clinic has the papers!
- The clinic has the papers!

564
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:23,860
The clinic has the papers!
The clinic has the papers!

565
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:27,168
Well, we have four days on,
and then four overnights,

566
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,692
and then four days off.

567
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,825
What do you do all night
in a firehouse?

568
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,827
Sleep.

569
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,437
You don't fight fires at night?

570
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:36,830
Only if there's a fire.

571
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,414
I could get used
to that schedule.

572
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,491
It's hell on a marriage.

573
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,188
I'll bet.

574
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,634
Alex invited me for dinner
tonight at the house, the four of us.

575
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:01,463
Yeah, right.

576
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,641
Are you crazy?

577
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,295
You can't come over
for dinner tonight.

578
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,647
Alex invited me.
What was I supposed to say?

579
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,179
I guess I'll see you for dinner.

580
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:26,793

What are you looking at?

587
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,858
Mmm. You want some of this?

588
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,035
There's plenty to go around.

589
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,647
Get you a little dish.
You're gonna love it.

590
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:57,563
Huh? Try it.

591
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,960
You don't want that?
You don't like it?

592
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:10,836
Hello?

593
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,969
Hi! Yay! I can hear you.

594
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,493
What are you talking about?

595
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:15,948
I rented a car.
My Bluetooth works.

596
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,123
I was just testing it.
Okay, bye.

597
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:18,801
Wait. Hold on.
Why did you rent a car?

598
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:22,109
Um, I figured I'd be stuck here
for a few days at least

599
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,200
waiting for Mom and Dad's
money stuff to work out.

600
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,896
- They found all the paperwork.
- Oh.

601
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,811
They're sending it
over to Paul as we speak.

602
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,466
Okay, great.
Well, whatever.

603
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,917
I have a car,
and I'm headed home.

604
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,817
Are you feeling better?

605
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,428
I feel like a million bucks.
You wanna go out and do something?

606
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,391
Let's turn it around, baby.

607
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,611
Yeah! The clinic has
the papers!

608
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,788
Sure does, and I'm feeling tip-top!

609
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:51,399
Great! Are you gonna hang
around here and write today,

610
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,662
or are you gonna
come to the store with me?

611
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,925
What? No, I'm going out.

612
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,362
With who?

613
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,102
Oh, Michelle. She rented a car.

614
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,279
My dad is coming over
for dinner.

615
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:05,674
Great. Oh, you should go ahead and scrub
down the grill if we're gonna cook out.

616
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,894
There's a lot of spiderwebs.

617
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:10,462
Hey! Hello!

618
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:11,592
Sorry. Love you.

619
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,920
So, you thought about what
you're gonna do after this?

620
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,860
- What do you mean?
- You gonna move back to Philly?

621
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,949
- It's where I live.
- Now.

622
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,475
I mean, you live
anywhere you want to, but I live here.

623
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:26,086
Mm-hmm. I lived here already.

624
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,610
When I move,
I like to go somewhere new.

625
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,656
Don't you miss California?

626
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:31,786
I do miss California.

627
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,441
Mm-hmm.
We could use you.

628
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:34,940
You ever thought
about settling down,

629
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,792
just for a little while,
with your big bro?

630
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:39,621
I'm not thinking
about settling anywhere.

631
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,971
Fine, not settling down.

632
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,862
Settling down is for squares.
Fuck settling down.

633
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,932
But settling in?

634
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:48,456
Oh, man! Come on.
It's the best!

635
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,458
- Stop saying "settling."
- No, I will not.

636
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,025
Settling in is...

637
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:55,811
What about roll?
Like roll into town for a while.

638
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:58,945
Yeah, that's better.

639
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:02,427
Just roll around nice and slow,

640
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,995
and then you just roll...
to a stop.

641
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,650
- Uh-huh?
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,478
Oh, I get it.
You got a guy back there?

643
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,088
- No.
- Right.

644
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,742
- Not at all.
- I know you.

645
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,527
You think you know me?

646
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:18,965
I sort of know you.

647
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,576
Uh, sweetheart,
cut the lemons into circles

648
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,946
and quarter the limes.
And would you pass me that pepper?

649
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,406
We should get a Jacuzzi.

650
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:26,799
Gross!

651
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,671
- No, everybody loves a hot tub.
- You see?

652
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,388
Yeah, everyone
who's into staph infections.

653
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:35,242
- If we had one, you'd be in it every night.
- Gross!

654
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,549
These mushrooms
don't have any butter.

655
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,941
That is not my fault.

656
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:41,640
Butter kills.
Olive oil is a superfood.

657
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,599
Sweetheart, I was raised
on bacon and butter sandwiches.

658
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,646
So were your grandparents.
They lived well into their 90s.

659
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:49,474
How long do you think
I wanna live?

660
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:52,124
Nice old-timer story.
How much did you pay for a gallon of milk?

661
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:53,652
I had to squeeze
the teats myself.

662
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:54,957
Dad!

663
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,611
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

664
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:58,004
No, it doesn't.

665
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,019
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

666
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,934
You're fucking Bill?

667
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,807
You're out of your mind.

668
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,071
Bullshit! I know
what you look like when you're in heat.

669
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:25,031
"Oh, I like it
when you old-timers squeeze my teats."

670
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:26,336
Oh, my God!

671
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,121
That's not even close
to what I said.

672
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,688
So, you're denying this?

673
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,082
I was right.
Jesus Christ!

674
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,520
Michelle, you're fucking
with a long-standing marriage.

675
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,611
A marriage is a bond
between two people,

676
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:40,742
my wife's parents.

677
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:41,961
They're separated.

678
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:44,833
They do this all the time.

679
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,985
They split up. They realize that
they're better off together.

680
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,098
They patch it up.
It's what they do.

681
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,057
- He's not happy.
- They're Alex's parents.

682
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,668
She doesn't want them
to split up.

683
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:56,802
- Are you working against us?
- What do you want me to say?

684
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:59,065
Uh, that you're a selfish,
flaky, fucked-up person,

685
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:00,849
who can only think
about herself.

686
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,590
- Come on, Marcus.
- This has to end.

687
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,071
It will.

688
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,770
The paperwork is here,
and I'm gonna be gone in a couple of days.

689
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,364
This is really delicious,
Dad. Thank you.

690
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,149
The trick is you squirt the steaks with
lime juice before

691
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,847
and then after the grill.

692
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,196
Mmm.

693
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:45,720
Steaks?
Swordfish, right?

694
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:47,940
We're eating fish, not steaks.

695
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,160
Yeah, it's a fish,
but the cut is called a steak.

696
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:55,730
Well, in this house,
steaks come from cows.

697
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,385
Don't serve fish
and call it a steak.

698
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,997
All right,
got it, buddy. It won't happen again.

699
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:05,261
It's just that there's
a moral issue at play here.

700
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,176
What moral issue?

701
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,179
A cut of fish
can be a steak. That's a...

702
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,964
I'm talking
about personal ethics here.

703
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:13,534
Did you just kick me
under the table?

704
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,012
Stop.

705
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:19,624
It's a steak.

706
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,017
You cut a fish longways,
it's a fillet.

707
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:24,106
You cut it sideways,
it's... it's a steak.

708
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,804
I don't know what to tell you.

709
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:28,850
Who cares what
the cut is called, hmm?

710
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,179
Just, sometimes, you have
to examine your behavior, you know?

711
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:39,774
It's like...
Like, why do we behave the way we behave?

712
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:42,864
- You're behaving like an asshole.
- What is going on?

713
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:48,478
It's just that people who know about this
kind of thing would say

714
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:54,310
that it's morally irresponsible
to take a fish like this...

715
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,923
out of the ocean...

716
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:02,623
snatch it
from the jaws of life...

717
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:07,367
for our carnal pleasure.

718
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:09,021
You know what I mean?

719
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,153
It's like we can
get by without it,

720
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:13,591
but yet, we feel deserve it.

721
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:18,291
Do you think that
there's a lot of swordfish left?

722
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,295
There aren't.

723
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,953
Well, there were a lot of them
down at the seafood market at Pico.

724
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,610
Right.

725
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,220
Oh, I gotta go play.

726
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:37,527
No, you said
you had the night off.

727
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,355
Yeah, it just came up last-minute.

728
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,183
Marcus, please don't leave.

729
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:45,057
I gotta get.
Last-minute, so...

730
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:49,365
Babe, gotta go.
Love you. Sorry. Um...

731
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,019
Good night, everyone.

732
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,934
Thanks for the steak dinner.

733
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:03,031
Sorry, Dad. I don't even know
what's wrong with him.

734
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:11,083
There's some pretty top-notch Red Communist,
Garfield stuff up on eBay right now,

735
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:14,042
which is awesome.

736
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,698
But I also saw
this whole strip just dedicated

737
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:23,312
to Dennis the Menace having
a very special relationship with a priest.

738
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:32,887
A friend of mine has
an original Blondie strip

739
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:36,412
where Dagwood is hugging Hitler.

740
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:40,416
- Wow.
- Just hugging him.

741
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,244
Just hugging him up.
Just hugging it out.

742
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,985
You know
who the king is, though?

743
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:48,163
The guy who did Andy Capp.

744
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:51,210
Because for every
Andy Capp strip

745
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,169
where, like, Andy Capp,
"Oh, I don't have a job,"

746
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,042
or, like, Andy Capp is just drinking at
the pub with his friends,

747
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:59,871
there's another strip
where Andy Capp and his wife

748
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:03,135
are, like, really, really
pushing the envelope,

749
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:07,487
and I'm talking, like...
sexually speaking.

750
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:13,449
Wait. S&M,
bondage, role playing?

751
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:18,759
All that stuff.
They were pro-sexual.

752
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,283
They were evolved, you know?

753
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:24,460
But not a single one
of those strips ever made it to print

754
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,288
because of the powers that be.

755
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,337
Fucking pencil necks!

756
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,775
It's not right.
It's not right.

757
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:37,735
You know what?

758
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:40,563
Who are they?

759
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:44,524
You're goddamned right!
Who are they to tell us,

760
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:47,962
you know, like, what we can see
and what we can't see?

761
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:49,529
You know, we're just Americans.

762
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:51,879
We're trying
to, like, better ourselves

763
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,229
and learn about our bodies.

764
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,231
You know, and you got
this great strip

765
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:59,104
where Flo has just got
her hair up in curlers,

766
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:03,761
and Andy Capp is just popping a bowling
pin up her ass, you know?

767
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:07,242
And she is loving it.

768
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:10,245
The only thing sticking out
is that little nubby thing, but she is...

769
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:11,638
He's behind her, right?

770
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,381
And he's just,
like, twisting it.

771
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,036
But it's like
these two married people

772
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,908
just having a really nice
moment together.

773
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:29,308
Swordfish.

774
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:32,528
Swordfish. I liked it.

775
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:36,271
You're wearing
the necklace I made you for your wedding.

776
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,404
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

777
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,103
I wear it all the time.

778
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,757
I make earrings now
if you want them.

779
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,498
No, thanks.

780
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,761
I can't...

781
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:51,243
When I work with kids,
they yank on my earrings.

782
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:56,291
So, I'm scared
they'll rip my ears apart.

783
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,513
Right on.

784
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:02,003
I didn't know
you worked with kids.

785
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:04,256
I do. I did.

786
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:09,043
But, um, it wasn't
really paying well,

787
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:12,481
so I'm back to waiting tables.

788
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,354
That sucks.

789
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,269
It does.

790
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,490
Yeah.

791
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:25,494
But Marcus, uh, he...

792
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:32,545
teaches piano lessons
to help out.

793
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:36,592
But you can't write songs

794
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:40,292
when you're working
full-time, so...

795
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:43,121
- You know what you gotta do?
- Hmm?

796
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,645
Is teach Marcus
how to wait tables...

797
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:48,517
and you go back to the school.

798
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:54,567
Before I add the flecks,
we wanna heat up the metal.

799
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:57,309
So, let's get
our safety goggles on,

800
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,354
and we'll get
a little heat going.

801
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:04,142
You really wanna have
a circular motion.

802
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:05,970
Let me get a little
more heat on here.

803
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:10,931
And hard solder here.

804
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:13,760
- Hello?
- Hi. Are you still up?

805
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,283
We really got to heat things up.

806
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:16,719
I am.

807
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,225
- Hi.
- Hey, come on in.

808
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,488
I went to the store.

809
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,839
- Great! What did you get?
- I went to the sex store.

810
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,277
Not what I thought
you were gonna say, but okay.

811
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,540
- Are you okay with that?
- How could I not be?

812
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,369
What is a sex store?

813
00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:00,589
This is a pretty
sad bachelor pad you found yourself, Bill.

814
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,765
You're lucky I'm here.

815
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:05,638
A sex store is
where they sell sex toys.

816
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,207
Let's fuck like rabbits.

817
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:13,385
- Who wears that? You or me?
- You tell me.

818
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:16,170
I need to tell you, though.
I have a low threshold for pain.

819
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:19,739
If you melt wax on my nipples,
I'm gonna scream like a pig.

820
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:22,742
That's sort of the point.

821
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:25,179
- All right. All right.
- Tight.

822
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,573
- Really tight?
- Yeah, really tight.

823
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:29,705
- Is that too much?
- No, tighter.

824
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:32,360
Or is... That's the last hole.

825
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:33,491
Okay.

826
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,457
All right, give me this one.

827
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:50,117
I swear to God, I never know
what to expect next from you.

828
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:53,251
Whip me.

829
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,643
What?

830
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:56,515
Do you wanna get the whip?

831
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,256
- Do you wanna whip me?
- Yeah, yeah.

832
00:49:58,386 --> 00:49:59,822
Okay, it's in the other room.

833
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:01,563
- All right, I'll go.
- In the bag.

834
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:02,694
All right, I'll get it.

835
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:03,738
Okay.

836
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:19,102
Hmm.

837
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:51,570
Oh, honey, don't cry.

838
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,659
Did I take too long?

839
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,487
I was just...
I was choosing a whip.

840
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:59,708
That was so out of line.
I'm so sorry.

841
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,537
I wasn't thinking about you laying out
here all exposed like that.

842
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,627
I took way too long.
I'm so sorry.

843
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:10,154
But I just... I couldn't hit that
ass with just any old whip, right?

844
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,858
I should have just picked
the first whip I saw.

845
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:21,730
It wasn't you.
You didn't do anything.

846
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,080
Well, then what's wrong?

847
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,089
My parents are dead.

848
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,222
I'm gonna undo you from there.

849
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:37,355
Leave them.

850
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:39,531
Okay, why don't...

851
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:43,100
Just... leave me alone
for a minute, will you?

852
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,667
Okay.

853
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:20,572
Hey.

854
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,144
I missed you.

855
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,498
Uh-uh.

856
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:34,629
Come on.

857
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:38,676
Come on.

858
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:40,635
Babe.

859
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:59,828
We're gonna work on your stroke,

860
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,440
the touch of your fingers
on the keys.

861
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,311
Do you know what
the word "piano" means?

862
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:07,271
"Softly."

863
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,441
It means "play it softly."

864
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:11,927
Quieter than that.

865
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:14,408
Do you know the expression...

866
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:17,368
"tickle the ivories"?

867
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,718
Let's try it.

868
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,983
Mm-hmm. Just... Just...

869
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:27,508
It's great. Even...
even quieter.

870
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,042
Uh-huh.

871
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:43,785
That's great,
whatever this is right now.

872
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,439
You hear the silence?

873
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:49,443
Where the hell you been?

874
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:51,315
Hi.

875
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:52,901
- I was with friends.
- It's almost noon.

876
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,579
What do you care?

877
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,974
These are affidavits,
next of kin.

878
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:01,673
The lawyer sent them
over here hours ago.

879
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:03,718
We need to sign
the goddamned things,

880
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,044
so we can get them back to him,
so we can get this all settled.

881
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:09,420
Okay. Where is
all this crazy energy coming from?

882
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,899
I haven't even put my keys down.

883
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,162
So, put them down,
sign the papers.

884
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:15,184
Here they are.
They're just sitting here, not signed.

885
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,993
- First of all, you're yelling at me.
- Mm-hmm.

886
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:21,693
And second of all,
do I talk to you that way?

887
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:43,280
There. Was that worth
all that drama?

888
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:47,414
Rachel, one second.
I'll be right with you.

889
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:51,852
Is it over?

890
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,640
I'm handling it.

891
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,095
You said you'd end it,
not handle it.

892
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,643
You promised you'd end it.

893
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:01,602
I'm going to.

894
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:04,953
You're going to?
Why are you going to?

895
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:07,391
Why aren't you just saying,

896
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:09,958
"Yeah, it's over.

897
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:13,962
I promised you I'd do it,
and I did it"?

898
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:15,921
I promised you'd I'd do it,
and I'll do it.

899
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:17,879
I can't trust you.

900
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:22,928
Why are you overreacting
like a mental patient?

901
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:25,757
Because I haven't barely
seen you in five years,

902
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:29,587
and every chance that you get,
you're running out the door.

903
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:31,502
We've hardly spent
any time together.

904
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,547
When is it my turn?

905
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:36,202
You're only here
for a finite amount of time,

906
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,987
and you're spending every minute of it
with Bill fucking Tully.

907
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:44,341
I can't control
the way I grieve.

908
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,129
You're doing what you always do.

909
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:52,914
You run around.
You cause trouble.

910
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:56,918
You stir shit up,
you set it on fire, you watch it burn,

911
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:59,617
and now,
you're doing that to me!

912
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:02,924
Do you wanna yell at me,
or do you wanna hang out with me?

913
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:05,057
Because you have to pick
one or the other.

914
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:06,493
Oh... fuck it.

915
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:16,024
Shit.

916
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,079
Go away.

917
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:29,863
No.

918
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:37,785
I feel so totally alone.

919
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,879
Ugh!

920
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:48,274
I don't know
what I'm doing, Marcus.

921
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,485
You know I'm winging it.
You could cut me some slack.

922
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:58,893
I wish I could be here.

923
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:04,246
I do. I wish I could...
settle down,

924
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,814
and get a house
across the street from you,

925
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:08,773
and we could borrow butter
and shit.

926
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:14,431
But I can't.

927
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:18,870
Mm-hmm.

928
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,569
Seeing all those people
at the wake...

929
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:28,793
and seeing you...

930
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:32,057
and those goddamned
coconut monkeys.

931
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:36,104
You know,
Mom and Dad, by the way,

932
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:38,803
didn't bring them back.
They sent them back.

933
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,347
They didn't even come home
for Christmas that year.

934
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,069
The monkeys came
in the fucking mail,

935
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,636
and that was our Christmas.

936
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:47,942
If you don't remember.

937
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:58,170
I really don't feel very well.

938
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,963
When someone has suffered
severe emotional trauma,

939
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:11,096
oftentimes, the best thing
that I can recommend is

940
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:13,446
not treatment, but connection,

941
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:17,145
as in a referral to a top
mental health professional.

942
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:20,105
Mental health?
No, this is physical, it's not mental.

943
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:23,064
Look left.

944
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,284
Look right.

945
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,199
That's a mistake
that a lot of people make.

946
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:29,723
Health is health.

947
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:32,247
Stress is just like
any other environmental factor.

948
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:35,512
- Environmental factors?
- Yes.

949
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:40,125
The pain is localized
around my eyes. Is that environmental?

950
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,737
Are there tests we could run
on, like, my optic nerves?

951
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,739
I'm talking more
about stress and trauma.

952
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,307
I think it'll be
really therapeutic for you

953
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:51,049
to discuss openly the issues
that you're facing with somebody.

954
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:55,009
Isn't that what I'm doing now?

955
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:09,806
What is going on?

956
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,287
The red helps my eyes.

957
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:15,552
The doctor says I need to control my
environmental factors.

958
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:17,858
And this adds moisture.

959
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:21,862
Moist and red makes
me feel better.

960
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:25,257
"Moist and red."

961
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:57,202
What are we watching?

962
00:59:57,332 --> 00:59:59,987
Vintage Brinkses?

963
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:02,076
- Dortmunders.
- Ah.

964
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,079
Our cousins.

965
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,084
I never met them.

966
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:12,913
I'm trying to connect
to where I come from.

967
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,612
Is it working?

968
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:18,876
Not really.

969
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:25,143
Maybe you should try
moist and red.

970
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,059
You don't look good.

971
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:30,017
What's the matter?

972
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:33,368
I'm grieving, Paul.
I'm bereft.

973
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:36,023
You don't look bereft.
You look ill.

974
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:38,349
We've been through a lot.
Why don't you give us some news?

975
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,332
I have some news...

976
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:42,726
but it's not good.

977
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:46,033
I finally figured out why your parents'
finances were so difficult to track.

978
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:49,036
It's 'cause
they wanted it that way.

979
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:52,953
- You should know that the FBI is now working with the IRS...
- FBI?

980
01:00:54,781 --> 01:01:00,308
Yes, it seems that your parents took in
millions of dollars in charitable donations

981
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:04,095
and laundered it
through a series

982
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:07,707
of non-existent
non-profit organizations.

983
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,056
They're all fraudulent.

984
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,754
These bank accounts are empty.

985
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:14,061
So, they were,
like, con artists?

986
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:16,803
Whatever your parents were,
they were physicians first.

987
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:18,413
They did practice medicine,

988
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:21,547
and I'm sure a lot of this money
went into their clinics,

989
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,116
but apparently,
a lot of the money did not.

990
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:27,814
So, what about the inheritance?
How much cash is there?

991
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:32,340
There's no cash, Marcus.

992
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:34,647
There's only debt.

993
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,390
What about my house?
Did you find that paperwork?

994
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,435
I did get that paperwork.

995
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:42,829
The property is still
in your parents' name.

996
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,140
Your parents did leave you, Michelle,
that property in the Joshua Tree.

997
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:53,231
- Okay.
- But with this enormous debt,

998
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:55,992
I'm afraid that all of those properties
are going to have to liquidated.

999
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,410
They're taking my house?

1000
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,413
It's going to cover
the bulk of the liability.

1001
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:03,328
It's a good thing.

1002
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:09,334
I'm sorry. I know it's not
what you came here to hear.

1003
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:12,467
It actually is
what I was hoping to hear,

1004
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,252
so thanks, Paul.
This is great.

1005
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:18,952
- I'm gonna tell you something.
- Okay.

1006
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:22,216
But I don't want you to do
what you always do.

1007
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:24,107
What is that supposed to mean?
What do I always do?

1008
01:02:24,131 --> 01:02:26,351
I just... I don't want
you to judge

1009
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:29,223
until you hear
all the facts on this, okay?

1010
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:32,531
I want youto see me
as me. Hmm?

1011
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:35,142
I'm your dad,
but I'm also a man.

1012
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,207
Oh, my God! What are
you talking about? Are you gay?

1013
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:38,580
No, I'm not gay.

1014
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,060
Well, what is it? Are you sick?

1015
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:43,411
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm not sick.

1016
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,326
- Alexandra...
- Hmm?

1017
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:48,416
I have never been
better in my life.

1018
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:50,941
Okay.

1019
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:11,918
Hey.

1020
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:15,400
What's going on?

1021
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:22,146
Oh, well, if it isn't
Michelle fucking Brinks!

1022
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:25,236
I just spent the afternoon
listening to my father

1023
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:28,152
profess his
disgusting love for her.

1024
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:31,024
- Wait. It's not what you think.
- My father!

1025
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:34,071
He said he hasn't felt so alive
since he was 25 years old.

1026
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,246
Gross!

1027
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,117
Ugh! I told her to end it.

1028
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,120
You knew?

1029
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:42,470
No.

1030
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:45,691
I mean, yeah,
I knew, you know, but I told her...

1031
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,041
You told her?
You told her what?

1032
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:51,262
Because you didn't
tell me anything.

1033
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,004
I told her to stop.

1034
01:03:55,614 --> 01:03:57,224
All right, well...

1035
01:03:57,355 --> 01:04:00,097
You know what?
Fuck you both.

1036
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:02,249
You two deserve each other.
I don't need this bullshit.

1037
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:04,449
- Alex...
- You are supposed to be my sister-in-law.

1038
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,843
Are you fucking crazy?

1039
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:12,587
Alex... Alex!

1040
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:18,593
What are you doing?

1041
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:22,206
- Just don't talk.
- You're packing. You're leaving, over this?

1042
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:26,253
I just need some time
to think and then to breathe.

1043
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:29,430
I need to be away
from the Brinkses for one fucking minute.

1044
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,519
Leaving isn't the answer.

1045
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,522
The only way we're gonna solve anything
is if you stay and talk to me.

1046
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:36,960
I don't wanna talk to you.

1047
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,788
- Where are you gonna go?
- Away.

1048
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:43,880
So, you're gonna walk out on me the same
week that both of my parents died?

1049
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:52,410
I'm sorry...

1050
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,500
about your parents.

1051
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,763
But the problems
I'm talking about

1052
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,113
have been around
the whole time we've been together.

1053
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:01,506
- The whole time?
- Mm-hmm.

1054
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:03,725
Every second
we've been together,

1055
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:07,425
I've been walking around
committing capital crimes.

1056
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:09,340
What are these crimes?

1057
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,692
I don't...

1058
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:16,260
I can't talk
about this right now!

1059
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,088
I know what it is.

1060
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:20,960
I'm a hypochondriac.
I'm a drunk.

1061
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:24,311
I'm a no-talent failure.

1062
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:25,922
No, I...

1063
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:31,318
I do not think you are
any of those things.

1064
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,233
Except maybe a hypochondriac.

1065
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:36,062
Alex, I love you.

1066
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:40,501
You don't put me
in the front of your thoughts,

1067
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:44,549
or anywhere in your thoughts,
when you decide to do things.

1068
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:47,204
When is that ever gonna change?

1069
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,945
Now.

1070
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,645
Soon.

1071
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:01,044
I just don't know
how all this happened.

1072
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:04,221
I mean, a husband and a house...

1073
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:05,962
We lost the house.

1074
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:08,616
What?

1075
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:11,968
My parents were...

1076
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:18,975
The bank is gonna
claim the house.

1077
01:06:25,807 --> 01:06:27,461
That's what I'm talking about.

1078
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:29,681
You're leaving?

1079
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,988

01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:33,380
I need you.

1081
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:40,213
I just... I need
to clear the static out of my head.

1082
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:44,304
Me, too. We both do.
We can do it together.

- I tried that.

For Christ's sake, Andrew,
he doesn't need light bulbs.

01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:11,654
Yeah, from here to Delaware.

1220
01:16:13,394 --> 01:16:14,961
Perfect.

1221
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:17,311
Now, it's definitely
not all this.

1222
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:19,749
We can get county surveyors
to stake out the lines.

1223
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:24,362
But it's basically
from that tall Joshua tree

1224
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,669
next to the little one,
if you can see that,

1225
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:30,847
over to that big pile of rocks,

1226
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:33,589
back to...

1227
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:38,028
kind of where
that cluster of bushes is.

1228
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:39,986
Ah.

1229
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:42,380
So, uh, what are we doing here?

1230
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,904
You could develop this land
if you wanted to.

1231
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:46,993
I could definitely
help with that.

1232
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:50,693
No. I just wanted
to see it again.

All that shit is

1250
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:57,273
Yeah, I tossed it. I'm sorry. I should
have asked you if you wanted any of it.

1251
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,604
No, I don't.

1252
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:03,390
Good. It's all junk.
It's better off in the driveway.

1253
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:05,871
- Even the denture bath?
- That was a tough one.

1254
01:19:14,358 --> 01:19:15,358
Where's Alex?

1255
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:19,058
Gone.

1256
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,018
Is she coming back?

1257
01:19:22,148 --> 01:19:23,668
She said
she's moving in with a friend.

1258
01:19:29,982 --> 01:19:31,418
I'm really sorry.

1259
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:37,903
It's better off.

1260
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:42,821
What about the dog?

1261
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:47,391
Uh, I don't think you're allowed
to put a dog out with the trash.

1262
01:19:47,521 --> 01:19:51,090
Yeah, you, um, have to wait
for recycling day.

1263
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:55,312
I'll take the dog.

1264
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:57,836
That's all right.
I got her.

1265
01:19:57,967 --> 01:19:58,967
No.

1266
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:01,492
I'll take her.

1267
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:02,798
It feels right.

1268
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:06,323
You're not taking the dog.

1269
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,412
She was delivered
to my doorstep. I took her in.

1270
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:11,154
Wait a minute.
The dog is spoken for.

1271
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,523
No, I'll take her. I'm starting
a new life with me and the dog.

1272
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:16,289
You don't know
how to care for a dog.

1273
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,399
You haven't walked her, or bought her
food, or even petted her fucking head.

1274
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:20,728
She's my dog.

1275
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:23,296
- I'm taking the dog.
- Get your own dog!

1276
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:35,569
Okay.

1277
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:54,850
I don't wanna go back to Philly.

1278
01:20:57,243 --> 01:20:59,898
I wanna stay in Los Angeles.

1279
01:21:01,682 --> 01:21:03,119
Okay.

1280
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,469
And keep the dog.

1281
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,166
Okay.

1282
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,300
And live with you.

1283
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:13,869
I don't know.

1284
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:21,093
It's the first time we've been
under the same roof in 10 years, and...

1285
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:25,315
It hasn't gone very well.

1286
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:26,882
It hasn't.

1287
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:33,192
But you're the only family
I have left.

1288
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:36,195
Yeah, no shit.

1289
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:39,503
Let me see.

1290
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,941
And you need a roommate.

1291
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,901
I'm sorry,

1292
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:49,513
but you do.

1293
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:51,254
Huh? Come on.

1294
01:21:51,384 --> 01:21:52,603
- Don't be weird.
- Come on.

1295
01:21:57,782 --> 01:22:01,699
Are you gonna be able
to behave yourself,

1296
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:03,614
keep your nose clean?

1297
01:22:03,744 --> 01:22:05,485
No.

1298
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:08,444
Okay, great.

1299
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,405
But if I feel like
you're cramping my style...

1300
01:22:12,536 --> 01:22:15,234
you're outta here.

1301
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:16,365
Yeah, right.

1302
01:22:18,194 --> 01:22:20,109
Grab a box.

1303
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,241
Help me get out of here.

1304
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:30,641
Hey, you want me to write,
like, "books" or "living room"?

1305
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:32,611
Because people tend
to write what's in the box,

1306
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,514
but I like to write
what room it's going in.

1307
01:22:34,645 --> 01:22:38,779
Well, I don't know
where we'll be living,

1308
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,496
so I don't know
what room it's going into.

1309
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,608
