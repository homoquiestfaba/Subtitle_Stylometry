1
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,145
The pool hall is a great equalizer.

2
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,013
In the pool hall, nobody cares about
how old or young you are...

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,649
what color your skin is,
or how much money you got in your pocket.

4
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,683
It's about how you move.

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,690
I remember this kid once...

6
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:02,091
who could move on a pool table
like nobody had ever seen.

7
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,893
I mean, hour after hour, rack after rack,
his shots just went in.

8
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,832
The cue was part of his arm,
and the balls had eyes.

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,762
And the thing that made him so good...

10
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,703
was he thought he could never miss.

11
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,873
I know...

12
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,905
'cause that kid was me.

13
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,042
What they're doing
is forming this new league...

14
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,608
kind of like what they have
for golf and tennis...

15
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,153
but for pool.

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,182
They scouted all the best players
in the country...

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,316
for 50 spots on this new pro tour.

18
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,861
Then they made their selections.

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,989
Last summer, I was in Memphis
playing Bucktooth for that Chevy.

20
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,557
The tournament director himself
was in the room watching me play.

21
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,963
A guy by the name of Toupee Jay.

22
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,966
Anyway, after playing Bucktooth...

23
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,668
this guy Jay comes up to me...

24
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,836
and he says even though
all 50 spots in the tour are filled...

25
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:57,246
after watching me play, they'd have to make
an exception in my case to carry 51.

26
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,717
Can you believe that? They want me.

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,280
He even told Joe
he'd send the invitation himself.

28
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,622
Man, when I was out there playing...

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,256
we had no professionals.
All we had was hustlers.

30
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,899
I don't wanna be a hustler, Rags.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,436
I want to be a professional,
and I'm gonna be.

32
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,563
I'm just waiting for my invitation.

33
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,298
What's going on here?

34
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,175
-We were just--
-We were just what?

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,913
You know who this is?
This is Rags, and he's a hustler.

36
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,351
Probably one of the best.
What'd you do? Make him win the first set?

37
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,856
-He's up $20.
-He's $20 up. Right, $20 up.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,653
Then you'd be $50 up, then $100,
then you'd be broke.

39
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,093
Come on, Joe, let me play.
I can beat this guy.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,256
Maybe you can and maybe you can't.

41
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,424
But we don't deal with maybes, do we?

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,526
You don't know all the angles yet,
but I do, all right?

43
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,003
He's bad news.
Even if you win, you can't win.

44
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,530
What do you mean, even if I win,
I can't win? I don't understand.

45
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,077
You don't have to understand.
Just listen to me.

46
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,474
If the kid wants to play...

47
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,108
why don't you let him play?
He may learn something.

48
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,278
The only thing he'll learn from you
is how to lose.

49
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,221
I'm trying to do something here.
I'm trying to educate this kid, all right?

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,555
So if you got something to say, say it to me.

51
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,062
Otherwise shut the fuck up,
because he's my kid, all right?

52
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,893
He's my fucking kid.

53
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,498
And I'm gonna make him a champion.
So you stay away from him.

54
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,576
-Mail came today, Joe.
-Thanks, Don.

55
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,735
-White boy's got skills.
-No, he can't.

56
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,723
Damn!

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,358
Now let me get this straight.

58
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,700
You're saying that
because you and me are friends...

59
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,996
that makes us niggers?

60
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,135
No, "niggas," all right?
There's a big difference.

61
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,140
That's what I just said. "Nigger."

62
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,580
-No. "Nigga."
-"Nigger."

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,880
"Nigga," N-l-G-G-A.

64
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,651
-What the fuck is that?
-Man and me, like, we're brothers.

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,489
You know, like if I say, "You my nigga,"
that means we're boys.

66
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,961
Like that man you're playing, right there?
That's my nigga Charles.

67
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,129
My nigger Charles, right?

68
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,263
Hold it. See, you can't say that.

69
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,904
-Only I can.
-Why?

70
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,302
Because, first of all, you don't say it right.

71
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,314
And second, you don't know Charles. I do.

72
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,747
-You do?
-I do.

73
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,445
I've known Charles
since he was knee-high to a duck.

74
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,010
See, me and Charles, nigga, we down.

75
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,086
-You're down?
-Yeah, down.

76
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:02,218
Of course you're down. You're down
about $5,000. Give me my fucking money.

77
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,764
You know what?

78
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,493
It is absolutely impossible
to have an intelligent conversation...

79
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,162
with your white ass.

80
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,166
Shoot pool, honky.

81
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,450
This is our night, Johnny.

82
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,653
This is our night. I can feel it.

83
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,789
I mean, you've got them animals in there
eating out of the palm of your hand.

84
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:44,303
You beat them, you take their money,
you call them names to their faces...

85
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,928
and they love you.

86
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,870
I don't know how you do it.

87
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,272
I never saw anything like it.

88
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,176
Beating a man out of his money, that's easy.
Anybody can do that.

89
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,982
But beating a man out of his money
and making him like it...

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,540
that's an art.

91
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,316
That's an art of a true hustler.

92
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,686
But it's getting late...

93
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,553
and I don't wanna be here
all fucking night, okay?

94
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,896
There's enough drug money in there...

95
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,695
that we're gonna need
a fucking wheelbarrow to carry it out.

96
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,702
So stop messing around.

97
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,133
I mean, you got a game
those people never seen.

98
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,512
And quite frankly,
I'd like to see it sometime myself tonight.

99
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,442
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna bump up the bet...

100
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,617
and you're gonna
close this fucking night out.

101
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,654
So stop wasting my fucking time.

102
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,192
Just do it.

103
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,765
A bottle of Jack.

104
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,138
I'll be a three-legged dog
if I'm not looking at the Side Pocket Kid.

105
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,602
You don't remember me...

106
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,612
but I saw you play once
about 10 or 15 years ago.

107
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,539
I used to wear a rug.

108
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,011
Toupee Jay.

109
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,710
Yeah, that's me.

110
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,715
I saw this kid play one of the best games
I've ever seen in my life.

111
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,282
Couldn't have been more than
14 or 15 years old...

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,124
but, man, he could shoot the lights out!

113
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,694
Now look at him. He's all grown up.

114
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,062
You know, I always wondered
what happened to you.

115
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,468
Why you never made it down
to Johnson City.

116
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,702
Well, Jay, I've never been
much of a tournament player.

117
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,175
-There's no money in them.
-No money?

118
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,610
We just held the U.S. Open in Atlanta.
First prize was $100,000.

119
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,345
But you gotta be invited to those things,
don't you?

120
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,824
We did invite you. A couple of times.
I sent the invitations out myself.

121
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,157
I even called and spoke to a backer
you had in those days.

122
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,594
But he said you weren't interested.
Something about...

123
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,060
your parents wanting you to finish school.

124
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,903
What was the name
of that backer you had, anyway?

125
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,642
Was it Joe?

126
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,349
Bet $20,000!

127
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,784
What's the matter? Did I stutter?

128
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,283
Everybody got all quiet, and shit?

129
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,485
About a minute ago,
it was like an evening at the Apollo.

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,428
Now, all of a sudden, it's quiet as a church.

131
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,265
That's all right, Chico, I don't blame you.

132
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,832
I've been beating this motherfucker
all goddamn night. He can't win.

133
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,298
You better watch your mouth.

134
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,205
You watch my mouth, Chico...

135
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,109
'cause you sure as hell
don't want to watch me play pool.

136
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,546
Unless I'm blindfolded, handcuffed,
with a cue sticking out of my ass.

137
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,176
Maybe you'd bet the $20,000 then, right?

138
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,920
That's what I thought.

139
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,390
Come on, Joe, let's get the fuck out of here.

140
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,224
These guys wouldn't bet $5 they were black.

141
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,194
Hold this.

142
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,097
You got a bet.

143
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,527
But for $20,000, you got to play
my man Brad in the corner, over there.

144
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,673
What are you doing?
I only got $8,000 on me.

145
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,875
Don't play that guy. He's a pro.
I saw him at the pro tournament in Phoenix.

146
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,440
Don't you ever tell me who I play again.

147
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,013
I'll play anybody in the house,
you know that, Chico.

148
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,856
Do you wanna play this bad motherfucker
on my money?

149
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,520
I don't think so.

150
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,891
Seems you got
too much personal shit going on.

151
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,401
You know what? Fuck you, Johnny.
Charles, get the rack.

152
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,031
I'll play him myself.

153
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,776
-What the fuck are you doing?
-He's got $8,000 on him, but it's not enough.

154
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,780
What the fuck is going on?

155
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,339
You should have looked out for me.
I was just a kid.

156
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,080
I'll fucking kill you, you motherfucker!

157
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,621
Shut the fuck up!

158
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,525
Do you honestly think that I would let
a white boy walk into my pool hall...

159
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,721
and talk that much shit
unless he was trying to tell me something?

160
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,027
You missed the fucking signs.

161
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,725
You didn't listen.

162
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,997
Me and Johnny, we's niggas.

163
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,098
-I'm out of here.
-Peace.

164
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,671
What's this I hear
about you not having my money?

165
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,611
Get the fuck off me!

166
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,383
When I was 12, I walked into a pool room...

167
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,656
picked up a cue,
and I just knew how to play.

168
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,528
I guess, for some people,
it's baseball or music.

169
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,396
For me, it was pool.

170
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,234
But I never wanted to be a hustler.
I wanted to be the best.

171
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,403
But after 15 years with Joe...

172
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,444
the only thing I ever got to be
was the best hustler.

173
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:29,174
I guess, in life, things don't always work out
the way you want them to.

174
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,534
You wanted to see me?

175
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,906
I'd have to say you're the worst carpenter
I ever worked with in my entire life.

176
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,451
How did you get this job?

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,419
Jack Radosta hired me on.

178
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,150
I guess he thought
he owed me a couple of favors.

179
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,321
Jack's a good man.
Bad gambler, but he's a good man.

180
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,026
I know I'm no good at any of this stuff.

181
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,965
But Jack's been showing me some things.
If I work harder...

182
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,401
-and I try as hard as I can--
-Relax, you're not getting fired.

183
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,973
As a matter of fact,
I've decided to move you up...

184
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,509
and make you head of supplies.

185
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,545
That's a promotion, son.

186
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,109
-More money, nice bonuses.
-Thanks.

187
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,386
I figure, out of all the men here,
you're probably most qualified for that job.

188
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,820
Why do you say that?

189
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,154
You're the pool hustler, ain't you?

190
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,353
If I need a few truckloads of steel
to disappear off this site...

191
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,488
I know I can count on you
to make it happen, right?

192
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,899
You get taken care of, I get taken care of,
and everybody's happy.

193
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,767
And the heaviest thing
you ever have to lift around here...

194
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,598
is a clipboard.

195
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,469
Well?

196
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,177
I'm sorry, Bill.
I think you got the wrong guy.

197
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,416
-What?
-Tell Jack I said thanks, okay?

198
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,488
You don't do as I say...

199
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,016
then you and Jack will both
be looking for work somewhere else.

200
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,529
Then you can tell Jack I said we're even.

201
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,238
Johnny, you got a phone call.

202
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,312
Hey, Nick. What's up?

203
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,811
What?

204
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,185
Yeah, I want a game.

205
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,953
What I'm saying is that I bet you $200
I can drink both these pints of beer...

206
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,864
-before you drink those shots of Jack.
-Sounds good to me.

207
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,492
That is absolutely impossible.

208
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,901
-Then put up your money.
-No problem.

209
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,566
-Brett, can you spot me?
-Again? You already owe me $200.

210
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,733
I'll pay tomorrow.

211
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,777
No cheating. I know how you guys are.

212
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,336
You can't knock one of my glasses
off the table...

213
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,473
and tell me to lap it up to win my bet.

214
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,848
-Who the fuck do you think we are?
-I know, I just....

215
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,055
To be fair, you must at least
let me finish my first beer...

216
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,057
before you fire down both your shots.

217
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,150
And we can't touch the other's glasses.

218
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,353
-Deal.
-You're on.

219
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,055
-Fine.
-Sounds good to me.

220
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,722
Absolutely. Good luck.

221
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,961
$20, $30, $40.... $65.
How much more do I need?

222
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,870
If Tang wins his game,
that should be just enough.

223
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,303
Since when was he satisfied
with just enough?

224
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,568
Tang's right.
Plus I'll need more money for fliers.

225
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,406
You can play Moose a quick game.
He's good for $100.

226
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,844
-Say, Moose!
-Don't mess with me.

227
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,939
I was watching TV with your wife today.

228
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,144
Stupid bitch.
Took her two hours to watch 60 Minutes.

229
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,719
Look, I'm sorry. I made him.... Oh, my God!

230
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,615
-Say, "1, 2, 3, go."
-1, 2, 3, go.

231
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,397
-That hand's quicker.
-What difference does--

232
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,433
-Use your left hand--
-Shut up.

233
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,466
You can't touch my glasses
and I can't touch yours.

234
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,103
It's incredible what's going on.

235
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,640
How about that?

236
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,616
That's it, Danny, get your money up.

237
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,814
Race to 5 for $100,
and I wanna see the money this time!

238
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,516
No more playing for owesies.

239
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,220
Good Lord, Moose!
Will you calm down, get a throat lozenge?

240
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,125
Let me get my cue, will you? Hey, Nick!

241
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,559
Hand me my cue, will you?

242
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,395
-ls that legal?
-Of course it's not legal.

243
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,633
I'll get your money.

244
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,839
-What's he doing here?
-Never mind your brother.

245
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,243
He's playing Moose, for Christ's sake.
Concentrate on your own game.

246
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,875
-You've told me that since I was 15.
-I can't help it. This guy's tough.

247
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,043
He's a pro.

248
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,979
You didn't say anything about that.

249
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,217
This guy's a pro? What's his name?

250
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,456
I don't know. He's a new guy on the circuit,
for Christ's sake.

251
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,128
-I don't know. I haven't played in a while.
-lf you're short on the money, I'll back you.

252
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,796
-lt's not about the money--
-I know it is not about the money...

253
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,739
but you can't go on playing bums
all your life.

254
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,608
Sooner or later, if you're any kind of man,
you got to step up...

255
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,136
step out, and see what the fuck you got.

256
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,914
All right, somebody hand me a cue.

257
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,819
-You wanna play some?
-Maybe something cheap. I'm just learning.

258
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,125
-$1,000 sound about right?
-Fine.

259
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,702
-Did you see that last shot?
-Unbelievable!

260
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,169
-You see the look on that fucker's face?
-Fucking dog.

261
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,005
We gotta go to Mel's.

262
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,671
Waitress there has the sickest tits
I've ever seen.

263
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,841
-Jesus Christ, when did this happen?
-Weather's been crazy lately.

264
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,215
How often have I said,
"Stay out of the pool room"?

265
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,346
-A thousand?
-Exactly. So how come you don't listen?

266
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,653
It makes no sense. Every day
you say, "Stay out of the pool room."

267
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,489
But I come and win $200 or $300.
It's easy money.

268
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,161
-Enough!
-Coming to Mel's?

269
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,168
You guys are retarded. I'm not going.

270
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,363
-Let's go.
-Seriously, don't smoke.

271
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,566
If I catch you with him smoking,
I'll take your bar mitzvah money.

272
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,132
-Thanks, Mom.
-He wouldn't do that, would he?

273
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,338
All right, Mom, get in the fucking car.

274
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,509
Did you guys know
that the average penis size is 6.4 inches...

275
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,546
and that the average vaginal canal
is 7.9 inches?

276
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,112
Therefore, in this country alone...

277
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,382
there's over 17,000 miles...

278
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,291
of unused virgin pussy out there.

279
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,432
-Come on.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

280
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,935
-This shit is true.
-Did you do the math on that?

281
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,234
-I did.
-You have too much free time.

282
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,103
Where do you get this shit?

283
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,234
-lt's common knowledge.
-Hey, Danny.

284
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,245
-You still playing The Goat, Friday night?
-Yes, you girls are coming, right?

285
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,308
The guy who signed Stevie Ray Vaughan
is coming down to see my ass.

286
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,015
Sorry, I gotta work Friday night,
and it's Lanie's last night of training.

287
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,058
What is this, the Olympics?

288
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,759
Come on, take the night off.
I'll train her myself.

289
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,160
This is the universal sign for "check."

290
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,191
I need this.

291
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,327
If Sinatra made it big by paying off girls
to scream and faint when he sang...

292
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,203
I got to have a couple of hot girls
throwing their panties on stage at my gig.

293
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,469
-We'll see.
-I love you. Mean it.

294
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,773
-Are you kidding me?
-Man, that chick has got body karate.

295
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,838
Do you think her tits are real?
I hate chicks with fake tits.

296
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,544
Are you kidding me? Fake tits are
the greatest invention of the 20th century.

297
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,678
-Plus they're safer.
-Safer?

298
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,822
Do you know that 78 percent
of chicks that have fake tits...

299
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,519
who are involved in boating accidents
do not drown?

300
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,119
-Where do you get this shit?
-lt's common knowledge.

301
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,891
Get the fuck out of here.

302
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,704
Now, slowly, give me your gun
and all the money in your briefcase, nigga.

303
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,783
You messed
with the wrong guy, motherfucker.

304
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,016
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

305
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,493
My girlfriend, Tara, was a law school
student from the good side of the tracks.

306
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,896
Her parents had her living in this
fancy apartment for the last four years.

307
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,798
She didn't like me playing pool much.

308
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,360
And I didn't like me much when I didn't.

309
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,506
Now that I've picked up the cue again,
I just hope she understands.

310
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,082
Hi, baby.

311
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,715
I'm sorry that I didn't call. I was....

312
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,692
Fuck! Jesus fucking crap!

313
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,831
Did you forget something?

314
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,304
It's your boss's party tonight,
and I'm supposed to wear a suit, right?

315
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,740
It was my birthday last night, Johnny.

316
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,638
-lt was?
-God damn you.

317
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,480
Why didn't you
say something about it last night?

318
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,953
What's this?

319
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,825
You're playing again, aren't you?

320
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,160
So that's what's more important
than me last night, the fucking game?

321
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,458
Aren't we through with all that?
What about your job with Jack?

322
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,298
What about my job with Jack?
It didn't work out.

323
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,359
Why?

324
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,439
Do I look like a construction worker to you?

325
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,206
Give me an Indian and a cop,
I'll sing you YMCA. Is that what you want?

326
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,713
You think I like living with you,
like a kept man?

327
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,250
Breaking my back for peanuts
while you pay the check?

328
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,547
I play pool, Tara. That's what I do.

329
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,421
You know I beat a pro last night?

330
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,585
First time I picked up a cue in forever.
I sent him to the ATM three times.

331
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,794
I've always done what other people
want me to do. You, Joe, everybody.

332
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:58,192
-Now I'm gonna do what I wanna do.
-ls that why you play? Is it for the money?

333
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,333
You know me better than that.

334
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,673
I'm not sure how well I know you.

335
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,509
But you'll start to get to know
my foot in your ass...

336
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,209
if you think that
you're gonna forget my birthday...

337
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,844
and make me feel sorry for you
in the morning.

338
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,720
I just turned 30,
and I will be damned if I'm gonna let you....

339
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,023
Oh, my God.

340
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,795
You rat bastard!

341
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,365
Mikey V, go get my stuff.
You hock that thing again?

342
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,065
I just needed a little cash
for last night's game.

343
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,940
-You pawn motorcycles?
-I pawn anything, you know that.

344
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,244
That's your guitar. You shouldn't pawn that.

345
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,181
He's got your pool cue.
You're not supposed to pawn that.

346
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,410
That's different.

347
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,453
-Why is that different?
-Because it is.

348
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,580
If you need something, come to me.
Don't hock that thing again.

349
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,056
That's not very practical.
You're never around.

350
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,956
I'll be around.

351
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,928
I'm playing at The Goat, Friday.
Think you can come?

352
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,865
Why you gotta say it like such an asshole?
Just ask me nicely, and I'll be there.

353
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,401
-What time?
-8:00.

354
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,097
-I'll be there at 8:00, all right?
-We'll see.

355
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,208
Looks like you're getting pretty good
at that thing.

356
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,508
I'm getting pretty good at a lot of things.

357
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,878
Watch yourself,
I'll be coming after you soon.

358
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,780
I'll be sure to keep my eyes open.

359
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,149
I made a score last night,
so just take some--

360
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,519
What're you doing?
Are you gonna embarrass me in front of V?

361
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,526
You're my brother, not my mother.
You start looking after yourself.

362
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,221
You're in here, too.

363
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:35,862
That's me. That's not supposed to be you,
all right?

364
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,095
I leave town for five minutes, and this guy
thinks he's a hotshot pool shark.

365
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,866
Yeah, well, I am.

366
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,969
-You're not.
-I am.

367
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,144
You should not be having
your hands like that.

368
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,683
Why should I not have my hands up?

369
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,719
Because someone could just,
I don't know....

370
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,720
My goodness, is that horrible?

371
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,851
You know something?

372
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,792
You really wanna see pool,
come to the state line with me.

373
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,850
Check out the pros.

374
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,973
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

375
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,568
and welcome to the Olhausen Invitational...

376
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,680
$100, 000 9-ball shootout.

377
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,978
I see a lot of familiar faces here tonight.

378
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,077
May your hands be steady,
and your aim be true.

379
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,682
Good luck.

380
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,746
Look at this.

381
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,283
See that guy in the beard?

382
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,621
That's Robert Tobin.
Best bank shot in the game.

383
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,957
Big guy over there with bushy eyebrows.

384
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,024
That's Bruce Kaner, the champ from Russia.

385
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,333
But the guy they always chase every year
for the title is that guy.

386
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,999
-Bobby LeBlanc.
-The best in the game.

387
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,740
Look at him, watch the way he breaks.

388
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,233
Shit.

389
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,681
Three balls on the break.
Six-ball run, and he's out.

390
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,814
Is that what makes him so good?

391
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,785
With that break,
he only plays six while others play nine.

392
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,789
There's a lot more to his game
than his break.

393
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,654
Watch the way he strokes the ball.

394
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,660
Smooth, never out of line.

395
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,057
When God invented pool players,
He made that guy right there.

396
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,229
Hey, Johnny, is that you?

397
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,134
St. Louis Louie, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

398
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,605
You, too. What're you doing here?
I didn't see your name on the roster.

399
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,971
I'm not playing.

400
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,510
I'm just showing my brother
a real game of pool.

401
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,706
-He's never seen you play before?
-Like I said, a real game.

402
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,080
Don't let him fool you. Your brother
can move the rock with the best.

403
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,618
I don't know about that.

404
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,816
I'm gonna go up and say hello to the boys.
Y'all wanna come with me?

405
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,357
Sure. Let's go.

406
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,450
What's he mean by "the rock"?

407
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,620
That's the cue ball. Come on.

408
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,826
All right, fellas. Clear the way.
I'm coming through!

409
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:53,496
Sorry, Louis, there's no food in here.
Buffet's around the corner.

410
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,769
What're you laughing at, Shorty?

411
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,402
When you go to bed at night, how do you
keep your head from sliding off the pillow?

412
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,412
I want you to meet an old friend of mine.

413
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,779
This is Johnny Doyle,
his big brother, Danny.

414
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,645
Charlie Banks over here, Boston Shorty...

415
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,211
and the legendary Jersey Red.

416
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,615
Jersey Red? I've heard about you for years.

417
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,662
-What have you heard?
-Red's got more stories than the Bible.

418
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,357
I once heard you ran a rack of balls
with a nine iron.

419
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,163
It was a putter, son.
Took the sorry son of a bitch for $12,000.

420
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,964
-What was your last name?
-Doyle.

421
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,871
Used to be known as "The Side Pocket Kid."

422
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,511
I heard of you.
You're the kid who took Bucktooth's Chevy.

423
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,871
You remember that?

424
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,245
Remember it? That was my car.
Bucktooth stole it from me.

425
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,341
It's not funny. We were on the road together.

426
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,248
I pull off to take a piss.

427
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,552
He drives off, leaves me standing there
with my dick in my hand.

428
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,317
I loved that car. I was glad he lost it to you.
Let me buy you a drink.

429
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,260
-You want one, Louie?
-Not really.

430
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,890
I got a game, shortly, and I gotta stay sharp.

431
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,093
-Who's it with?
-Greeks. You all want in?

432
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,227
Greeks? Shit, yeah, count me in.

433
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,372
Malaka, you're professional.

434
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,575
Last time you play, you beat me $10,000.

435
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,668
I shoot ball three times whole game.

436
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,805
Yeah, but I had my eight hours of sleep.

437
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:13,112
-You know I don't play good when I'm tired.
-What about your friend?

438
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,516
We play partner. $2,000 a man.

439
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,290
Who, him? I don't even know him.
He don't wanna play pool, anyway.

440
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,619
Ask him.

441
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,417
Hey, kid, you wanna play some pool?

442
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,985
Sure, I'll play.

443
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,825
I'll see if he's got any money.

444
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,661
You are so beautiful, man.

445
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,796
You've got 'em so turned around,
they don't know what to think.

446
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,672
Red, let me borrow your cue for a second.

447
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,602
What?

448
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,747
Johnny, I thought you knew
what we were trying to do here.

449
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,183
I'm trying to set him up for Red.

450
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,847
I thought you knew the move.

451
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,089
No hard feelings, all right?

452
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,484
Of course not.

453
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,927
Go ahead, go do your thing.

454
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,862
What's this?

455
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:09,236
He doesn't have any money,
but just to show you how fair I am...

456
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,639
I'll take the old shaky man as my partner.

457
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,405
Fine, you take old man. Let's go.

458
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,877
Get balls!

459
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,642
I got your balls right here,
you Greek bastard.

460
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,843
You don't wanna play this guy, anyway.

461
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,319
He may be a jackass,
but he plays pretty good.

462
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,754
Here, hold my coat, will you? Thanks.

463
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,667
Here, stick around.
Play some cards or something, all right?

464
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,170
Take a cab home. I'm gonna get out of here.

465
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:45,197
-I wanna go with you, man.
-Just do as I say, all right?

466
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,519
I made a Freudian slip yesterday.

467
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,151
I meant to ask my wife to pass the butter...

468
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,719
but instead I said,
"You bitch! You've ruined my life!"

469
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,634
-That's lovely. Excuse us.
-My pleasure.

470
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,829
-You're late.
-You look fantastic.

471
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,966
You're still late. What took you so long?

472
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,942
You didn't tell me
the guy lived in Sherwood Forest.

473
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,807
It took me an hour to find the place.

474
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,645
I had to leave a trail of breadcrumbs
along the way, to find my way back.

475
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,411
You don't look so bad yourself.

476
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,181
-I can't believe I got you in a suit.
-Me, neither.

477
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,085
It's going back tomorrow.

478
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,018
I know how you hate these things.
Thank you for coming.

479
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,457
No problem.

480
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,628
Here comes the wicked witch of the world.

481
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,494
-Brace yourself.
-Be nice.

482
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,261
There you are. I want you
to meet some friends of mine.

483
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,860
Tara, this is Bernice and Laurence Winthrop.

484
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,567
Richard Illich, and this is Brian Schwartz.
Everyone, this is Tara.

485
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,734
And John. Hi, John.

486
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,778
I'm surprised to see you here,
what with your busy schedule and all.

487
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,374
-I can't believe you actually made it.
-I did, Beth, all right? So relax.

488
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,352
No, really.
What has been keeping you so busy?

489
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,714
I know you're always fashionably late...

490
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,658
but I would just love to know
what kept us all waiting for you today.

491
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,127
I've been here for about an hour already.

492
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,597
I just was outside,
helping the valets kick-start your broom.

493
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,432
They had trouble finding your keys.
I think that was the problem.

494
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,131
Beth, may I speak to you for a moment?

495
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,367
John, I must say my curiosity is piqued.

496
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,936
What kind of business are you in?

497
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,442
-I kind of move money around.
-Money management. Hard currency?

498
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,952
-Generally.
-lt's a risky business.

499
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,885
What's your loss ratio?

500
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,251
Larry, I don't lose money that often.

501
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,351
Really? What's your technique?

502
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,463
Let's just say I kind of
take it out of other people's pockets...

503
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,365
and put it in my pocket,
you know what I'm saying?

504
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,133
Okay, excuse me.

505
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,976
Excuse me, handsome. You got anything
in this joint besides champagne?

506
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,412
I didn't think so.

507
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,444
Lawyers' party, big deal. Can't get a beer.

508
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,888
I'm going outside. Get some smog.

509
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,185
What do you call a thousand lawyers...

510
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,829
buried up to their neck in sand?

511
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,598
-What?
-Not enough sand.

512
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,796
-Hi, Mike Flynn.
-John Doyle.

513
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,800
I saw you come in.

514
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,631
-Good hair.
-You, too.

515
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,709
Are we related?

516
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,706
Only kidding.

517
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,749
I retired last month...

518
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,048
so my friends drag me to these things.
They try to keep me busy.

519
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,054
What do you do?

520
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,059
I don't know.
You could say I'm self-employed.

521
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,295
That's good. It's wise.

522
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,393
When I was a kid, I figured out right away...

523
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,527
most companies pay people enough,
so as they don't quit.

524
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,731
People work hard enough,
so as they don't get fired.

525
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,502
You know, what's that?

526
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,304
Bullshit is what that is.

527
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,945
You play pool, Mike?

528
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,142
A little. Why do you ask?

529
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,481
Because you got a crease on your pants.

530
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:57,019
I'm not sure I wanna be hanging out with
a guy who noticed a crease in my pants.

531
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,325
I didn't say "a crease in your pants."

532
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,231
I said "a crease on your pants."
It's horizontal, below the pocket.

533
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,598
Normally, I might think
that would come from bad dry-cleaning.

534
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,196
But a guy like you
doesn't get bad dry-cleaning, do you?

535
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,572
Comes from playing pool.

536
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,842
When you lean against the table
to take a shot...

537
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,180
table makes a slight crease in your pants.
Yours happens to be accentuated...

538
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:26,019
by a little bit of blue chalk,
something only found on a pool table.

539
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,718
You're right. I've been playing pool.

540
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,661
Losing my ass all night
on that stupid table they got upstairs.

541
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,866
You say they got a table upstairs?

542
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,234
Come here.

543
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,341
That's how we do it.

544
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,908
It's no fair playing a guy on his own table.

545
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,818
One more setup, Jack.
It's my party. You'll owe me.

546
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,515
That's it for me.

547
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,319
-Tapped out?
-Phil over here is a ringer.

548
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,850
Mike, you back for some more?

549
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,555
I'm just getting started.

550
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,428
Phil, that's a friend of mine, John Doyle.

551
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,991
Phil Stein. It's his house.

552
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,696
John, nice to see you. You shoot pool?

553
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,665
I play a little.

554
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,868
We've been playing a little. Doubles, 8-ball.

555
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,809
But everybody here seems to be tapped out.

556
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,473
-You and Mike wanna take him on?
-Sure.

557
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,617
Why not double the stakes?

558
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,579
Are you sure you could afford it?
You're down quite a bit right now.

559
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,520
I'd be careful if I were you.

560
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,854
I don't have a lot of money on me tonight.

561
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,826
It's okay, I'll cover us both.

562
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,422
Let's play, like children.

563
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,501
This one's for all the marbles, boys.

564
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,635
Maybe, if I just....

565
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:05,276
I guess even a blind squirrel can find a nut
every once in a while.

566
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,416
What are you trying to say, Phil?

567
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,180
I'm not trying to say anything.

568
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,483
I'm just saying that shot was luck.

569
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,819
You couldn't do that again
in a million years.

570
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,224
I don't have to make it again
in a million years. I made it just now.

571
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,990
I'm saying it was luck.

572
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,293
Nobody can make that shot. It's impossible.

573
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,457
I can.

574
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,829
What's that?

575
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,697
Set 'em up, I'll make it.

576
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,506
I'll even make it one-handed.

577
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,644
Did I stutter?

578
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,115
Everybody got all quiet, and shit.

579
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,386
About a minute ago, it was like an Elk's
Lodge meeting up in this motherfucker.

580
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,422
Now suddenly it's quiet as a church.

581
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,583
Who is this guy?

582
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,957
-You're not serious, are you?
-Of course I am. What's it worth to you?

583
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,126
You're down quite a bit right now, Phil.
I'd be careful if I were you.

584
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,601
One hand?

585
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,112
All right, I'll bet you anything you want.

586
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,141
Anything?

587
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,515
All right.

588
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,955
You have a young paralegal
that works for you.

589
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,616
She's about to take the bar.

590
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,384
Even though I'm sure she's great
at what she does...

591
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,692
I think she'll make an even better lawyer.

592
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,096
I say this: If I make that shot...

593
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,564
you gotta give her a job as a lawyer
in your firm.

594
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,466
One year. No special treatment.

595
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,569
-Just a job and a chance to prove herself.
-That's ridiculous.

596
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,639
We scout the top law school graduates...

597
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,045
from all over the country for that job.

598
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,176
It starts at six figures, plus benefits.

599
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,782
Tell me, what the hell
are you gonna put up against that...

600
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,187
if you miss?

601
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,994
How about...

602
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,531
my new Benz?

603
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,602
It's got a can't-get-lost system. It's beautiful.

604
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,397
I know you want it.

605
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,866
You can own it.

606
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,977
All right. You got balls, kid.

607
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,778
Set it up.

608
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,645
Thanks.

609
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,177
So what do you say?

610
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,545
Come back to my boat, a little wine,
a little dancing.

611
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,777
You should see the moon over the water.

612
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,116
-lt's intoxicating.
-Will your wife be there?

613
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,656
Honey, you'll never believe
what just happened.

614
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,191
Excuse me.
Can't you see I'm talking to the lady?

615
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,022
Now you're not. So beat it.

616
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,961
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you all night.

617
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,898
Upstairs. I've got an unbelievable story
to tell you.

618
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,367
Can't you see
she doesn't want to talk to you?

619
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,903
Come on, Tara. Let's go.

620
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,031
-I'm not going anywhere with you.
-Who the fuck is this?

621
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:21,066
-He's a lawyer in our firm. He's a little drunk.
-I don't care who he is.

622
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,740
You talk to my girl again like that,
I'll take your teeth out with pliers.

623
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,340
Don't talk to him like that.
You'll get me fired.

624
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,683
-I can talk to him any kind of way I want.
-Good playing.

625
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,780
You had Phil shaking
like a dog shitting peach seeds.

626
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,656
Here's your end. And here's my card.

627
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,821
You come across action like that again,
count me in.

628
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,659
You know him?

629
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,023
You know him?

630
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,863
You hustled my boss?

631
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,264
Of course you did.
Why should tonight be any different?

632
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,639
You can't do anything
without playing an angle, can you?

633
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,611
I'm sorry, Uncle Mike.
I shouldn't have brought him here.

634
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,273
-That's your Johnny.
-This is Uncle Mike?

635
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,247
-You don't understand, sweetheart--
-I understand.

636
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,842
You think about one thing.

637
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,218
You care about one thing, and it is not me.

638
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,917
Please don't go. Get the fuck off me!

639
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,450
Are you crazy?

640
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,596
Women. You can't even
live with them anymore.

641
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,394
So, what about you?

642
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,767
I'll give you the keys,
and you can stay overnight at the office.

643
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,271
Thanks, Nick.

644
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,239
What are you going to do?

645
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,377
Gonna give up pool
and try to go back to her?

646
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,969
I gotta tell you something.

647
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,847
I don't think you can give up the game,
because you love it too much.

648
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,909
I don't know. Joe messed me up good.

649
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,012
Joe had nothing to do with it,
for Christ's sake!

650
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,517
Your trouble is, you played so many bums,
you almost became a bum yourself.

651
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,327
And you're not!

652
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:51,900
You're suffering from
a minor-league syndrome, understand?

653
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,596
You've gotta pull your ass out of that.

654
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,263
Tang and Danny don't belong in this place.

655
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,368
They don't belong in the world of pool.
But you do, for Christ's sake!

656
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,740
You have one of the most natural talents
in that arm I've ever seen in my life.

657
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,976
And what do you do?

658
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,214
You walk around pretending,
"I don't deserve it."

659
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,418
But you do deserve it,
don't you understand that?

660
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,549
That's a waste!

661
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,494
It's one of the biggest wastes in the world...

662
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,999
because you have the ability to be the best!

663
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,926
You come here.

664
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,531
You go around...

665
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,376
thinking you're a loser...

666
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,574
and, boy, you'll become a loser.

667
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,442
And pretty soon...

668
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,878
the only people you'll be able to beat...

669
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,913
are those people who think
they're bigger losers than you are.

670
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,318
Think it over.

671
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,444
Don't you fucking move!

672
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,844
You're gonna shoot me, Joe? Go ahead.

673
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,421
You killed me a long time ago.

674
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,051
You ungrateful fucking prick.
You don't remember, do you?

675
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,561
Where would you be without me?

676
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:29,292
I found you on the street,
living above the arcade with the rats.

677
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,164
Your mother and father
didn't care about you.

678
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,500
But I did. I was your father.

679
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,369
I bought you shoes and clothes.
I cleaned you up.

680
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,307
I taught you a skill.

681
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,475
I taught you the game.

682
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,674
The car you drive, the women you're with...

683
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:49,185
-everything you are, you are because of me.
-And what's that, Joe?

684
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,744
A fucking con man, a liar?

685
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,985
Someone who knows how to fuck you
before you fuck me?

686
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,527
I don't want to be that anymore.

687
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,427
-You owe me!
-I don't owe you fucking shit!

688
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:05,664
Don't tell me how you did it for me,
because you did it for yourself.

689
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,206
You saw a meal ticket in me,
and you fucking cashed it.

690
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,706
But you sold me out cheap, man.

691
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,078
You never gave me a chance.

692
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,483
What, you think I'd get too big for you?
Like I wouldn't need you anymore?

693
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,448
I needed you, Joe. I needed you a lot.

694
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,720
Because, you know, you're right.

695
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,849
My father never gave a fuck about me.

696
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,917
I needed you to be my father.

697
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,960
You don't like the way that tastes,
go ahead and shoot me.

698
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,296
You're a tough guy. You can do it.

699
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,600
You were never good enough to be a pro.

700
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,645
At 14, they would've chewed you up.

701
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,044
You should thank me. I saved you.

702
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,555
-Maybe he's gay.
-I think he might be.

703
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,788
-Are you gay? That's cool.
-I am not gay!

704
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,087
A little loud.

705
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,300
I think girls are a little weird, that's all.

706
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,897
This weekend, I was at this chick's house,
28 years old...

707
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,407
and she still has stuffed animals on her bed.

708
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,501
-Don't you find that strange?
-All chicks have stuffed animals.

709
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,547
They're chicks, they're weird.
You can't let that bother you.

710
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,674
-Scoot over.
-Dude, what happened?

711
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,412
What the fuck did you do
to your fucking hand?

712
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,981
I was drunk.
I slammed it in the door of my car.

713
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,355
-You gotta go see a doctor.
-I'll go. It's all right.

714
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,291
-You want me to take you?
-I'm good.

715
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,661
-I came here to talk to Max, actually.
-What's up?

716
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,962
I figured with my hand broke up like this...

717
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,969
I should get a job,
'cause I won't be shooting pool no more.

718
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,868
-You are drunk.
-How can I help?

719
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,875
I figured since you're the only degenerate
here who's got a job...

720
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,276
maybe I might ask that you put in a word
with that Merv guy.

721
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,573
Merv? You fucking kidding me?

722
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,810
He's not the kind you'd want to work for.

723
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,910
-Why?
-He's kind of a fucking asshole.

724
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,623
So, how bad could it be?

725
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,458
Come on, he's a good friend of mine.

726
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,927
Then definitely no. You think I want
anyone else like you working here?

727
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,089
Next thing, it'll be mutiny at Merv's.

728
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,566
Then they'll find me face down
in a puddle of blue toilet water.

729
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,604
Don't you want a good salesman?
The sign in your office--

730
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,264
I know what the sign says.

731
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,735
Did you ever sell motor homes before?

732
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,239
Did you ever sell cars before?

733
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,071
Have you ever sold anything before?

734
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,641
Then why the hell should I hire you?

735
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,310
-Because I got ESPN.
-ESP.

736
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,780
What the hell are you two talking about?

737
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,723
You know, Dionne Warwick,
Psychic Friends, all that.

738
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,851
It'll be a great asset for a salesman...

739
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,361
to know what a customer's thinking
at all times.

740
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,523
-I don't believe in that shit.
-You don't?

741
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,762
-I don't.
-Then let me prove it to you.

742
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,929
-How?
-I don't know. Let's make a bet.

743
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,174
-What kind of bet?
-Don't. Remember what happened last time?

744
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,910
What happened the last time?

745
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,276
Nothing. Forget it. We'll go somewhere else.

746
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,950
I'm tired of people not believing
in my psychic abilities here.

747
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,747
I'll tell you what.

748
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,517
If I can tell you where you got your shoes,
you give me a job, all right?

749
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,787
If not, I don't know, you can have my ring.

750
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,958
-He never gets the first one right.
-Will you shut up?

751
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,225
Fine, you got yourself a bet.

752
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,097
Sounds good to me.
Why don't you guys shake on it?

753
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,904
But you'll never get that job,
I'll tell you why.

754
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:32,601
I got these shoes when I was on a cruise,
in international waters.

755
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,611
So no matter what you say,
you're gonna lose.

756
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,515
I never said I could tell you
where you bought your shoes.

757
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:44,452
I said I can tell you where you got 'em.
Right now, you got your shoes on your feet.

758
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,693
-I hate it when that happens.
-How's today for you? Can you start today?

759
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,496
Hi, this is Tara. Leave a message.

760
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,096
Pick up the phone, will you, please?

761
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:02,664
Sweetheart, please pick up the phone.
I'm tired of leaving messages.

762
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,640
Hello ?

763
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,877
I'll just leave you ridiculous shit
on your machine...

764
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,077
until you run out of tape, okay ?

765
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,144
Pick up the phone. Hello?

766
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,390
All right, what do you want?

767
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,285
Who is this? Beth?

768
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,330
-I wanna speak to Tara.
-Tara doesn't want to speak to you.

769
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,696
Put her on the phone for me,
will you, please?

770
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,634
It's important. I need to speak with her.
God damn it.

771
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,140
-Don't take that tone with me.
-There's something I have to say to her.

772
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,074
-lt's very important.
-Tell me. I'll give her the message.

773
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,745
-Bye.
-No, wait. Hold on.

774
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,017
Can you take a message for me?

775
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,020
Okay, great.

776
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,984
Get a pen and paper.
Do you have one handy?

777
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,819
-Right here.
-You have it in your hand?

778
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,688
Write this down for me, please.

779
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,623
-We gotta follow our dreams, right?
-Right.

780
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,758
We live for the moment, right?

781
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:09,568
Love what you do while you're alive, 'cause
tomorrow a truck could hit you, right?

782
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,744
So I'm doing the right thing by taking
all the money my family's ever saved...

783
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:19,339
for me to go to college with, and use it
to bankroll myself on the road, right?

784
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,641
-You're not serious.
-He's serious.

785
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,619
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Please do something.

786
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,054
I've talked to him all day,
but he won't listen.

787
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,992
In that case, if he's got his mind made up,
there's no talking him out of it...

788
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,858
the only thing left to do
is to send him out in style.

789
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,525
Party, Chris's house, tomorrow night.
His parents are out of town.

790
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,867
Robin Hood,
thank you for donating my place.

791
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,497
Sorry, my parents just got
brand-new white carpeting.

792
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,666
Anything gets on that, and I am a dead man.

793
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:50,202
There is no way we could possibly have
a party at my house.

794
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:01,187
Could everyone please stand on the plastic?

795
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,918
What's going on? How are you doing?

796
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,458
What's going on?

797
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,928
Can I get you guys a beer?

798
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:07,986
How you doing?

799
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,089
What's up, doc?

800
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,998
Listen, man, the key to picking up women
is very simple.

801
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,296
Old Spice and Aqua Velva.

802
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,203
Are you kidding?
That's the shit my dad uses.

803
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,769
Exactly. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is the old-school shit.

804
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,041
What the fuck are you looking at?

805
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,475
It's cool.

806
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,979
It just seems like
everybody I meet nowadays is just...

807
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,021
weird.

808
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,981
What's up, my man?

809
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,553
I find myself wanting to meet a girl
who is completely normal, for a change.

810
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,791
You don't have any tattoos, do you?

811
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,231
Good.

812
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,302
Sweetheart, come on, Jacuzzi. You'll love it.

813
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,731
-What are you doing?
-Eating pop rocks, drinking pop.

814
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,833
Are you out of your fucking mind?
What's the matter with you?

815
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,537
Don't you know a kid died like that?

816
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,108
-Wait a minute.
-What?

817
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,451
Do you have any stuffed animals
on your bed?

818
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,181
No, of course not.

819
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,685
Okay, that's good.

820
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,533
What are you doing?

821
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,330
Choke me.

822
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,500
-What?
-Choke me. I like it.

823
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,602
Oh, my God!

824
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,014
That's just.... Jesus!

825
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,477
Yo, Romeo. Grab a brew and relax.

826
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,182
-That's easy for you to say. Jesus!
-Where's Tang?

827
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,920
Last time I saw him, I think
he was adopted by a 12-year-old boy.

828
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,896
Seriously, I can't believe
he's really going on the road.

829
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,100
Me, neither.
He has no idea what the fuck he's in for.

830
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,031
I think that's kind of the point.

831
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,628
But he doesn't realize
the situation that he's in.

832
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,431
It's not about the money.
He's gambling with his future.

833
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,036
If he fucks this up, then he can regret it
for the rest of his life.

834
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,980
-What's he got in the box, anyway?
-$40,000.

835
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,244
What? $40,000?

836
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,919
And you morons
didn't try to talk him out of it?

837
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,888
-What's wrong with you?
-I tried.

838
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,482
He's so jonesed about this,
he doesn't listen to us.

839
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,824
He's just trying to be like you.

840
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,126
-All right, guys.
-You get 'em, baby.

841
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,464
You go get 'em, Tang.

842
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,369
All right. It's me against the world, baby!

843
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,607
-Yeah, baby.
-You go shoot some stick, now.

844
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,115
-Think he'll last a month?
-I'll give you 3-to-1.

845
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,745
-I'll take it.
-All right.

846
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,896
-Who is next?
-That's what I'm talking about, baby.

847
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,771
Okay, mister.

848
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,845
I didn't even have any of it, you know.

849
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,883
Bye-bye. Anybody else? I'm game.

850
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,013
Anybody in here play for money?

851
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,686
-What do you play for?
-What do you got?

852
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:27,319
-I play $20 a game.
-How about we play $100?

853
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:31,164
And I'll give you four balls off the table.
You play 8-ball?

854
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,858
We usually play 9-ball.

855
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,666
You give me four balls off the table,
you got a game.

856
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,070
Put it up.

857
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,175
-Call it.
-Heads.

858
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,284
Take 'em down.

859
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,231
-Do it again?
-Put it up.

860
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,871
What's going on?

861
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,274
This guy's giving Chris four balls
off the table for $100 a rack.

862
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,477
Four balls off the table?
Since when does Chris play 8-ball?

863
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,917
I don't know. Why?

864
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,854
Four balls off the table's
the biggest hustle in the world.

865
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,791
Chris is getting his balls out of the way,
so this fucker can shoot.

866
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,760
That's game. Do it again?

867
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,929
-One more time.
-What's up?

868
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,435
-I'm about to beat this guy's ass.
-How much you down?

869
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,095
$200.

870
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,701
We've played two games
and I haven't shot yet.

871
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,039
As soon as he fucks up, I'll be on his ass.

872
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,602
Have you forgotten?
I'm on in an hour. Let's go.

873
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,979
-He's giving me four balls off the table!
-Let's go.

874
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,414
He's hustling you.
This guy's a fucking hustler. Let's go.

875
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,414
Take 'em down.

876
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,395
All right, Max, let's go.

877
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,900
We can't leave Chris here.
What if the fucker tries to start something?

878
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:15,028
He'll learn his lesson. Let's go.
I'll see you later. Don't be late.

879
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,366
I hate choosing.

880
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,764
I'm such a bitch.

881
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,338
Let's get to work!

882
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,990
Poor little white trash

883
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,262
Say you got some extra cash

884
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,897
Why don't you come

885
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:46,196
and blow it all on me ?

886
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,737
I ain't nothing but a smart ass

887
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,967
drinking from an empty glass

888
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,712
I'm as crazy as a tree

889
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,814
What's your hurry ?

890
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,657
Don't you worry, baby

891
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,689
Never shed a tear for me

892
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,828
Don't you worry, baby

893
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,156
I'm cold as a boy can be

894
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,233
I ain't scared of a broken heart

895
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,439
I get bored with the easy part

896
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:29,634
Heaven knows I'm a redneck gigolo

897
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,219
I think you and I

898
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,123
should go down by the seaside

899
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:52,297
Pick up all the dead things on the beach

900
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,902
Ain't nothing but a washed-up world

901
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,137
You ain't nothing but a stupid girl

902
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:06,172
I think that's the way that life ought to be

903
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,619
What's your hurry ?

904
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,987
Don't you worry, baby

905
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,528
Never shed a tear for me

906
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,329
Don't you worry, baby

907
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,765
I'm cold as a boy can be

908
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,504
I ain't scared of a broken heart

909
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,833
I get bored with the easy part

910
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,880
Heaven knows I'm a redneck gigolo

911
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:43,875
Come on!

912
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,927
All right, man.

913
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,300
Man, you were really good tonight.

914
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,000
Thanks, Harold.

915
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,302
Too bad no one will ever know.

916
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,776
Thanks for coming. I appreciate that.
Don't tell me. You lost.

917
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,087
-I know. I fucked up, okay?
-Yeah, you fucked up.

918
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,790
-God damn it. How much did you lose?
-$2,000.

919
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,192
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I'm waiting for you.

920
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,494
Now that Johnny's gone,
you're the top dog around here.

921
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,592
Maybe you want to step up.

922
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,402
You ain't welcome around here no more.
Nick says you're out.

923
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,873
Tell him I'll burn this place to the ground
if he thinks I'm out.

924
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:43,435
And tell Johnny, when he gets his hand
out of that cast I put him in...

925
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,538
that I want his game, too.

926
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,345
-You did that to his hand?
-What the fuck will you do?

927
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,043
Fuck! It's fucking bullshit, man.

928
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,449
We can't let them come into our pool room
and push us around.

929
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,193
-We gotta do something.
-What? Joe's a fucking psycho. He'll kill us.

930
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,388
We've gotta beat him at his own game.

931
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,365
That sounds great, but Joe's got
this demon fucking pool fiend with him.

932
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,631
-The guy never misses. He's unconscious.
-We'll get Johnny to play.

933
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:12,232
Fuck that. Johnny's out of his mind.
He's got chick drama and a broken hand.

934
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,105
Anybody's gonna step up, it's gonna be me.

935
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,411
Are you deaf? Did you not hear me?
The guy never misses.

936
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,075
-He just destroyed me.
-Chris, I destroy you.

937
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,175
This is different. The guy's really good.

938
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,619
I'll play him on table 4.
Nobody knows better how that table rolls.

939
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,089
That's true.
Table 4 does roll pretty fucked up.

940
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,150
You know why? I'm the one
who put the matchbox under the leg.

941
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:35,095
-Motherfucker.
-Give me my $100 back.

942
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,998
We're gonna have to pawn your car.
I need money to put pressure on them.

943
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,628
Wait a minute. Pawn my car?

944
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,164
-You're not gonna pawn my car.
-lt's just for one day.

945
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,175
Are you out of your fucking mind?

946
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,370
There's no way I'm gonna let you do this.

947
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:53,711
In a million years,
you are never gonna pawn my car.

948
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,860
Let's go, Phil. $500 a hole.
Let's get cracking.

949
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,091
Hold your horses. I gotta call my wife...

950
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,930
and tell her I'll be stuck in traffic
for at least a week.

951
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,197
Mr. Stein, you forgot to sign these.

952
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,136
Thank you.

953
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,534
That's great. You know...

954
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,313
I need to talk to the both of you.

955
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,612
Remember that bet you made?

956
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,650
This is the last time
I'm gonna call you, so....

957
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,393
I don't know, if you change your mind,
or if you ever check your machine...

958
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,227
then you'll know where to find me.
All right. Bye.

959
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,660
I am not having a good day.

960
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,297
Every day is a good day, kid.

961
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,232
Just try missing one once.

962
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:59,006
I gotta go get some felt for the tables.
I'll be gone a couple of hours.

963
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,778
-Keep an eye on the castle.
-You got it.

964
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:05,979
Here.

965
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,616
Here's the keys.

966
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:15,557
Make sure you lock up
before you leave, all right?

967
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,058
Back off her.

968
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,796
-Ma'am.
-Hey, Nick.

969
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,572
What happened to your hand?

970
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,875
I cut myself shaving.

971
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,986
Why didn't you tell me
what you did for me that night?

972
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,388
Because you spend so much time
always thinking that I'm an asshole...

973
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,723
that you never see
any of the good things that I do.

974
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,121
All I wanted to do...

975
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:52,463
was give you what I knew you wanted
more than anything in the world...

976
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,204
the only way I knew how.

977
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,538
The only thing I ever wanted was you.

978
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,712
I love you.

979
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,484
Wait.

980
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,155
-There's something I have to tell you.
-What?

981
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,022
I'm a motor-home salesman now.

982
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,833
I know. I heard.

983
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,596
What do you mean?

984
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,731
I saw you in the window, with the tie.

985
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,275
Are you stalking me now?

986
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,176
No. You almost made a sale.
I almost came....

987
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,339
Why are you gonna stalk me?

988
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,014
I just missed you, baby.

989
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,780
I missed you, too.

990
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,260
You guys want some action?

991
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,827
I'll be at Hard Times, table 4, tonight.

992
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,339
Can't miss me.
I'll be the one whipping your ass.

993
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,935
What's the weather like lately?
I haven't been outside.

994
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,445
What you wanna do, Brad....
Is that your name?

995
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,314
You wanna stroke it, not poke it.
Look how pretty that is.

996
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,087
I move 'em around pretty good, myself.

997
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,018
This is too easy.

998
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,625
Can you get that money up there?
My arm is....

999
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,262
Thanks. Appreciate it.

1000
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,723
-$500, baby. Easy as fucking pie.
-That's my boy!

1001
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,137
Where'd you get that stick?
Is that Johnny's cue?

1002
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,402
-He ain't using it, so I borrowed it.
-Danny, be careful, man.

1003
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:43,236
Something strange is going on.
He's not playing you the way he played me.

1004
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,338
Of course not.
I'm a lot better player than you are.

1005
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,905
Here he comes.

1006
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,575
-Nice table.
-You like that? Thanks.

1007
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,645
Why don't we switch tables
and double the bet?

1008
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,257
No, I say we play on this table or I quit.
That's the deal.

1009
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,954
You're such a punk.
Fine, let's double the bet.

1010
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,656
That sounds good.

1011
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,661
You weren't breast-fed, were you?

1012
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,997
Rack 'em, Joe, my finger's so'.

1013
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,708
Dead rail. I can't believe that!

1014
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,438
Table 4, baby.

1015
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,288
This guy's got us playing
on this fucked-up table.

1016
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,985
What's your deal?

1017
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,690
Are you gonna play,
or cry about it like a fucking baby?

1018
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,130
Bet $5,000.
He can't beat me three sets in a row.

1019
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,791
Shut up. It ain't your money.

1020
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,962
It's half my money.
You want out, I'll play him on my own.

1021
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,007
You can't fire an air barrel.
How will you cover if you lose?

1022
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,371
I'm not gonna lose. I'm in this guy's head--

1023
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:51,504
-Don't be an idiot. We don't have the money.
-Get the fuck out of here.

1024
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,445
Fine. $5,000. You call it.

1025
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,280
-You call.
-Tails.

1026
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,658
So you won a fucking break.
Big fucking deal.

1027
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,756
Pay up. $5,000.

1028
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,495
-Where's the money?
-Tough guy!

1029
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:20,891
Get the fuck out of here,
you punk-ass bastards. Get out of here. Go!

1030
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,036
Listen to me. The money. 24 hours.

1031
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,734
-Or next time I come back angry.
-You son of a bitch!

1032
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,140
-That's enough!
-I'll tell you when it's enough.

1033
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,088
-Fuck!
-Jesus Christ, what the hell are you?

1034
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,351
I'm a klutz.

1035
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,054
Fuck, Danny!

1036
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,059
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

1037
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,798
Get them up in the air so we can see them!

1038
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,897
Let's see them hands!

1039
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,048
Hey, Nick. What's going on?

1040
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,656
What's wrong?

1041
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,692
-Danny's in jail.
-What happened?

1042
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,791
He crapped out
firing an air barrel at Brad last night.

1043
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,463
How much?

1044
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,905
$5,000. He's stuck for half of it.

1045
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,301
And it gets worse.

1046
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:10,334
When Joe found out
that Danny couldn't cover...

1047
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,844
then he leaned on him pretty heavy,
beat the shit out of him...

1048
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,876
put a gun to his head and said,
"You've got 24 hours to get the money."

1049
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:21,582
That's when Danny went crazy,
tried to knock over Sal's.

1050
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,955
-What?
-He's in County Jail.

1051
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,219
It's $25,000 bail.

1052
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,987
We got to get him out, right? Nick?

1053
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,457
I'm sorry, kid.
I just don't have that kind of money.

1054
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,469
All I got is my dad's plastic.

1055
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,301
-I ain't got nothing.
-I can call my dad.

1056
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,067
No.

1057
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,009
What are you gonna do?

1058
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,542
I'm gonna go get my brother. Come on.

1059
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,046
Hey, Nick. He's here.

1060
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,550
Detroit. You got action.

1061
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,033
Come here. Give me the fucking thing.

1062
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:21,841
Fuck.

1063
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,549
Nick, anything on the bankroll?

1064
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,857
Nothing. De nada.

1065
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,092
The next level. Why don't you take over?

1066
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,897
Come on, set 'em up.

1067
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,672
-How's the arm?
-Horrible.

1068
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,578
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

1069
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:37,148
-Let's play the first set for $5,000.
-All right, fine.

1070
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,827
Fine. Call it.

1071
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,858
The money first. Put it up.

1072
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,532
What's wrong?
You don't think I'm good for it?

1073
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,195
Put the money on the lights.

1074
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:53,605
-I think you know me better than that.
-I know you too well, Johnny boy.

1075
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,438
I'm not gonna fall for any of your old tricks.

1076
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,138
The money.

1077
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,111
Fine. Just give me a second, all right?

1078
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:10,253
-What the hell are we working with here?
-lt's about $5,500.

1079
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,890
Christ!

1080
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,453
I got one barrel, no cue.
How the hell do I like it?

1081
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,499
It's okay. We're covered.

1082
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:21,258
-Jesus Christ, where'd you get that?
-I'm the rich kid, right?

1083
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,994
Don't worry about it.

1084
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,969
-Are we playing here, or what?
-We're playing.

1085
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:30,173
Joe, how about we play this one
for $10,000?

1086
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,442
-Ten's my favorite number.
-Nice cue. You shooting with that?

1087
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:37,144
No, that's not his cue, smart ass.
He's shooting with this.

1088
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:11,511
Fuck.

1089
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:16,455
You wanted a pro, you got one.
He's ranked 13th in the country.

1090
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:20,152
You don't stand a shot against him.
You had enough yet?

1091
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,859
Rack 'em.

1092
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:26,434
Christ, Nick, the kid's good,
but he's not that good.

1093
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,197
You're just getting started.

1094
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,932
Yeah, but it's just cost us $10,000
to get me started.

1095
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:34,339
You listen to me. I know this type of guy
from my past experience.

1096
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,935
This son of a bitch is not a stayer,
you understand?

1097
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:41,176
He'll crack sooner or later.
When he cracks, you'll win. Have faith.

1098
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:45,043
-"Have faith."
-Okay, you're covered.

1099
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,287
Covered? What the hell
kind of ATM you got?

1100
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,657
Thanks, Chris.

1101
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,511
Fuck!

1102
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,091
This is so sad.

1103
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,657
Wait here. I'm not done yet.

1104
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:36,838
I know. I think he's getting warmed up now.
Just give us another $10,000. Maybe....

1105
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:39,200
You motherfucker!

1106
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,175
How could you do this?

1107
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,407
This is fucking Tang, man!

1108
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:50,416
He don't got no fucking credit cards
and no Cadillac.

1109
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,513
You give me this rich-kid bullshit.
You got me in there pissing away his future.

1110
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,587
What the fuck are you doing?

1111
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,628
What am l, a baby?
Like I had no say in this?

1112
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,455
-My friend was in trouble. I came to help.
-What the fuck, man?

1113
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,595
He bails out Danny now
and pays off his debt, he's out $30,000.

1114
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,570
Then he's broke, too. What the fuck?

1115
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,130
All right, we just took a fucking chance.

1116
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,302
Come on. We never thought you'd lose.

1117
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,440
Here, man. Take this.

1118
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,547
Keep your money.

1119
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,826
What are you gonna do?

1120
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,657
Come on. Just take the money! I'm sorry!

1121
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,198
All right, what do you say we bump the bet?
Play this one for $20,000.

1122
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,498
How much you got up there, John?

1123
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,236
You wouldn't be flashing me
no nigger roll, would you?

1124
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,972
'Cause that don't look like no $20,000.

1125
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:55,216
As long as we're doing this,
why not play for $50,000?

1126
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,619
I've been looking for him all day.
Are we too late?

1127
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,086
No, perfect.

1128
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,919
-Sorry I'm late, John. Hi, how you doing?
-Who are you?

1129
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,725
His backer.

1130
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,962
What do you say you match what I got,
and we play till somebody takes it all?

1131
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,134
-$20,000 is okay.
-Are you sure?

1132
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,935
-Race to 5 for $20,000.
-Put it up.

1133
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,231
All right.

1134
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,787
At least you got Tang's money back.

1135
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,883
Yeah, but my brother's still in jail.

1136
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,528
Come here. Get over here.

1137
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,797
-Put him the fuck out. Come on.
-I got him.

1138
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,858
-Bet $40,000.
-Fine. Good. Even better.

1139
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,208
Go ahead. Shoot 'em.

1140
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:21,953
Don't miss.

1141
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,965
Fuck this back-and-forth bullshit.
It's a big waste of time.

1142
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,664
You want to put it all up, Mr. Backer man?

1143
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:35,142
Come on. Last set. Shoot it all.
Race to 9 for $80,000.

1144
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:40,647
I'm betting this big-time action
brings out the dog in your boy, over there.

1145
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,350
Did I just stutter or something?

1146
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:51,990
A few minutes ago, it was like a pool hall
in here. Now it's as quiet as a church.

1147
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,256
Is this your first time in a pool hall,
Mr. Backer man? Is that it?

1148
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,736
Your clothes getting a little mashed?
Let me tell you something.

1149
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:07,375
When you walk out of here,
your skin will smell of this place for a week.

1150
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,876
Every time you put on that suit,
you will think of me taking your money.

1151
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:16,316
'Cause I'm the only one in this room
who knows how fast your boy can run.

1152
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:19,114
You want to know why? 'Cause I bred him.

1153
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,882
How the fuck does that make you feel...

1154
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,527
to be in that position,
with all your money on the table?

1155
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,563
-How much you got, Joe?
-What?

1156
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,088
Total. You put down $80,000
like it didn't matter.

1157
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:36,001
That's a lot of money for somebody
like you and him. I think it matters.

1158
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:39,040
-What's the difference--
-I'm a millionaire.

1159
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,841
That's the difference.
I lose $80,000, I get another $80,000.

1160
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,442
For me, it doesn't matter.
See, I think it's you...

1161
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:50,210
who's sweating this, the both of you.

1162
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,745
People in pool rooms don't come across
this kind of take but once in a lifetime.

1163
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,057
And now you're gonna
put it all on the line against John...

1164
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,027
'cause you think he's gonna choke?
I don't think so.

1165
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,087
I think he's gonna choke.

1166
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,792
You want to shoot it all, let's shoot it all.

1167
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:11,370
-How much you got in your pocket?
-I got a couple of thousand.

1168
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,066
You?

1169
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:17,970
$500.

1170
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,778
-What about your ring?
-What?

1171
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,512
-How much for your ring?
-You want my ring?

1172
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,986
You said it: "Shoot it all."

1173
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:30,983
-What's it worth to you?
-I paid $2,800 for it.

1174
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,387
$3,000. Covered.

1175
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:40,367
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.
Nick, make sure, please, it's all there.

1176
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:43,463
I'm gonna have a drink. You want a drink?

1177
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,633
All right.

1178
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,221
You watch those nature documentaries
on the cable?

1179
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,253
Yeah.

1180
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,298
See the one about lions?

1181
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,829
Got this lion.

1182
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,506
He's the king of the jungle.
Huge mane, out to here.

1183
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,872
He's laying down under a tree,
in the middle of Africa.

1184
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,406
He's so big. He's so hot.

1185
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,219
He doesn't want to move.

1186
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,384
The little lion cubs,
they start messing with him.

1187
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:39,755
Biting his tail, biting his ears.
He doesn't do anything.

1188
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,362
The lioness, she starts messing with him...

1189
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:48,500
coming over, making trouble. Still nothing.

1190
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,870
Now, the other animals notice this...

1191
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:56,068
and they start to move in, the jackals.

1192
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:58,940
Hyenas.

1193
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,373
They're barking at him, laughing at him.

1194
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,485
They nip his toes
and eat the food that's in his domain.

1195
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:09,456
They do this...

1196
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:13,927
then they get closer and bolder,
till one day...

1197
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:18,828
that lion gets up
and tears the shit out of everybody...

1198
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,427
runs like the wind,
eats everything in his path.

1199
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:27,405
'Cause every once in a while,
the lion has to show the jackals...

1200
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:31,209
who he is.

1201
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,879
It's too late to be scared. It's time to kill.

1202
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:45,054
I'm going in the other room.
You come out when you're ready.

1203
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,800
Don't beat him. Kick his ass.

1204
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,758
Watch this 2-ball go down.

1205
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:11,931
Fuck.

1206
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,839
That's fucking bullshit!
I can't fucking believe this.

1207
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,511
I don't know. I think I gotta bank it.
There's nothing else I can do.

1208
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,613
You can do it. It's a two-rail safety.

1209
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,678
I think you're right. Thanks, Nick.

1210
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,938
Good shot.

1211
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,986
Take that, you motherless motherfuckers!

1212
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,294
Stop. Easy. No....

1213
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,521
Shit!

1214
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,041
Shoot the shot already. It's an easy shot.

1215
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,418
-Easy shot, my ass.
-Shows how much you know.

1216
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,390
I can't believe I'm playing
with somebody so fucking stupid.

1217
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:41,053
I ain't biting on any of your
South Side shark techniques, so shut up.

1218
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:42,721
The shot can't be made, Brad.

1219
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,231
Believe me,
I'd rather have you shoot it than me.

1220
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,528
Me, too.

1221
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:53,235
-Come on!
-Bullshit.

1222
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:56,367
If you think it's so easy,
why don't you come and shoot it?

1223
01:26:56,444 --> 01:27:00,244
Believe me, I wish I could.
I'd pay to shoot a shot like that.

1224
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,979
How much is it worth to you, Johnny boy?

1225
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:05,851
What are you saying?

1226
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,822
You think you can make it. I say
it can't be made. I don't want him doing it.

1227
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:13,452
So why don't you speak to Daddy Warbucks
and see how much it's worth?

1228
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:17,328
I don't gotta ask nobody nothing.
That's a tough fucking shot.

1229
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,662
It's worth, maybe, $200 bucks.

1230
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:24,802
$200? We're playing for $100,000
and you want to offer me $200?

1231
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,599
Offer me $5,000,
and then maybe I'll think about it.

1232
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,473
What are you saying, Joe?

1233
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:34,174
You don't want to go home broke
once John makes this shot.

1234
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:36,980
Listen, mister, all due respect...

1235
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,815
but save your money,
'cause you don't know the game.

1236
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,821
The shot can't be made.

1237
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,148
It's up to you.

1238
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,359
Here's your gas money.

1239
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,256
You're gonna need it.

1240
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,628
Excuse me.

1241
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,542
Come on, get legs.

1242
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,475
Fuck!

1243
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:15,713
What the hell were you thinking?
I told you you couldn't make the shot.

1244
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:23,158
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking my shot.

1245
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,362
See, I just paid $5,000 for your shot.

1246
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:32,434
Now it's my shot.

1247
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,139
Listen, you can't do that.

1248
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,414
-He just did.
-This is bullshit!

1249
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,246
It's not an old trick
you should have been looking out for.

1250
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,619
-This is fucking bullshit, man!
-Here's what my brother owes you.

1251
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,989
-Fuck you.
-You and I got some unfinished business.

1252
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:56,029
The rest of y'all clear out.
It's about to get rowdy in this motherfucker.

1253
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,763
-Go!
-Later, Joe.

1254
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,373
A game like that, you should be on the tour.

1255
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,017
I don't think you'd want me beating you
every week.

1256
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,521
You didn't beat me. I got hustled.

1257
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:26,216
Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't.

1258
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:29,952
-I guess I'm a hustler.
-Doesn't have to stay that way.

1259
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,155
Think about it.

1260
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,147
Wanna get out of here?

1261
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,085
Let's go get your brother.

1262
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,988
-Wait, we're not going in that.
-What are we going in?

1263
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,821
We're going in that.

1264
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:02,788
That's my Uncle Mike's car.

1265
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,992
Not anymore. Come on.

1266
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,680
Okay, boys, you ready?

1267
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,119
Go.

1268
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,427
Give me two seconds.... Okay, I'm all right!

1269
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:08,528
Jesus Christ.

1270
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:18,167
-I'm telling you, right now--
-No way those are real.

1271
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,366
What we need is a plastic surgeon.

1272
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,774
Shut up! We need a consensus,
all right? Tang?

1273
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,575
They must be real. There's no scar.
I'm going with God.

1274
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,047
Are you retarded?
There's laser technology now.

1275
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,574
They can remove scars, plus God made
plastic surgery. 100-percent fake.

1276
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,588
I don't know. It's a shot in the dark,
but I'll go with real.

1277
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:39,387
I can't leave Max hanging on this.
They look great, but a little too amazing.

1278
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,984
I'll say store-bought.

1279
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,306
All right! Is that your final answer?

1280
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:56,371
Want to take the 50-50? Audience choice?

1281
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,575
-Come on.
-All right, okay!

1282
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:02,148
All right, Scarlet.
Here's the moment of truth.

1283
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:05,617
-Are they real, or are they Memorex?
-They're real.

1284
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:08,712
I knew it!

1285
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:12,850
-Scarlet, they feel hard as a rock.
-Never go swimming. You'll drown.
