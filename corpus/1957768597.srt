00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,622
Sorry about
that misstep earlier.

179
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,326
I guess I just went
someplace else for a moment.

180
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,161
What were you
thinking about?

181
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,364
Uh... my father.

182
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,933
Please,
won't you have a seat?

183
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,267
Thank you.

184
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,269
Seems he just never
fails to trip me up.

185
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,039
Oh, unrealistic expectations?

186
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,708
Oh, you could say
that, yeah. Yours too?

187
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,977
My father wants me
to be Connie Chung,

188
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,146
but the thought of
not being blonde just--

189
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,717
That's very funny!

190
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,053
But what about your father?
What does he expect?

191
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,789
He wants me to take over
the family business.

192
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,023
Oh, what's that?
Christmas.

193
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:57,196
Uh, gifts, shipping,
toys mostly.

194
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,067
But he refuses to listen
to any of my ideas.

195
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,869
He won't let me
update anything.

196
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,038
Seems he's just stuck
in the last century.

197
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,174
How does he make
his deliveries?
Pony Express?

198
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,742

202

You're pretty funny yourself!

203
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,249
Well...

204
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,719
Wait. You should talk to Hector.

205
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,255
He has a very interesting idea.
I think you might like it.

206
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,158
So I suggested Nick forget
about the family business

207
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,393
and start one of his own.

208
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,795
Well, I've got
the primo idea, amigo.

209
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,464
It's an online
Christmas charity.

210
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,399
And you'd be
the perfect guy to run it.

211
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,102
You're already huge
on the fund raising circuit,

212
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,038
so why not start
your own charity?

213
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,206
Sounds intriguing.

214
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,175
Call me tomorrow
and we'll talk.

215
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,777
Okay, Hector.

216
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,979

Good to see you.

217
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,482
Why don't you call me
tomorrow as well?

218
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,851
And we'll talk?

219
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,419
Talking's good.

220
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,221
To start with.

221
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,794
I'm glad we finally met.

222
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,862
Me too.

223
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,042
Good morning, Jasper.

224
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,310
And a lovely morning
it is, too.

225
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,013
Oh, thank you.

226
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,216
Great party last night, huh?
[chuckles]

227
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,889
Yow!

228
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,892
Does Mrs. Sarathi have
to put curry on everything?

229
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,431
Anything wrong?

230
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,134
You're not your usual chatty

233
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,347
And yet, it remains
oddly chilly in here.

234
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,484
What's going on, Jasper.
Why the silent treatment?

235
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,820
Do you have to go
out of your way

236
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,122
to attack your father
and his traditions?

237
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,091
Me?

238
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:09,161
Every time I open my mouth,
all I get is the old, ho ho ho.

239
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,530
Why not just show up,
take over,

240
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,499
and then change
whatever you want?
Yeah, well.

241
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,168
It's a little late
for that, isn't it?

242
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,938
He obviously doesn't think I'm
ready to fill his boots.

243
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,339
And what do you think?

244
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,575
And what is that supposed
to mean?

245
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,544
Do you think you're ready?

246
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,114
I know your father is
a hard act to follow,

247
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,449
and Christmas is
an enormous responsibility,

248
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,120
and we all get nervous
at the idea of a challenge--
Wait a minute.

249
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,890
Are you suggesting that
I'm afraid to take over?

250
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,392
Well, I was merely
stating that--

251
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,329
For Heaven's sake, Jasper, me?

252
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,032

255
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,480
You don't like my cooking?
Fine, I won't cook anymore!

256
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,850
No, no Mrs. Sarathi,

...but delicious.

259
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,256
I was merely suggesting that

260
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,125
perhaps you should try
a little less--
If I wanted to be mistreated,

261
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,493
I could go back
to my own country!

262
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,196
Now, now, let's not
get carried away.

263
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,466
Carried away? I'll show
you carried away. I quit!

264
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,335
Is there a problem?

265
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,437
Not if you mail
my check to Daytona!

266
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,711
Why is it so difficult
to keep a cook?

267
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,015
All I want is someone who can
run the kitchen as smoothly
as you run the this house.

268
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,116
Is that too much to ask?

269
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,418
Not at all, sir.
Good.

270
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,054
Then you'll find a replacement
by the end of the day.

loves entertaining.

351
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,868
Of course there'll be caterers
to help you with that.

352
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,339
What else?
Oh, yes, your accommodation.

353
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,675
You'll have a private entrance.

354
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,611
I'll be living here?
Yes, is that all right?

355
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,613
Yes.

356
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,916
I'm sure my aunt
will love her privacy again.

357
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,318
[gasps]

358
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,387
When will I meet
Mr. St. Nicholas?

359
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,656
I don't believe he's
here at the moment.

360
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,526
I think I heard his Ferrari
leave about ten minutes ago.

361
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,529
His Ferrari, is it red?

362
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,731
Yes.

363
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,900
Is that a problem?

364
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,669
I hope not.

365
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,705
I've set up several charities,

366
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,373
so I can handle the
administrative stuff.

367
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,809
But I need a partner
with a familiar face

368
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,245
and fund raising clout.

369
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,447
Okay.
I'm listening.

370
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,916
It's an online charity.

371
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,885
It's a Web site
that lets people ask

372
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,653
for what they want
for Christmas.

373
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,957
We buy the gifts
with the money people donate.

374
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,292
I like it.

375
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,664
And people could donate more
than just money, couldn't they?

376
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,901
Yeah.
We could match up people
with something to give

377
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,769
with people
who need something.

378
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,506
There's a poor family
that wants to give
a computer to their kids,

379
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,541
and you've got one
you want to get rid of.

380
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,410
Or they need a Christmas dinner
and you've got a spare turkey.

381
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,311
Sure.

382
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,248
It would be like running
my own Christmas.

383
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,749
Exactly.

384
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,551
In fact,

385
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,254
the name I picked is...

386
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,989
MrStNick.com.

387
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,926
Oh, I don't know if
that's really appropriate.

388
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,264
We could shoot a couple of
commercials at Heidi's station,
promote the heck out of it.

389
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,932
What do you think?
[Woman on intercom]
Mr. Villarba?

390
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,967
She's ready.

391
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,471
Wait until you see
Mrs. Claus.

392
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,513
Now that's festive, hmm?

393
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,994
Who plays Mr. Claus?

394
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,930
That's where you come in.

395
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,432
Look, I don't think
that's a good idea.
Oh, why not?

396
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,434
Well, Santa Claus?
I don't think so.

397
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,937
Sure, you'd be great!
You're a great public speaker.

398
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,506
Yeah, but not on television,
not on camera.

399
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,441
I don't have any experience.
No experience?

400
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,044
No problem.
TV's great that way.

401
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,279
I'll walk you through it,

402
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,014
give you tips on Teleprompter
technique.

403
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:21,954
Besides, who wouldn't believe
you as Santa Claus?

404
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,442
Hi, Armando.
Pardon me, Mr. Nick.

405
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,814
Wow! What smells so wonderful?

406
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,816
Dinner.
I'm making pabellon criollo.

407
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,517
That's Venezuelan, isn't it?

408
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,553
Yes, that's where
I'm from originally.

409
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,555
I'm Lorena Braga,
the new cook.

410
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,490
Nick St. Nicholas,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

411
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,092
Say, don't I know you
from somewhere?

412
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,327
No.

413
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,396
You look so familiar
Well, you know us Latin women,

414
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,864

415
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,000

we're easy to confuse.

[shouts in Spanish]

417
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,435
That's it!

418
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,004
You drive a Volkswagen!

419
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,439
I don't know
about Venezuela, Ms. Braga,

420
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,108
but here,
road rage is frowned upon.

421
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,945
In Venezuela, we stay
on our side of the road.

422
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,747
Excuse me?

423
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,415
There's something
you should know.

424
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,952
I don't really care for it
when people talk back to me,
especially in my own home.

425
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,086
No wonder you're still
a bachelor.

426
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,055
What's that supposed to mean?

427
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,791
I guess women lose their appeal
once they start talking.

428
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,463
Jasper! Jasper!

429
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,998
Is everything all right, sir?

430
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,367
No! She drives a Volkswagen.

431
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,935
Right.

432
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,071
I'll take care of that
immediately, sir.

433
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,940
Would you like me to quit now,
or stay until you're found a
replacement?

434
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,877
You don't want to quit.
Why do you want to quit?

435
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,012
Why does she want to quit?

436
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,915
Well--
She's extremely qualified.

437
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,150
She'll stay.

438
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:06,058
Just tell her how I feel about
sarcastic remarks and such...

439
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,593
and when people
answer back to me.

440
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,868
To us, finally meeting.

441
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,339
I have to admit,

442
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,842
I'm still a little apprehensive
about doing that TV commercial.

443
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,544
Oh, you're a natural
for the part.

444
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,180
And don't worry,
I won't let you look foolish.

445
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,048
Well, there's really
only so much you can do.

446
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,616
Pepper?
Thank you.

447
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,454
I have to say,
I admire celebrities

448
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,689
who lend their names
and faces to charity.

449
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,125
Well, I always like
to speak out for
a good cause.

450
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,928
And I admire that--
a woman with strong opinions

451
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,865
not afraid to speak her mind.

452
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,434
Thank you, Lorena.

453
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,902
You may go now.

454
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,043
Nick, let me be
honest with you.

455
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,046
One of the down sides
to being famous is

456
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,082
that everybody wants
to get close to you,

457
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,984
but not always
for the right reason.

458
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,020
So I've become
a very guarded person.

459
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,692
It's not easy for me
to trust someone,

460
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,494
but I have a good feeling
about you.

461
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,431
The good feeling is mutual.

462
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,106
[sleigh bell alarm]

463
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,746

Good morning, dear.

464
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,081
Sleep well?

465
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,785
I love the busy season.

466
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,253
If Nick doesn't want
to take over,

467
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,955
I could do this
for another hundred years.

468
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,091
Oh, dear,

469
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,895
I was so looking forward
to retiring this year.

some lovely condos open.

on the milk and cookies, hmm?

Just e-mail us your

who can help grant it.

Or, send a donation to help

Oh, my God.

00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,743
Remember, "Mr. St. Nick"
isn't just my name

Did not!

that was my best one so far.

494

That was great, kids.
You look terrific.

00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,621

00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,997

to you for a second?

500
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,932
Sure.
I'll be right back.

Can you help him out?
He's clutching a little bit,

00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,104

you're treating the kids
like they've got cooties.

Yeah, hey, thanks, buddy.

507
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,749
Thanks.
Okay. Take nineteen.

508
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,953
Hey, did you see that?

509
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,788
That's not his wheelchair!
That kid can walk!

510
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,024
I know!
Isn't it wonderful?

511
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,261
You are doing a terrific job.
Oh, this suit is killing me.

512
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,730
Oh, it's just nerves.
It happens to everyone.

513
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,300
Just have fun with it.

514
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,375
So, what did you think?

I think you look like
a cheap burlesque

516

of everything
your family stands for.

517

Oh, come on, Jasper.
It's all in good fun.
All for a good cause.

518
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,921
The next time you feel compelled
to lampoon a holiday legend,

519
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,223
why don't you dress up
as the Easter Bunny?

What?

521
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,064
What's going on?

and, uh,
I've never done this before,

701
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,438
so quite frankly,
I don't really know
what to say.

702
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,609
And you want my advice?

703
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,377
Yeah, well maybe just
a couple of pointers.

704
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,379
Okay, so you're Heidi.

705
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,547
What?

706
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,516
And uh, okay,
just sit there.

707
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,918
Should I get down on one knee,
or is that too old-fashioned?

708
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,322
Women have fallen for it
for centuries,
so it must work.

709
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,857
Okay.

710
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,227
Um...
[clears throat]

711
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,528
Oh, sir

712
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,230
Um...

713
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,465
What do you think women
want to hear?

714
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,202
I suppose you could always tell
her that you love her.

715
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,337
Love. Love is good.

716
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,972
Yes.

717
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,207
Hmmm. Um.

718
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,577
It's a tricky one.

719
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,315
Start by telling her
how you feel.

720
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,685
List the qualities she has
that make her special to you.

721
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,320
Do you mind?

722
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,256
Not at all.

723
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,924
Thank you.

724
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,493
Because that is
what is important,

725
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,895
that she is special to you.

726
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,930
Maybe you enjoy
her fun-loving spirit.

727
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,765
Yes, I do.
I do.

728
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,867
Then tell her.

729
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,269
Okay

730
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,978
Heidi, most people wait
their whole lives

731
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,247
hoping to find
that special someone.

732
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,016
To feel a connection

733
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,352
to feel as if they're meant
to be together.

734
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,588
That that person
is your other half,

735
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,256
your soul mate.

736
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,293
And every day I look forward
to seeing your face

737
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,728
and hearing your voice.

738
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,996
And when I walk into a room--

739
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,832
I just hope you'll be there.

740
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,968
Yes.

741
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,605
Will you marry me?

742
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,009
What do you think?

743
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,345
I--

744
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,848
I think it will work.

745
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,883
Do you have a ring?

746
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,551
Oh, yeah, yeah.

747
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,553
I knew I was forgetting
something.

748
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,992
[gasps]

749
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,729
That will definitely work.

750
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,600
Thanks.
[laughs]

751
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,706
[Secretarial Elf]
Stewart Ames.

752
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,741
[Santa] Naughty.

753
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,376
Cynthia Aaron.

754
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,978
Nice.

755
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,412
Next.

756
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,615
Brian Abbott.

757
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,950
Very naughty.

758
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,052
Or maybe he's nice.

759
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,621
No, naughty.

760
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,656
I'm pretty sure
he's naughty.
Next.

761
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,992
Joanne Abernathy.

762
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,793
Nice.

763
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,894
Give her that doll
she wants.

764
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,063
She wants
a Razor Scooter, sir.

765
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,032
Oh, of course.

766
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,967
Give her the scooter.
Next?

767
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,302
Albert Artale.

768
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,904
Nicholas, I--

769
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,507
Would you excuse us
a moment, please?

770
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,414
Nicholas, have you looked
outside recently?

771
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,794
Oh, what's wrong
with the Aurora Borealis?

772
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:17,995
I don't know.

773
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,698
And I don't know
what's wrong with you.

774
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,799
Me?

775
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,001
Nothing's wrong with me.
I'm fine.

776
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,103
You are not fine.

777
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,806
Look at you.
You're not yourself.

778
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,974
You can't fix toys.

779
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,077
You don't know which child
is which anymore?

780
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,481
Nicholas,
something is very wrong.

781
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,583
I think we should call Mimir.

782
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,621
No, no. I don't need to see
any blasted wizard.

783
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,091
Everything's perfectly normal.

784
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,026
That's normal?

785
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,738
[chattering]

786
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,816
You thought
of everything.

787
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,885
I'm just doing my job.

788
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,558
You don't seem too happy
about Mr. St. Nick's romance.

789
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,759
The woman wears fur.

790
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,462
Primitive, but not a crime.

791
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,030
And that dress.

792
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,700
I've seen more fabric
on a pot-holder.

793
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,104
And why, may I ask,
should you care?

794
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,538
I don't care.

795
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,140
What makes you think I care?
I just--

796
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,142
I just don't have a good
feeling from that woman.

797
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,745
Jasper, can we get
the lights any lower?

798
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,913
Not unless I dim
Miami, sir.

799
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,948
[Nick]
Where's the dessert?

800
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,016
It's right here.

801
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,053
What are you doing?

802
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,888
I'm putting the ring
into the dessert.

803
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,223
Not in my soufflé.

804
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,592
It's romantic.
No, it isn't.

805
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,894
Do you want her to choke?
Choke?

806
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,598
She should choke--
She could choke on that ring.

807
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,032
She has a point, sir.

808
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,770
You wouldn't want to have
to Heimlich your fiancée.

809
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,938
So I should just give it
to her?

810
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,039
Okay.

811
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,941
Thanks, Lorena.
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

812
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,244
"Heimlich" my fiancée.
[chuckles]

813
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,779
What was all that about?

814
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,048
She "should choke
on that ring"?

815
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,518
I didn't want my soufflé
ruined by a big diamond.

816
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,653
Or a big blonde.

817
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,790
Of course,
you're not falling for him.

818
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,925
Me?

819
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,661
For Mr. St. Nick?
Are you kidding?

820
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,663
I saw the way your eyes lit up

821
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,065
when you were helping him
with the proposal.

822
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,168
I am not falling for him.

823
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,071
I am not.

824
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,147
Heidi, there's
something I want to ask you.

825
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,225
People wait their whole lives,

826
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,528
hoping to find
that special someone,

827
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,897
and when they do,
they should seize the moment

828
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,532
and not let it get away.

829
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,001
Heidi, will you--

830
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,907
I was in the middle
of something very important.

831
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,742
More important
than destroying Christmas?

832
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,944
What are you talking about?

833
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,012
MrStNick.com?

834
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,248
What's next?
Chanukah-in-a-can?

835
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,916
Explain yourself, Nicky.

836
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,051
Explain what?

837
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,053
That horrible commercial.

838
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,287
You mean you saw it
already?

839
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,092
Shame on you,
turning our proud family
heritage and our name

840
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,161
into that vulgar website.

841
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,864
And that suit was awful.

842
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,131
Okay, you're right.

843
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,099
You're right.

844
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,802
But the message was good,
don't you think?

845
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,973
Message?
When I was your age,
I had a real message.

846
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,941
Peace on earth.

847
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,309
Good will toward men.
Yes.

848
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,111
I'm just trying to expand
on that.

849
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,114
That dot-com thing
is a stupid idea.

850
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,084
And lazy.
You're looking for other people
to do your work.

851
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,852
That's not true.

852
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,821
Dad, you only take care
of children.

853
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,256
What about adults?

854
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,058
I'm just trying to get more
gifts to deserving people.

855
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,027
And if you'd listened
to my ideas in
the first place--

856
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,062
Don't turn this around
and blame me.

857
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,267
You have never included me.

858
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,868
Even when I was a little boy

859
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,070
I used to beg you to let me
sit on your lap

860
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,372
and drive the sleigh.

861
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,275
A little Santa wants to do
that with his father.

862
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,244
And every boy wants to spend
Christmas with his dad.

863
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,747
I couldn't.

864
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,215
Ah, here we go.

865
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,752
This younger generation lives
to drag up the past.

866
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,855
Fine. You don't want to talk
about it, let's not talk
about it.

867
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,090
You know, now's not really
a good time for me anyway.

868
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,126
I think I've found my Queen.

869
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,329
The beautiful woman
in that commercial
that you two hate so much.

870
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,264
That's the woman
you intend to marry?

871
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,732
Yes.

872
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,670
And I should be home right
now asking her to--

873
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,971
marry me!

874
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,073
Oh, Nick.

875
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,277
That is so sweet
and romantic and loud.

876
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:04,782
Well, I'm just so excited
I want the world to know
how happy I am.

877
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:08,953
Heidi...

878
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,227
will you marry me?

879
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,432
Yes.

880
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,067
I would love to.

881
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,007
That's not exactly how
we rehearsed it.

882
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,143
Well, it worked, didn't it?

883
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,116
Why did you zap him out
in mid-sentence?

884
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,018
I didn't.

885
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:46,323
You mean, he zapped himself?

886
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,026
Oh.

887
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,335
Now, that does it.

888
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,137
I'm calling Mimir.

889
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,140
No, no, don't call that--
that quack.

890
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,310
She just did.

891
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,478
Mimir.

892
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,713
Yes, the quack himself.

893
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,050
Oy, I hate making
house calls.

894
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,285
So, what are
the symptoms?

895
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,354
Well, he can't fix toys

896
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,390
or get into his suit

897
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,392
or remember
who's naughty and nice,

898
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,027
and he's lost his appetite.

899
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,828
Blast it, Carlotta, I'm fine.

900
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,465
And, he's losing
his jollies.

901
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,368
That's definitely not good
for a Santa.

902
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,471
Let's see what the runes
can tell us.

903
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,052
"Herring rots from the head."

904
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,319
[Santa]
Huh?

905
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,123
"Only salmon swim upstream.

906
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:58,095
The wise cod rides the tide."

907
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,329
What's that supposed to mean?

908
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,331
Well, it means
something's fishy.

909
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,033
How should I know?

910
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,469
I just read the stuff.
I don't write it.

911
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,072
Can you try to interpret them?

912
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,973
Oh, all right.

913
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,408
Just for the "halibut."

914
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,245
Okay, let's see.

915
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,083
"Herring rots from the head."

916
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,818
I suppose that refers to you.

917
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,985
I'm a herring?

918
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:26,356
You're the head.
Of the household,
and the holiday.

919
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,991
If something's wrong
with the head,

920
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,794
the whole holiday goes bad.

921
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,497
"Only salmon swim upstream."

922
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,133
Now that must refer
to your spawn.

923
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,901
Nick?

924
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,904
He's swimming
in the wrong direction.

925
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,974
Away from Christmas and
everything that goes with it.

926
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,511
While you're hanging
on past your time.

927
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:52,449
"The wise cod rides the tide."

928
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,552
That means, go with the flow.

929
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:01,125
Follow the natural order,
father to son.

930
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,561
You can't battle forces
beyond your control.

931
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,097
It's the twelfth month
of the hundredth year,

932
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,566
and that means Nick's
becoming Santa Claus,

933
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,168
whether you like it or not.

934
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,569
Ah, enough of this nonsense.

935
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,305
"Flow with the cod" my foot.

936
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,507
I've got work to do.

937
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,075
I have a Christmas to deliver.

938
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,012
You couldn't deliver
a newspaper.

939
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,048
You're losing your powers,
and your son's getting them.

940
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,417
The kid's got to handle
Christmas,

941
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,853
or there won't be
a Christmas.

942
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,357
So, it's all up to Nicky?

943
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,526
[sighs]

944
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,362
Voila.

945
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,165
There you have it,
the family home.

946
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,066
Oh, Nick.
That's amazing.

947
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,403
Oh, and the crowning touch--

948
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,138
here's Dad.

949
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,406
[chuckles]

950
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,075
Uh, Dad's holiday decorations.

951
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,179
He goes all out
for Christmas, I'll tell you.

952
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,080
And where did you say
your parents lived?

953
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,116
Up north.

954
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,884
Way up north.

955
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,153
I can't wait to meet them.

956
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,154
[muttering]
Oh, yes you can.

957
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,357
You know,
I've been doing
some thinking.

958
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,360
I was planning an intimate
soiree on Christmas Eve.

959
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,962
What do you say we get
married then?

960
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,030
[wines spills]

961
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,498
[Jasper]
I beg your pardon, sir.

962
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,400
On Christmas Eve?

963
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,936
Nick, that is so romantic.

964
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,939
Excuse me, sir, but don't you
have something else to do

965
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,574
on Christmas Eve?

966
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,375
No, Jasper,
don't you remember?

967
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,010
That was cancelled.

968
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,579
Lorena,
what do you think?

969
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,314
Can we pull off
a wedding?

970
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,015
In a week?
Sure, why not?

971
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,084
A Christmas Eve wedding.

972
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,520
You are the best gift
a girl could ever get.

973
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,288
Really?

974
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,457
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

975
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,260
Are you all right, sir?

976
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,962
Of course
I'm all right, Jasper,

977
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,631
I've never been better.
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

978
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,267
I'm just very happy.

979
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,369
You're positively jolly, sir.

980
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,439
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

981
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,140
[continues]

982
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,521
Madre de Dios.
Look.

983
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,656
What is that?

984
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,725
It looks like
the Northern Lights.

985
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,326
In South Beach?

986
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,594
Bet you didn't forecast that.

987
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:22,232
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

988
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,207
First we lose
the Aurora Borealis,

989
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,343
and now we're losing the snow.

990
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,280
Mimir is right.

991
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,516
All your Christmas magic
is going away.

992
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,653
You have to pass
the torch to Nicky

993
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,256
before it goes out altogether.

994
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,659
At least talk to him.

995
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,028
Tell him what's going on.

996
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,329
Oh, all right.

997
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,635
Nicholas XXI, come home.

998
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,472
[gasps]

999
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,976
You mean you can't even zap
him home anymore?

1000
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,146
I just need a little rest.

1001
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,150
Reach out and touch him.

1002
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,225
...is kind of spectacular
cosmic display

1003
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,661
that normally occurs
in arctic areas.

1004
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,397
And yes, your Miami
meteorologist

1005
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,700
was amazed along
with everyone else.
[phone rings]

1006
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,134
I mean, no one could've
predicted this...

1007
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,036
Hello?

1008
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,606
Oh, hello, Your Majesty.

1009
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,310
Uh, okay.

1010
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,212
Just hold on one moment, sir.

1011
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,246
It's your father.

1012
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,715
Oh, it is, is it?

1013
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,049
Well, please tell him for me,

1014
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,051
it'll be a cold day in Miami

1015
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,554
before I talk to him again.

1016
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:54,458
Yes, I know it's
almost Christmas Eve.

1017
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,294
Can I call you right back,
Your Majesty?

1018
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,162
Thank you.

1019
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,200
[Jasper]
What was all that about?

1020
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,168
I've spent my entire life
trying to please that man.

1021
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,303
Well, not anymore.

1022
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,804
You don't want to do this, sir.

1023
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,840
Marry Heidi and never speak
to my father again?

1024
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,042
That's exactly
what I want to do.

1025
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,180
[revs engine]

1026
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,750
[tires screech]

1027
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,486
Today's temperature
should reach the low 90's,

1028
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,187
and that means it's going to be

1029
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,690
another sunny, sultry day
in paradise.

1030
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,326
I'm Heidi Gardelle.

1031
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,460
[State Manager]
And cut.

1032
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,195
[stage bell rings]

1033
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,302
Hi.
Hi. What a nice surprise.

1034
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,804
Are you busy?

1035
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,806
Just finished doing
the weather for the week.

1036
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,875
In one day?
It's Miami.

1037
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,110
The only thing
that changes is my clothes.

1038
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,780
'Course I may have to do
updates on this whole
Northern Lights thing.

1039
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,581
Right.

1040
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,316
Can we talk?
Sure.

1041
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,722
Come on in.
Here, have a seat.

1042
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,728
Before we get married,

1043
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:09,232
I thought there were a few
things about me you should know.

1044
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,568
It's only right that I open up
and tell you everything, right?

1045
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,337
Of course.

1046
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,707
I'm Santa's heir apparent.
Excuse me?

1047
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,843
My father is Santa Claus.

1048
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,145
I was supposed to take over
the family business,

1049
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,348
but he is so bull-headed
Your father is Santa Claus?

1050
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,817
Yes.

1051
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,351
At some point
you're going to meet the folks,

1052
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,220
and it's going to come up,
believe me,

1053
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,790
so I just thought you
should know what's going on.

1054
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,526
Your father is Santa Claus?

1055
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,162

01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,114
[phone rings]
Hello.

1404
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,548
How soon can you get
to the airport?

1405
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,750
Nick's been arrested,

1406
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,286
and I've got $5 million
and two tickets to the Caymans.

1407
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,423
Flight's in one hour.
I'm on my way.

1408
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,360
Did you hear what's happened
to Nick?

1409
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,095
Just found out.
There must be some mistake.

1410
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,430
I'm going to see him now.

1411
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,332
I'm right behind you.

1412
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,705
[Woman]
...while filming
a commercial--

1413
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,377
They wouldn't have arrested him
if they didn't have proof.

1414
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,747
Don't be so quick to judge,
Mija.

1415
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,716
He's innocent
until proven guilty.

1416
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,885
This is America.

1417
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,854
Besides, it's Christmas.

1418
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,857
Peace on earth,
good will towards men.

1419
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,859
I hate men.

1420
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,195
I can't believe
he's a crook.

1421
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,864
I know. I know.
He had us all fooled.

1422
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,134
No, I'm saying
I don't believe it.

1423
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,170
I know Mr. St. Nick
can be weird and all,

1424
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,237
but a crook?

1425
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,907
This guy
is totally into giving.

1426
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:02,678
And look.
Look what he's done for us,
for all the kids.

1427
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,879
A crook wouldn't do that.

1428
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,123
Merry Christmas, St. Nicholas.

1429
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:19,795
Perhaps a night in cooler'll
help jog your memory.

1430
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,264
But I don't know anything.

1431
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,234
Well, I don't.

1432
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,473
[Man]
Hey.
Yes, sir.

1433
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,878
Aren't you that guy on TV?

1434
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,379
Santa Claus.

1435
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,482
Alias Nick St. Nicholas.

1436
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,717
Hey. Hey, man.

1437
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,785
Sit down.
Thank you.

1438
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,754
Get out of there.
[yelps]

1439
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,190
So what're you in for?

1440
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:49,658
Generosity.

1441
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,293
Yeah? Me, too.

1442
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,195
I gave a new client
a free sample.

1443
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,930
He turns out to be a cop.

1444
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,733
I'm telling you, man,
no good deed goes unpunished.

1445
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:58,901
Hm.

1446
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,836
Worst part?

1447
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,872
My old lady set me up.

1448
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,840
Really?
Yeah.

1449
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,810
My friend Hector set me up.

1450
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,912
At least I thought
he was my friend.

1451
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,481
Sir?
[Nick] Jasper.

1452
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,550
Ah, there you are.

1453
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,519
How are earth did this happen?

1454
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,586
Hector set him up, man.

1455
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,921
No.
Yes.

1456
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,890
Apparently, he took
all the money from the charity

1457
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,892
and put it in
an offshore account
in my name.

1458
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,927
But how he managed
to get that, I don't know.

1459
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,228
Where's Miss Gardelle?

1460
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,796
Heidi?

1461
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,598
With any luck she
doesn't even know I'm here.

1462
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,267
Oh, she knows.
I told her.

1463
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,434
What?

1464
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,271
She said she was coming here.

1465
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,939
This Heidi
your woman?

1466
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,541
My fiancée.

1467
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:39,808
She know this Hector?

1468
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,010
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he introduced us.

1469
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,411
Oh.

1470
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,712
Wait a minute.

1471
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,881
Are you suggesting that--

1472
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,317
But Heidi's my fiancée.

1473
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,853
[Man]
And Hector was your friend.

1474
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,988
I don't believe that Heidi
would set me up.

1475
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,859
Yeah, well, it's 'cause
you're in denial, dude.

1476
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,562
Sir, I have
other pressing news.

1477
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,865
What, more pressing
than my fiancée framing me
for fraud?

1478
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,633
Your mother's here.

1479
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,702
[groans]

1480
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:07,937
Dear.

1481
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,772
You didn't tell her
I was in jail?

1482
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,608
No, of course not,

1483
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,444
but she told me that you--

1484
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,979
um...

1485
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,783
Could we have a private moment,
please?

1486
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,052
Yeah, sure.

1487
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,420
Thank you.

1488
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,624
You're Santa Claus.

1489
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,392
Oh, yes, Jasper.
Very funny.

1490
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,860
No, I'm not joking.

1491
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,529
Your father isn't well.

1492
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,966
The magic has left him

1493
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,901
and has come to you.

1494
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:39,735
Are you sure?

1495
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,937
You can't get
out of your Santa suit.

1496
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,941
You hear children's
secret wishes.

1497
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,409
You go on a date

1498
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,311
and bring the Northern Lights
along?

1499
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,649
Do I have to draw
a picture, sir?

1500
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,452
I'm Santa Claus?

1501
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:02,591
Well, I'm doing a swell job
so far, aren't I?

1502
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,465
Just when Santa Claus
should be loading up
his sleigh,

1503
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,968
I'm getting sent up the river.

1504
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,372
Some Santa I turned out to be.

1505
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,007
I couldn't even pick
the right Mrs. Claus.

1506
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,408
[Lorena]
We can find him ourselves,
officer.

1507
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,609
Thank you.

1508
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,878
[Nick] Lorena.

1509
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,881
Danny.

1510
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,483
Just tell me
you didn't do this.

1511
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:28,917
I didn't.
I swear it.

1512
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,885
[Danny]
I told you.

1513
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,920
Hector and Heidi set him up.

1514
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,889
I never liked
that woman.

1515
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,958
Tell me about it.

1516
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,993
Could you give us a minute?

1517
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,695
Yeah, sure.

1518
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,832
Lorena, please believe me.

1519
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,669
I would never use
Christmas that way,

1520
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,505
and I would never do anything
to disappoint those kids

1521
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,407
or you.

1522
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,577
I know.
I believe you.

1523
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,912
You do?

1524
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,447
Well, I'm glad to hear that

1525
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,882
because there's something
I've got to tell you,

1526
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,984
and it's going to sound
a little crazy,

1527
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,653
but, um...

1528
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,088
I'm--
Sir.

1529
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,556
Jasper, not now.

1530
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,362
I'm Santa Claus.

1531
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:17,966
Santa Claus?

1532
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,002
Yes.

1533
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,603
Okay.

1534
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,138
Okay?

1535
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,974
Okay.

1536
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,843
You mean, you believe me?

1537
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,915
Mr. Nick St. Nicholas,

1538
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:37,853
you are the kindest,
most generous man
I have ever known...

1539
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,924
and if you tell me
you are Santa Claus,

1540
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,892
then I believe you.

1541
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,595
I knew it.
No wonder you could hear
what I was thinking.

1542
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:50,466
And I want to make
those wishes come true, Danny.
I really do.

1543
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,067
I hate to interrupt, sir,

1544
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,971
but you have to make
an awful lot of wishes
come true...

1545
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,005
and real quick.

1546
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,941
Right.

1547
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:02,778
Jasper, you think I've got
all my father's powers?

1548
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,147
Now would be an excellent time
to find out, sir.

1549
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,850
Then, by the power
of Christmas...

1550
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,622
get me outta here.

1551
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,059
Wow.

1552
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,894
He really is.

1553
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,596
He really is.

1554
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:23,132
Man...

1555
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,867
wish I could do that.

1556
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,107
Where is he?

1557
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,746
Over here.

1558
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:43,051
I guess his navigation
isn't fine-tuned yet.

1559
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:51,126
I guess I really am Santa.

1560
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,900
Bye-bye.
Bye.

1561
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,002
Bye-bye, hope you enjoyed
your flight.

1562
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,503
Hardly.

1563
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:02,838
I'm sorry.

1564
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,006
I'm normally pretty jolly,

1565
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:07,009
but I'm not myself lately,

1566
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,677
and I'm not used to flying
commercial.

1567
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,947
We better get out of here.
Nick, my car.

1568
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,081
Right.

1569
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,988
Now, everybody buckle-up.

1570
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:23,058
Prisoner escaping!
Prisoner escaping!

1571
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,960
There! Prisoner escaping.

1572
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,964
[Man]
Move! Move!
Hold it!

1573
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,041
[sirens blaring]

1574
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,042
Does thing go over 60?

1575
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,543
Turn left, turn left.

1576
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,719
Whoa.

1577
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,020
[tires screeching]

1578
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,525
Cut over.

1579
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:06,935
[horn beeping]

1580
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,707
[tires screeching]

1581
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,088
What the...

1582
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,924
Snow?

1583
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,325
[horns honking]
[drivers clamoring]

1584
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,628
[Woman] It's snowing.
[Man] I have no idea, man.

1585
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,099
Well, what do we do now?

1586
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,202
Perhaps we need
more Santa power, sir.

1587
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,649
Here goes nothing.

1588
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,654
Whao.
[laughing]

1589
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,956
Ho-ho-ho.

1590
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,793
I'm getting the hang of this.

1591
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,072
There's no way
I'm phoning this in.

1592
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,042
Today's temperature should
reach the low 90s,

1593
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,777
and that means
it's going to be
another

1594
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,980
sunny, sultry day
in paradise.

1595
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:25,948
I'm Heidi Gardelle.

1596
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,051
Heidi-- what kind of name
is that for a Queen?

1597
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,020
[Nick laughing]
[Lorena] Whoa!

1598
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,355
[honks]

1599
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:36,658
[thudding]
Nicky.
[gasps]

1600
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:40,395
Mom.

1601
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,064
Mother.

1602
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,966
Sonny. Sonny.

1603
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:47,769
Oh, sweetie.

1604
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:51,039
Nicky, how can you marry
that silly weather girl?

1605
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,442
She can't even tell her suns
from her snowstorms.

1606
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,243
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm not going to marry her.

1607
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,712
You're not? No.

1608
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:59,181
I'd like you to meet Lorena
and Danny.

1609
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,649
Where's Dad.

1610
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,453
He wouldn't come.

1611
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:07,389
He said, you should
"bloody well come to him."

1612
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,992
Well, forget it.
Of all the stubborn--

1613
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,727
Like father, like son.

1614
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,998
All right.

1615
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,234
Take me to my father.

1616
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,077
Oh, miss?

1617
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,880
Aren't Mrs. Claus,
on that dreadful commercial?

1618
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,815
Why, yes.

1619
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:34,983
Excuse me, I'm running late.

1620
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:39,154
I believe you know my son,
Nick?

1621
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,025
You're Nick's father?

1622
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,894
Nicholas XX.

1623
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,797
Well, I would love to stay
and talk,

1624
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,899
but I have a flight to catch.
[magic whispers]

1625
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,000
Nick.
[gasps]

1626
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,035
Dad.
Nick.

1627
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,236
Heidi.

1628
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:56,471
Isn't it a small world?

1629
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,407
I ran into the girl
you're going to marry.

1630
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,109
Not anymore I'm not.

1631
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,011
Where are you going?

1632
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,379
Don't tell me.

1633
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,114
Just off for
a little impromptu trip?

1634
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:10,252
You, and Hector, and a whole
lotta loot from our charity?

1635
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,221
I take that as a yes.

1636
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,090
How could you?

1637
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:18,527
Those people believed in us,
in Christmas.

1638
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,996
I was amazed at all the
outpouring of love and kindness

1639
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,365
and good will.

1640
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:26,435
But then that's what Christmas
is all about--

1641
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,070
opening up your heart,

1642
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,305
to show people just
how much you love them.

1643
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,241
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

1644
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,476
Yes, lovely.

1645
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:36,211
Now, could you let me go?

1646
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,416
Gladly. [scoffs]

1647
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,319
Now, she is definitely...

1648
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,987
[together]
Naughty.

1649
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,025
Thank you.

1650
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:56,465
What took you so long?

1651
01:18:56,498 --> 01:19:00,168
I had to meet the parents.

1652
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,070
Don't ask.

1653
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,305
Besides,

1654
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,541
you didn't think I'd let you
and those millions of dollars

1655
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,043
leave without me, did you?

1656
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,878
[P.A. dings]

1657
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,013
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is our captain.

1658
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,182
We'll be experiencing
a rather unusual delay

1659
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:17,886
due to what appears to be
the first snowstorm
in Miami history.

1660
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:21,289
We're not sure when it'll blow
over, so just sit tight.

1661
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,501
And we're back.

1662
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,568
Nicky.
Welcome back, sir.

1663
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,103
I found him at the airport.

1664
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:36,438
Would you believe
he took commercial?

1665
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:40,108
Oh, Nicholas, oh,

1666
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,277
my poor pudding.

1667
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,046
Dad, I'd like you to meet
a couple of friends of mine.

1668
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:45,981
This is Danny and...

1669
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,149
this is Lorena.

1670
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,117
It's so nice to meet you,
sir.

1671
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,252
Nice to meet you.

1672
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,955
Very nice.

1673
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,491
Well...

1674
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:57,826
Well, what?

1675
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:01,096
You said it would be a cold day
in Miami when you talked to me.

1676
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,331
Start talking.

1677
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,368
All right.

1678
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,003
You want me to take over
Christmas,

1679
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,070
you've got to let me take over.

1680
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,206
I'm just afraid that you don't
really want to retire.

1681
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,175
You're right.

1682
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,309
I am?

1683
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,443
I don't want to retire

1684
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:20,081
because when I'm not
Santa anymore,

1685
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,583
who will I be?

1686
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,085
Dad...

1687
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,587
you'll always be Santa...

1688
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,156
the Santa of the century.

1689
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,358
Last century.

1690
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,594
Dad, you did an amazing job.

1691
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,197
You don't have to be scared
to retire.

1692
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,566
Thank you.

1693
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,069
And you don't have to be
scared to take over.

1694
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,371
Scared, me?
What are you talking about?

1695
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:47,409
Nick, admit it.
You're a little scared.

1696
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,012
Well, who wouldn't be?

1697
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:54,082
Being Santa Claus--
it's a huge responsibility.

1698
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,350
I don't wanna screw up
Christmas.

1699
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:57,152
You don't want to let
the kids down.

1700
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,353
I don't want to let you down.

1701
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:02,591
Me? What do I
have to do with it?

1702
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:04,059
Everything.

1703
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,262
What if I don't live up
to your expectations?

1704
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:12,167
It's not what I want
that matters.

1705
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,670
You have to be the Santa Claus
that you want to be.

1706
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:19,341
And I trust you'll be
a good one.

1707
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,412
Oh, Dad.

1708
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,548
Thanks, Dad.

1709
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:30,051
I will, I promise.

1710
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,053
With some help.

1711
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:34,055
Lorena,

1712
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:37,525
people can wait their whole
lives hoping to find
that one person

1713
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:42,564
who truly is their other half,
their soul mate.

1714
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:47,068
For me, you're that person.

1715
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:52,474
Each day I look forward
to seeing your face

1716
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,043
and hearing your voice

1717
01:21:55,076 --> 01:22:01,082
and when I walk into a room,
I hope you're there.

1718
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,060
Lorena...

1719
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,430
will you marry me
and be my queen?

1720
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,968
Yes, of course.
I would love to.

1721
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,477
[Nicholas Sr.]
Oh, I almost forgot.

1722
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,383
Drop the weapon!

1723
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:38,186
It's a torch

1724
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,021
Drop it, St. Nicholas!

1725
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,556
Never.

1726
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,092
[people gasp]

1727
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,063
[Woman]
Did he just...

1728
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,230
[Man]
This is getting weird.

1729
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,468
"Do not open for 10 to 20."

1730
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,139
Well, well, well.

1731
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:00,709
[chuckles]

1732
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,411
[sirens chirping]

1733
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,513
You know, maybe we better get
out of here.

1734
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,816
Danny, how'd you like a job
over the Christmas vacation?

1735
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,351
Santa's helper?

1736
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,785
That'd be awesome.

1737
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,155
I'm ready now, Dad.
[bang on door]

1738
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,671
All right, all right.

1739
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:30,705
Take it easy everybody.

1740
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:34,275
It's time to do this.

1741
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:39,114
So, by the power vested in me,

1742
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,116
and so on and so forth,

1743
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:44,419
and I see you've already passed
the torch,

1744
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:49,324
so yadda, yadda, yadda,
you're Santa Claus.

1745
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,425
[cheering]

1746
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:58,433
Jasper, will you keep an eye
on this until I get back?

1747
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:01,503
I should be delighted,
Your Majesty.

1748
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,539
So when are we going
to schedule that wedding?

1749
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,775
Soon as we get back, right?

1750
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,276
Sounds perfect.

1751
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,111
We?

1752
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,147
Yeah, you and Danny
are coming with me.

1753
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,215
Tonight? Really?

1754
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,851
Christmas is a family holiday.
You two are my family.

1755
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,387
We better get a move on we've
got a lot of work to do
tonight.

1756
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,657
Son, you'll need this.

1757
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,162
Thanks, Dad.

1758
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,800
Nice beard, by the way.

1759
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,668
Oh, yeah,
how about that?

1760
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,171
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1761
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:39,340
Merry Christmas... son.

1762
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,580
Ah, Santa?

1763
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,148
Yes?

1764
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:49,684
Better get going.

1765
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,554
He's right.

1766
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,189
Danny.

1767
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,800
Okay, Danny.
Hop on up there.

1768
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,335
This is so cool.

1769
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:08,603
Lorena.

1770
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:12,207
Mmm, I'm not so sure
about the beard.

1771
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,908
Oh, don't worry.

1772
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,877
I just did this for my Dad.

1773
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,645
And Christmas.

1774
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,180
You ready, Danny?

1775
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:20,548
Ready.

1776
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:23,685
Ready Mrs. Claus?

1777
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:26,721
I'm ready,
Mr. Nick St. Nicholas.

1778
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,524
Oh, what the heck?
Call me Santa.

1779
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,895
On Dasher, on Dancer,
on Prancer, and Vixen.

1780
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:39,534
On Comet, Cupid,
on Donner, and Blitzen.

1781
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,736
Hyah!

1782
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:43,171
Good-bye.

1783
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:57,485
Merry Christmas to all...

1784
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:01,222
and to all, a good night.
