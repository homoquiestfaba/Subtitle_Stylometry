1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,473
OK, how do you like this shipped?

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,886
Standard ground takes 7
to 10 business days...

3
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,156
or if you need it tomorrow, we can
overnight it for an extra 20 bucks.

4
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,550
Well, I don't need it tomorrow.

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,036
Well I'm a Supervisor here
I can knock it down to 15 for you.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,357
Well thanks. I'm tempted.
I'm so impatient.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,110
Hey for me, it's instant gratification.

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,660
Alright... what the
hell, ship it overnight.

9
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:57,879
No problem.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,678
If you have any other
questions call anytime.

11
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,356
My name is Todd Anderson.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,471
- Thanks Todd.
- Your very welcome

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,112
I need you in my office.

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,478
Is this gonna take a while?
I just ordered

15
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,156
from Thai Garden and I'm pretty fast.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,079
So you like spicy food?
That's interesting.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,877
Close the door please.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,072
Why is that interesting?

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,954
Todd, we decided to
restructure order performance.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,356
- Restructure how?
- Offshore the whole department

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,879
- Good one.
- I'm not kidding.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,497
Check out this spreadsheet,
any American job that's

23
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,994
done on the phone or
online is going overseas.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,498
The savings are incredible.

25
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:54,875
Is this some kind of weird physiological
test, you're pulling on me?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,639
Like a ritual hazing for the
annual review.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,018
It's not quite time for
your review Todd. You

28
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,276
been working coming up
on 4.5 years, not 5.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,599
You can't outsource Order Fulfillment.
Our catalog is patriotic knick-knacks...

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,076
If a factory worker from Wisconsin
calls the 800 number to buy this...

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,749
and get's a person from another country,
he's gonna flip out.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,316
That's where the accent
training comes in.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,954
You expect me to walk in
there and tell everyone

34
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:23,468
I'm sorry your job
has been outsourced?

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,477
I'll do it.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,952
- So I'm fired too?
- No, no, not at all.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,338
But I manage fulfillment,
now you don't need me here.

38
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,596
You're right, we don't need you here.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,113
We need you in India...
someone's gotta train the new guy.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,617
And after that?

41
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,593
We'll find something for
you, company's growing.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,159
- 'We'll find something for you'?
- 'Course you're free to quit.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,396
But you haven't vested your
stock options yet. Quit

44
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,511
now and you'll give it
up, plus your pension...

45
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,773
and medical and you'll
be out there, in a bad

46
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:59,033
job market with no
unemployment benefits.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,748
As these guys, in about 20 minutes.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,356
No, no way, I'm not going to India to
train my own replacements.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,420
All you need to do, is
visit the call center,

50
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,359
improve the minutes per incidents...

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,189
and make sure the new guy's up to speed.

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,359
- What's this new guy get paid?
- Half a mill...

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,057
Rupees.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,075
That's 11.000 dollars a
year, to do your job.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,558
Same as 8... as for the price of one.
What're you gonna do?

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,434
- Come on, let's get MPI go down to 6.
- No, I'm not going.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,678
It's just a short trip,
you like spicy food?

58
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:39,795
Dave, I'm not going to India.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,354
I gotta get to a train station?

60
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,910
Hi, can you get me to the
train station?

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,258
Oh crap... no, Sir, Sir!
I wanted a taxi, a taxi.

62
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,596
No problem.

63
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,998
Alright, sorry, thanks'...
let me grab my bag, thanks.

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,577
Woo, wo, wo... no, no,
no, stop, stop, stop.

65
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:25,036
No, no, no, go, go, go...

66
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,919
Hi...

67
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,595
- You like it in India?
- Well, it's interesting.

68
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,096
It is the best country,
...no problem.

69
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,018
Hey... no problem, you've
got to jump... jump.

70
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,515
What?

71
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:30,994
- You jump... you must jump the train...
- There's no room.

72
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,990
You must jump... jump.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,990
Jump... good.

74
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,992
I'll... I'll take one of those.

75
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,430
No change, no change...
impossible, no change.

76
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,235
Oh, that's okay, I'm dying of thirst.
Keep the change.

77
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,039
- You're sure?
- Yea, it's fine.

78
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,935
- You like?
- Mm...

79
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,135
Are you Mr. Doad?

80
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:27,075
Mm, yes... no, I'm Todd, Todd Anderson.
Western Novelty.

81
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,697
I sent a car, but you were not there.

82
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,294
I didn't see it, I had to take
one of those taxi go-kart thingy.

83
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,835
So sorry for the inconvenience.
I'm sorry, please to meet you, Mr. Doad.

84
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,670
I'm Purohit Narsimacharaya
Virajnarianan, but you can call me Puro.

85
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,780
Puro?

86
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,759
Puro, I'll take you to
your hotel, please come.

87
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,112
Sir... Sir, please come back, I'm here.

88
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,313
I'm waiting for you, good day, good
night, good morning... please come.

89
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,111
You like India?

90
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,394
Bombay is a little crazy, but Gharapuri
looks different... a little cleaner.

91
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,991
Bombay is terrible... terrible,
Gharapuri is very clean.

92
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,715
- You have a business card, Mr. Doad?
- It's Todd, please call me Todd.

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,874
Executive Vice-president of Marketing
and Order fulfillment. Very impressive.

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,393
Not as impressive as it sound. What I
really do, is sell kitsch to rednecks.

95
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,796
Now I train some other schmuck to do it.

96
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,396
- May I ask a question?
- Yea, go ahead.

97
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,996
Would you kindly be telling
me, what is kitsch,

98
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:57,471
and what is redneck,
and what is schmuck?

99
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,835
Kitsch is garbage that people buy.

100
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,511
- And Redneck basically means farmer.
- Farmer?

101
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,074
And a schmuck?

102
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,919
That means like a nice guy...
you're the person I'm gonna train?

103
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,638
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that.

104
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,231
I'm so fortunate to be learning the way
of American business from you, Mr. Doad.

105
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,194
Todd please... call me Todd.

106
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,357
- Your first trip to India?
- Yes

107
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,597
Some foreigners who come here,
do not experience it well.

108
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,836
But I can tell, you are
of a different breed.

109
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,952
A very good traveler.

110
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,197
Strong, and ready for
anything, and everything.

111
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,198
That's very kind of you,
why do you say that?

112
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,949
Most foreigners cannot eat cola
without becoming very ill.

113
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,518
How far is the hotel?

114
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,819
Your reservation is for
the Gharapuri Palace

115
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,997
Hotel, but that place is very lonely.

116
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,817
I'll take you to Aunt
Ji's guesthouse, she will

117
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,513
take care of you better,
then your own real mother.

118
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,076
No, actually, I just like to go
to my hotel, I'm tired, and I...

119
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,634
Please, I insist, we go to Aunt Ji.

120
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,072
She has a very good garden, most
excellent Indian cook... very hygienic.

121
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,509
You won't be lonely
there, I'm telling you.

122
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,758
OK, fine... I'll check it
out, just make it quick.

123
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,713
Yes, schmuck.

124
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,993
There, please come, please come.

125
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,318
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

126
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,216
You must be tired from
your trip from Bombay.

127
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:13,992
No, no, no, we're just here to look.

128
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,035
Look, look... I have some tea freshly
made, especially for you only.

129
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,994
- And what is your good name?
- My good name?

130
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,515
This is Mr. Doad to
you, fresh from America.

131
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,910
Oh... Mr. Doad, how sweet.

132
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,350
Please come in, please... come in...
come in.

133
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,998
Thank you.

134
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,998
So... Mr. Doad.
What does your father do?

135
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,669
What is it you're selling?
Are you married?

136
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,019
No, I'm not married.

137
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,712
Ah... you have a girlfriend, hmm?

138
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,877
No, I did, but we broke up a
couple of month ago.

139
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,754
Why break up?
You should be married.

140
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,148
Well a... she wanted to start a family
and I wasn't quite ready yet.

141
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,316
Not yet? My god.

142
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,037
You're old enough to be a grandfather.
What're you waiting for, ha?

143
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,233
Just eat. Very nice.
Fresh.

144
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,872
That's good.

145
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,933
What?

146
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,397
Sir, you should not
place the hand that

147
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:43,633
has been in your mouth,
back in the food.

148
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,036
And a... you should not
eat with your left hand.

149
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,833
In India, we eat with the right hand.

150
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,636
- Left hand is considered to be...
- Dirt...

151
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,957
- Unclean.
- Unclean, unclean yes.

152
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,163
Why?

153
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,561
Why...

154
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,014
OK...

155
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,637
That's great. OK.

156
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,356
That's good, thank you... thank you.

157
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,276
We work from 6 in the evening to
6 in the morning. Daytime in America.

158
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,040
That's unscrupulous,
aren't you tired?

159
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,679
No, no, no, we are accustom
to the problem by now.

160
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,758
Is it true that... when I'm manager...

161
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm going to earn
500.000 rupee a year?

162
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:50,159
That's what they told you.

163
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,554
Because of my future salary, I'm now
engaged to Bageshy Sasubude.

164
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,274
Bagy who?

165
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,516
Watch the...

166
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,837
She's cute.

167
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,590
She's more beautiful than Ashwe Naray.
I've loved her all my life.

168
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,838
I could never think of
marrying her until,

169
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,955
Western Novelty hired
me for 500.000 rupees.

170
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,357
Are you kidding me, this is it?

171
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,870
There's no office, to rent in Gharapuri,
so we had to build one.

172
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,516
This is outsourcing all the real estate,
in Bombay, Madras, Bangalore...

173
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,872
even Gharapuri, so we had to build one.
Please come.

174
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,112
This here is the supervisor.

175
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,633
And here we have the agent division.
They work very hard.

176
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,798
It's OK.

177
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,277
And because of America,
we have different time zones.

178
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,110
Seattle, New York, Chicago and India.

179
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,993
Puro, what is that?

180
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,352
Oh, this?

181
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,756
This is our MPI monitor,
Minute Per Incident.

182
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,757
This is going to go up on the wall.

183
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,000
This is the average time our
agents solve the calls in.

184
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,910
What? Oh, that just a cow,
must have wandered in. One minute.

185
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,558
Don't worry Mr. Doad, we
are fully operational.

186
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,315
We have state of the art computers...

187
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,074
digital phone lines, optical
modems, everything.

188
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,429
- Mr. Doad, are you OK?
- I have a cramp.

189
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,915
The cola.

190
00:19:58,817 --> 00:19:59,832
Oh god.

191
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,410
- One rupee.
- Not a good time.

192
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,790
- One rupee.
- Tomorrow.

193
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,638
- Only one rupee.
- I don't have a rupee

194
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,756
- Please.
- Is that all you can say?

195
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,637
Hungry, only 1 rupee.

196
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,948
All right.

197
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,354
Now leave me alone, alright.

198
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,790
No, no, no, don't touch.

199
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:27,878
- Hey...
- Yea...

200
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:39,878
- What're you doing?
- Downstairs... bathroom... no problem.

201
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,235
Oh... no toilet paper.

202
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,231
Hello everyone... I'm Todd Anderson
from Western Novelty...

203
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,750
and I'm here to help integrate
you into our business.

204
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,939
Now, I gotta tell you,
this centre numbers

205
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,998
are nowhere near what they should be.

206
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,316
And based on the stompers complaints,

207
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,511
we've been having,
it's a cultural thing.

208
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,575
Basically, you people
need to learn about

209
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:41,510
Americans, it's all about
bringing down the MPI.

210
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,455
Things go faster if the
customer feel they're

211
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,269
talking to a native English speaker.

212
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,539
But we are native English speakers.
English

213
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,678
is the official language
of our government.

214
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,679
You got it from the
British, and so did we.

215
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,557
We just speak it differently.

216
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,434
We say 'internet',
and you say 'innernet'.

217
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,156
Fair enough, that's exactly my point,
I'm asking you to say 'innernet'.

218
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,220
Next time you're on a
call, try to listen

219
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,159
carefully to the customer's
pronunciation...

220
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,211
the slang, small talk,
try to learn from them.

221
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,046
Learn about America.

222
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,395
- Sir?
- Yes? You are?

223
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,353
- Marmite.
- Manmeet.

224
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,951
No, Manite, what I want to know is,
what is 'small talk'.

225
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,834
Oh, you know, that's like,
'How you doing today'.

226
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,110
How's the weather in Arizona?

227
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,515
- You can talk about sports.
- Like cricket?

228
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,473
Never mind, forget sports,
you wanna sound American.

229
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,593
If anyone ask where you're located,
just say 'Chicago', hm.

230
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,757
- Try that.
- Chicago.

231
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,678
OK, when you make the 'a' sound,

232
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,654
Hold your nose, to flatten
the vowel like 'Chicago'.

233
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,954
'Chicago'.

234
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,117
That's great, and if anyone ask
how the weather is, say 'windy'.

235
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,516
- Yes, you are?
- Asha, sir.

236
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,269
Isn't that a little dishonest?
I mean I'm not gonna lie.

237
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,949
I'm not in Chicago, I'm in Gharapuri.

238
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,857
If I have to do this
job, I was told that I

239
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,634
would be selling products
to a customer...

240
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:15,997
on the telephone, I did not know we
had to be deceptive.

241
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,936
A lot of Americans are
upset about outsourcing.

242
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:21,752
But sir, most of the products
they're buying are made in China.

243
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,199
OK, we're almost back, we'll continue
this tomorrow, thank you.

244
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,512
It says 'made in China'.

245
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,558
Ouch... don't touch me, don't touch me!

246
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,590
Go away... I'm serious.

247
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,238
Good morning, Mr. Doad.

248
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,272
You had a long night, huh?

249
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,951
What?
You look like you have no energy.

250
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,436
- You must go to sleep.
- No, I will.

251
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,872
First you eat.
You're looking sick.

252
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,034
No, thank you, I can't.

253
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,508
Mr. Doad, you want to
meet a nice Indian girl?

254
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,077
No, no, thank you, I'm just...
I'm really not interested.

255
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,988
Are you... homosexual?

256
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,350
Excuse me?

257
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,678
- You like Indian boy, not Indian girl?
- No.

258
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:47,608
No!

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,833
Oh, god no, thank you,
I can't eat a thing.

260
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,511
You must eat, you showing up much
to skinny, enjoy it will be hot.

261
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,553
Maybe tomorrow, I just
need to get some air.

262
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,477
Tomorrow?

263
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,159
- When is this glass coming?
- It is coming presently, sir.

264
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,238
Is the volume always this low?

265
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,856
This is low?

266
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,352
Well yes, you're obviously not
riding on all the callers yet.

267
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,159
Why is the MPI so bad?
At 12 minutes per

268
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,838
incidents, we're losing
money on every call.

269
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,088
Bad?... When I started it was 15,
I brought it down to 12.

270
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,919
This place is a disaster,
if we don't get it down to

271
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,717
6, I'll be stuck in India
for the rest of my life.

272
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,046
We'll get the MPI down, no problem.

273
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,252
Don't say no problem,
when it is a problem.

274
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,805
If we don't get it down
to 6, you'll never get a

275
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:24,329
promotion and you'll never get
to marry what's her face.

276
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,579
Who's face sir?

277
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,797
Your girlfriend, Bagy
Swami, whatever her name is.

278
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,875
Everyone, please work
harder, faster. OK?

279
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,189
Ok, what else?
Yes, Manmeet.

280
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,359
I do not understand item H403.

281
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,669
H403, ah... yea, a lot of Americans
wear this to sporting events.

282
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,472
But why, sir?

283
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,718
It's hard to explain, they just do...

284
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,337
I do not understand
the purpose of A221.

285
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,834
A221.

286
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,925
That's a burger brand.
Americans eat a lot of beef...

287
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,460
and some people like to
burn their initials into

288
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,959
their food, with a red hot
iron before they eat it.

289
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,913
- Why?
- That's a cow brand.

290
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,555
You know, the thing you use, to burn
a symbol into a cow.

291
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,355
In America, that's how you keep track
of your cows, is branding.

292
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,677
- With a red hot iron?
- Yeah.

293
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,553
But, a... wouldn't the cow run away?

294
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh, no, we only do it
to baby cows, when

295
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,199
they're small enough, to...
hold them down.

296
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,672
- Yes, Asha?
- A suggestion, Mr. Todd?

297
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,509
- Go ahead.
- You need to learn about India.

298
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,075
Hey, its Todd... I'll
be out of the country

299
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,470
for a few days, so leave a message...

300
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,750
<I>You have no messages.</I>

301
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,753
<I>Are you still there?
You have no messages.</I>

302
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,277
I told you, it's my grandson's
first day at school...

303
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,598
I want to get him some supplies, but I'm
not sure what kids need these days.

304
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,871
- Perhaps some rubbers, ma'am.
- What did you say?

305
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,755
I mean... if you have a pencil,
you need some rubbers.

306
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,839
OK... who can tell me,
what was wrong with this call?

307
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,354
It's not a 'rubber'... it's an 'eraser'.

308
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,268
- No, sir, this is a rubber.
- No, it's an eraser.

309
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,789
'Rubber' means condom.

310
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,957
- You mean like a 'flat'?
- They call it an 'apartment'.

311
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,790
No, a condom... birth control.

312
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,150
Does it work?

313
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,349
- This is Dave.
- Hi Dave

314
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,410
I just saw your numbers, you do realize
you're not on vacation over there?

315
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:40,958
Yeah, I gotta come here for vacation.

316
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,610
Unless you're planning on taking up

317
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:44,139
residence, you better
get the ball rolling.

318
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,516
Yeah, that's why I'm calling
actually...

319
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:49,013
An MPI in the 6's is not realistic.

320
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,474
I didn't say in the 6's Todd,
I said get it down to 6.

321
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,230
6,59 is not 6, its 7, you
need to get it down to 6.0

322
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,112
You're kidding me? We had a deal.

323
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,878
Seattle agents calls,
getting offline on Sunday.

324
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,516
Expect a bump in calls on.

325
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,996
You know what a 6 is in the industry.
Anything below 7. That's the definition

326
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,875
Don't you read you contract? We said
get it down to 6, I'm holding it at 6.

327
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,389
Dave, you're a corporate slime ball.

328
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,796
Watch it Todd, you lose
your stock options,

329
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:17,071
and you'll be living
in a cardboard box.

330
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,509
- Dave...
- I gotta go

331
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,672
Julie?... Hey, it's me.

332
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,078
Yeah... how you doing?

333
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,509
Just wanted to check in and say hi.

334
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,158
Oh nothing... just wanted
to hear your voice.

335
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,271
I miss you.

336
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Oh, I know, I'm sorry, did I wake you?

337
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,959
Yeah, I know... I know.

338
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,155
Is somebody there?

339
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,955
Money...

340
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,150
Cheeseburger.

341
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,179
How much to take me to Bombay?
To Bhagat Singh Road, right now?

342
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,265
Oh no sir, Bombay is too
far, it will use too much

343
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:26,349
petrol, it will damage
my car, it's impossible.

344
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,711
- OK, 6000 rupees.
- Don't sweat it, I'm gonna expense it.

345
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,615
OK sir, 5000 rupees
and not a rupee less.

346
00:33:31,616 --> 00:33:33,389
Whatever.

347
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,514
OK, my deal is that, sir! I'll take you
to Bombay for 4000 rupees.

348
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,316
Hello sir... how may I help you?

349
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,137
I like two cheeseburgers,
a large fries...

350
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,833
Sorry, but we don't have
cheeseburgers here, sir.

351
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,428
What?... I thought this is McDonald's?

352
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,439
Sorry, sir... this is MacDonnell's.

353
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,588
Get the Maharaja veggie burger.
It's as close as you gonna get.

354
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,871
I came all the way from Gharapuri
for a cheeseburger.

355
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,537
You know they have a
real McDonald's in

356
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:22,074
Gharapuri, you still can't
get a cheeseburger.

357
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,552
You know what INDIA
stands for, don't you?

358
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,434
'I'll Never Do It Again'

359
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,077
Did you hear about the guy who
outsource his old job?

360
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,873
He writes code in San Francisco...
makes 70 grand a year...

361
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,037
so he hires a guy in Bangalore
to do his job for 12 grand.

362
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,211
His boss thinks he's telecommunicating.

363
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,023
He's got so much free
time, he's thinking

364
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:48,733
about getting another
job just like it.

365
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,068
We've got Indian doctors,
reading American X-rays.

366
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,113
Lawyers, writing briefs,
I'm in customer service.

367
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,754
- Me too.
- So, how long you're here for?

368
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,158
- I have to get my MPI under a flat 6.
- Not in India.

369
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,215
Not unless you hire the
accent neutral, that

370
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:11,150
work for me, all you can
hope for here is an 8.

371
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,379
I can't go home till I get a 6.

372
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,478
Well, you better find
yourself a wife then.

373
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:16,821
She'll call me 'Doad'.

374
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:20,682
- What?
- My name is Todd, everyone says' Doad

375
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,877
Listen here, Todd.
Just a word of advice.

376
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,709
I remember feeling, like you do.
I was resisting India.

377
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,071
Once I gave in, I did much better.

378
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,113
I don't understand?
What's so difficult about this order?

379
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,357
Pink over the blue, and I wanna stay
away from the horizontal stripes.

380
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,135
And may I ask you, are
you married, ma'am?

381
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,790
Married? No.

382
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,512
Oh really?

383
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,479
Look buddy, I assure
you, I'm in Chicago.

384
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,317
Yeah, right.

385
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,438
Oh god.

386
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,030
Puro, where have you been?
Things are going crazy here.

387
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,696
How can you be even... wandering off,

388
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:21,232
You're suppose to be
coaching these people.

389
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,516
Maduri is having a
nervous breakdown, and

390
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,672
Manmeet hits, on every
women who calls.

391
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,076
And... where is the glass
to this god damn office?

392
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,589
I'm sorry sir... very sorry.

393
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,109
The glass is coming presently.

394
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,038
What's all this?

395
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,152
For you sir, you don't look well.

396
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,857
This food helps with your
stomach, Aunt Ji made

397
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:45,434
it for you, okay for you
to eat, no problem.

398
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,396
- Well...
- What sir?

399
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,556
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

400
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,638
- Mr. Doad... stop!
- Puro?

401
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,457
I'm very sorry, I should
have told you this earlier,

402
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,153
you should not wear good
clothes on this day.

403
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,316
Watch out!

404
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,175
I'm very sorry, Mr. Doad,
you should not

405
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:42,269
have worn good clothes
on this day of holy.

406
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,913
Come on now.

407
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,913
- Holy what?
- Just Holy.

408
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,196
Celebration of color,
changing of season.

409
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,352
I didn't think you dressed already.

410
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,040
Don't worry, I have
this, I'll protect you.

411
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,600
Come with me, come... come.

412
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,475
Come, Mr. Doad, come.

413
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,395
Oh... no...
Mr. Doad... are you OK?

414
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,657
- Give me one of those.
- Ok... here.

415
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,119
- Oh... that's a good shot.
- I used to play baseball in college.

416
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,220
You like cricket, huh...
a very boring game, huh?

417
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,199
Give me another.

418
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,428
Happy Holy... come, Mr. Doad.

419
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,951
Happy Holy...

420
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,351
Any calls?

421
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,076
Need a pen?

422
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,874
Pick any one you want.
No, no, not all...

423
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,917
It's pretty good.

424
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,953
- Oh, my god, we must go, we're late.
- We can't go like this.

425
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,974
No problem, I'll take
care of it on the way.

426
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:19,868
Come, come, quickly.

427
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,153
- Sorry, somebody had to...
- No, thank you.

428
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,477
Sorry we're late... Holy.

429
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,558
- Sorry... thank you, Asha.
- Thank you sir.

430
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,030
Thank you very much. Thank you for
shopping with Western Novelty.

431
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,595
Before everyone takes off, I just...
I like to call a little meeting.

432
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,033
I wanna apology to all of you,
especially Asha. She was right.

433
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,116
I'd need to learn about India.

434
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,676
- Sir, there's no need to...
- No, wait. Let me finish please.

435
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,876
Our first mistake, is
trying to run this, like

436
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,952
an American office.
So I wanna ask you...

437
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,974
How can do we do things
differently, what would

438
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,868
make your work day a more
positive experience.

439
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,399
Yes, Sanjay?

440
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,832
Sir... may I bring in my family
pictures, for my desk?

441
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,111
Yes, bring pictures of them all,
I wanna see the whole family.

442
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,710
What else?
Krishna?

443
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,497
Sir, may I bring murti's for my desk?

444
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,153
Murti's? Absolutely,
whatever those are, I want...

445
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:58,436
anyone can bring whatever
they want to make this space

446
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,717
their own, as long as it doesn't
get in the way of work.

447
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,438
- Maduri?
- Sir...

448
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,753
Puro said that, we must wear only
western clothes to do western business.

449
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,677
Wear, whatever you want.

450
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,068
- What is your good name?
- I'm Rani, sir.

451
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,239
Sir, would it be possible, to get a
discount on Western Novelty products?

452
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,828
Is there something unparticular,
you were interested in?

453
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,998
Sir, number D100...
astrology placemats.

454
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,035
You want those cheesy things?

455
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,152
I'm sure... I could get
you a set for free.

456
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,949
- Ah... yes?
- What about the ceramic basket?

457
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,154
You guys want this stuff?
You like the Western you're selling?

458
00:44:42,155 --> 00:44:44,293
Yea... yea.

459
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:46,431
Alright... alright,
here is what we'll do.

460
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,517
I'll call the Company, and
I'll ask them to ship us a

461
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,473
collection of the most popular
items in the catalogue.

462
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,279
Whoever improves their
MPI the most, on a

463
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,958
given day, can get their
pick in merchandise.

464
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,471
Alright, great job everyone.
Thank you.

465
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,919
What is that?

466
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,318
Massala, rock salt, cumin, chili pepper,
makes it better.

467
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,038
- Nice?
- Oh wow!

468
00:45:30,548 --> 00:45:31,599
OK.

469
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,715
You know when I was young, Holy was the
favorite day of the year.

470
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,409
I used to await it eagerly.

471
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,697
For me, it was Halloween.
You know Halloween?

472
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:44,873
The costumes? My mom used to make
these great homemade costumes...

473
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,470
It's funny, I should
think about my parents.

474
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,197
You miss them? Of course.

475
00:45:52,198 --> 00:45:54,074
When I'm home, I don't
miss them at all.

476
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,670
- Do you see them?
- Not much, hardly ever.

477
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,633
- You don't live with your parents?
- No...

478
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,992
No, they live in Yakima...
Which is about 2 hours away.

479
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,111
But you see them every week?

480
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,435
No, a few times a year.

481
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,269
But why? They're so close.

482
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,072
I don't know.

483
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,476
Some things I don't understand
about American life.

484
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,353
You don't live with your parents...
Strange.

485
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,429
Another thing... you hate your boss,
and you don't like this country, hmm?

486
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,269
Why not choose something else... hmm?

487
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,960
I don't know how to explain it.

488
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,232
I my world, it just make sense
to work your ass off...

489
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,673
and go into credit card debt,
so you can have that 50 inch plasma...

490
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,435
You like the HDSI or the Digiblack?
Which one?

491
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,715
They're both good.

492
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,793
Todd sir, that's my family.

493
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,911
That's impressive.

494
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,598
Asha... could you come here please?

495
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,760
Ok, here's the deal...
you're the best we have,

496
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,359
and I've seen you giving
advice to the others.

497
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,234
After I leave, Puro going
to need an assistant-manager.

498
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:37,071
Now. We have to get the MPI to 6,0.
Can you help us?

499
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,953
Of course.

500
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,915
You think... she can do it?

501
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,634
I think Asha can do anything.

502
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,859
Congratulation on your
promotion, you only have to

503
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,958
step in on calls, when someone
is really in trouble.

504
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,514
Puro, you wanna, get her started?

505
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,675
- You know about this?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,777
Western Novelty, Gharapuri.

507
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:21,314
What the hell is wrong with you, Todd?
You trying to bankrupt us?

508
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,875
What are you talking about?
You've seen the MPI?

509
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,309
I'm talking about this request to
ship hundred of our products to India.

510
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,238
The agents can see the products online,
They don't need to fondle them.

511
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,919
Actually they do, it's
an incentive. They

512
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,477
need to understand
what they're selling.

513
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,050
So promise them this time.
Alright.

514
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,160
The freight got held up by
a shipping delay at customs.

515
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:39,355
- You've got to think bottom line.
- I am...

516
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,319
that's why I wanna introduce
our products to a

517
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,157
potentially new market of
over a billion people.

518
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,909
- Are you there?
- I'll overnight it to you.

519
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,798
It's working.

520
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,579
Your intended program is
a very good idea, sir.

521
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,797
I'm learning so much from you.

522
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,593
I can't believe you're so excited
about these tacky stuff.

523
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,030
Tacky? What is tacky?

524
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,436
Oh... uh... tacky is like...

525
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,596
Oh... never mind.

526
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,739
Hey...

527
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,115
I've noticed that everyone signed up for
the incentive program except you.

528
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,792
Don't you want anything?

529
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,912
What would I do with this?
I'm a vegetarian.

530
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,989
I'm voting for carrots.

531
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,760
You American have more
choices than anyone

532
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:49,399
in the world, why would
you choose this?

533
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,592
Actually... I got mine in red.

534
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,233
Uphold the town..

535
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:03,887
Hello.

536
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,839
You...
Sorry.

537
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,600
With all the gin joints,
in all the towns,

538
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,239
in all the world, she
had to walk into mine.

539
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,436
You know how to whistle don't you?
Just put your lips together, and blow.

540
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,233
Shut up, just shut up.
You had me in the (?).

541
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,592
My mama always said.
Life is like a box of chocolates.

542
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,395
I have one word for you.
Plastics.

543
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,318
Are you talking to me?

544
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,116
No, see now, it's not 'are you talking
to me?' Its 'you talkin' to me?'.

545
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,118
This are called reductions.
American use them all the time.

546
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,908
'Got to go' becomes
'gotta go', 'would you'

547
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:48,575
becomes 'woud'y', they jam
those words together.

548
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:51,558
OK, try it again.
Maybe with more voracity, this time.

549
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,915
Your talking to me?

550
00:51:56,715 --> 00:51:58,915
You talkin' to me?

551
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,715
Wow... that's very nice.
I believe it.

552
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,277
OK, who else is ready to go?

553
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,579
- Now we have something for you.
- What?

554
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,678
You will do a dance from an India movie
You will be Salman Khan.

555
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,429
- No. Wait
- Come on, dance... dance.

556
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,796
- Oh... no, no, no...
- Its very simple...

557
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,271
I can't do that.

558
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,511
Come on, Toad... dance.
Don't let me down.

559
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,596
You ironed my underwear?

560
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,474
Of course... doesn't your mother?

561
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,859
Yeah. I'm not sure, what
she's referring to, but

562
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,998
that part doesn't actually
require batteries.

563
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,671
Mr. Todd, Mr. Puro, we have a problem.

564
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,349
The shipment from Western Novelty
has gone to the wrong city.

565
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,879
What?... Where did it go?

566
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,999
They didn't write down
the pin number, so...

567
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:44,241
now they send the entire shipment
to the other Gharapuri.

568
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,358
Oh great.
There's another Gharapuri?

569
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,438
3 hours drive... maybe 6?
Depending on traffic.

570
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,393
And they will have to take a
ferry from there.

571
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,636
It's an island?

572
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,614
And there happens to be a 114 MG
Road in the other Gharapuri?

573
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,965
Every town in India has an MG Road.

574
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,762
Its stands for Mahatma Gandhi.
He was the father of our nation.

575
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:06,208
Right... okay, can
you take care of this?

576
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,419
No problem.

577
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,818
But first I must sleep
for 2 hours, so I can

578
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:12,195
come back for the interviews
of the new agents.

579
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,102
Then I must make sure, my
mother gets to the hospital.

580
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,884
Never mind... I'll go.

581
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:17,905
If we lose the incentive,
everything falls apart.

582
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,180
But someone should go with you.

583
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,447
If we leave now,
we can get back before night.

584
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,500
You want to go with him?

585
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,479
Well, I'm the future
assistant-manager.

586
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,591
Right?

587
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,358
I'm pretty sure there is a
painting of her in my room.

588
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,316
I feels like she following me around.

589
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,115
That's Kali, the goddess of destruction.

590
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,990
Why would you want the goddess
of destruction in your car?

591
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,400
Well, sometime destruction
is a good thing.

592
00:54:54,942 --> 00:54:57,221
She ends one cycle, so
a new one can begin.

593
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,034
- Why don't you ask her for something?
- Alright.

594
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,917
Destroy something for
me, so I'll understand.

595
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,111
We have to a... get a ferry,
and he'll wait here for us.

596
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,795
Oh my god, look... her hat.

597
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,959
That's our product... Western item D334.

598
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,119
Wow, I never actually seen one on of
our customer in the flesh before.

599
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,869
- What's with all the tourist?
- Oh, some famous cave.

600
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,798
It doesn't feel like India any more.

601
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,034
I could do it, you know.

602
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,276
Do what?

603
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,392
Your accent... if I
had to, I could do it.

604
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,312
'I'll take one of them
cheese head hats. '

605
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,033
Yeah Madam, no problem...
we do have them cheese heads.

606
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:34,737
What size do you want to purchase?

607
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,637
You're not one of them
outsourcer, are you?

608
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:38,514
What's your name?

609
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,235
My name is Larry.
May I kindly have your credit number?

610
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,272
If you're American?
What's our national bird.

611
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,437
Oh yeah. It's a big vulture
with a big white head.

612
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,676
Let me speak to your supervisor?

613
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,110
Certainly sir... hello, I'm the
supervisor, how may I be helping you?

614
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,465
You sound just like the other guy.

615
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,505
No sir. Some of us do sounds alike.
There

616
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,268
are over 1 billion of us, you know.

617
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,358
That's... terrible.

618
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,859
Nice... I guess we can
let him keep his table.

619
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,954
How we gonna get it back to the ferry?

620
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,239
- What's that?
- It's a temple.

621
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,113
- A temple for what?
- Shiva Lingam.

622
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,880
What's a Lingam?

623
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,719
Well... you know...

624
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,513
the male... part.

625
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,230
Hey, Todd, Todd, if you're going in,
take off your shoes.

626
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,397
Is this... the male part?

627
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,512
It's a symbol of creation.

628
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,838
- And the... female part?
- Yea, they go together.

629
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,639
You see, Shiva was a very
powerful god, and he grew

630
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,437
tired of the cycle of life,
death and reincarnation.

631
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,846
So, he decided to give up the pleasures
of life, and he smeared his body in ash.

632
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:22,837
- Ash?
- Yes

633
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:26,630
And he didn't eat, or drink, or indulge,
in any physical pleasure.

634
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,639
And this created a
terrible fire within him.

635
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,671
Well... sure.

636
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,718
And that transformed
him, in to a blazing

637
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,636
lingam, which threaten
to destroy all creation.

638
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,197
The other gods didn't know what to do,
so a Yoni appeared, as a goddess.

639
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,517
And she absorbed the terrible heat.

640
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,436
Restoring balance to the world, and
saving the universe from destruction.

641
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,338
Wow.

642
00:59:58,243 --> 00:59:59,188
Close call.

643
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,759
- Do you want a mango?
- Sure.

644
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,353
Have you ever eaten a mango before?

645
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,550
First time, it's great.

646
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,791
Eat it like this.

647
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,511
Hello, sir.

648
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,353
You needing nice room?

649
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,914
Need a room, no... we're
taking the ferry.

650
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,273
The ferry's not happening, I'll get
you last room, very good price.

651
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,029
- The ferry is not happening?
- Yeah... ferry is blowing up.

652
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,438
You staying here, I get you
really nice room, sir.

653
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,030
That's right.
'Ferry's blowing up. '

654
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,695
Sir, I gave you last
hotel room on island.

655
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,630
For very special price.

656
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,397
Go on, sir.

657
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,179
Welcome, sir... welcome.

658
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:34,548
Good afternoon. I guess we'll take...
two standard rooms.

659
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,070
No sir, no standard rooms.
I'm very sorry sir.

660
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,094
Two deluxe rooms.

661
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:41,988
Unfortunately sir, deluxe
rooms are already taken.

662
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,680
We have only one room available, sir.

663
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,738
The luxury suite?

664
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,996
No sir, the luxury
suite is not available.

665
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,193
But we only have one room available,
and the foreigners are very happy, sir.

666
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,671
OK, that's good.

667
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,518
Yea, that's great.

668
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,632
- Yea... thank you sir, that's fine.
- Give him money.

669
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,476
Ah... sir, that's enough.
That's good.

670
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,994
OK, thank you, thanks' for everything.

671
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,348
Well, this is... incredibly awkward.

672
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,948
Why you're surprised?

673
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,458
Oh, this is my fault?

674
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:57,555
Of course, it's your fault,
You asked Kali to destroy something.

675
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,404
It's not a joke. She blew up the
ferry and now we're stuck here.

676
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,808
You told me too, you said
sometimes destruction can be good.

677
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:04,091
How can this be a good thing?

678
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:05,993
How can I tell my
parents, that I spent the

679
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,568
night with you at the
Kama sutra Hotel.

680
01:03:07,603 --> 01:03:09,470
Well, I'm not gonna tell them.

681
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,306
Your standing downstairs at
reception desk, and that

682
01:03:12,307 --> 01:03:15,011
sleazy guy's saying this
room's not available...

683
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,158
and that room's not available,
and you just say... Oh.

684
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,838
Why didn't you say anything?

685
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,972
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't know how this country works.

686
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,761
You know, I can't even talk to you with
that stupid mango all over your face.

687
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:26,089
I don't have mango all over my face.

688
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:29,012
- It's all over your face.
- Is it?

689
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,512
Yeah.

690
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,437
I can't see anything.

691
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,231
Help me out, I can't...

692
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,232
'The deer and the hare. '

693
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,952
'It's the coupling of the swans. '

694
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,797
Oh my god...
'The monkey pulls the turnip. '

695
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,153
- No, that's... that is impossible.
- Come on, let's try it.

696
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:36,764
- No!
- Yeah, let's try it!

697
01:04:36,765 --> 01:04:38,903
- You said I should learn about India.
- No!

698
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,277
Todd, no one must know about this.

699
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,212
It must be our secret.

700
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:53,101
We stayed in different rooms, in
different hotels, and nothing happened.

701
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:55,956
Of course, I understand.

702
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,955
Here, listen to this.

703
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,957
Press that.

704
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,112
So now when I call you, you'll have
your own official Bollywood ringtone.

705
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,998
It's part of your continuing
education in India.

706
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:29,010
Thanks'

707
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,229
Well, have a good afternoon, Miss Asha.

708
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,954
I'll see you at work, Mr. Doad.

709
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,034
Hey... Kid!

710
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,195
That's for you to draw... paint.

711
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,995
- Hello...
- Hey!

712
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,031
You see that?
Unbelievable.

713
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,435
Mr. Todd, please go to line 15,
we have a problem.

714
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,935
- Hi.
- Hi.

715
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,656
- Is this an empty line?
- Yes.

716
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,116
- Hello.
- Very nice to chat with you.

717
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,595
You said there was a problem?

718
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,774
Yes sir... the problem is I have
to sit 3 feet away from you...

719
01:06:46,948 --> 01:06:48,427
and I can't come any closer.

720
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,888
Yes, that is a problem...

721
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:53,998
perhaps we can solve that after work?

722
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,711
I'm afraid, that might not be possible.

723
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,628
But, perhaps if we leave separately and
go to the market, we could meet there.

724
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:02,207
Well ma'am...

725
01:07:02,371 --> 01:07:04,397
I have to say, your perfume
is driving me crazy,

726
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:06,422
is there any way we can
expedite this order?

727
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,832
May I correct you, sir...
It is not perfume, it is cardamom...

728
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,551
We live next to a spice merchant,
and he grinds cardamom all day...

729
01:07:13,566 --> 01:07:15,048
it gets in to all our clothes.

730
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,912
I... like it.

731
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,915
I... 'm glad you like it, sir.

732
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,994
You're lucky he doesn't sell garlic.

733
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,068
Yes I am, sir.

734
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,937
My neighbor is buying
cabbages over there.

735
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:03,593
Come with me.

736
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,791
I think we're Ok now.

737
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,593
Don't touch me, not in public.

738
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,003
- But... I can help you down the stairs.
- Thanks'.

739
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,397
The MPI is almost down to 6...
I have to leave soon.

740
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,988
I know... Puro told me.

741
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,870
What'd you think about...

742
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,798
living in the US?

743
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,125
I would miss my parents,
it would be too hard.

744
01:08:43,308 --> 01:08:44,631
Have you ever thought,
about living here?

745
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,408
Here?... a, yea...

746
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,558
I would, but I think, I'd miss my
hot dog toaster too much.

747
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,496
- We're close.
- You think so?... How close?

748
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,078
- Oh... I can't really get into it.
- That's not a good thing.

749
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,273
- Lets go, get some tea.
- No, I can't, not here, please.

750
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,188
- People might talk.
- So what if they talk?

751
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,379
I should be more careful,
like I shouldn't

752
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,438
be seen with you, speaking like this.

753
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,677
- Like how?
- Intensely.

754
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,850
Ah... why not...?

755
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,308
You're a free woman, why shouldn't
you speak intensely if you want...

756
01:09:21,309 --> 01:09:23,679
Why do you always worry,
about what people think?

757
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,989
Because...

758
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,429
I'm engaged to be married.

759
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,520
- Engaged?
- Yes.

760
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,150
How long have you been engaged?

761
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,115
Since I was four years old, our families
have known each other for generations.

762
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,836
His name Ashok, he has a
very good job, and very polite.

763
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,997
We will be married in July.

764
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,590
Do you love him?

765
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,995
Not yet.

766
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,035
I can't believe this.

767
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,955
I just can't believe that... someone as
strong, and smart and as opinionated...

768
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,072
as you, would settle for
an arranged marriage.

769
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,578
I will learn to love him.

770
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:24,955
What about your right
to choose for yourself?

771
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,709
My parents met each other on their
wedding day, and they loved each other.

772
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,637
To me that's crazy.

773
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,675
Some people would say, Americans
50 percent divorce rate is crazy.

774
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,598
Will you tell... Ashok about us?

775
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,235
No... of course not, no one must know.

776
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,755
What'd you call this,
what you and I are doing?

777
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,799
- Holiday in Goa.
- What?

778
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,559
It's something my friends and I say.

779
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,018
A friend of mine, she
fell in love with a

780
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:00,356
boy, one month before
she had to get married.

781
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,630
He was a boy from her school.

782
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,877
So, she told her parents,
she was under a lot of stress...

783
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,117
and she had to go on a
holiday in Goa alone.

784
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:15,475
So, she and the boy went to the beach,
they had 3 weeks together...

785
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,909
and then she came back, and got married.

786
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,911
So, I'm just your holiday in... Goa?

787
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,637
No, not 'Just'...

788
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,833
My only holiday in Goa.

789
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,595
So, where can we go to be in Goa?

790
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,439
Shake my hand like a business
person, and go inside.

791
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,398
It's a pleasure talking
with you, Miss a...

792
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,235
Badwadikar.

793
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,928
Hey...

794
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:29,928
- Sir?
- Hi.

795
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,428
I thought, sorry, I... I
don't, I don't have any...

796
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,992
- You want me to come over?
- Aha... ha.

797
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,039
- Hello.
- It's Dave.

798
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,799
- Did you see our numbers?
- No, I was traveling.

799
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,556
- You mean you didn't see any of them?
- No, I need a ride.

800
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:16,080
A ride?

801
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:18,597
I'm at the train station, I
just got here from Bombay,

802
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:21,078
on the damn night train, get
over here and pick me up.

803
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,435
Wait one minute.

804
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,017
Dave... what you're doing here?

805
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:46,453
It's a surprise.

806
01:16:46,896 --> 01:16:49,159
Hello sir... hello... hi.

807
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,311
You want cola? Wait, wait...
I will make.

808
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,356
- Looks like a storage unit.
- You get what you pay for.

809
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,790
- What's with the music?
- It's probably a wedding, Dave...

810
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,907
Why you're here?

811
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:16,423
What kind of manager would
I be, if I didn't drop

812
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:17,937
in on our field operations,
every now and then.

813
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,686
- You don't trust me?
- Of course I trust you.

814
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:21,598
I just wanted to see
it with my own eyes.

815
01:17:22,313 --> 01:17:24,334
Collin's gave us a bunch of numbers,
which look good.

816
01:17:24,929 --> 01:17:27,071
But, somebody said it's too good
for 3 weeks work.

817
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,475
- You think I'm rigging the MPI?
- Relax.

818
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,177
When I walk in and see 2
dozen people generating

819
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:34,754
the MPI in the 6's,
I'll be a happy man.

820
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,235
After you.

821
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,359
Puro, what the hell is this?

822
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,709
It's the water coming
from the farmer next

823
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,937
- door, because of the irrigation.
- Irrigation?

824
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,854
That is, when the water
is flooded on the crops.

825
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:54,748
I know what that means.

826
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,639
The water is coming from
everywhere, and nowhere

827
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,398
to go, a big problem,
please tell me what to do.

828
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,910
Clear down to ten working stations.

829
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,151
Now it did... oh my god.

830
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:13,559
- I want you to shred your passport.
- Relax, Dave... it's no problem.

831
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,638
No problem...? How can
you say no problem?

832
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,957
- Does no problem look like that?
- It's no problem.

833
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,992
- We're going up on the roof.
- The roof?

834
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,601
People... we're going up to the roof.

835
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:27,990
We're gonna rewire this whole place
in the next 20 minutes.

836
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,350
It's a nice night, its dry up there.

837
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,240
We'll bring up the workstations,
run a new main power cable...

838
01:18:33,357 --> 01:18:35,123
We're going back online, upstairs.

839
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,752
- That's impossible.
- Maybe back in the States it is.

840
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,678
Anil, get the car.

841
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,420
I'll be right back with the consultant.

842
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:45,488
Consultant?

843
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,790
Puro, this is my neighbor,
he'll help with the rewiring.

844
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,797
He'll show you.

845
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,038
Consultant?

846
01:19:17,498 --> 01:19:18,417
Yeah.

847
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,753
See... no problem.

848
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,434
Yes, I am sincere, I do not
care what you look like.

849
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,676
You have such a lovely
voice and personality.

850
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,998
Manmeet, marriage proposal
is not small talk.

851
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,509
- I think she's the one.
- Not tonight.

852
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,393
But Todd, I'm in love.

853
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,375
As long as she buys
something every 5 minutes,

854
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:12,229
and you clock it as a
separate incident.

855
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,193
- You can say whatever you want.
- Thanks, Todd.

856
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,758
Elizabeth, wonderful news, we can
speak all night... I mean all day.

857
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,349
Yes sir, no sir... maybe sir.

858
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,711
Quick, quick, quick...
It's a supervisor demand.

859
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,718
Give it me, thanks'.

860
01:20:37,306 --> 01:20:38,623
Hello?

861
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:39,941
You got to be kidding me...

862
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,445
I'm buying a freaking
American eagle from a

863
01:20:41,446 --> 01:20:42,822
company that's suppose
to be in America...

864
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:44,023
and I get it in India?

865
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:46,797
- I understand that you're upset, sir.
- No, you don't.

866
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,451
You don't understand,
last month I lost my job

867
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:50,101
at the plant, where I
worked for 22 years...

868
01:20:50,228 --> 01:20:51,767
because the whole operation
moved to Mexico.

869
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,950
My brother had to leave
town because there're no jobs.

870
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,307
I know how you feel, sir.

871
01:20:55,607 --> 01:20:57,388
No, you don't, you have a job.

872
01:20:57,423 --> 01:20:59,796
Sir, please don't hang up,
I have a solution for you.

873
01:20:59,816 --> 01:21:01,088
What?

874
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,763
Please, understand that many Americans
are upset about outsourcing...

875
01:21:03,798 --> 01:21:07,559
so we have located American made
versions of all our products.

876
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,657
If you have a pen, I will give you the
website of an American company...

877
01:21:11,051 --> 01:21:13,281
that makes an eagle statue
very similar to ours...

878
01:21:13,516 --> 01:21:15,009
same size, same material...

879
01:21:15,026 --> 01:21:17,652
Only theirs is made 100
percent in America.

880
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,548
Well, thanks, I appreciate it...
But, ah... is the price about the same?

881
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,911
No, sir, there's is $212.00 more.

882
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:30,830
Sir...

883
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,405
Yea, alright... ah,
just sell me yours.

884
01:21:33,406 --> 01:21:35,970
Thank you sir, may I have
your credit card number?

885
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,923
Alright, ma'am, let me check that
with my supervisor.

886
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:47,798
Ok, the shipping fee for overnight, is
no extra charge. Anything else I can do?

887
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,354
Thank you, for shopping
at Western Novelty.

888
01:21:49,355 --> 01:21:50,875
My name Guarav.

889
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,910
That's it for today, well done everyone.
Thank you.

890
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,558
Oh, by the way, you broke 6.
Congratulations.

891
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,593
You guys are amazing.
I wanna see you all at the Lotus.

892
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,877
Dave?

893
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,029
Dave... you doing OK?

894
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:21,977
I feel like I swallowed
a live squirrel

895
01:22:22,044 --> 01:22:23,578
Don't worry, it only last's for a week.

896
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,135
Some of us are going to
the Lotus to celebrate.

897
01:22:26,136 --> 01:22:27,870
Why don't you come with us?

898
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,997
What's the Lotus?

899
01:22:29,637 --> 01:22:32,487
It's like an afterhours club for call
center workers, who get off at 6am.

900
01:22:32,522 --> 01:22:33,932
It would really be fun.
You wouldn't like it.

901
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,274
- I need to talk to you.
- We can talk tomorrow.

902
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,119
Yea, yea, but there's another
reason, I came here.

903
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,996
I need to wipe out all
the proprietary data, of

904
01:22:42,997 --> 01:22:45,231
these hard drives, before
we pull out of India.

905
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,795
What are you talking about?

906
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:51,897
Don't tell me we'll ship out, and moving
Fulfillment back to Seattle?

907
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:54,071
No... China.

908
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,401
We're running an existing
call center there already.

909
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:58,219
They go online tomorrow.

910
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:03,879
China is the new India.
20 heads for the price of one.

911
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,992
What're you gonna do?

912
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,029
- Big speech.
- Speech.

913
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,549
I do have something to say.

914
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,114
Unfortunately, it's bad news.

915
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,755
I just found out...

916
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,031
I don't know there's an
easy way to do this.

917
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:59,358
Western Novelty has decided to
move Order Fulfillment to China.

918
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,317
All of your jobs have
been outsourced.

919
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,632
Don't go to work tomorrow.
It's over.

920
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,389
Mr. Dave is wiping out the
hard drives, right now.

921
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,035
You get a month severance pay.
That's it.

922
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,028
Guys... announcement.

923
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,355
I am...

924
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,270
I'm engaged to Elizabeth Watson
in Orange, New Jersey.

925
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,475
I'm sorry, I didn't know, I swear.

926
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,989
Why are they happy about this?

927
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,749
They will be, it doesn't matter.

928
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,997
We trained them to a point, were they
can get a job anywhere.

929
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:01,749
Microsoft, Dell, Office Tiger.

930
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,474
They'll get a job in a week.

931
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,751
And with severance pay,
they can have some... fun.

932
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,440
So you can get another job too?

933
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,755
Management is different.

934
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,269
I'm not young any more.

935
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,198
If I'm lucky, I'll get a job.

936
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,914
But that might take a long time.

937
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,477
If Bhagyashree's parents will hear this,
she will marry someone else.

938
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,114
- What's her hurry?
- Astrology.

939
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,437
Her moon are lined up.
Auspices time.

940
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,109
She must marry this year.
And now I don't have a job.

941
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,879
I'm so sorry.

942
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,117
- I must leave India.
- What? Why?

943
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:45,677
I will die if I see Bhagyashree walking
on the street, with a new husband.

944
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,595
If it's any consolation,
I'm probably fired too.

945
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,994
I'm sorry.

946
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,588
You're a good boss.

947
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,109
Asha, sorry.

948
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:07,997
Oh, I'm not concerned about the job,
I'm more concerned about my novel.

949
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,775
Your what?

950
01:26:09,776 --> 01:26:11,430
I'm writing a book in
between calls at work.

951
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:15,189
And I saved a copy on my hard drive,
I don't want Dave to erase it.

952
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,993
So, can we go back and save it?

953
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,716
- Yes, I guess we should.
- I think we should go, immediately!

954
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,997
What's this book of yours called?

955
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,395
'Holiday in Goa. '

956
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,616
That was great, I almost
believed you myself.

957
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:42,152
Stop!

958
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,953
- No time for small talk.
- Where can we go?

959
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,418
Guarav gave us the key to his place...

960
01:26:47,419 --> 01:26:49,756
It's OK, he's a friend.
We can trust him.

961
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,919
We can be alone together.
We have two hours.

962
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,869
OK, I have to ask you something.

963
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,150
What is that?

964
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,590
It's a bindi, it's a third eye.

965
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:24,474
It's the eye, with which you see,
the most important things.

966
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,031
Sometime two eyes aren't enough,
when you need help.

967
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,960
You and me already have
been in my third eye.

968
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,310
Us? How?

969
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,080
Well, my father is an
assistant-manager with a foreign

970
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:43,719
company, and my mother comes
from a small village.

971
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,674
A girl in my position, has her whole
life mapped out in front of her.

972
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,870
Everything I've done,
I had to fight for.

973
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,657
'Asha, you can't go to
the university, Asha you

974
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:55,313
can't work in a call center,
what will people say?'

975
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,874
and then what you said...

976
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,436
It was the first time, that I ever
heard anything like that.

977
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,313
What did I say?

978
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,238
'Asha can do anything'.

979
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,955
I always wanted to believe that.
Until you, I didn't think it was true.

980
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,234
I hope Ashok sees that.

981
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,477
Well he better, because if he doesn't
then I'll leave him,

982
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,876
and I'll come to the US and
take away your job.

983
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,391
God, I'm gonna miss you.

984
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:46,349
- You'll meet someone.
- She won't smell like cardamom.

985
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,317
Rub some on her and pretend she's me.

986
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,637
She won't have your eyes either.

987
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,594
I wish I could meet someone
exactly like you.

988
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,870
Well... almost exactly.

989
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,111
Almost?

990
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:14,598
Someone as beautifully as you,
as smart as you.

991
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,075
It's funny.

992
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,236
What?

993
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,876
But is not afraid to try,
'Monkey pulls the turnip'.

994
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,839
Asha can do anything.

995
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,675
- Hi, Doad, how are you?
- Good.

996
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,351
My friend Sudah.
My guest, Doad.

997
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,878
Yes, yes.

998
01:30:11,441 --> 01:30:13,640
Data is uploaded, these
hardware is not worth

999
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,839
shipping to China, so I'm
just gonna leave it here.

1000
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,985
If there's anything you
want other than that

1001
01:30:17,986 --> 01:30:20,130
plasma, I got that
covered, you can take it.

1002
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,498
Just do it, Dave, if that's my option,

1003
01:30:22,499 --> 01:30:24,836
just let me go, you
don't need me anymore.

1004
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,235
We don't need you here.

1005
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,669
We need you in Shanghai.

1006
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,315
- You're insane.
- Someone gotta train the new guy.

1007
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,579
We've been acquired
by the largest direct

1008
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,718
marketing firm within
the United States.

1009
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,035
Western is just gonna be
a small part of this.

1010
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,756
The new company is gonna
outsource 4000 call center jobs.

1011
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,845
They need a VP to manage it all.

1012
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,827
I showed them your numbers,
and they want you.

1013
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,974
It's no joke, it's a great job.

1014
01:30:53,188 --> 01:30:55,734
You get to keep all the benefits
you have now, plus a fat raise.

1015
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,954
I'm not going to China.

1016
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,594
And you get to keep
the stock option, as

1017
01:31:02,595 --> 01:31:05,108
oppose to losing them,
and being unemployed.

1018
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:08,994
No thanks'.

1019
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,749
Someone's head hunting you? Alright
we'll beat their offer, whatever it is.

1020
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:26,309
Did I mention the stock option
will double in value, maybe triple.

1021
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,755
You don't have to live in China,
no, all you have to do is

1022
01:31:28,756 --> 01:31:31,070
get the call center up to
speed and just visit every...

1023
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:33,991
couple of months, you get
first class travel, and a co.

1024
01:31:33,992 --> 01:31:36,911
Apartment is yours in a high-rise
overlooking the harbor

1025
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,998
What do you want, Todd,
just tell me what you want.

1026
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:45,513
You can't quit, then you've work
your ass here, for nothing.

1027
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:50,111
You can't quit Todd.
Who I'm gonna send to Shanghai now?

1028
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,108
Better Hurry, its boarding.

1029
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,434
Mrs. Puro...

1030
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,714
Congratulations, to both of you.
Enjoy the view of the harbor.

1031
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,595
- Todd, you saved my life.
- You saved mine.

1032
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,337
Don't worry about running
the call centre.

1033
01:32:21,338 --> 01:32:23,953
You'll be great, 'Break a leg'.

1034
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,935
Break my leg?

1035
01:32:25,936 --> 01:32:27,789
Just an expression,
it means good luck.

1036
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,391
Thank you, Todd.
I hope that both your legs get broken.

1037
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,789
I'll never forget you said that.

1038
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,110
Mom? Hey, its Todd.

1039
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,276
Yeah, I'm back.

1040
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,916
It was... I'll tell you about
it, when I come by to visit...

1041
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,216
Hello...
