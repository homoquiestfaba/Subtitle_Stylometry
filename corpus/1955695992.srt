00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:55,218
- Is this good?
- No.

3
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,787
- Sorry. Lower?
- Yeah, yes.

4
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:00,390
- Good, good.
- Okay.

5
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:02,458
This is awesome.

6
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:07,363
- You can come if you want to.
- Okay, I'm about to.

7
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:08,532
- Good.
- Are you gonna come?

8
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,170
Eh...

9
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:14,338
- Did you hear that?
- Huh?

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,740
Like a woodland creature
pitter patter?

11
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,642
Okay, the plan is to have
sex in the woods.

12
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:21,311
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Are you okay?

13
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,213
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

14
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,847
Because I kind of feel like
maybe you're not into it.

15
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,517
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God.

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,520
- I fell. I'm sorry. A bug.
- What is it?

17
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,255
- Sorry.
- Okay.

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,856
A spider.

19
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:36,392
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:37,860
No, it's okay. It's cool.

21
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,695
I'm not a woodland person.

22
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,698
Okay.

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,534
Do you want me
to help you finish or...

24
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,234
No, I... my parents.

25
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,770
- Okay.
- Let's get in the car.

26
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,472
Lights, trash, door.

27
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:50,874
Traffic's gonna be
a nightmare.

28
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,545
Bye, house,
see you next summer.

29
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,645
What did you put
in these bags?

30
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:56,847
I have no idea.

31
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,382
It's like dead bodies.

32
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,517
Here and here.
Up front, please.

33
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,451
Pat, can I help
with anything?

34
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:05,454
Ali, Ali, Ali, no.
No, no, no!

35
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:07,223
- No.
- I rode bitch here.

36
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,524
- Okay
- Okay?

37
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,792
No, and you can
ride it back.

38
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,828
- I don't want to.
- Well...

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,466
Guys, I can sit
in the middle.

40
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,399

- Oh, Dana.
- Do it.

00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,583
- It's "bring."
- What?

47
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,917
"Bring."

48
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,252
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

49
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,655
"Break me a higher love"
like...

50
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,489
Like you... like you
have to break me

51
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,893
if you want me to love
like on such a high plain.

52
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,428
Alan, is it bring or break?

53
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,262
Ben's right, sweetie.
"Bring."

55
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,465
Ali, I revised
the Michigan app.

56
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,602
So do you want to talk through
the comments with me or...

57
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,270
Not really because
I don't want to go there.

58
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,572
Honey, you need to cast
a wide net.

59
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,841
Yeah, I'm sorry my future
is so stressful for you,

60
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,310
but I'm not applying there.

61
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,245
I didn't say
it was stressful.

62
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,679
Guys, you really need
to get a grip, okay?

63
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:04,982
Because Ali doesn't want
to go anywhere

64
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,583
unless everybody wears berets

65
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:07,984
and all they all smoke
clove cigarettes

66
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,453
and they all make
their own hummus

67
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,821
but they eat it
out of Frisbees.

68
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,788
I can see
your boyfriend's come stain.

69
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,490
- Ali!
- Shut up!

70
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,491
God.

71
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,827
It's her fiancée.

72
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,928
You can see
her fiancée's come stain.

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,495
God, it smells like

74
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:20,864
a K.D. Lang concert
down there.

75
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,798
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Fuck you.

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,568
- Shut up!
- Take a chill pill, please?

77
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,336
Fuck you!

78
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,839
It's not new for me
to be able to say swears.

79
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,941
- Slow down, sweetie.
- Hey, guys, relax.

80
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,525
<i>Have yourself a dental dam.</i>

81
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,360
<i>But, of course, I'm going
to be using this later</i>

82
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:54,064
<i>so I don't want
to ruin this later.</i>

83
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:57,000
Suck my dick.

84
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,537
Kim Deal's my hero.
Whatever.

85
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,508
School starts
in eight hours.

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,477
Okay, give me seven seconds.

87
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,811
It's after midnight.

88
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,380
I'm getting off.

89
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,082
Good night, Jed.

90
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,917
No, I think she has
a crush on you.

91
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,719
Ali.

92
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,790
Okay, good night.

93
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,627
Jed speaks.
What was he saying?

94
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,762
I don't know.
Butt stuff.

95
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:29,602
Oh, I love you, good night.

96
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,005
Love you.

97
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,885
Thank you.

98
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:50,887
This is for you.

99
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,923
Great belt.

100
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,858
Oh, I think
I'm getting a rash.

101
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,728
You got to stop
touching that.

102
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,896
So, is this guy you're seeing,
is this the...

103
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,697
What do you call it?

104
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,132
Smash slam poetry?

105
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:05,368
Ew, no, no.
No, I broke up with him.

106
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,572
No, this guy
is a performance artist.

107
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,440
- Oh.
- Major upgrade.

108
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,974
We ended up drinking
on his roof

109
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,709
and having one of those
epic conversations

110
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,012
until the sun comes up,
you know the kind?

111
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:21,050
Ben and I spent
three hours at Blockbuster.

112
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:25,087
And, uh, we got "Curly Sue."

113
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,957
Sexual.

114
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,625
It's a good film.

115
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,762

Do you have
any perfume?

126
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,471
My mom's like
a drug-sniffing dog.

127
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,507
Perfume. I don't think
dudes wear...

128
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,942
Like, some of that
man spray.

129
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:21,610
- This stuff.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

130
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,980
- Here we go.
- Okay. Spray me.

131
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,748
Oh, okay. Right.

132
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:28,819
Whoa, that's a lot.

133
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,656
I didn't want a lot.

134
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,024
Hi.

135
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,060
Hey, there.

136
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,098
- Oh.
- Floor, please.

137
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,202
What is that?
You got schmutz all over here.

138
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,070
What is that?

139
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,539
Did you parallel park yet?

140
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,841
I'm very good at it,

141
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,642
so it should be
a cinch for you.

142
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,110
Smells good.

143
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:57,680
Don't get too excited.
It's leftovers.

144
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,151
You know, when kids
in my class wore shoes like this

145
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:02,719
it meant they had polio.

146
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,086
Yes, they do look
a little corrective.

147
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:05,921
What did you do today?

148
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,190
- Crack.
- You know what I did?

149
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:11,260
I wrote beautiful copy
for fake Oreos.

150
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,831
Anyone for a Yum Yum?

151
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,533
Aw, yeah.

152
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,168
Honey, that stuff
will give you cancer.

153
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,702
Guess what?

154
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,072
George offered to host a reading

155
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,707
of my play at his house.

156
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,974
That's great, honey.

157
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,610
Plenty of booze, no food,

158
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,043
a bunch of self-righteous
Upper West Siders.

159
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,779
Hey, has anyone spoken
to Dana this week?

160
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,082
There is a sale at Kleinfeld's.

161
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,084
Did they pick a date?

162
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,284
Because I bet
it's my birthday.

163
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,086
No, not yet.

164
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,687
I was hoping the dress
would sort of get her excited.

165
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,524
So you'll come
to the reading then?

166
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,957
I don't know,
are you inviting me?

167
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,260
I want the whole family.

168
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,262
You, Ali, me, Ben, and...

169
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,096
you know, what's her face,
the one with the D.

170
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,533
- Yes, Dana.
- Douchebag.

171
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,700
Her name is not douchebag.

172
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:53,937
That's too German.
Douchebag.

173
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,137
Dana Douchebag.

174
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,276
Okay, switch.

175
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:03,146
Okay, I need to wash.

176
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:05,315
Okay, hold on.
Wait a second.

177
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,882
- What?
- What is that?

178
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,218
- What?
- Right there, that rash.

179
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,719
Oh my God. Come on!

180
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:13,022
Sorry, sorry.
It's on your arm too.

181
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,625
Oh, I've been itching
all week.

182
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,562
I think you might
have poison ivy.

183
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,031
What?

184
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,197
- Excuse me.
- What?

185
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,868
How did I get poison ivy?

186
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,236
- That was a joint decision.
- You gave me poison ivy.

187
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,038
It's probably
in my vagina.

188
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,106
You want me to look?

189
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,875
No! Geez.

190
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,209
Oh, I should probably
pee on you.

191
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,315
That move is for jellyfish.
I'm not stupid.

192
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,050
No, it's for poison ivy too.

193
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,185
I think it is.

194
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,589
You want to pee on me?

195
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,956
Here we go, here we go.

196
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,959
- No! We just have...
- Shh!

197
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,893
- Are you doing it?
- Just quiet down.

198
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,829
- All right, do it, do it.
- I can't pee on command.

199
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,363
Do it before I change my mind.
Do it, do it.

200
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,900
- Listen, okay, there it is.
- Oh my God.

201
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,201
- You want me to stop.
- No.

202
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,070
- No?
- I like it.

203
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:04,940
He was touring
with the Grateful Dead

204
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,743
for, like, many months.

205
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,310
So I don't even know
what this place is or...

206
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:09,979
He wasn't touring.
He was following them.

207
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,915
He probably has lice.

208
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,882
Making grilled cheese
sandwiches in the parking lot.

209
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,021
- Hey, Ravi!
- Oh my God.

210
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,321
Oh my God. Look at you.

211
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,723
Look at me?
Look at you.

212
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,124
You're back. Aw.

213
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,893
Embrace me, brother.
Embrace me.

214
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:25,895
You get a head hug too.

215
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,229
Hi, I'm Ben.

216
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,034
What's your... what's your name?

217
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:34,036
This is... this is Table.

218
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,105
Table?

219
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:39,809
Off the bat,
she's taken a vow of silence.

220
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,011
- Oh, okay. That makes sense.
- Wow.

221
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,177
Just in time for the party.

222
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,379
Dude, we got to catch up.

223
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,748
Yeah, yeah, let's catch up.

224
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,915
- You good?
- Yeah.

225
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,217
- Okay.
- She's so good.

226
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,818
- Hurry.
- Okay.

227
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,185
- Let's go, let's go.
- Benjamin.

228
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,088
- Look at this.
- Benjamin.

229
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,025
Guys, make room
for Table as well.

230
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:09,204
Did you see
what Ravi's new look is?

231
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,342
I think he sews it himself.

232
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,209
Can you imagine the Ravi
we knew in college...

233
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,811
Yeah. It's different.

234
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,180
Looking into the future
and seeing this?

235
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,815
I know.
Well, I guess it's...

236
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:23,686
the influence of, you know,
Mrs. Table, yeah.

237
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,122
He's soon to be, Mr. Table.

238
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,124
- Yeah. Hey, good for him.
- It's really sweet.

239
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,727
I'm still looking
for my Table.

240
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,462
I really am though.

241
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,430
This girl
I was just with

242
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,232
showed up to a date
wearing a ski mask.

243
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,133
Serious.

244
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,402
She said she wanted
to know my personality

245
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,906
before I knew her face.

246
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,842
Was she...
a normal person?

247
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,209
She was kind of
a mean drunk.

248
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,118
I'm really happy to see that
you never kicked your snort.

249
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,453
I don't want
to talk about it.

250
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,421
This one made it
on a foot loom.

251
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,491
It was slamming.

252
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,792
She made all of them.

253
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:07,132
Dowels, we made
like a thousand dowels.

254
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,800
What is that?

255
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:15,104
It's an engagement ring.

256
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:18,074
You finally did it.

257
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,081
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,845
Come with me.

259
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,445
I'm going to go
with Sophie.

260
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,783
That's so whack.

261
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,386
It will help me study.

262
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,824
That's not coke.

263
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,459
I know, it's H.

264
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,831
Holy shit.

265
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,900
Are we really just going
to do this right now?

266
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,068
I did it with Danny
last week.

267
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,906
It's really not scary.

268
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,473
It's like climbing
back into the womb.

269
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,209
You won't even have
to do that much.

270
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,486
Call my mom
if I die.

271
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,268
What?

272
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:56,561
What the fuck?

273
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,973
Holy fuck, Dad.

274
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,689
<i>In celebration
of the contributions</i>

275
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,324
<i>women make in every aspect...</i>

276
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,059
Ah, gotcha.

277
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,027
Doesn't that hurt?

278
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,031
This from the guy who's
gonna row over his own balls.

279
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,066
<i>As mothers, wives, sisters,
daughters...</i>

280
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,469
Wow, I love that suit.

281
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,436
Traffic is gonna
be a nightmare.

282
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,205
We better leave soon.

283
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,174
I thought we were
going to talk to Ali?

284
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,776
Can we talk tonight?

285
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,344
She's not going clubbing
in the middle of the day.

286
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,246
She went out again
last night.

287
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,647
I saw her pile of clothes
when I took out the trash.

288
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,416
Detective Pat.

289
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,352
God forbid she'd dislike you
for five seconds.

290
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:59,454
This is not me leaving you
to be bad cop, all right?

291
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,757
Bad cop.
I'm barely a crossing guard.

292
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,227
All right, I really
will talk to her tonight.

293
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,494
I promise.

294
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:07,162
What do you think?

295
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,664
Two weeks no phone?

296
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,233
And that includes Jed.

297
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,068
You know the boy's name.

298
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,339
- Uh-huh.
- Hmm.

299
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,073
No.

300
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,108
What are you, a mime?

301
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,709
Yes, I studied in France.

302
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,478
Actually, I'm a crossing guard,

303
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,049
and you can't pass
without paying the toll.

304
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:35,724
<i>We may help bring
new dignity and respect...</i>

305
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:38,694
That is a nice suit.

306
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,331
You up?

307
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,839
Bullshit.

308
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,292
<i>McCann Erickson?</i>

309
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,526
Mr. Jacobs, please?

310
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,361
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

311
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,831
Tell him it's C.

312
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,498
<i>Please hold.</i>

313
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,336
Yeah, I'll hold.

314
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,311
We all know
what we're breathing.

315
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,379
Whether or not he knows
that it's the same air

316
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,180
that jackass Giuliani
is breathing.

317
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,784
He's pouring all his money

318
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:35,852
into the police department.

319
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,586
Meanwhile, the rest of us

320
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,389
need to fight for
a different kind of enforcement.

321
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:41,891
Pat?

322
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,727
Solid Waste Disposal reforms
is pushing to 3 p.m.

323
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,362
- Okay.
- Grannis is on line two.

324
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,697
And Congressman Hinchey
just called

325
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,132
about the cement plants again.

326
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,432
Okay.

327
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,602
Also, Iris
from Dalton called.

328
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,738
Alexandra hasn't
signed in yet.

329
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,173
Uh, Alexandra
has the flu.

330
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:01,544
Again? Try ginseng.

331
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,746
I don't know that is.
I'll take Grannis now.

332
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,653
Thanks. Bye.

333
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,842
<i>You have four messages.</i>

334
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,709
<i>Dana, it's Laura.</i>

335
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,645
<i>You haven't gotten back to me
about book club.</i>

336
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:37,846
<i>You said you were
bringing the mahjong tiles.</i>

337
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,248
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

338
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,316
<i>I'm going to be home late.</i>

339
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,785
<i>I'm having some drinks
with some work peeps tonight.</i>

340
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,187
<i>Can you grab
some toilet paper?</i>

341
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:47,556
<i>Hi, this message
is for Dana Jacobs.</i>

342
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,624
<i>This is Samuel
from the Water Club.</i>

343
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:51,193
<i>If you're still interested
in having your wedding here,</i>

344
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,327
<i>please call me back at...</i>

345
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,263
<i>Hi, Dana, it's Mom.</i>

346
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,797
<i>There is a sale at Kleinfeld's
this weekend.</i>

347
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,903
Ugh!

348
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,747
Hi, this is Dana calling.

349
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,481
I just wanted to relay
a message to Kim and David

350
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:14,917
that I'm not going to be able

351
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,485
to make the staffing meeting
today.

352
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:20,389
I've eaten something wrong.

353
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,824
At lunch, and I just feel like
I need to be near

354
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,395
my own restroom.

355
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:28,200
Dana Jacobs.

356
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,803
I do our layout.

357
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,537
Yeah.

358
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,074
Oh, no.

359
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:49,778
Whatever.

360
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,946
It's okay.

361
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:51,980
Your secret's safe with me.

362
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,382
I won't tell anyone

363
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,017
you dance to world music.

364
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,751
I'm not ashamed.

365
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:59,921
I think it's good
to like music from our world.

366
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:05,628
Sorry, you had
a little hairball.

367
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,899
Where's, um...

368
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,600
Uh?

369
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,602
- Ben?
- Ben, where's Ben?

370
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:15,673
He's at work.

371
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,609
What? Can nobody hang out
alone anymore?

372
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:21,977
I feel deeply alone
at all times.

373
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,345
I say accept it.

374
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:24,447
This is my first day alone

375
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,914
since, I don't know, 1982,

376
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,784
and I am really digging in.

377
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,952
First, I'm doing this,
and then I'm gonna skip dinner.

378
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,354
I'm going to go
to Serendipity,

379
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:33,555
get a frozen hot chocolate,

380
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,091
eat it all by myself
and then...

381
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,561
Want to get a bite to eat?

382
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,528
With you?

383
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,977
Oh. You just had that
on hand?

384
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,712
It's cool.

385
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,114
The cops raided this place
last night.

386
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,882
So we're safe tonight.

387
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,718
Oh, you know what,
I have a job to get to.

388
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,689
I'm kidding.
Jesus, sit down and smoke this.

389
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,894
It's on fire.

390
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,866
So, do you have
any more tales

391
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:19,168
from the dating front?

392
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,669
Uh, last week a girl

393
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:21,937
asked if she could strangle me.

394
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,173
Well done.

395
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,609
Don't look over here. Oh!

396
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,744
I think you got
the musician.

397
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:30,578
I would say
we'd get kicked out,

398
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,980
but nobody here cares
about anything.

399
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:36,751
Yeah, you know...

400
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:40,088
All I really want
is a nice Jewish Italian girl

401
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,924
who just wants
to sit on the couch with me.

402
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:45,661
Watch "Mad About You."

403
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,064
Yeah, well, Helen Hunt
has really perfected

404
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,100
the frontal wedgie.

405
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,536
So, tune in for that.

406
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,471
I wonder where
Helen's vagina is.

407
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:57,840
Just kidding.

408
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:01,209
We can all see it
in prime time.

409
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,946
Yeah.

410
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,613
How about you and Ben?

411
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:09,584
You guys watch a lot
of Must-See TV together?

412
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,153
Yeah.

413
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,890
Sounds really nice.

414
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,793
Oh, save it.
You don't have to say that.

415
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:19,765
I'm being serious.

416
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,164
Yeah, it's nice.
It's very good.

417
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,866
It's good. We... you know.

418
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,634
It's very totally good.

419
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,671
We just brush our teeth,
and we take our clothes off,

420
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,104
and we get into bed,

421
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:33,042
and, if he reaches
for the candle,

422
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,111
I know that we're going
to have sex to the 11:00 movie.

423
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,613
That's really rude.

424
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,113
That's not even what I mean.

425
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:42,183
That's a real asshole remark
to make, Dana.

426
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,756
They really got
the heater on in here, right?

427
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,926
Oh my goodness.

428
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:54,497
How you feeling?

429
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,099
Mmm, mmm.

430
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,500
Mellowing out a little?

431
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,806
You know, I think that
the last we got stoned together

432
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:08,113
was... in your dorm room.

433
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,014
I remember that, I think.

434
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,082
Yeah?

435
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,116
Yeah.

436
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:18,953
We had a four-hour
conversation about dinosaurs.

437
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,593
And I then I think
some clothes came off.

438
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,543
So fun.
I should go home.

439
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,911
- Yeah, okay.
- Whoa.

440
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,077
You okay?

441
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,713
Yeah.

442
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:46,715
I should get a cab.

443
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:47,886
Okay, go ahead.

444
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:00,499
Shit.

445
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,947
Uh, oh my God.

446
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,585
<i>You came from Second City,
didn't you?</i>

447
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,955
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>Were you in the main company?</i>

448
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,859
- <i>Main stage.</i>
- Hey.

449
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:30,959
I have to pee so bad.

450
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,261
I'm reading
Hammacher Schlemmer.

451
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:36,632
They're advertising
the world's fastest razor blade.

452
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,869
There's an inversion machine
and a lot of luggage.

453
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:42,837
- Babe?
- Hmm?

454
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,373
Are you okay?

455
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,308
I'm going to the bathroom.

456
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,145
No fucking way.
KGB surveillance binoculars?

457
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:53,584
What the fuck?

458
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:57,251
Kitten Toe!

459
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:58,988
You can buy as many
as you want.

460
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,357
You can hook 'em up
to form a kitten village.

461
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,294
You can build
your own kitten village.

462
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,962
Babe, there's some his and hers
trench coats in here.

463
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:10,164
It says that they're packable.

464
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,866
I don't know what's different
about that

465
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:13,001
than regular trench coats,

466
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,336
but whatever.

467
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:18,172
She we go stone
or pale putty?

468
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,008
Pale putty.

469
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,911
This is fucking awesome.

470
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,214
Oh, my God.

471
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,676
Incoming.

472
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,220
Looks like Chernobyl in here.

473
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,289
Mm-hmm.

474
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,927
Mmm.

475
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,330
So you want to tell me why
I'm getting calls from school

476
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:17,132
asking where you are?

477
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,735
Or should I tell you
what I think I know?

478
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,370
- Cool choices.
- Hey.

479
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,271
You tell us you did well
on the Vonnegut essay.

480
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,306
Meanwhile, I see you got an 83.

481
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:26,874
- You went through my stuff?
- Didn't go through your stuff.

482
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,276
It was on your desk.

483
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:30,011
Well, what's an 83,
like, like a B?

484
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:31,447
Yeah!

485
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,716
God, it's a good grade.
You freak.

486
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,117
Your mom is trying to say
that you're smarter than a B.

487
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,120
But dumb enough
to leave enough clubbing clothes

488
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:39,388
in the stairwell.

489
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,055
Not entirely your fault.

490
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:43,292
We did take you
to Studio 54 in utero.

491
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:48,430
You want to tell her
about the Quaaludes?

492
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:50,199
Okay. You got me.

493
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,366
I got a B,
and I have a life.

494
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:54,737
You're real fucking detectives.

495
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,337
Don't you fucking
detective me.

496
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,940
- You wanna know what I think?
- No.

497
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,440
I think we should
just let her get a B.

498
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:02,878
Let her sneak out.
Hopefully, she'll get mugged.

499
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,846
Most people learn
from failure.

500
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:08,049
Wow. Well, you would know.

501
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:09,687
You're the king.

502
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,888
No wonder he hates you.

503
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,026
- What?
- Excuse me?

504
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,027
You're reckless.

505
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:22,029
And grounded.

506
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:24,165
Both of you
are so fucked!

507
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,034
Stop cursing!

508
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,870
Just stop it for once, Ali.

509
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,141
Just get out!

510
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,048
Should of just done it myself.

511
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,854
I was alone in there
anyway.

512
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:49,324
Hey.

513
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:52,795
There's a 6:44.

514
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,162
Just meet me there now.

515
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:31,165
Great, she's going out
to get mugged.

516
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:36,071
No one's getting mugged.

517
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:39,106
She's too scary.

518
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,496
You have to be
really quiet, okay.

519
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:10,140
Oh, fuck.

520
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:13,877
Uh!

521
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,557
Did you bring condoms
this time?

522
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,126
Yeah, should I get 'em now?

523
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,865
Yeah.

524
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,943
Should I put it on now?

525
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:10,431
Is the CD skipping?

526
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,167
I don't think so.

527
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,036
Dude, it's totally skipping.

528
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,407
Oh, are you fucking
kidding me?

529
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,180
That's embarrassing.

530
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,486
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

531
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,899
<i>Mind you have work to do.</i>

532
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,334
You hear that?

533
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:48,538
It's probably a bear.

534
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,308
Probably a bear?

535
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,143
You're such a city kid.

536
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:58,346
There's a bear outside?

537
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:01,315
They can't open doors,
can they?

538
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,084
How do you know that?

539
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:08,422
All right.

540
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,394
- Ah!
- Ah! Ah!

541
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:16,064
Dana! Dana!

542
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,334
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

543
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,269
I asked you first.

544
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,038
I'm Jed.

545
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,507
Okay.

546
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:27,508
Can you not tell Mom
I'm here, please?

547
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,478
No, obviously I'm going
to tell Mom that you were here.

548
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,413
God, you're like
a tattle-tail. You bitch!

549
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,248
Actually, I'm an adult

550
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,351
who was coming for a quiet
weekend in the country

551
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,386
and found her home invaded,

552
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:40,654
and, yeah, I'm gonna tell mom
that you were here

553
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:41,722
in your underwear.

554
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:44,258
With...

555
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,094
- Jed.
- Jed.

556
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,399
And both of you
need to leave right now.

557
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,567
No! What... you leave.
We were here first.

558
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:56,071
You are such an irritant!

559
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:57,506
You're a little piece
of toilet paper

560
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,373
that gets stuck
to somebody's shoe.

561
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,744
You're like the embodiment
of constipation, okay.

562
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,113
Okay.

563
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:06,715
All right, great.

564
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,616
You can stay. Fine.

565
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,384
But he needs to leave.

566
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,487
And you can take him
to the train station

567
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:14,456
because you have
your learner's permit.

568
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,191
No, I can't because I need
a parent to be in the car.

569
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:21,496
Oh, please stop
Frenching in front of me.

570
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:24,231
Stop Frenching
in front of me.

571
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,438
Why don't you
just come back with me?

572
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
I think my sister might be
having a nervous breakdown.

573
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:37,746
I need to make sure
she doesn't tell my mom.

574
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:46,121
Is your drug store underwear
that deep up your ass?

575
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,356
What?

576
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,561
See you later.

577
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,083
Is he your boyfriend?

578
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:16,586
Not really.

579
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,255
Do you guys have sex?

580
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,490
Yeah.

581
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:25,226
Oh.

582
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,331
So, Mom has no idea
where you are?

583
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,601
Does Ben know
where you are?

584
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:35,302
Well, that's different

585
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:38,539
because Ben is not
my mom.

586
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,376
I'm here because
I needed to get away,

587
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,311
and you're a child.

588
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:47,349
You know, and you ran away
from home, and that's...

589
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,251
I did not run away
from home.

590
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,554
I went to our family's
country house.

591
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,559
How much more vanilla
can that scenario get?

592
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:04,566
Look at us
having sister time.

593
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,438
Are you going to, like,
try and braid my hair later?

594
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,505
Do you want
to go swimming?

595
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,354
This is the best sports drink
I've ever had.

596
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,456
That's because
it's Whiskey Mountain Dew.

597
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,925
It's because it's what?

598
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,659
It's Whiskey Mountain Dew.

599
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,729
Whoo! Hoo!

600
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:40,202
Did I do that?

601
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,769
Three Mississippi, four.

602
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:44,371
You think you could ever
be a synchronized swimmer?

603
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:45,609
Do everything
that I do.

604
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:53,748
I could definitely do this.

605
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,450
Can you do that?

606
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,519
Can you not, please?

607
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,987
Big splash. Stop!

608
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,626
Ow! Stop! Stop!

609
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:09,264
Ow, God!
What's your problem?

610
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,499
Why do you play so rough?

611
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,334
God, calm down.

612
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:15,369
Seriously, why do you have
to go so hard at everything?

613
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,804
You ruin everything.

614
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:19,407
Fuck you, cunt.

615
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,909
Sorry.

616
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:23,778
Ali!

617
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:27,849
Ali.

618
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:30,784
Ali!

619
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:32,354
Stop!

620
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,824
Stop!
I don't like horse play.

621
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,358
I don't like pranks.
I don't like this.

622
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,795
I don't like it.

623
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,469
Dad's having an affair.

624
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,409
Oh, my God.

625
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,677
Yeah, wait till
you get to April.

626
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,746
He had a haiku phase.

627
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,546
Why does he sometimes
refer to himself

628
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,416
as "her Pillsbury Dough Boy"?

629
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,619
Oh, it's because
he calls his dick "dough."

630
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:07,655
- Oh, Jesus. God.
- Yeah.

631
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,557
Just broke my brain.

632
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,459
Fucking... I hate him.
Okay, I hate him.

633
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,396
- You don't hate him.
- I do though.

634
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,731
- You don't.
- Why should I not?

635
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,733
I don't think that...

636
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:20,302
we should say anything to Mom

637
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,336
until we know what this is.

638
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:24,472
If I were Mom,
I would chop off that dough

639
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,508
Loretta Bobbitt style.

640
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,909
It's not... it's Lorena.

641
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:31,345
I got a strong feeling that
he's in love with someone else.

642
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,847
She cut off an entire penis.
You should say her name right.

643
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,684
I can tell that
he's in love with someone else.

644
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,584
I think she threw it
out a window as well.

645
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,554
And he doesn't even
have to be fucking her.

646
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:42,423
What's going on is that he's
emotionally cheating on Mom.

647
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,925
You watch way too much Oprah.

648
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,927
"Emotionally cheating."

649
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,429
And maybe it's just
a fantasy,

650
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:49,831
which...

651
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,434
to be honest
is totally healthy.

652
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,436
It's just, you know,
a totally healthy thing

653
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,440
to have... to have fantasies.

654
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,661
♪ Do, do-do-do ♪

655
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,829
- Look what I found.
- Oh, my God.

656
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:23,898
In mother's wardrobe.

657
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,599
Looks so good!

658
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:28,001
Wow!

659
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,311
I have something to say.

660
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:40,548
I have something
that I feel that...

661
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,485
if I don't share it...

662
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,387
it will stay inside of me

663
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,856
and start to eat me alive.

664
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,090
Please, say it.

665
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:01,469
I slept with somebody,
and it is not Ben.

666
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:02,704
- Ow.
- What?

667
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,838
- I know, I know.
- Whoa.

668
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,876
- I really... liked it.
- Oh.

669
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:12,579
My body, like,
really responds.

670
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,449
Ugh.

671
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,753
We're just like
a family of cheaters.

672
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,421
I just have to get it out.

673
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,055
I just have to say
"I'm Dana,

674
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:24,626
"and I'm a cheater,

675
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,026
and I'm a Mountain Dew drinker."

676
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,729
Yeah, and you're
a come guzzler.

677
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,697
Sold.

678
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,166
Okay.

679
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,836
Thanks for telling me.

680
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,541
I just think maybe
this is a sign

681
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,876
that there's somebody else
that I'm supposed to be,

682
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:44,512
that it's trying
to get out of me.

683
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:47,514
Okay, yeah. Okay.

684
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:49,483
What's her name?

685
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:57,191
Ba... delia.

686
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,892
Badelia?

687
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,628
And I'll tell you what.

688
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,697
Badelia's very fun to be.

689
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,898
A lot of people
don't get to be Badelia.

690
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,668
Badelia is
a little bit wicked.

691
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,103
- Uh-huh.
- She's wild.

692
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,737
She makes her own choices.

693
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,907
And Badelia has secrets,

694
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:17,144
and secrets can be rather fun.

695
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,112
You know what else?

696
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,081
- Double triple lunge!
- Oh!

697
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,818
Mikhail Baryshnikov.

698
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,188
I like dancing.

699
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,490
I don't think I've ever

700
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,923
danced with you before.

701
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:30,992
It's really nice to hear you

702
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:32,092
say yes instead of no.

703
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:33,528
No!

704
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:39,633
Anyone home?

705
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:41,838
Mom?

706
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:47,909
- Mom?
- Mom?

707
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:51,112
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

708
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,280
I love you.

709
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:56,985
I love you.

710
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,255
And I love you too.
What's going on here?

711
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,557
I love you.
I just wanted you to know.

712
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,559
And I love everything you do.

713
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:06,994
Busting dust.

714
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:08,229
Where's Dad?

715
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,666
He's at his writing workshop.

716
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:13,635
I called Sophie's mom.

717
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,037
Do you want to tell me
where you really were?

718
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,972
Oh, she was at my place.

719
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,807
Ali!

720
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,776
Sorry I scared you.

721
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,679
What is that? Laundry?

722
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:28,883
Oh, I was actually
hoping to crash here

723
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,851
for a few days,
if that's possible.

724
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:32,186
If you have room.

725
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,987
Is everything okay?

726
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,158
Yeah.

727
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,693
What about you?

728
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:39,961
How long do you
plan on staying?

729
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:41,628
Uh, until I'm 40.

730
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,634
All right, that works for me.

731
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:52,974
Thanks for bringing
this stuff.

732
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:56,144
I'm just so surprised.

733
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,246
Are you okay?

734
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,648
Yeah, I'm fine.

735
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,950
It's just crazy.

736
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:05,653
Your dad doesn't seem like
the type to have a mistress.

737
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,289
He seems like...
don't take this the wrong way...

738
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,191
but, like, too pussy to cheat.

739
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:14,162
What did you say?

740
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,998
What?

741
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,365
What?

742
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,833
- Say "pussy" again.
- Oh my God.

743
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,802
- Say it.
- Umm...

744
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:25,072
Aren't you supposed
to be at work right now?

745
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:26,641
I called in sick.

746
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:28,876
This is nice.

747
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,677
You can bite me
if you want.

748
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,878
- You want to bite me?
- Oh. No.

749
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,782
- Do you?
- Oh God.

750
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:37,818
Does anybody... oh my God.
Is anybody here?

751
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,253
Okay.

752
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:40,988
Tell me how good
my pussy feels.

753
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,789
- Tell me.
- Huh?

754
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,825
Tell me how good
my pussy feels.

755
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,195
Oh my God, I don't want to.

756
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,695
- Do it.
- It feels great.

757
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:49,863
- It feels great.
- Say it.

758
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,666
Why are you barking at me?

759
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:53,066
What do you want? Tell me how
it feels on your dick.

760
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,103
Tell me how my pussy
feels on your dick.

761
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,338
If I told you to tell me how
good my dick felt in your mouth,

762
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,740
you'd call 911.

763
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,208
Okay.
Let's call the police.

764
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,177
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

765
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,217
What's happening?

766
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,952
Well, we were fucking,

767
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:12,987
and then you ruined it.

768
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:16,791
Okay.

769
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,026
You can't even
say "pussy" to me?

770
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:21,128
I can say it.

771
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,963
I asked you to say it,
and you didn't say it.

772
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:24,932
- Just not all the time.
- No, it's not all the time.

773
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:26,733
I asked you to say it one time,

774
00:43:26,735 --> 00:43:28,836
and if mine is the only one
you're ever going to see

775
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,905
then you need to figure out how
to say the word "pussy" to me!

776
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,677
What's happening right now?

777
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,813
Ow. Ow!

778
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:42,619
- Ow. Ow!
- Sorry.

779
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,729
You know I would never
write erotic poetry

780
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:57,898
to another woman.

781
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,267
Because I can't read or write.

782
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:03,371
That's not funny.

783
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,972
Okay, sorry.

784
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,206
I'm just trying to tell you

785
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:07,974
that I would never
cheat on you.

786
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:09,976
If that's what
you're worried about,

787
00:44:09,978 --> 00:44:12,447
I'm here, and if you want to
talk or you don't want to talk

788
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,315
or you want to keep saying
"pussy" over and over

789
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,152
until it gets weird
we can do that too.

790
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,690
Can you hand me those jeans?

791
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:32,301
Um, when are you
coming home?

792
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:38,840
I just want to be here
for Ali right now, okay.

793
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,374
She needs me.

794
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:43,744
So, I'm going to stay here
for a few days.

795
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:46,113
And I'll call you tonight.

796
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,354
<i>He accepted
the German terms.</i>

797
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,190
Oh!

798
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:57,925
<i>But after
the unconditional surrender,</i>

799
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,494
<i>the Nazis bombed the city
anyway.</i>

800
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,896
You okay?

801
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:05,032
Yeah.

802
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:09,070
Ooh!

803
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,141
You can't deny that
there's a lot of energy

804
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:16,844
and confidence
behind that.

805
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:19,447
They knew how to sing too.

806
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,516
No, don't do that.
Don't do that.

807
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,050
- What's wrong?
- What?

808
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:26,019
- Why?
- Because we're not...

809
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,188
Somebody could see that.

810
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,023
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

811
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:30,791
You're worried about
the matinee crowd in here?

812
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:32,325
These guys?

813
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,327
What's... what's the matter?

814
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:36,530
I'm sorry.

815
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,365
I was supposed to see
that movie with Ben.

816
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:40,036
He likes Nazi stuff.

817
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:43,938
Well, you should go again,
you know.

818
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,273
You seemed a little...

819
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,874
distracted at certain moments.

820
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:50,010
You're so perverted.

821
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:51,144
I don't think you were
quite giving Adolf

822
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:52,345
your full attention.

823
00:45:52,347 --> 00:45:54,548
You're full of it.

824
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,552
All these old people in love

825
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,985
are making me feel
like a whore.

826
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:00,588
- Are you kidding?
- No.

827
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,856
Did you see what
those two old people were up to?

828
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:04,358
- No.
- It was really...

829
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,159
- It was really gross.
- No, you're gross.

830
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,563
You're having
a torrid affair.

831
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,898
You can't torture me.

832
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,204
Hey, I think I love you.

833
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,139
What? What?

834
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:20,407
Just kidding.

835
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:22,376
Don't do that.

836
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:25,213
That's psycho.

837
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,148
I don't know.
Maybe I do.

838
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,383
It's hard to tell,
you know.

839
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm probably dead inside.

840
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:31,952
You're so irresponsible.

841
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:33,588
That is such a psycho thing.

842
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,923
That's such a psycho thing
to say for so many reasons.

843
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,224
Am I very irresponsible?

844
00:46:49,304 --> 00:46:51,539
What time is it?

845
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:55,008
Oh, I don't know,
and I'm fine with that.

846
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,177
I'm doing this thing
where I say

847
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,478
I leave the watch at home.

848
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,246
I release myself
from my schedule.

849
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,648
- I go about my day.
- That could be C.

850
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,650
- That could be C.
- That?

851
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,284
Oh!

852
00:47:04,286 --> 00:47:05,653
That lady would break
Dad in half.

853
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,588
That is not love.

854
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,423
I do love her trench.
So many trenches.

855
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:11,892
Yeah, I kind of want one.

856
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,229
Should I?

858
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:18,499
You would look
just like a French film star.

859
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:21,369
- Are you serious?
- I am so sold on it.

860
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,237
Okay.

861
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,440
That's going to be you
in 20 years.

862
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:28,976
- Hey! Oh!
- No.

863
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:31,177
Such a diss.

864
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:32,679
Well, guess what, babe,

865
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,615
you're going to be married
to that.

866
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:37,184
A gentleman like that.

867
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,186
Oh shit.

868
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:41,488
- Passion...
- No, it's Dad.

869
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,557
- Oh my God! What's the plan?
- Hurry.

870
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,092
Ow.

871
00:47:46,094 --> 00:47:48,128
- Just get up.
- Ow, ow, ow.

872
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,266
Move your ass.

873
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:53,369
Hey.

874
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,371
- Get down. Get down.
- Huh?

875
00:47:57,373 --> 00:48:00,307
Oh, I don't want
to see this.

876
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,979
What's he doing?

877
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,581
- Hey.
- Hey, Alan.

878
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,050
I missed you.
Feel better?

879
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,119
- All right.
- You were sick, right?

880
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:15,722
Oh, don't have that
for lunch.

881
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:18,358
Sauerkraut, mustard.

882
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,626
He's getting
a fucking hot dog.

883
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,630
Cholesterol nightmare.

884
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,077
What the hell is
going on with her?

885
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,612
I have no fucking clue.

886
00:48:39,614 --> 00:48:41,648
I thought I was going
to be planning her wedding,

887
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,617
not feeding her
Lucky Charms.

888
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,019
Bye, sweetie.

889
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:47,253
Have a great day!

890
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:05,338
<i>You have one new message.</i>

891
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,208
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

892
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,175
<i>I'm sorry that we keep
missing each other.</i>

893
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:12,445
<i>I need to stay here
for a few more days.</i>

894
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,481
<i>Just call me back.</i>

895
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:17,050
Hey.

896
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,387
Hello.

897
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:28,429
What are you doing?

898
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,697
Just borrowing a shirt.

899
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:31,798
What are you doing?

900
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,267
It's my closet.

901
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:38,773
God, yeah...

902
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,275
Can't control my arm.

903
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:44,378
Teri! You're crazy!

904
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:58,059
Whoa! Oh!

905
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,161
Gotcha.

906
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,199
Oh my God.

907
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:06,700
What is that?

908
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:08,135
It's an eyebrow ring.

909
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:09,503
Yes, it is.

910
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:11,639
- Well?
- Lisa "Left-Eye" Lopez.

911
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,307
- Shut up.
- I love it.

912
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:14,708
- You do?
- Yeah.

913
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,278
It's, like, really hot.

914
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,648
It's like squatter-hot.

915
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,282
No, don't, don't, don't.

916
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:23,717
- What?
- Don't... don't touch it.

917
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,786
Because I don't want it
to get infected.

918
00:50:25,788 --> 00:50:28,822
Really?
It's un... untouchable?

919
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:31,092
Aw, fuck it, I don't care.

920
00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:34,862
- Let's have drinks.
- Let's do that.

921
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,463
Let's have so many.

922
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,733
You have to get up, Dana.

923
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,271
Dana!

924
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,472
Oh my God, you barfed.

925
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:48,309
- No, I didn't.
- This is how Hendrix died.

926
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,579
Okay?

927
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,313
You can't kick me.
I'm trying to help you.

928
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:55,382
- I can't!
- I have to go to school, Dana.

929
00:50:55,384 --> 00:50:58,184
- I don't.
- You have to go to work.

930
00:50:58,186 --> 00:51:01,354
- Let's go to the bathroom.
- No, don't do it.

931
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:04,291
- Shut up.
- Oh my God, I'm gonna kill you.

932
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:06,226
If you want
to use the bathroom,

933
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:07,760
then use the bathroom
by yourself.

934
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:09,630
I don't need
to use the bathroom.

935
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,499
I'm not here
to be your counselor!

936
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,235
I have to go to school.
Your butt crack's in my face.

937
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,735
Good, then enjoy it.

938
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:17,771
What?

939
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:21,175
Ben called again last night.

940
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:23,409
For the millionth time
in two weeks.

941
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,648
I don't think
he's going to keep calling.

942
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,516
Oh.

943
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,619
Dance, Badelia, dance!

944
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,621
Oh my God, Ali.

945
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,159
<i>I'm locked in here</i>

946
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,130
while the world continues
to buzz around me.

947
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:46,700
I've become nothing
but a plant to water.

948
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:48,672
A piece of furniture
to dust.

949
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,641
I'm vanishing.

950
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,545
Turning into skin particles
floating around the apartment.

951
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,546
Particles that bore me.

952
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:03,349
Two sons
and one miscarriage.

953
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:08,555
It's your line.

954
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:10,657
It's on page 74.

955
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,226
Sorry, everyone.

956
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:13,860
That was a shit show.

957
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:15,795
My God, did you hear
my stomach growling?

958
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:17,697
It was like another character
in that play.

959
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:20,300
You know... thank you...

960
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,202
it was just so...

961
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,204
Badly written?

962
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:27,541
I'm not really concerned
with the quality of Dad's work.

963
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:29,943
I'm glad it's
a pile of shit, okay.

964
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:32,479
If it were better, more people
might actually see it.

965
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,847
Mom would be
even more humiliated.

966
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:37,918
Do you think that she was?

967
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
He made us boys
and put the mother in a coma.

968
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:41,755
Good point.

969
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:45,793
Someone who can capture that
like Carla.

970
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,228
- Do you know Carla?
- Uh-uh.

971
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,494
Carla?

972
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,664
Ah, thanks for coming.

973
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,700
Holy shit.

974
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,774
I think that's C.

975
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,614
Oh my God.

976
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,880
What do we do?

977
00:53:07,882 --> 00:53:08,882
This old lady
just pinched my ass

978
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:10,416
and winked at me.

979
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,385
Are you old enough
to drink?

980
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:14,854
Mind your own business.

981
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:17,691
I will take that from you,
thank you very much.

982
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:19,827
I am leaving.

983
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,929
I have a splitting headache.

984
00:53:23,398 --> 00:53:25,532
And that's getting infected.

985
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:26,603
I know.

986
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:30,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

987
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:34,340
I will see you at home.

988
00:53:34,342 --> 00:53:36,610
Oh...

989
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:39,479
I can't believe
we're all just

990
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:41,981
in C's house right now.

991
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:44,284
Yeah, I'm going to take
a dump in her bed.

992
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:46,854
Who... who is C?

993
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:50,456
Who are you?

994
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,992
I'm going to go snoop
in her medicine cabinet.

995
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,528
Wow.

996
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,996
Not a fan.

997
00:53:56,998 --> 00:53:59,969
No, C is my dad's mistress.

998
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:06,373
Wow.

999
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,742
That's funny, I was thinking
she looks like your mom.

1000
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:10,610
Yeah, that's really funny.

1001
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:14,048
She's a terrible actress.

1002
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,717
This is the home that
she shares with her husband.

1003
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,720
Why would my dad
bring us here?

1004
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:22,856
Yeah, and also
you brought me here, you know.

1005
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:25,325
It's like a play
within a play.

1006
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:26,994
There's even someone
in a coma.

1007
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:29,796
Why would he do it
to my mom?

1008
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:32,398
And in front of
his teenage daughter.

1009
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,934
Yeah, it's twisted.
Let's get out of here.

1010
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:36,070
I don't want to...

1011
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,276
I'm not in the mood to...
whatever.

1012
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:42,342
Are you worried
about your sister?

1013
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:44,811
- Yeah.
- She's gonna be fine.

1014
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:48,481
Well, that's...
how do you know that?

1015
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,016
Because we're grown-ups.

1016
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:52,519
We all know monogamy
is impossible.

1017
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:55,389
So it's better she learns
that now from her own family

1018
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:57,124
than have it be some
like forbidden fruit

1019
00:54:57,126 --> 00:55:00,427
that tears her heart out
later in life.

1020
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:02,362
Is that what you believe?

1021
00:55:02,364 --> 00:55:04,700
Look at us, you know.

1022
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:10,005
Oh my God.

1023
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:22,648
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1024
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:28,155

00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:31,724

Jeffrey! All right.

1027
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,796
Okay, Max, hit me.

1028
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,032
Ah! Come on,
one more time.

1029
00:55:39,034 --> 00:55:40,934
One more time.
Come on, hit me!

1030
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:43,436
Ah! Come on.

1031
00:55:43,438 --> 00:55:44,737
You guys love it

1032
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:46,106
when the shrimp
misses my mouth.

1033
00:55:46,108 --> 00:55:48,778
We're too old
for this place.

1034
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:53,546
So...

1035
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:56,150
What did you guys
think of the play, huh?

1036
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,019
Well, you put mom
in a fucking coma.

1037
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:02,822
Hey, Columbo,
I'm the one in the coma.

1038
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:05,726
Okay, can I go?

1039
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:07,461
I have a test tomorrow.

1040
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,829
They're about to make
the volcano onion.

1041
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:12,132
She does.
She has a test.

1042
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:13,570
Fine.

1043
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,780
It's nice to see
you two be sisters.

1044
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:28,081
I think most of her friends

1045
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:31,017
think that I'm like
her weird aunt.

1046
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:32,820
What?

1047
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,621
You're the only one
in the family who says aunt.

1048
00:56:34,623 --> 00:56:37,124
- Aunt?
- Too much Jane Austin.

1049
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,929
May I ask you...
a question?

1050
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,666
Shh, shh.

1051
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:49,735
Excuse me, hi. May I please
have another of these.

1052
00:56:49,737 --> 00:56:51,637
Yes, and make it two.

1053
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,005
Do you have to, like,
slurp it down?

1054
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:56,876
I mean, Max, he notices.

1055
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:58,644
The same person
who threw food at your head?

1056
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,079
I asked you a question.

1057
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:01,215
You're afraid that
I'm going to offend him?

1058
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,483
I asked you a question.

1059
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,883
You didn't answer it.

1060
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:05,052
You didn't.
You asked if you could ask...

1061
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,052
What are you doing home?

1062
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:08,054
Oh.

1063
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,195
I don't know, Dad.
What do you want me to say?

1064
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:18,898
I'm flailing, okay?

1065
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,900
I'm just trying to figure out
if the life

1066
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:23,570
that I have picked for myself
is even the one that I want,

1067
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,104
and I don't...

1068
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:27,876
even know if I'm allowed
to ask that question.

1069
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,979
You may never
figure that out.

1070
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,947
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1071
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,652
Thank you.

1072
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,090
Well, why did you want
to marry Mom?

1073
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,592
How did you know?

1074
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:47,994
She had great legs.

1075
00:57:47,996 --> 00:57:49,829
And the mouth
of a truck driver.

1076
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:57,170
Truth is...

1077
00:57:57,172 --> 00:58:00,577
your mother is
the best partner I ever had.

1078
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,981
I wanted to be better for her.

1079
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,519
She made me think
I could be.

1080
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,217
Hello?

1081
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:48,220
I got... I got
my eyebrow pierced.

1082
00:58:48,222 --> 00:58:50,356
What?

1083
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:51,992
And then it looked
really dumb,

1084
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,930
and it got gross,
so then I took it out.

1085
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:04,905
Sounds like you've been busy.

1086
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:09,610
What are... have you
been up to?

1087
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,378
Did... did you get
any new holes in your body?

1088
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:18,050
Oh, I've been here
just holding down the fort.

1089
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:20,653
I miss you.

1090
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:23,624
I miss your voice,
and I miss you

1091
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,360
a very, very lot.

1092
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,829
You've got
a funny way of showing it.

1093
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,302
I think I just got
really scared.

1094
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:38,037
Of what?

1095
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,641
I don't know.

1096
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:43,242
Us?

1097
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:45,979
And then this thing
with my family,

1098
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:49,048
it's like I'm surrounded
by these people

1099
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,251
who never asked
any questions.

1100
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,952
There are just all of
these little things

1101
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:55,354
that I haven't said.

1102
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:57,791
I don't know, I haven't taken
a shower by myself

1103
00:59:57,793 --> 00:59:59,226
in the last five years.

1104
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,927
So, shower alone.

1105
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:03,229
I'm not forcing you
to shower with me.

1106
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:09,369
I want to come home.

1107
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:14,074
I have not heard from you
in two fucking weeks.

1108
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:18,110
I know.

1109
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:20,981
And I'm sorry.

1110
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:26,853
Ali and I are still going to go
to the Halloween Parade,

1111
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:30,691
and your costume
is still in the closet.

1112
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,392
And I totally get it
if you just don't want to go,

1113
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:36,932
but I really hope
that you do.

1114
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:42,904
And I love you.

1115
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:58,217
Ow.

1116
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,490
Be quiet.

1117
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,459
Okay.

1118
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,735
Sick.

1119
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,369
Hurry up.

1120
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,338
I'm hurrying.

1121
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,508
Holy dang!

1122
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:25,845
I feel like if you bring
this much money to school

1123
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:27,813
you do not need it.

1124
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:30,083
Hey, since you live downtown,

1125
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:32,418
would you mind picking up the H
for the party later?

1126
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,854
Without you?

1127
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:36,956
Yeah, I mean,
it's really easy.

1128
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,727
I'll tell you where to go.

1129
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,963
Yeah.

1130
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:53,106
Happy Halloween.
Ooh, this is spooky.

1131
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:56,242
Ali, one per customer.

1132
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:58,110
I feel like
such an asshole.

1133
01:01:58,112 --> 01:01:59,912
You are such a thief,
and you are an asshole.

1134
01:01:59,914 --> 01:02:01,248
This is fun.
Don't be in a bad mood.

1135
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:04,383
I didn't think I'd get
to do this again.

1136
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:05,985
Happy Halloween!
Trick or treat!

1137
01:02:05,987 --> 01:02:07,253
Happy Halloween.
Trick or treat.

1138
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:08,854
- Oh, hi, girls.
- Thank you.

1139
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:11,992
- Oh, thanks.
- Look, Emma, it's...

1140
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,894
Oh, we're
the California Raisins.

1141
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,798
Cute, a nerd. In costume.

1142
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,001
Happy Halloween.

1143
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,568
I think we have
to tell Mom.

1144
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,104
You know, I don't think
he's ever going to.

1145
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:26,039
He's not ready to.

1146
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:29,275
He's never going
to be ready.

1147
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:33,045
Can I just say...

1148
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:35,382
you don't understand
what he's going through.

1149
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,117
Dad loves Mom.

1150
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,853
But now he's terrified
of hurting her.

1151
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,220
So, it's not that easy.

1152
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:42,588
Yeah, he should've
thought of that

1153
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,324
before he titty fucked
some woman

1154
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:46,293
whose laundry
is full of dry clean only.

1155
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,360
You went through her laundry?

1156
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,530
I'm telling her.
I'm telling her right now.

1157
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:54,467
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, Ali. Please.

1158
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:56,503
Oop!
Pardon me.

1159
01:02:56,505 --> 01:03:00,106
Mom? Mom, we have
to tell you something.

1160
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,208
We're going to be late.

1161
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,075
You guys look so cute.

1162
01:03:03,077 --> 01:03:07,046
No, wait, just one picture,
just one picture, please.

1163
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:09,382
Go... um, just be a raisin, okay.

1164
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:11,550
Oh, that's cute.
Move around a little bit.

1165
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,621
- Like this?
- Oh, that's adorable.

1166
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:17,090
How about a little of this?

1167
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:23,396
Alexandra.

1168
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:26,999
Please tell me you are
holding these for a friend.

1169
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:28,267
You smoked
for 20 years.

1170
01:03:28,269 --> 01:03:29,936
My gynecologist
smoked then.

1171
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,438
Okay, great,
we heard it.

1172
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,206
- I'll talk to her.
- This is bullshit, okay?

1173
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,976
Bullshit.
Both of you are hypocrites.

1174
01:03:36,978 --> 01:03:38,413
I'm so over this.

1175
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:42,514
What the fuck
just happened?

1176
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:44,617
I'll handle it.
I got it.

1177
01:03:46,954 --> 01:03:48,889
She's just being scary.
It's Halloween.

1178
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,394
She's a scary...
a scary raisin.

1179
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,320
Come on, darlin'.
It could've been that bad.

1180
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:23,491
Watch it. My ex...

1181
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:31,363
Can I get a white wine?

1182
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:32,934
You got it.

1183
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:43,043
I don't think
he's going to be there.

1184
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,945
It's making me sick.

1185
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,646
Okay, well, I mean
you cheated on him,

1186
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:48,447
and you ignored him
for two weeks.

1187
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,550
So, I probably wouldn't
show up either if I were him.

1188
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:53,519
Yes, but just
take into account

1189
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:55,220
that he doesn't know
the cheating part.

1190
01:04:55,222 --> 01:04:56,588
Good.

1191
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,490
You take that
to the vault, okay?

1192
01:04:58,492 --> 01:05:00,025
Why? What?

1193
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:01,628
You just throw away
the combination.

1194
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,362
Because he never
has to know about it.

1195
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,731
- Anything.
- You...

1196
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:08,034
Ugh!

1197
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:10,369
Ooh.

1198
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:11,403
It's that time of the month.

1199
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:15,075
No.

1200
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,043
You know, you are really
a weird little bird,

1201
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:18,043
you know that?

1202
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:20,282
Mime. Sorry.

1203
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,985
You're a weird
little bird.

1204
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:29,722
I just want you
to be happy.

1205
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,967
He's here.

1206
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:43,369
How's my raisin?

1207
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:48,243
It looks really good.
You look awesome.

1208
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,414
You forgot to make
a pee hole for this thing.

1209
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:56,452
- Aw.
- Hi.

1210
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,624
Oh. Hi.

1211
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:07,594
You're crying.

1212
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,695
- I know.
- Hi.

1213
01:06:09,697 --> 01:06:11,197
Hi.

1214
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1215
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,334
What's the matter?

1216
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:18,670
You look so nice
in this box.

1217
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:21,374
You are so nice
to wear the box.

1218
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:22,742
I love it.

1219
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:24,510
I mean, I hate it,
but I love it.

1220
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:25,612
I'm wearing it.

1221
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,048
You are so good.

1222
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,450
Yeah, you are too.

1223
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:34,186
Okay, you're freaking me out
right now.

1224
01:06:34,188 --> 01:06:37,190
Okay, yeah.
I'm not good.

1225
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:39,425
What happened?

1226
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:40,559
I did something bad.

1227
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:44,463
Okay. Just what?
What?

1228
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:47,566
A couple weeks ago,
after we saw...

1229
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:49,802
after we went
to the party, I...

1230
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:52,338
when I was at the party
and I was talking to Nate there.

1231
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,407
- And then...
- No!

1232
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:56,675
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Please, please, please.

1233
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:58,311
- Let me finish.
- Did you fuck him?

1234
01:06:58,313 --> 01:06:59,545
I'm not putting
my words together.

1235
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:01,213
Did you fuck him?

1236
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:03,650
You fucked him!

1237
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,186
I knew it.

1238
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,487
I fucking knew it,
and I didn't say anything

1239
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:10,155
because I'm a fucking chump!

1240
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:12,157
No, no, no, no, no.
I am the chump.

1241
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:15,695
I can't believe you.

1242
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:18,597
Ben? Ben, please.

1243
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,700
Please, please!

1244
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:23,135
Ben!

1245
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:26,107
- You drop your box, Raisin Man.
- Fuck you!

1246
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:40,220
Never was
a disco man myself.

1247
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,690
Neither was my husband.

1248
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,391
The coke was great.

1249
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:48,764
Yeah, so I hear.

1250
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,666
Divorced? Widowed?

1251
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:56,568
Uh, what if I'm neither?

1252
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,840
Somebody married you.

1253
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:03,742
So how long
you been divorced?

1254
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:06,579
I'm not.

1255
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:08,680
Looking for a third?

1256
01:08:08,682 --> 01:08:10,682
You're not his type.

1257
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,619
You're a real pisser.

1258
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:16,289
My husband used to think so.

1259
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,694
I'm Mitch.

1260
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,196
Let's dance, Mitch.

1261
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:27,866
Who knows how to disco
like it's 1975?

1262
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,652
What did I just do?

1263
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:48,955
Badelia be crazy.

1264
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:51,357
I just didn't want
to be Dad.

1265
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,459
You're not Dad.

1266
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:55,894
You should've seen
his face.

1267
01:08:55,896 --> 01:08:57,597
He's never going
to talk to me again.

1268
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:59,665
Yes, he will.

1269
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,369
I mean it.
It will be okay.

1270
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:05,905
Um, can you just wait here?

1271
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:07,607
I have to pick up
something for a friend.

1272
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,411
I'll be back
in, like, a second.

1273
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:13,715
No, thank you.

1274
01:09:19,253 --> 01:09:22,988
Who do you know
who lives here?

1275
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:26,826
Um, don't worry
about it.

1276
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:29,728
Ugh, Ali, no,
I hate that, okay.

1277
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:32,331
And also this has been
a horrible, long night.

1278
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,833
Can we please just go home?

1279
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,867
Yeah, just wait
right there, okay?

1280
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,610
Is this dripping?

1281
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:50,450
Bag and a bag?

1282
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,887
Uh, yeah. Two?

1283
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:56,022
Two and two.

1284
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:57,924
What? Wait, he's taking
my money.

1285
01:09:57,926 --> 01:10:00,293
He'll be right back,
freshie.

1286
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:01,760
Is this your friend?

1287
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:04,030
- What did...
- Just be quiet, okay?

1288
01:10:04,032 --> 01:10:06,432
Why?
Is this a drug deal?

1289
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:08,668
- Are you buying drugs?
- Shut the fuck up, trash bag.

1290
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,402
Uh, take a better look,
cool guy.

1291
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:11,970
I'm a California Raisin.

1292
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:14,906
Dana! Can you just...
can you be cool, please?

1293
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:16,308
No, I can't be cool.

1294
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,677
I've had the worst night,

1295
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:18,945
and I don't know why
you would bring me

1296
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,713
to this gross place.

1297
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:23,816
No offense.
Let's just go.

1298
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:26,552
Ooh! Oh my God!

1299
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:28,487
Is that a needle?

1300
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:31,424
- Just calm down, okay?
- I don't want to calm down.

1301
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:33,358
It's for a friend.
It's not even for me.

1302
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,594
And this is not, like,
a regular thing for me, okay.

1303
01:10:35,596 --> 01:10:36,728
It's... it's a holiday.

1304
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:38,063
The holiday is Halloween,

1305
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:39,632
which is not typically
a heroin holiday

1306
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:41,668
on most people's calendars.

1307
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,936
You're so smart.
Why would you do this?

1308
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:45,871
You know that people do it
one time, they get addicted...

1309
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:48,808
I did it once.
I'm fine.

1310
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,476
Jesus Fucking Christ, Dana,

1311
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:52,411
not everything
is so black and white.

1312
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:55,647
Like, you can... you can fuck Nate
and still love Ben, right?

1313
01:10:55,649 --> 01:10:57,349
Oh, shit!

1314
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:00,820
Okay. You need
to just step out.

1315
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:03,889
You're not
in this conversation.

1316
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:12,800
So, Mini Trash,
want your shit or not?

1317
01:11:17,037 --> 01:11:19,405
Not.

1318
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:20,772
Five-o! Five-o!

1319
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,709
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1320
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,477
- Yo, run, raisins, run!
- Go, go, Ali!

1321
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:27,813
Go, go, go, go, go.

1322
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,648
- Hold on, ladies
- Are you kidding?

1323
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,483
I just said no.

1324
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:33,753
And I'm sure Nancy Reagan
would be real proud.

1325
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:35,120
But you're trespassing.

1326
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:37,393
Come on.

1327
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:55,641
Hey. Lenny's on HBO.

1328
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:03,683
Remember I took you
to see him on our first date?

1329
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,619
Then we went to night court
to watch hookers

1330
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,720
and pimps get arraigned.

1331
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:34,045
What's...

1332
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,983
What's gotten into you, huh?

1333
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:39,921
Hi.

1334
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:12,552
Oh. Oh!

1335
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,021
Ah, oh.

1336
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,991
Oh.

1337
01:13:40,113 --> 01:13:42,781
Alan?

1338
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:43,951
What?

1339
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,789
Which one of us
fucks better?

1340
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:54,861
What are... what are you
talking about?

1341
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,263
Just... just stop, okay.

1342
01:13:58,265 --> 01:14:00,799
Really, Patty,
I don't know what you're...

1343
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:01,933
Stop.

1344
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:04,105
Stop lying.

1345
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:10,041
I know about Carla.

1346
01:14:10,043 --> 01:14:14,714
I read all the stupid...
fucking shit that you wrote.

1347
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:19,285
Are you serious?
It's a play.

1348
01:14:19,287 --> 01:14:21,286
It's... it's for the play.

1349
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:24,557
I should chuck that
fucking computer at your head.

1350
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:25,924
Patty, I...

1351
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:27,462
Just stay,
stay where you are.

1352
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,567
What was your plan?

1353
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:36,672
Were you ever
going to tell me or...

1354
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:47,181
Why her and not me?

1355
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:52,652
Because she knows
I'm alive, okay?

1356
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,720
She knows you're alive?
Really?

1357
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:58,991
When was the last time
you or anybody in this house

1358
01:14:58,993 --> 01:15:00,692
ever even looked at me?

1359
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:02,093
You think I'm a failure.

1360
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:03,896
You said it
right in front of Ali.

1361
01:15:03,898 --> 01:15:05,630
I did what?

1362
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:06,933
You don't even
like me anymore.

1363
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,300
Look, I married you, okay.

1364
01:15:08,302 --> 01:15:09,869
Can we just assume
that I like you?

1365
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:12,571
I don't have to assume
with her.

1366
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,072
She tells me!

1367
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:15,840
Really? She tells you what?

1368
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:17,742
That you're so great
and that she loves you.

1369
01:15:17,744 --> 01:15:19,778
Yeah, for who I am
and some other person

1370
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,551
she wishes I could be.

1371
01:15:28,221 --> 01:15:30,858
I had...

1372
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:37,362
I had no idea...

1373
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:39,800
that this was
going to be anything, Patty.

1374
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,272
I don't want
to lose you.

1375
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:48,176
And the girls.

1376
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:53,148
You broke the rules.

1377
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:54,339
Hey.

1378
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:57,175
We're home.

1379
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:59,745
We'll all talk
in the morning.

1380
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,179
I'm gonna find a spot.

1381
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:02,915
Okay.

1382
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:04,150
Okay.

1383
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:30,442
Mom?

1384
01:17:32,979 --> 01:17:34,682
Mom?

1385
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,986
Oh my God, Mom.

1386
01:17:40,988 --> 01:17:44,022
We're okay.
I'm so sorry. We're fine.

1387
01:17:44,024 --> 01:17:47,362
We're fine.
Mom, we're totally fine.

1388
01:18:04,444 --> 01:18:06,247
Your father fucked up.

1389
01:18:09,216 --> 01:18:12,485
We know.

1390
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,288
You do?

1391
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,992
We haven't known
for very long.

1392
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:23,262
And we also weren't sure.

1393
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:25,296
Yeah, but I should've
told you.

1394
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:26,866
No, no, no.

1395
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,004
You have nothing
to apologize for.

1396
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,275
I've known
for a little while too.

1397
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:10,108
Oh.

1398
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,210
No.

1399
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,422
Come here.

1400
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,058
I love you guys so much.

1401
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,827
Even when you make me crazy.

1402
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:30,865
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1403
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:37,570
You know it doesn't
always wind up like this.

1404
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,141
Right, it doesn't
have to end up like this.

1405
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:49,818
This isn't so bad.

1406
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:19,010
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

1407
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:37,228
Hi.

1408
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:39,231
You think you're being cute.

1409
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:41,066
But you're being
a fucking asshole.

1410
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:23,375
- I love you.
- I love you.

1411
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:24,546
Thank you.

1412
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:31,383
Um, I made you this tape.

1413
01:21:31,385 --> 01:21:35,523
Oh. What a loser.

1414
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:42,227
I called it.
I knew you'd get back together.

1415
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:43,594
Yeah, you know everything.

1416
01:21:43,596 --> 01:21:46,231
Yeah. Bye.

1417
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:47,569
Bye!

1418
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:08,019
Want to get high
and watch "Zelig"?

1419
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:10,524
Not really.

1420
01:22:13,394 --> 01:22:14,425
What's up?

1421
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:16,398
What do you mean?

1422
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:19,697
You're not saying anything.

1423
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:22,304
Neither are you.

1424
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:27,138
My mom wanted me
to invite you

1425
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,174
to my grandma's
80th birthday party.

1426
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,378
Oh.

1427
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,647
They call you
my girlfriend.

1428
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:37,385
Is that okay?

1429
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:42,120
I like you.

1430
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:47,125
Like, like a lot.

1431
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:50,094
Um, just seems like
in a year from now

1432
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:53,165
we're going to be
at different schools.

1433
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:55,601
And, like, I don't even know
where I'll be, you know.

1434
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,669
And it's, like, at some point

1435
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:59,772
either I'm going to hurt you
or you're going to hurt me,

1436
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:03,474
and... like we're friends.

1437
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:05,510
So I just want to stay friends.

1438
01:23:05,512 --> 01:23:07,545
Got it.

1439
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,313
What time is it?

1440
01:23:09,315 --> 01:23:11,650
- It's probably 3:00.
- Yeah, I should go.

1441
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:14,186
My dad's probably downstairs.

1442
01:23:14,188 --> 01:23:16,358
Fuck his car up.

1443
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:27,499
So, you put your blinker on.

1444
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:30,102
Check your rearview mirror,
your side mirror.

1445
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:32,537
I know.

1446
01:23:35,309 --> 01:23:37,576
Where am I going?

1447
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:40,178
Poppy's house.

1448
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,647
You moved in with Poppy?

1449
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:44,348
That's depressing.

1450
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,817
Thank you.

1451
01:23:45,819 --> 01:23:47,452
It's not that bad.

1452
01:23:47,454 --> 01:23:49,220
He spends most of his time
in Atlantic City

1453
01:23:49,222 --> 01:23:50,555
with a flavor of the month,

1454
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:52,324
and I feed his cat
while he's away.

1455
01:23:52,326 --> 01:23:54,293
Yeah, I don't really
want to go to Queens.

1456
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,327
So, can you just,
like, sign the papers

1457
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:58,533
and say we completed
the hours?

1458
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,641
You have every right
to be upset.

1459
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:11,710
Cool.

1460
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:15,313
You'll never know
how sorry I really am.

1461
01:24:15,315 --> 01:24:18,784
But I'm not leaving
this family.

1462
01:24:18,786 --> 01:24:21,753
You keep saying that.

1463
01:24:21,755 --> 01:24:24,826
How does that actually work?

1464
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:31,729
I have no fucking idea.

1465
01:24:40,573 --> 01:24:42,508
Have you ever thought
about the possibility

1466
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:48,179
that Carla's just filling
a void you created for yourself?

1467
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:49,748
A void?

1468
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,884
- Yeah.
- What is that?

1469
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,919
Like Oprah?

1470
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:57,321
No, God, why does everyone
think I get my shit from Oprah?

1471
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:59,357
Because your shit
is far too wise

1472
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:02,429
for the amount of time you've
actually been on this planet.

1473
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,534
All right.

1474
01:25:09,936 --> 01:25:12,170
So, Poppy has a cat?

1475
01:25:12,172 --> 01:25:13,705
Yeah, I've never
actually seen it,

1476
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:16,208
but I smell it.

1477
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,942
Easy. Okay, you got it.

1478
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:20,247
Okay.

1479
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:23,848
Easy, easy, easy.

1480
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:27,154
Watch out for this girl
in the short skirt.

1481
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,692
I'm going to take a bath.

1482
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:39,630
I want to glue him
to the wall

1483
01:25:39,632 --> 01:25:41,366
and take a flame thrower

1484
01:25:41,368 --> 01:25:44,303
and shoot fire
into his hair.

1485
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,870
And then just take some ink

1486
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:48,307
and shoot it into
his fucking blue eyeballs.

1487
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,473
Okay.

1488
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:51,576
- Also kill him.
- Stop.

1489
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:54,379
I can't keep having
this conversation with you.

1490
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:56,214
If you didn't want
to have the conversation,

1491
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:57,883
you probably shouldn't
have told me about it

1492
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,418
because the image
of you two fucking

1493
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,253
is in my head.

1494
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:02,588
Do you know
what that's like?

1495
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:03,921
No, I don't.

1496
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:07,358
I didn't want to lie
to you anymore.

1497
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,561
Cheating's lying.

1498
01:26:09,563 --> 01:26:11,530
You told me
so you could feel better.

1499
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:12,964
Just because
I did one shitty thing

1500
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:15,601
doesn't mean
I do all shitty things.

1501
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:19,470
I did a stupid, gross thing,

1502
01:26:19,472 --> 01:26:22,773
and I'm endlessly,
endlessly sorry.

1503
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:24,476
I'll always be sorry,

1504
01:26:24,478 --> 01:26:25,843
but I also can't undo it,

1505
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,478
and I don't know
what to do.

1506
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,516
I love you. I love you.
And I hate myself.

1507
01:26:31,518 --> 01:26:34,318
And I just...

1508
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,190
I just, I...

1509
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:41,362
I don't know what else to do.

1510
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,326
I mean...

1511
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:17,698
do you think I wasn't
scared and bored too?

1512
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:22,968
You asked me
to marry you.

1513
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,436
Yeah.

1514
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,338
Because I wanted
to marry you.

1515
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:27,973
But, yeah, it's terrifying

1516
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,808
thinking I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

1517
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,576
comparing everybody else to you.

1518
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:34,879
I know.

1519
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:38,849
I... I mean, what happens
in six months?

1520
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:41,753
I don't think
either one of us

1521
01:27:41,755 --> 01:27:43,992
can say that
it's going to be perfect.

1522
01:27:45,492 --> 01:27:49,527
But I can... I can say that
I love you.

1523
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:52,430
And I just want
to live a life

1524
01:27:52,432 --> 01:27:54,769
where we're always
choosing each other.

1525
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,273
And I choose you.

1526
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:05,980
If you'll let me.

1527
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,791
Will you take a bath
with me?

1528
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:22,928
Will we have sex in it?

1529
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:27,098
You know that doesn't work.

1530
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,800
We're going to fuck
in this tub.

1531
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:32,603
You're gonna get
your elbows bonked.

1532
01:28:32,605 --> 01:28:36,978
Oh, no!

1533
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,384
Of course you can, honey.

1534
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,053
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1535
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:49,787
I'm sorry.

1536
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:51,790
- Hi, Mom. You look pretty.
- Happy birthday.

1537
01:28:51,792 --> 01:28:53,592
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

1538
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:55,494
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- Is that mine?

1539
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,963
Guess what it is.
It's a trench!

1540
01:28:57,965 --> 01:29:00,432
- Oh!
- She got one for herself too.

1541
01:29:00,434 --> 01:29:02,134
I did,
but it's not matching.

1542
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:04,602
- So, we won't be dorks.
- Maybe I should get one too.

1543
01:29:04,604 --> 01:29:05,803
No, no, don't.

1544
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:06,937
Yes.

1545
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:08,773
What are you wearing?

1546
01:29:08,775 --> 01:29:10,709
This is what you call
a fashion statement.

1547
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,177
- You love these suspenders!
- I love it.

1548
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:14,579
She looks like
an adorable Doug Henning.

1549
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,113
I'm not saying
they're not cute.

1550
01:29:16,115 --> 01:29:17,749
I'm just saying people
are going to assume

1551
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:19,049
that you have
to pull your pants up

1552
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:20,718
because you're wearing
a diaper.

1553
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,120
I think they're adorable.

1554
01:29:22,122 --> 01:29:23,722
- I think it's so...
- A cute diaper.

1555
01:29:23,724 --> 01:29:24,990
I'm taking this away
from you.

1556
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,525
- No, you ain't.
- No, come on.

1557
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,058
- I'll have it.
- Slow down.

1558
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,693
You've cat to be kitten me
right meow.

1559
01:29:29,695 --> 01:29:30,995
Yeah!

1560
01:29:30,997 --> 01:29:32,664
Whoa!

1561
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,199
You didn't really
just say that?

1562
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:36,634
- I've been waiting six months...
- That's my guy.

1563
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:38,903
You cat to be kitten me
right meow, my Ben.

1564
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:40,772
- Hey.
- Hi.

1565
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:43,711
- Happy birthday, Ali.
- Thanks.

1566
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,483
Hi.

1567
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,782
What? No gift?

1568
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:54,919
It's parked outside.

1569
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:57,022
Really?

1570
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,990
You look great.

1571
01:29:58,992 --> 01:30:01,927
You look tired.

1572
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,695
Is there something outside?

1573
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:05,729
Honey, it's a brand-new
horse and buggy.

1574
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:07,598
Be careful, it bucks.

1575
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,601
I don't even get
two presents out of this shit?

1576
01:30:09,603 --> 01:30:12,470
You are such a tiny asshole.

1577
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:14,572
Happy birthday.

1578
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:16,040
Hey, Ben.

1579
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:17,675
- Hey. How are you?
- Good to see you.

1580
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:18,977
- Good to see you too.
- Long time.

1581
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:20,879
Yeah.

1582
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:23,618
Thanks for inviting me.

1583
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:32,223
Well, ah, Max!
My man!

1584
01:30:32,225 --> 01:30:33,825
- Yay!
- Yay, he's here.

1585
01:30:33,827 --> 01:30:36,126
He's a family member.

1586
01:30:36,128 --> 01:30:38,229
- Looking sharp.
- He's my long lost son.

1587
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:39,830
- Oh, whoa.
- You have the shrimp, right?

1588
01:30:39,832 --> 01:30:41,700
Can you... Max?

1589
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,602
Can you put the shrimp
on one side of the grill,

1590
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,271
not near the meat because
I'm developing a little allergy.

1591
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:49,241
- She's "allergic" to shrimp.
- I am. It gets me flushed.

1592
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,875
Is that the stuff
that's really hot?

1593
01:30:50,877 --> 01:30:53,143
- Yeah.
- I think that got me last time.

1594
01:30:53,145 --> 01:30:54,979
- So what are you drinking, Ali?
- That's a birthday drink.

1595
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:56,615
It's... yeah.

1596
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:57,949
And you guys
just let that happen?

What do you mean "she"?
What about you?

1601
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,723
- I was...
- You were an accomplice.

1602
01:31:05,725 --> 01:31:07,526
I was a dingleberry
on the situation.

1603
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:08,860
- You're the oldest.
- I didn't know what was...

1604
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:10,594
She can't even handle
her soda.

1605
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:13,063
Mom says I'm a heavyweight.

1606
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:17,835
<i>Give her all the shrimp.</i>
