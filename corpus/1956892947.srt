1
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,650
(gun cocked)

2
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,420
- [Man] Money.

3
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,190
Nobody gets dead.

4
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,820
On the floor, asshole.

5
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,290
(people screaming)

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,320
Fill it.

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,050
Let's do it.

8
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,750
Come on.

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,390
Come on.

10
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,120
Come on!

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,490
(intense music)

12
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,150
(shot fired)

13
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,790
Come on!

14
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,320
(tires screeching)

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,790
(melancholy music)

16
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,420
(stream running)

17
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,850
(birds chirping)

18
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,550
- Whatever else.

19
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,850
Your daddy was a god fearing
man, Travis.

20
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,350
It ain't right.

21
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,450
- It says here.

22
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,450
I, uh,

23
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,750
I can't read that fine print.

24
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,050
Sheriff, would you mind?

25
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,420
(clock ticking)

26
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,520
- Says here your daddy left

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,050
just about everything to that
preacher fella on TV.

28
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,350
Money and stock mostly.

29
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,750
Of course, you do get all the
land.

30
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,620
And he goes on to say

31
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,590
if you work hard

32
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,990
you just may make something
of your life.

33
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,550
Says you get the family
collectibles.

34
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
That would be your mother's
embroidery.

35
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,990
This coin collection.

36
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,250
And your mother's thimbles.

37
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
- Don't know much about
thimbles.

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,120
But as I recall

39
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,920
it's an impressive coin
collection.

40
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,390
That's his daddy's chain,
ain't it?

41
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,950
- Well that's worth a heap of
money.

42
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,550
Maybe you'd like to keep it
down at the bank.

43
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,850
- No.

44
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,820
- Know, your daddy showed me

45
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,820
a couple of confederate bills
once.

46
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,650
They're probably not worth
anything

47
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,490
but uh

48
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,020
I'd be willing to pay top
dollar.

49
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
What do you say?

50
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,350
- No.

51
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,920
- Easy, Andrew.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,490
You're starting to drool all
over the judge's table.

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,950
He can't break up that
collection.

54
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,450
It's been in his family for
over a hundred years.

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,920
- Well, I thought I'd give it
a shot.

56
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,420
- Is that all?

57
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,820
- Well, if you two would sign
this we'll get it done.

58
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,850
(melancholy music)

59
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,950
(chickens clucking)

60
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,320
(horses neighing)

61
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,350
- [Bobby] Hey, Travis.

62
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,990
You up there in the hayloft?

63
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,490
You need to get these stairs
fixed.

64
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,220
- [Travis] Bobby, what a
surprise.

65
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,350
You usually knock.

66
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,450
Come on in.

67
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,290
- Thought you might be
thirsty.

68
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,390
Sorry about your dad.

69
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,990
(bottles opening)

70
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,890
I'm off duty.

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,350
So when are you taking off?

72
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,220
- I don't know.

73
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,390
Soon I guess.

74
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,720
- That's good.

75
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,020
You've been talking about it
since high school.

76
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,520
Traveling the world.

77
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,550
Meeting exotic women.

78
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,750
The way I see it

79
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:04,890
now's your big chance.

80
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,290
- I guess they're not women
that know you.

81
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,990
- Talking about Chris Bodie
again?

82
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,450
God damn.

83
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,650
That was just perfect.

84
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,820
You know she was hitting on
me at the hoe down.

85
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,320
I

86
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,220
- She was my date.

87
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,520
- Gotta move fast.

88
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,090
- You move late.

89
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,590
- You'll never leave.

90
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,250
- You never know.

91
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,890
- Yeah.

92
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,350
I think I do.

93
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,250
Catch you later.

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
(scary music)

95
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,650
(organ playing)

96
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,990
(country music)

97
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,550
- Thanks for the ride.

98
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,690
(truck engine roaring)

99
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,450
(birds chirping)

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,250
Hi there.

101
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,520
Oh boy.

102
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,820
I think I'm lost.

103
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,190
Kelly.

104
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,950
- I'm sorry.

105
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,520
Travis.

106
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,750
- Please to meet you, Travis.

107
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,590
Could you help me?

108
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,990
I was trying to get to
Watkins.

109
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,520
- Watkins?

110
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,220
You're here.

111
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,890
Outside of Astonville.

112
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,890
Watkins is there

113
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,620
30 miles away.

114
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,250
- You know if there's a

115
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,390
bus or anything around there?

116
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,920
- Train runs through town.

117
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,790
You hungry?

118
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,620
- What?

119
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,290
- You hungry?

120
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,750
'Cause if you are.

121
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,250
I was just getting ready to
have some lunch.

122
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,690
You can join me if you want.

123
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,250
And then I can take you back
into town afterwards.

124
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,320
If you're hungry.

125
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,750
- Okay.

126
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,290
Let's eat.

127
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,350
- I haven't really thought
about it

128
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,390
until just now.

129
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,650
Hey.

130
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,990
You forgot your bag.

131
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,350
(clock ticking)

132
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,690
- Oh my God.

133
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,890
How long I was asleep?

134
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,020
- Four and a quarter hours.

135
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,650
- Oh my God.

136
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,650
I'm so sorry.

137
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,090
Could you take me into town?

138
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,620
Get a room at the Traveler's
Club.

139
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:20,920
- It's too late.

140
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,290
I mean

141
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,890
I'm sorry I let you sleep so
much.

142
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,790
I guess I figured

143
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,950
well I figured that

144
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,950
if it would be alright with
you

145
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,120
that you could

146
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,590
stay here tonight.

147
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,250
It's a big house.

148
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,220
All the rooms.

149
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,720
The doors lock.

150
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,450
Besides I sleep in the
hayloft.

151
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,950
- The hayloft?

152
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,490
How come?

153
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,550
- I just do.

154
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,450
My father lived in the house.

155
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,920
- Oh wow.

156
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,820
Nice collection.

157
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,420
Winchester

158
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:02,990
1894.

159
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,820
- '92 actually.

160
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,120
You know guns?

161
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,420
- Yeah.

162
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,290
They kinda run in the family.

163
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,520
- Yeah?

164
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,350
Mine too.

165
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,690
It's good 'cause we got 'em
all over the house.

166
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,720
- Do you have to stay out in
the hayloft?

167
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,750
- If you feel safer.

168
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,190
- I'd feel safer

169
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,750
if you stayed in the house.

170
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,220
- Sorry?

171
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,790
- I'd feel safer if you
stayed in the house.

172
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,850
- Sure.

173
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,290
I mean, okay.

174
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,390
Room's this way.

175
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,320
- Travis?

176
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
You're a real gentleman.

177
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,290
- [Travis] Station's just a
little further up.

178
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,950
("Somebody's Fool" by David
Allan Morgan)

179
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,320
So what are you gonna do when
you get to Watkins?

180
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,950
- Ricky went there to be an
actor

181
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,290
at that Gem Theater, you know?

182
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,450
- The dinner theater in
Watkins?

183
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,090
- Yeah.

184
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,750
- You sure?

185
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,250
- Sure I'm sure.

186
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,350
- Well.

187
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,550
I think it's been closed for
a lot of years.

188
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,950
- Really?

189
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,290
- I'm pretty sure.

190
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,490
We used to go there when I
was a kid.

191
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,650
- Well shit.

192
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,950
(dramatic music)

193
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,250
- When's the last time you
talked to him?

194
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,220
- Well, we sorta broke up.

195
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,350
Before he left and

196
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,490
I told ya I was gonna
surprise him.

197
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,520
- I'm sorry.

198
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,650
Eat somethin'?

199
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,290
Come on.

200
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,450
- [Jolene] If I had to fly
back to London.

201
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,920
To cover up the incompetence.

202
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,350
I would not be pleased.

203
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,250
Because I told you.

204
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,750
- [Lutie] Hey Travis.

205
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,190
- Hey Lutie.

206
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,650
Where's Earl?

207
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,890
- He's kinda takin' a day off.

208
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,050
Can we get a couple OJ's
please.

209
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,520
- Comin' right up.

210
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,850
Hey, Travis.

211
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,490
Our TV is kinda actin' up.

212
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,190
Suppose you could have a look
at it?

213
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,820
- Sure.

214
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,150
- [Jolene] I'm sick and tired
of you screwing things up

215
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,590
when I'm not there to hold
your hand.

216
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,850
- Who's the girl?

217
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,820
- I wouldn't if you don't
know.

218
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,290
- So introduce me.

219
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:33,990
- She's just passin' through
town.

220
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,850
- Then I suppose to tell her.

221
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,850
- You're Travis Graham,
aren't you?

222
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,350
- That's right.

223
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,720
- I'm Jolene.

224
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,020
I hear you're looking to sell
some property

225
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,120
in this area.

226
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,390
- News sure does travel fast.

227
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,190
- I'm looking to buy.

228
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,620
Do you think I could see your
place?

229
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,720
- Well, there's really not
much to see.

230
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,650
- You're not gonna sell your
house are you?

231
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,520
- Depends on what she's
offerin'.

232
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,190
- Oh, I'm sure I could make
you

233
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,850
a very attractive offer, Mr.
Graham.

234
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,490
- Excuse me.

235
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,750
Travis, didn't you say

236
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,920
your great granddaddy built
that house?

237
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,690
Can't just up and.

238
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,950
Look I'm sorry.

239
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,750
I'm embarrassing you.

240
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,820
Take it from somebody

241
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,520
who's never really had much
of a home.

242
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,620
Family.

243
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,790
Pretty soon you're gonna
start to miss it.

244
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,650
- Miss Leder.

245
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,490
I appreciate your interest.

246
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,350
But I'm really not sure yet.

247
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,820
- There's no harm in just
taking a look.

248
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,350
Is there?

249
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,520
- I'll let you know.

250
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,750
Nice to meet you.

251
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:02,890
- Okay.

252
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,450
- Small town.

253
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,620
Nobody minds their own
business.

254
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,350
- Travis, take your hat off
when you're inside.

255
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,790
- Sheriff Bob.

256
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,320
- That's the sheriff?

257
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,150
I've never seen a sheriff
without a gun before.

258
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,050
- He doesn't need one.

259
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,390
- Hey Travis.

260
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,120
You drivin' the Chevy to the
hoedown?

261
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,620
Wouldn't be the same

262
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,250
without an arrival from the
Graham family.

263
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,890
- I hadn't thought about it.

264
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,520
- A hoedown?

265
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,790
I love a hoedown.

266
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,650
- Don't you have some place
to go?

267
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,320
- Nowhere to go.

268
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,890
No money to get there.

269
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,850
Maybe you could use a hand
around the ranch.

270
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,820
- Maybe.

271
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,290
- [Anchorwoman] Two armed
robbers

272
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,420
got away with over $10,000
dollars.

273
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,420
- I tell you.

274
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,290
It's one damn crazy world out
there these days.

275
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,920
(crashing noise)

276
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,420
- You think I'm sellin'?

277
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,990
This is my place.

278
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,320
God damnit!

279
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,050
(screams)

280
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,750
- Put that bat down.

281
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,520
- Earl. - Earl, you put that
bat down

282
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,690
or I'm dropping you where you
stand.

283
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,620
(glass shattering)

284
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,390
- Let's just all calm down
now.

285
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,390
Earl, you drive away your
customers.

286
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,950
- You back down or you're
goin' down.

287
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,120
- You better get your son's
gun out of my face

288
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,020
this is my place.

289
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,590
I ain't fuckin' around.

290
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,550
- Put the gun down, Bobby.

291
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,590
I said put the gun down.

292
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,590
Now.

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,750
Earl.

294
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,950
My thickheaded, jackass son's
not listenin' to me.

295
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,690
What I'm gonna do

296
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,890
is walk over there

297
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,550
and take his gun away.

298
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,350
Don't want you puttin' that
bat

299
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,390
upside my head now.

300
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,090
- Do it, Bob.

301
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,690
Do it.

302
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,890
- Bobby.

303
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,120
Give me the gun.

304
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,190
- Please put the bat down,
Sir.

305
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,050
- Deputy, you don't give me
that gun

306
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,350
you can give me your badge.

307
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,550
- There you are, Earl.

308
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,250
You're callin' the shots now.

309
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:08,950
- Get him out of here, Bob.

310
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,350
- Mr. Yates would like you to
leave his diner.

311
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,690
- What are you lookin' at?

312
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,720
- You think maybe that bat
could use a rest?

313
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,450
Let me get you a cup of
coffee.

314
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,590
You and me and Lutie will
talk.

315
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,120
- Now you know why he doesn't
need a gun.

316
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,620
(crickets chirping)

317
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,450
(soft country music)

318
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,790
(dog barking)

319
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,550
- I'm sorry.

320
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,890
Your mom

321
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,350
she had such nice things.

322
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,990
- Maybe don't tell 'em in
shorts.

323
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,390
That's real nice.

324
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,420
You being here.

325
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,520
- Sorry I'm not more help but
these gloves are so big.

326
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,690
Do you smell that?

327
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,520
- Yeah, somethin'.

328
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,290
- Let's check it out.

329
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,620
Oh my God.

330
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,920
It's so sad.

331
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,390
What happened?

332
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,090
- Must have got separated
from his mom.

333
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,790
Then the coyotes got to him.

334
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,650
- Poor baby.

335
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,620
- Excuse me.

336
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,950
I'm gonna burn it in the
furnace.

337
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,490
- Burn it?

338
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,520
Shouldn't we have buried it?

339
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
- Dogs would have just come
and dug it up.

340
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,520
- Wow, I love Paris by night.

341
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,520
- Sorry.

342
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,350
- You know.

343
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,290
There's nothing more romantic

344
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,920
than sharing a late night.

345
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,650
- Sydney?

346
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,420
- I lived there.

347
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,120
- Really?

348
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,620
What was it like?

349
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,050
- Well.

350
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,090
You know.

351
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,250
It's a strange thing but

352
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,590
it's a lot like Astonville.

353
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,990
I'm joking.

354
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,950
Paris.

355
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,750
Paris is breathtaking.

356
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
But I personally prefer this.

357
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,520
- Ma'am.

358
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,890
- I'll tell you all about it

359
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,950
when you let me take a look
at your place.

360
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,620
- Well, it's like I said.

361
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,550
I'm not so sure that I want
to sell right now.

362
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,490
- Now.

363
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,290
You don't want to sell

364
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,850
or your girlfriend doesn't
want you to sell?

365
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,220
What about your father?

366
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,290
- What about him?

367
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,650
- He loved that house very,
very much.

368
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:39,850
- So?

369
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,950
- You know it's a small town

370
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,890
and people talk.

371
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,150
From what I gather.

372
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,520
Your father loved that house

373
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,320
more than just about anything.

374
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,750
(dramatic music)

375
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,920
- I really should be going.

376
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,220
Well, that's just folks
talking about

377
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,290
things that they don't
understand.

378
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,820
- All the more reason to get
away.

379
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,720
Don't you think?

380
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,990
I'm staying at Tanner's Inn.

381
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,620
Not exactly The Savoy but.

382
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,250
I must admit.

383
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,820
I'm used to getting what I
want, Mr. Graham.

384
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,690
I am not a patient woman.

385
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,850
- Whoo!

386
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,190
God, it's beautiful here.

387
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,120
I could stay here forever

388
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,220
and never get tired of it.

389
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,050
Who's place is that?

390
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,320
- Opal and Arthur Del Ripple.

391
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,750
They're out of town for a
while.

392
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,520
Do me a favor.

393
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,050
Remind me that I gotta feed
their cat.

394
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,190
- Sure.

395
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,490
- So anyway

396
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,650
tell me more about Corpus
Christi.

397
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,020
- Yeah, well that's where I'm
from originally, you know?

398
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,190
Texas.

399
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,890
Then Milwaukee.

400
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,890
(rifle blast)

401
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,620
So what was that?

402
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,820
- Almost dinner.

403
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,420
- Shotgun worse than that.

404
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,650
It's a tough shot though.

405
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,690
- Well I just like to try my
luck.

406
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,920
- There's some to the left of
the oak.

407
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,290
- That's a tough shot.

408
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,250
- Yeah, right flank.

409
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,450
(rifle blast)

410
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,920
Steady hand.

411
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,890
Crazy heart.

412
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,420
Runs in my family.

413
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,950
("The Great Divide" by David
Allan Morgan)

414
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,850
Do you think you could give
me a massage?

415
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,550
(fire crackling)

416
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,820
(moaning)

417
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,350
You okay?

418
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,650
- Yeah.

419
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,750
- That's okay.

420
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,520
(erotic music)

421
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,820
What's this?

422
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,790
- Scar.

423
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,720
- From what?

424
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,650
- Football.

425
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,520
(birds chirping)

426
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,490
- Shit.

427
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,550
I was patented.

428
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,320
- You're so cute.

429
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,950
- [Travis] My parents didn't
want me.

430
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,290
- You didn't.

431
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,220
I thought I was a bad kid too.

432
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,620
My Uncle Buddy.

433
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
My brother insisted my Mom
told me

434
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,720
Families can be so screwed up.

435
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,320
That won't happen to us.

436
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,290
'Cause we're the best of our
marrow

437
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,590
(car horn honking)

438
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,590
- Hi.

439
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,720
I was on my way to the
property down the road

440
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,950
and I thought I'd stop by and
say howdy.

441
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:24,890
- Howdy.

442
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,720
Some car.

443
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,450
It's nice to see you.

444
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,820
- Is this a good time to look
around?

445
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,820
(suspenseful music)

446
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,820
- I really don't know.

447
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,950
- Tick tock, Mr. Graham.

448
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,750
Bye.

449
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,350
(car engine starting)

450
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,850
(sneezing)

451
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,490
- Hi cutie pie.

452
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,790
- Hi.

453
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,020
- I found this under the gun
case.

454
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,750
What's it for?

455
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,050
- I don't know.

456
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,920
- You don't know?

457
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,620
(clock ticking)

458
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,790
(suspenseful music)

459
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,450
- Travis?

460
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,920
- Yeah.

461
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,120
- Hi, how are you?

462
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,920
- Good, how are you?

463
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,490
- I'm good.

464
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,720
You're handy with TVs aren't
you?

465
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,090
- Sure.

466
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,450
- Well, the one in my hotel
room

467
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,720
there's something wrong with
it

468
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,590
and nobody's come by to take
a look at it

469
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:28,990
and well

470
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,990
do you think you could spare
the time

471
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,050
just to have a quick look?

472
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,690
Please?

473
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,050
- Well, I really.

474
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,150
- Oh, it won't take too long.

475
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,890
Please Travis.

476
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,420
- Sure.

477
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,090
Loose cable

478
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,750
just like a food mixer.

479
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,950
- Really?

480
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,520
That's a coincidence.

481
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,620
I'd like to give you
something.

482
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,520
I wrote this.

483
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,790
I hold my hands so tightly
together

484
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,290
that they begin to sweat.

485
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,190
The skin cracks and peels

486
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,590
from the center of my bones.

487
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,650
Teeny

488
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,820
tiny

489
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,390
baby chickens.

490
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,120
Will not be your finger.

491
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,750
Stand

492
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,650
silhouette mans.

493
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,590
One of them is turned off.

494
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,690
And the other

495
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,490
the big fancy car.

496
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,950
No.

497
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,920
No, no.

498
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,450
It's okay.

499
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:44,990
It's love.

500
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,120
It's meant to have a sort of

501
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,790
ironic humor.

502
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,020
- I really should be going.

503
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,550
- No, no.

504
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,790
Come and sit down.

505
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,650
I have a little presentation.

506
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,020
- I don't understand.

507
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,420
Mr. Anton's on the island of
Corfu.

508
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,020
But

509
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,490
he called it be it's Greek
name.

510
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,250
Kerkyra.

511
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,620
I was only 19 years old.

512
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,650
He had to have been more than
twice that.

513
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,650
He told me many things.

514
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,850
Oh, oh,

515
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,720
this one.

516
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,520
This one is my favorite.

517
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,150
The world becomes miserable.

518
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,320
These light things.

519
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,690
Sit down.

520
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,450
I took my birth control pill.

521
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,850
Let's go to bed.

522
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,590
Now where do you think I got
that one?

523
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,420
- I don't know.

524
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,450
- Lost.

525
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,650
Because I was magnet.

526
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,890
You see.

527
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,820
I lied to you just now.

528
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,820
It wasn't meant at all.

529
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,650
It was a purposefully sunny
Australian day.

530
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,750
My dear Smith Alec.

531
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,620
- I'm sorry.

532
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,990
(seductive music)

533
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,350
We'll have to do something
about all of this.

534
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,450
Shh.

535
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,350
(water running)

536
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,620
(erotic music)

537
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,820
- What are you doing?

538
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,350
- Incense.

539
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,250
(pounding noise)

540
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,350
- How new is the hair cut?

541
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,550
- A hair cut.

542
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,450
- Nice.

543
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,190
- Thanks.

544
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,750
This the bank robbers?

545
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,350
- Yeah, they robbed the bank

546
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,590
out at Two Pines this morning.

547
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,490
The teller got a look at the
two inside. But not the
driver.

548
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,220
Where were you this morning?

549
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,790
- I'll see you later, Bobby.

550
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,320
- Travis.

551
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,320
- Where?

552
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,950
Where is it?

553
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,490
- [Travis] Kelly?

554
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:36,920
- Yeah?

555
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,290
- What are you doing?

556
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,590
- I'm opening up the room.

557
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,590
It's a little stuffy in here.

558
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,890
- That's not a very good idea.

559
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,690
You shouldn't be doing that.

560
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,720
This was my father's room

561
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,650
and no one's supposed to be
in here.

562
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,190
- Oh, come on.

563
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,690
I'm not hurtin' nothin'.

564
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,350
What's with the hairdo?

565
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,050
It's so short.

566
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,620
And there's no stuff in it.

567
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,790
(water running)

568
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,250
- Turn around.

569
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:12,890
Soap.

570
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,750
What is this, now?

571
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,890
What's Kiki?

572
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,750
- Me.

573
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,720
Kelly.

574
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,550
Kiki, you know.

575
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,790
My sister

576
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,520
my sister did that.

577
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,890
- Did he call you that?

578
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,120
- No.

579
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,950
Not even in front of the
wrong.

580
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,090
- Okay.

581
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,650
What about.

582
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,690
- That would be.

583
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,650
(country music)

584
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,420
Howdy.

585
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,650
- Hi Travis.

586
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,620
I closed my London deal and I

587
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,620
I had nobody to celebrate
with.

588
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:20,990
So I.

589
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,050
- So we're celebratin'.

590
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,050
And I'm doin' a little
cleanin'

591
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,920
around the house.

592
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,350
- Aren't you gonna
congratulate me?

593
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,790
- Congratulations.

594
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,890
- I congratulated you already.

595
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,750
- Thank you.

596
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,250
Thank you, both.

597
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,190
- I guess now you can

598
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,290
get that look at my place

599
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,750
that you've been meain' to.

600
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,590
- No, no.

601
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,590
No.

602
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,990
- I didn't look.

603
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:49,820
- She didn't.

604
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,090
That's true.

605
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:51,620
She did not look.

606
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,990
I said no

607
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,950
talking about that.

608
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,450
- That's right.

609
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,420
Absolutely

610
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:03,720
no business.

611
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,990
- [Travis] So slow.

612
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,450
- No, you take the cross.

613
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,290
(screaming)

614
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,350
(laughing)

615
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,720
(clock ticking)

616
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,590
Come on.

617
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,650
Come on.

618
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,120
You didn't pay your bill you.

619
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
- Stay here.

620
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,920
I'll be right back.

621
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,650
- [Jolene] We're scared.

622
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,990
Travis it's dark

623
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,790
and there's fleas and mice.

624
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,850
- Open.

625
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:44,990
Beer or whiskey.

626
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,320
- Beer.

627
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,950
And whiskey!

628
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,750
- Okay.

629
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,550
(rock music)

630
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,990
- Thank you.

631
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,520
Thank you.

632
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,390
- Drinks.

633
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,920
Music.

634
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,120
Wait.

635
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,150
Wait no.

636
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,890
Let me get my.

637
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,120
What do you guys wanna listen
to?

638
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,650
I'm looking at country.

639
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,890
(dramatic music)

640
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,190
- Don't.

641
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,920
That's enough.

642
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,750
- I told you what hand with
the bet.

643
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,850
Now look at you.

644
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,790
Two women in your house

645
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,550
What are you gonna do about
us?

646
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,690
- Tell her yourself.

647
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,220
Please don't.

648
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,750
(erotic music)

649
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,320
- What?

650
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,820
I'll tell you when.

651
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,720
You don't need to be watching.

652
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,720
I guarantee he wishes he were
you.

653
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,290
Hello.

654
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,450
- Good morning.

655
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,220
Where's Jolene?

656
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,420
- She got up early.

657
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,650
And just denied her.

658
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,350
- What about you?

659
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,620
- No one forces me to do
things I don't wanna do.

660
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,020
Nice.

661
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,850
Almost natural.

662
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,320
I was thinkin'.

663
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,920
As long as Jolene's in town

664
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,450
maybe she could stay here.

665
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,550
It's lonely in a motel.

666
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,750
- You serious?

667
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,620
- Why not?

668
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,290
I mean

669
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,320
I don't think it will last
night.

670
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,450
It be fun to have her.

671
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,590
It be like our own family.

672
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,320
- Morning, Travis.

673
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,850
- Morning.

674
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,690
- Morning, Travis.

675
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:56,990
- Morning.

676
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,820
- Usual?

677
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,490
- Yes please.

678
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,990
- [Robber] Alright, everybody.

679
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,020
Quiet.

680
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,620
Money.

681
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:11,950
Nobody gets dead.

682
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,050
- Andrew.

683
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,150
- [Robber] On the floor, big
boy.

684
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,320
I said get down, lard ass.

685
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,320
- No heroes here.

686
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,250
Isn't that right, Andrew?

687
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,250
- [Robber] You.

688
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,320
Open that drawer.

689
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,450
Give me the money.

690
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,020
- Cops.

691
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,890
Is comin'.

692
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,420
Let's go.

693
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,050
- [Robber] Get out of my
fuckin' way.

694
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:39,650
- Hey.

695
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,120
Bobby!

696
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,920
(gun shots fired)

697
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,050
- Daddy!

698
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,850
Jesus Christ!

699
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,290
No, daddy!

700
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,350
(gun shots fired)

701
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,150
Freeze you son of a bitch.

702
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,950
(gun shots fired)

703
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,320
(dramatic music)

704
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,450
Get an ambulance now.

705
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,490
Call Sheriff Knight in Hurley.

706
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,120
Tell him to set up roadblocks.

707
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,820
Everything's he got.

708
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,450
Go!

709
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,450
(engine revving)

710
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,420
- [Robber] Fuck you!

711
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,590
We're stayin' here.

712
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,350
Bullshit!

713
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,650
(soft rock music)

714
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,220
(Kelly screaming)

715
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,050
Don't fight me.

716
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,320
Don't fight me, baby.

717
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,690
Well.

718
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,320
Lookee here.

719
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,690
Daddy's home.

720
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,620
Just in time.

721
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,290
'Cause I'm fixin' to fuck her.

722
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:05,820
- Drop it.

723
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,990
- No, you son of a bitch.

724
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,490
You drop it.

725
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,050
This sweet little bitch.

726
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,490
She's gonna be one big fat
greasy stain on your carpet.

727
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,590
Comprende?

728
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,350
- Okay.

729
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,490
- What's a matter, boy?

730
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,920
You ain't got no balls.

731
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,990
(intense music)

732
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,690
You done fucked up, boy.

733
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,050
Now

734
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,690
I'm gonna cut your dick off.

735
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,450
And then I'm gonna make you
eat it, boy.

736
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,920
(gun shots fired)

737
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,520
- Kelly, don't!

738
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,390
- Fuck you!

739
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,020
(crickets chirping)

740
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,220
(dog barking)

741
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,690
They were sure mad when they
got here.

742
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,890
- They?

743
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,350
- There was a girl.

744
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,590
Think she was drivin'.

745
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,050
She ran off down across the
road.

746
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,350
I don't know what they were
doin'

747
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,290
but they were arguin' pretty
bad.

748
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,120
- You alright?

749
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,550
You Okay?

750
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,550
You don't feel bad or sad or
nothin'?

751
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,020
- No.

752
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,550
I'm okay.

753
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,320
I shouldn't feel bad.

754
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,150
Tried to hurt me

755
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,890
now he's.

756
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:53,420
His fault he's.

757
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,820
- I gotta call Bobby Jr.

758
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,150
- No.

759
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,250
- Yes. I saw we should trust
him

760
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,350
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

761
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,320
- Baby, think about what just
happened here.

762
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,290
I gotta call Bobby Jr.

763
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,150
He can take care of all of
this.

764
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,090
- No.

765
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,820
It's over.

766
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,990
We don't have to call. We
don't have to call anybody.

767
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,050
- Calm down, it's gonna be
okay

768
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,550
if I just call Bobby Jr,
alright?

769
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,250
Please?

770
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:15,850
- No!

771
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,850
(crying)

772
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,120
We.

773
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,750
We don't

774
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,390
Don't have to call.

775
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,420
It's you and me, baby.

776
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,250
We can keep this between us.

777
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,020
- His partner's dead too.

778
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,650
I found him in their car.

779
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,820
I really should go and take
care of it.

780
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,390
- When I'm done.

781
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,820
- Ah!

782
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,420
Shit.

783
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,790
- I haven't told anyone this
before.

784
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,890
Three years ago this man

785
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,050
my neighbor

786
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,920
came in to borrow some sugar.

787
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,420
So he said.

788
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,650
When I went to the kitchen to
get it.

789
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,090
Grabbed me by the hair

790
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,720
and bent me over the kitchen
table.

791
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:22,990
I couldn't.

792
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,390
He lifted my dress

793
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,590
and cut off my underwear with
his pocket knife.

794
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,620
Said he'd cut me too if I
move.

795
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,920
I heard his zipper.

796
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,290
Then he got on top of me.

797
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,750
And I reached and I clawed on
that table.

798
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,390
Then he dropped his knife.

799
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,250
I grabbed it.

800
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,850
He slapped me in the head

801
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,790
and I cut his arm.

802
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,990
He fell forward on top of me
on the floor

803
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,220
and I kept stickin' on him

804
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,550
over and over and over.

805
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:06,550
Then he died.

806
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,390
They say I was a bad girl
from a bad family anyways

807
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,290
so I must of asked for it.

808
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,450
And he gave his 10% to the
church.

809
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,690
And that makes good.

810
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,750
Daddy didn't believe me
either.

811
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,450
So I ran.

812
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,320
They were gonna stuff me in
this jail with kids

813
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,650
with psychiatrists but

814
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,550
my sister took me away.

815
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:37,490
She said

816
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,520
nobody fucks with family.

817
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Cops around here will think

818
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
I asked for it again.

819
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,990
Know what I mean?

820
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,850
- Nobody has to know about
what happened here tonight.

821
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,890
Alright, you're next, partner.

822
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:20,020
(car engine humming)

823
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,620
Shit.

824
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,320
- Hi.

825
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,490
What are you doing?

826
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,450
- Just fixing some things.

827
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:35,890
- What?

828
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,050
- Just things.

829
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:39,690
- Well.

830
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,620
Hurry up and come inside
please.

831
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,420
I think she's lying to you.

832
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:50,490
Okay?

833
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,950
How long?

834
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,920
- Two minutes.

835
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,620
I'll see you inside.

836
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:54,950
- Alright.

837
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,650
Don't be long.

838
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,720
("Catch My Soul If You Dare"
by Stella)

839
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,250
Oh, I'm so sorry.

840
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:45,790
I forgot.

841
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,620
Let me make it better.

842
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,250
Oh.

843
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,220
- Ow!

844
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:02,720
- Oh, Travis.

845
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,520
You need to take a shower.

846
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:05,950
Bad.

847
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,820
Why don't you give us a rest.

848
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,420
Okay?

849
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,490
(water running)

850
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,720
- Didn't take much convincin'.

851
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,250
Said the motel beds aren't as
comfortable as ours.

852
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,920
- Company is better too.

853
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,650
Hi.

854
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,490
- So, now okay?

855
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,550
- Sure.

856
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:08,520
- Good.

857
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,350
Left.

858
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,950
First second.

859
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:11,550
Right.

860
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,390
- I'll fine it.

861
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,350
- Four deaths have been
attributed to them.

862
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,920
As well as the theft of
what's believed to be

863
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,120
over $200,000 dollars.

864
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,790
In other robbery related news.

865
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,250
Services for Sheriff Robert
Brody

866
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,890
will be held this Saturday

867
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:32,120
at the Newport Church in
Astonville.

868
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,990
The Kiwanis Club as acting
ushers.

869
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,650
- I

870
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,290
I know.

871
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:42,850
- Know what?

872
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,120
- It's okay.

873
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,490
Kelly, she told me.

874
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,520
You did the right thing,
Travis.

875
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,220
No.

876
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,420
It's best for everyone this
way.

877
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:57,950
Trust me.

878
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:03,220
So, um.

879
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,490
You didn't like

880
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,450
think of calling the bank or
anything

881
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:08,890
did you?

882
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:11,990
- No.

883
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:14,720
Just keep on.

884
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:17,690
- Have you looked through it
yet?

885
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,190
No?

886
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,790
- No.

887
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,450
No.

888
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,090
Can't be right.

889
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:32,650
There's only $7,000 dollars
here.

890
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,420
- What?

891
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,750
- That's it. Just the money
from the bank in town.

892
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,990
- Where's the rest from the
other robberies?

893
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:39,720
- I don't know.

894
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,790
- They probably stashed it
after each hit, you know?

895
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,320
In case they got caught and
had to leave.

896
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,920
I can't believe all this
stuff.

897
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:50,390
- What?

898
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:52,920
- Nothing.

899
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,120
I mean.

900
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,120
Just the plans for their next
job.

901
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,090
Maps.

902
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,520
Timed schedule.

903
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,620
They were gonna hit the bank
up in Hurley.

904
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:04,020
- So?

905
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,920
- So?

906
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,090
I was just thinking if

907
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:08,690
maybe

908
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,850
maybe

909
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,550
we could do

910
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,790
what they were planning to do.

911
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,120
And then dump the car.

912
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,420
I mean

913
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,690
no one would be any the wiser.

914
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,090
- What?

915
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,820
(dramatic music)

916
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,850
- You're not serious.

917
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,950
(laughing)

918
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:28,490
- Why not?

919
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,790
- 'Cause we're not bank
robbers.

920
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,290
That's why not.

921
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,620
- I'm telling you something,
Travis Graham.

922
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,590
I've been a million different
things

923
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,420
and a million different
places.

924
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,950
I've experienced things
you've never even dreamed of.

925
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,790
And I didn't get to those
experiences

926
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,690
by playing it safe.

927
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,520
- Wait a minute.

928
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,850
- Oh, come on, Travis.

929
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,320
Live for once.

930
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,190
- What if we get caught?

931
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,550
- We won't get caught.

932
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:06,450
This is the perfect
opportunity.

933
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,520
The real robbers are dead,
right?

934
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,190
And we're the only ones that
know that.

935
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,890
We've got their car.

936
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,620
And we have alibis for the
other robberies.

937
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,520
All we have to do is get away
clean.

938
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,450
What a rush.

939
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,620
God, just taste it.

940
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,220
- Let's do it.

941
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,890
- Not you.

942
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,950
- Why not me?

943
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,250
I'm a good driver.

944
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,490
- Travis, it says right here

945
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,290
that after shift change

946
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,950
there's only two tellers and
one guard.

947
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,020
The manager's at lunch.

948
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,290
So, we're in and out clean.

949
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,020
- Didn't you ever play cops
and robbers

950
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,250
when you were a kid?

951
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,250
Didn't you?

952
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,090
- Yes.

953
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,220
- Okay.

954
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,020
- I'll wait.

955
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,690
Let me guess.

956
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,920
Bobby Jr played the cop.

957
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,190
And you played the robber.

958
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,750
Am I right?

959
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:12,250
- Yes.

960
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,790
- Bobby Jr. announces you
Travis.

961
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,250
First time I met him.

962
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,820
That day in the diner.

963
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,990
When he told me that you
might wanna sell some
property.

964
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,090
He made

965
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,620
a complete mockery of you.

966
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,250
Now

967
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,490
I'd have thought

968
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,450
you might wanna turn the
tables for once.

969
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,120
- You have no reason to use
this.

970
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:44,750
- Okay.

971
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,820
Fine.

972
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,020
I mean we're gonna do it.

973
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,550
With or without you.

974
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,620
It be a lot easier with you
but.

975
01:06:59,120 --> 01:06:59,620
Come on, Kelly.

976
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,020
(laughing)

977
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,520
We'll do it.

978
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,350
- I just need a minute to
think.

979
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,190
- What you got to think about?

980
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,420
Come on.

981
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,720
It be a good story for our
grandkids

982
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,350
God dangit!

983
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,390
Rob the bank!

984
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:15,320
Rob the bank!

985
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:15,990
Rob the bank!

986
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:21,190
(clock ticking)

987
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,920
- This is crazy.

988
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,890
(rock music)

989
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,650
- [Kelly] Come on!

990
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:40,150
- Those are different till
right?

991
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,750
- Yep.

992
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,620
- When do I get a gun? - You
don't get one.

993
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,320
- I'm a better shot than you.

994
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,590
- You won't need one.

995
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,720
Don't need to be a robber to
think that.

996
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,950
- Just in case, okay? - I
don't want this one.

997
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,690
You take it.

998
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,320
- Here.

999
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,650
- Take it, Travis.

1000
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,590
- I'm so wet right now.

1001
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:21,790
- Ready?

1002
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:22,790
- In and out.

1003
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,520
Clean and fast, right?

1004
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,550
- Right.

1005
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:26,220
- Right.

1006
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,720
- Right?

1007
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:27,990
- Right, yes.

1008
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,290
- Let's do this.

1009
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,890
(heavy country music)

1010
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,790
- [Travis] Quiet!

1011
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,190
Money.

1012
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,090
No one gets dead.

1013
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,650
Everybody on the floor now.

1014
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,520
I said get down on the God
damn floor.

1015
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,990
Alright, Macho Man, get down
there.

1016
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,950
Where the hell is the guard?

1017
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,550
- Don't be afraid, darlin'.

1018
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,650
Be nice and you'll be home in
time for supper.

1019
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,750
Fill her up.

1020
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,820
- Get up.

1021
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,290
Where's the guard?

1022
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:27,350
Get out of there.

1023
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,620
Where the hell is the fucking
guard?

1024
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,390
- Hurry up.

1025
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,320
Come on, let's go.

1026
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,150
- He's at lunch.

1027
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:36,220
- Shut up.

1028
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,050
- Come on, come on.

1029
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:38,690
- Shit.

1030
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:45,290
- Fill her up.

1031
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,220
- Please, for the Jesus of
God, hurry.

1032
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,190
- Hurry!

1033
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,190
Let's go.

1034
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,820
Come on, come on.

1035
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,550
Fill a bag.

1036
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,350
Come on.

1037
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,990
Fill her up.

1038
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,250
- Freeze!

1039
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,550
- Make your choice, Mister.

1040
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,890
I said make your choice.

1041
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,320
- No!

1042
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,520
(shots fired)

1043
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,850
- Fuck me!

1044
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,690
Come on, let's get out of
here.

1045
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,420
Piece of shit.

1046
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,750
- Come on, Travis.

1047
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,950
- Start the car, Kelly.

1048
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,190
I think I just pointed though.

1049
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,820
Fucking old man shouldn't
have tested me.

1050
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,950
- Did you kill him?

1051
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,620
- I hope not.

1052
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:05,790
- Are you okay?

1053
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,050
- No, I gotta drive.

1054
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,220
(shouting)

1055
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,320
- Let's get us a son of a
bitch.

1056
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,420
- What you do, man?

1057
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,150
(police siren wailing)

1058
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:33,320
- Shit!

1059
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,320
(screams)

1060
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:40,290
- Oh, my God!

1061
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:43,690
- Hold on.

1062
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,950
I'm gonna blow his tires.

1063
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:50,250
- No, what are you, Travis?

1064
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:50,790
- Come on.

1065
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,120
- When you gonna shoot his
tires?

1066
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,220
- Throw the bag.

1067
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,590
- What the fuck are you doing?

1068
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,420
- Knock it off.

1069
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,420
- Give us a kiss for this.

1070
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,850
(shouting)

1071
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,320
Cops can't drive.

1072
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,290
Let's go.

1073
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:45,950
I wanna fuck.

1074
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,620
- Stop it.

1075
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,250
Stop it.

1076
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,050
- I'm fucking you so hard.

1077
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:56,950
- Travis, don't.

1078
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,490
- You want it.

1079
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,420
- No.

1080
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,590
Stop it, you asshole.

1081
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,290
- Shut up.

1082
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:04,120
- Let me go.

1083
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,650
- Shut up.

1084
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,290
You want it.

1085
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,450
I know you want it.

1086
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:12,550
Bitch.

1087
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:13,820
Shut up.

1088
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,450
Shut up.

1089
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,490
I'm fucking done this before.

1090
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,320
Shut up.

1091
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:18,990
Just shut up.

1092
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,320
- Baby.

1093
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,190
You okay?

1094
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,090
- Oh, God.

1095
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:27,990
He's gone crazy.

1096
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,420
- Who the fuck do you think
you are?

1097
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:43,920
- [Newscaster] Story of the
bank robbers

1098
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,190
continues to grow each day.

1099
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:46,850
Oddly enough

1100
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,320
the suspects dumped a
thousand dollars worth of
money

1101
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,690
by throwing it at the squad
car.

1102
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,290
Officer Mike Thorton who had
spotted

1103
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,850
and was following the
suspects.

1104
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,620
(police sirens wailing)

1105
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,390
- Sorry to wake you, Travis.

1106
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,720
- No problem.

1107
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
What's up?

1108
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,990
- Another robbery.

1109
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:19,820
Guard got shot.

1110
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,490
- Really?

1111
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,720
- Yeah.

1112
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,020
Strange you know.

1113
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,790
The roads around Hurley got
closed off pretty quick.

1114
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,420
They're definitely still in
the area though.

1115
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,250
You haven't seen or heard
anything have you?

1116
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,490
- No.

1117
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,720
- Those girls with you here?

1118
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,220
Jolene and

1119
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:36,850
- [Travis] Kelly.

1120
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:37,490
- Kelly.

1121
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,220
Yeah.

1122
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,490
I'm gonna need to talk to
them.

1123
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:42,920
- Sure.

1124
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,220
- [Bobby] Were they around
here today?

1125
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:46,850
- Working with me all day.

1126
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,290
Why?

1127
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,850
- Nothing, it's just.

1128
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,590
The witness from the robbery

1129
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,020
out in Two Pines said that was

1130
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,790
a woman in the gang of three.

1131
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,450
What do you know about this
Jolene any way?

1132
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,190
This real estate lady.

1133
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:03,690
- She's alright.

1134
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,250
Look, um

1135
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,550
what difference does it make?

1136
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,950
I mean I just got through
telling you

1137
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:14,120
that she was working with me
here all day.

1138
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,750
- Right.

1139
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,320
Right.

1140
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,490
- Bobby?

1141
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:32,890
- I miss him, Travis.

1142
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,420
I miss him.

1143
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,250
- Your daddy was a

1144
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,250
a good man.

1145
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,250
And a good sheriff too.

1146
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,790
- I just want to do him proud.

1147
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,290
You know, I just wanna.

1148
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,520
Damnit.

1149
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,350
How do you get rid of this
feeling, Travis?

1150
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,350
- Things were different

1151
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:58,950
between me and my father.

1152
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:03,790
- Right.

1153
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:13,690
You be careful, Travis.

1154
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:14,950
These people don't seem to
think too much about killin'.

1155
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,190
- Go home and get some sleep,
Bobby.

1156
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:19,990
I'll call you if I hear
anything.

1157
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:22,890
- Thanks, Travis.

1158
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:45,890
- Morning.

1159
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:46,420
- Morning.

1160
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:53,720
- I missed you last night.

1161
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,590
Sorry.

1162
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:08,790
You know about.

1163
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:11,650
- Whatever.

1164
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,690
- What are you doing?

1165
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:33,220
- You know

1166
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:34,890
you hurt her.

1167
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:37,890
Did you hear me, Travis?

1168
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,890
I said you hurt her.

1169
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,990
- [Travis] Come on, Jolene.

1170
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,320
What am I suppose to do?

1171
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,750
I told her I was sorry.

1172
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,620
- Bobby Jr's here.

1173
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,190
(dramatic music)

1174
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:51,820
- Shit.

1175
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,550
What's up?

1176
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,420
- We're covering the area.

1177
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,450
We narrowed it down to your
property

1178
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:07,120
and the Salisbury's just
north.

1179
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,220
Down to James parcel in the
west.

1180
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,650
And the Del Ripple place
across the way.

1181
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,920
- Wow, you think they're
still around?

1182
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,250
- Yeah, we're pretty sure.

1183
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,790
- Bulldog Murphy saw a black
car

1184
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,690
travelin' the harvest trail
just a couple miles

1185
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,220
from where Sheriff Knight's
deputy

1186
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,850
got run off the road.

1187
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,250
- No shit.

1188
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,450
- Yeah, they're here.

1189
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,850
They're hiding out somewhere.

1190
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:29,450
Listen, Travis.

1191
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:29,920
I'm gonna need you to take me
around your place.

1192
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,320
Out to the lake.

1193
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,290
Your granddaddy's moonshine
shack.

1194
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:34,550
Any place that you think they
might be hidin'.

1195
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:36,890
- No problem.

1196
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,020
Can you hold on just a second?

1197
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,290
- Yeah.

1198
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:42,950
I'll be in the truck.

1199
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:43,490
Hurry up.

1200
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,950
- He wants to see the back
point.

1201
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:57,850
He might want to come in here
and look around.

1202
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:58,750
So hide everything.

1203
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,390
- Wait.

1204
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,590
Just in case.

1205
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,920
Good luck.

1206
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:36,050
- [Travis] How's the guard
from the bank in Hurley?

1207
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,190
- Dead.

1208
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:41,690
He lost too much blood.

1209
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:47,650
You're awful quiet, Travis.

1210
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,420
Something you want to tell me?

1211
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,320
- Nope.

1212
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:54,750
- You sure?

1213
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,490
- Yep.

1214
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,350
- Come on, you did it. Didn't
you, Travis?

1215
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:08,820
- Did what?

1216
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,850
- You doin' one of those
girls, or what?

1217
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:19,590
- Well, you do what you can?

1218
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,790
- What you get?

1219
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:23,850
You get a little pussy

1220
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,450
you turn into an asshole.

1221
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,320
- I guess it's my turn now.

1222
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,050
You jealous?

1223
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:32,590
- Jealous?

1224
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,620
Hey

1225
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,220
look.

1226
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,350
There.

1227
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,450
(hard country music)

1228
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:43,290
Red.

1229
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,720
Red I got 'em.

1230
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,850
I'm in pursuit of the black
lemon.

1231
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:47,850
Heading around the lake

1232
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,750
to the Graham property.

1233
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,150
Heading north.

1234
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:52,820
(police sires wailing)

1235
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:10,950
Get out.

1236
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,120
- What are you doing out here?

1237
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,290
- Well, you said to hide
everything.

1238
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,250
- That didn't mean to move
the car.

1239
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:35,350
- Well, I thought you guys
were looking around

1240
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,590
on the other side of the lake.

1241
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,490
You almost got us caught.

1242
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:42,990
You almost fucked up
everything.

1243
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:52,690
Idiot.

1244
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,390
- What you think we should
have done

1245
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,420
left in the barn 'til these
hillbilly cops

1246
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,750
done and looked there?

1247
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,350
- [Red] Repeat.

1248
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:16,990
Robbery suspects drivin' down
by Mortimer.

1249
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,550
- Roger that. Red, we got 'em
pinned down

1250
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,720
at Travis's and Del Ripple
place.

1251
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,990
I'm sure of it.

1252
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,120
I'm gonna double check
Travis's.

1253
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,950
You take the Del Ripples.

1254
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:23,550
Over.

1255
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,550
- Jolene.

1256
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:28,450
Come out now. I got rid of
Bobby Jr.

1257
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,850
Jolene?

1258
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,650
(dramatic music)

1259
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,820
Estimated value $230,000
dollars.

1260
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,890
Samuel Graham died.

1261
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,950
Survived by only living
relative, his son, Travis.

1262
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:01,650
Kelly!

1263
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,350
- What?

1264
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:09,520
- Sweetheart.

1265
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
Do you know anything about
this?

1266
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:14,990
- About what?

1267
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,590
- Where's Jolene?

1268
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,490
- I don't know.

1269
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,550
- What do you mean you don't
know?

1270
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:08,650
You planned this all along,
didn't you?

1271
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,450
(screams)

1272
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,450
(grunting)

1273
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,420
(gun shot fired)

1274
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,020
She was trying to rob me.

1275
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,890
But I caught her.

1276
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,520
Where is it?

1277
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:52,190
Why didn't you just steal it

1278
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,290
the first night you were
here, huh?

1279
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,620
Now where's the fun in that?

1280
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:04,950
Oh.

1281
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,250
I can't.

1282
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,690
(groaning)

1283
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,920
Just shoot this bat with that
brick.

1284
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:22,490
- Fuck you!

1285
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:25,690
You see

1286
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:26,920
around here

1287
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,290
folks will figure

1288
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,690
I'd be in my right.

1289
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:35,450
I could kill where you lay
right now.

1290
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,950
Put that gun away, Kelly.

1291
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:40,150
Did you hear me, sweetheart?

1292
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:41,920
I said you can put that gun
away.

1293
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,450
(police sirens wailing)

1294
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:53,250
How could you do that to you?

1295
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,590
- What?

1296
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,250
- Jesus.

1297
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,550
I told you.

1298
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:04,220
She had nothin' to do with
those other robberies.

1299
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:04,820
- Then you're the driver.

1300
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:13,990
- [Red] We got 'em, Bobby.
Over at the Del Ripple place.

1301
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:15,520
One suspect.

1302
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,920
ID'd as a Caucasian female
driver.

1303
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,690
We need some layin' down on
the robbery.

1304
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:21,320
Get over here. - The bank job
in Hurley.

1305
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,050
That was her idea.

1306
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:23,990
That was your idea.

1307
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:27,920
- It was just for kicks.

1308
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,150
Shoot.

1309
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:33,390
You practically came in your
pants.

1310
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:34,850
- You were the real fuck.

1311
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,350
- Do it, Kelly.

1312
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,250
- Put the gun down, Kelly.

1313
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,620
Just put the gun down.

1314
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,720
Put the gun down, sweetie.

1315
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:02,050
- Who's gun is that?

1316
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:04,290
Who's fucking gun is that?

1317
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:06,750
- The robber's she killed!

1318
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,490
- That's right.

1319
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:09,920
You little lucky chump.

1320
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:13,620
You were about to kill me.

1321
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,850
With a bullet in your head.

1322
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:19,390
For piece of plastic valium.

1323
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,990
He's coming back to the one
that killed his daddy.

1324
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,490
And the guard in Hurley.

1325
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,450
Now.

1326
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,890
As far as I know.

1327
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:32,490
Kelly and I aren't suspects
in those murders.

1328
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:37,290
If you catch my drift.

1329
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:40,950
I'm tired.

1330
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,220
Just shoot him, Kiki.

1331
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:48,520
- Kiki?

1332
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,620
- Nobody fucks with family.

1333
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:06,690
(gun shot fired)

1334
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,950
(melancholy music)

1335
01:29:59,450 --> 01:29:59,890
- Here.

1336
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:03,220
- Sure you can travel?

1337
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,990
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1338
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:06,490
Just slow while drivin'.

1339
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,490
There you go.

1340
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,350
Always have to have a
souvenir.

1341
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:36,990
Let's go.
