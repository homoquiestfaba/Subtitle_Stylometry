1
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,896
You do well?

2
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:31,583
Yo

3
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:33,556
You ready to meet mama?

4
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:36,362
Look at me!

5
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,167
I don't bring just anyone to meet mama.

6
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,376
And you said you were ready to become one of us

7
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,491
I'm a Believer

8
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:52,961
Come in.

9
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,084
Cassidy made a good haul tonight, Mama.

10
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:27,963
The community appreciates all the

11
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,245
good work we do here.

12
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,760
Heh. Sure love the way they show their appreciation.

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,082
I'm sure Chief Check will appreciate it also.

14
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,022
Cassidy.

15
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,112
I heard about you.

16
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
Have you ever had your fortune read?

17
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:59,972
Well, you will enjoy it.

18
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
Yes Mama.

19
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Well, I can see here

20
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,598
Nice things.

21
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Money...

22
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Toys.

23
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:18,145
Hmm. But...

24
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:20,799
You are

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
lonely though.

26
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Sad. Despair.

27
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,295
Ahh.

28
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
But it seems you have found your true calling.

29
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,386
So.

30
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:39,721
Let's officially make you

31
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,722
part of the church.

32
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
No need to be nervous, my child.

33
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:50,148
(Snaps fingers)

34
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Is this... is this zombie powder, Mama?

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,659
Such colorful names they give to my

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
sacred blessings.

37
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
I'm sorry, Mama.

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,816
Now...

39
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
Take the cup in your hand

40
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
And just relax.

41
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Come on, Cassidy.

42
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,241
You said you wanted to.

43
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:27,242
Shh!

44
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,661
Maybe he's not ready yet to receive my offers.

45
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:32,662
No! No, Mama. I'm ready.

46
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,308
Now... Cassidy

47
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,967
Look.

48
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,561
Deeply into my eyes.

49
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:10,187
(Snickering)

50
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,189
(Voodoo noises)

51
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:19,072
Papa... Legba.

52
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:33,920
Up boy!

53
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,602
Now.

54
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,918
Cassidy, Everyone...  follow me

55
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:58,902
(Match striking)

56
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,831
Do you remember what I told you all

57
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,733
when we first started this?

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,584
I told you all

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
that we must be ready

60
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:26,912
to defend our faith

61
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,462
against the non-believers.

62
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:31,776
Well, now...

63
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:34,090
that time has come.

64
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:35,946
Cassidy!

65
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:39,607
You have brought sin into our sacred house.

66
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:40,608
No!

67
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:41,695
I don't...

68
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,453
Do not lie, boy.

69
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,470
It is time for your penance.

70
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,093
(Voodoo drumming)

71
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:14,714
(Bongo breakdown)

72
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:28,824
(Voodoo chanting)

73
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,207
You must cleanse this church.

74
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,928
You must cleanse it of all sin

75
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,327
before you can enter my kingdom.

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,884
You will soon, my son.

77
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:01,888
You will soon.

78
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:14,826
Hi. We're here to learn more

79
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,827
about the church

80
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,968
I don't think this is your kind of church.

81
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,576
Oh, you be surprised... um.

82
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:27,700
My family's actually from the West Indies,

83
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,703
from St Lucia.

84
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:29,904
And, uh...

85
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,324
You know, I grew up in a church like this.

86
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,120
Your family practices voodoo?

87
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,122
We did... Back on the island.

88
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,290
But, uh...

89
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:43,264
You know, we haven't been able to find a church here to practice...

90
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,235
So, when I heard about this one?

91
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:47,556
Thought I'd bring my wife and check it out.

92
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,134
Well, go on in.

93
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,614
Mama welcomes everyone.

94
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,185
(Door closes)

95
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,199
So you were part of a

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,650
church like this in St. Lucia?

97
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,662
Thought you were Puerto Rican?

98
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:14,646
Of course not.

99
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:18,410
But we have churches just like this in Puerto Rico.

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,233
Well I should know this stuff

101
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,914
about my husband after all.

102
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,505
(Gasps)

103
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:45,606
Hello.

104
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,056
I didn't see you there.

105
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:52,128
You have such pretty eyes.

106
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:56,736
Uh... I'm James and this is Patricia.

107
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,156
I'm Sammie.

108
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:06,207
Ok... uh, well.. you may know

109
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,362
a friend of mine then.

110
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,127
He's a member here.

111
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,581
You see? It's perfect.

112
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,664
You must have it and only ten dollars.

113
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:20,032
Can you help me out? Anything?

114
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:22,559
I don't know.

115
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,820
How about five dollars?

116
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:28,201
Shoot. If it's for the church? Why not?

117
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,278
Do you know where Mama is now?

118
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,433
Down those stairs.

119
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,627
Thank you.

120
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:50,753
Oh. Hey! And, uh...

121
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,153
Keep up the good work you do around here.

122
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,730
(Whispers) That was strange.

123
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,943
Yeah, let's just hope we

124
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,452
finally meet this Mama.

125
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:02,473
Make some progress.

126
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,291
Is this Mama's room?

127
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,272
It sure is.

128
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:35,040
(Knocking)

129
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,425
Hello, anyone there ?

130
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,717
We're looking for the high priestess...?

131
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:40,692
Mama... Dominique DeSilva?

132
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:43,514
Come in.

133
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,591
You're here for a reading, my darlings?

134
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,771
No. Actually, my wife and I would

135
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,972
like to join the church.

136
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,132
When I was young, my family...

137
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,213
My family went to one in St. Lucia.

138
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:08,862
So...

139
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:10,958
James.

140
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,836
Have you ever had the kanzo performed

141
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:14,977
any time in your life?

142
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah, yeah. I think so...

143
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,608
I'd have to ask my mother but

144
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,785
Yeah! Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

145
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:23,694
Pretty sure.

146
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,312
How did you hear about us?

147
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,131
My... my brother.

148
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,972
My brother was actually a member here

149
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,712
You may know him.

150
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,454
He does not look familiar.

151
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:45,440
Do you mind taking a closer look at that?

152
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,542
I am sure he is not part of our flock.

153
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:52,608
Funny... because

154
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,400
He mentioned this here church,

155
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,658
and you by name.

156
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,105
We welcome you into our sacred house

157
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,406
with open arms.

158
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,153
And you return our acceptance by

159
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:03,178
bearing false witness against this church?

160
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,179
I ask you now,

161
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,791
to leave. Immediately.

162
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:06,688
Look.

163
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,195
If we can't find him, we have no choice

164
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,719
but to go to the authorities.

165
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,088
Leave now and never come back.

166
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,890
This is your last chance.

167
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,208
Back up!

168
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,211
Back up.

169
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,302
Back up!

170
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,458
We don't want any trouble.

171
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:24,863
Okay.

172
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,610
Okay...

173
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,776
I will get him for you.

174
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,315
(Groans)

175
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:50,641
(Groans)

176
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,086
(Groans)

177
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,538
It's Cassidy.

178
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,032
We killed him.

179
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,046
James.

180
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
What are we going to tell the parents?

181
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:26,613
I don't know.

182
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:27,927
We can worry about that later.

183
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,571
We've just got to get out of here.

184
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:38,777
You shot me.

185
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,668
Why did you shoot me?

186
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,083
Kid ... You were out of control.

187
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,977
We didn't know what to do.

188
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,829
(Gunshots)

189
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:02,134
(Gunshots)

190
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:13,407
(Screams)

191
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,121
Looks like you found your friend.

192
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:20,356
(Laughing)

193
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:23,318
(Laughing)

194
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,319
You find this funny?!

195
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,463
It would be funny to die.

196
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:29,464
Ok, Sammie...?

197
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,095
You need help us get out of here

198
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,375
so we can call the police.

199
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:35,086
Can you do that?

200
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,776
How about my ten dollars now, huh?

201
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:42,912
Okay. Okay. Okay.

202
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,140
I'll give you twenty dollars

203
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,354
if you get us out of here.

204
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:48,439
What a big baby!

205
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:53,228
(Groaning)

206
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:11,351
(Humming -- ♫ Mary Had a Little Lamb ♫)

207
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:32,799
Do you think she knows where she's going?

208
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,003
I don't think we should be following her.

209
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,254
I don't trust this girl.

210
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,896
We don't have much choice.

211
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,186
I don't know...

212
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:50,688
(Humming -- ♫ Mary Had a Little Lamb ♫)

213
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:01,624
(Laughs) Hi!

214
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,479
Light switch... on!

215
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,571
Sammie...?

216
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,015
Do we have much further?

217
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,375
We've been walking a while.

218
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:14,752
A while?

219
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,671
They have no idea.

220
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:19,976
What?

221
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:37,607
(Door slams)

222
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:47,175
Sammie!

223
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:48,641
You there?!

224
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:49,642
Sammie!?

225
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:51,113
They chose...

226
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:52,640
poorly.

227
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:53,926
(Banging) Hello?!

228
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,669
What do you want from us?

229
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:13,103
Fear...

230
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:41,846
I can't see a thing

231
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,149
Hey...

232
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,150
Wait up.

233
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,151
I can't see anything.

234
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,493
James?

235
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,349
What do you want from us?!

236
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,287
Delightful.

237
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,778
Your fear is exquisite.

238
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,099
I'm not scared of you!

239
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,206
Breathe in.

240
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,745
Breathe it in, child.

241
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,248
Breathe you stupid bitch!

242
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:00,511
Breathe!

243
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:47,315
Mother?

244
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,033
What are you doing here?

245
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,061
You're too late.

246
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,301
Where are we?

247
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:58,051
We were in your father's care room.

248
00:20:58,832 --> 00:20:59,985
Not that you would know

249
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,808
since you never came to visit.

250
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,505
Are you okay?

251
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,386
(Screams)

252
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,721
Patricia!

253
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,230
Patricia!

254
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,732
Patricia! What are you doing?!

255
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,415
You're just making things worse!

256
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:25,418
Stop?

257
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:27,349
You never stopped him.

258
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,350
No. Stay away.

259
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,006
Please just stay away from me.

260
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,126
(Muffled scream)

261
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,429
Nothing.

262
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
Stay here. They'll be coming soon for you.

263
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:13,229
Sure.

264
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,881
Hey. Who are you?

265
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:31,772
What are you listening to?

266
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,245
You like that stuff?

267
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:38,831
Yeah.

268
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:41,041
You know, in this room... there are

269
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,042
straps.

270
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:43,544
Chains.

271
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,545
Whips and stuff...

272
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,221
You wanna go in there?

273
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:49,372
I really do.

274
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,128
Ooh.

275
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:55,749
(Laughs)

276
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,057
So who is this?

277
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:00,354
I dunno.

278
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:02,335
Why? Does it matter?

279
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,336
No.

280
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,055
It'll be fun to have someone watch.

281
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,277
Okay, let's get started.

282
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,176
No way.

283
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:19,351
Yeah way.

284
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,371
Get on the rack, dog!

285
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,503
No treats 'til I say so.

286
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:35,846
(Laughs)

287
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:37,859
Okay. Let's do it.

288
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:53,316
Not done yet.

289
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Appreciation?

290
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,205
Not yet.

291
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:18,672
Shut up dog boy.

292
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:20,644
Ahem.

293
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,151
I don't have a key.

294
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:26,296
Who does?

295
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
K Hole.

296
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,862
So this was all for nothing?

297
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:31,430
I opened the door.

298
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,087
And I got him out of the way.

299
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
Now you just pull your hand out.

300
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,833
Just pull it through, huh?

301
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,044
Yeah. Break your thumb.

302
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:38,778
What?!

303
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,229
You're crazy.

304
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,388
Patricia needs us.

305
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,529
They're coming now. We don't have time.

306
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:49,785
This Little Piggy...

307
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:50,786
Whoa! Hey!

308
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:00,722
(Bone snapping)

309
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:04,935
(Groans)

310
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,341
Let's go now

311
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,091
Yeah, punk!

312
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,992
Say hi to Mama and K Hole for me.

313
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,748
(Muffled) I'll kill you!

314
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:35,600
Well...

315
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,429
Lead the way.

316
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:47,936
Hurry up!

317
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:55,002
Hey, how about we slow down a little bit...?

318
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,070
Know what I'm saying?

319
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,290
Maybe you should... take.

320
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,361
Take time to think about where we're going?

321
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,616
What do you think?

322
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:04,461
I think we need to help Patricia.

323
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:05,789
Look, the best help

324
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,841
for Patricia is for us to

325
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:09,064
get out of here and get the police.

326
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,461
There are only two of us, alright?

327
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:14,669
She has an entire army.

328
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,932
You know how long I've been in here

329
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,199
looking for a way out?

330
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,595
And you've been here for one second

331
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:24,536
and you want to go running to your mama?

332
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,286
We were here on a missing persons case

333
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:29,060
when we got stuck in this Hell maze.

334
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:31,281
You have no idea what a

335
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:33,883
Hell maze this place really is.

336
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,357
So what are you saying? You don't

337
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,508
know how to get out of here?

338
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:39,460
You're so stupid there's no way out!

339
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:41,365
(Screams)

340
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:54,780
Don't you touch me!

341
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,206
Don't you fucking touch

342
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,610
Don't you ever touch me!

343
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,118
Okay... okay, okay!

344
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,599
Look, calm down.

345
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
You want out?

346
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,854
You want out, right?

347
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:14,514
That's what you want?

348
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,927
Make a left at the

349
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,092
end of the hallway and open the window

350
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,474
and climb out.

351
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Why surprised?

352
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
At least you have a choice.

353
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
Patricia

354
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:28,081
has

355
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,085
no

356
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:29,598
choice.

357
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,519
Sammie, listen you

358
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,440
have to understand

359
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:34,150
I think it's best that we get help.

360
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:35,544
Piss off!

361
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,639
We don't need you

362
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,194
I will save Patricia.

363
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
And when she has to die?

364
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:43,552
Again and again?

365
00:29:43,553 --> 00:29:45,979
It will be your fault!

366
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,581
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ok?!

367
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:10,428
Please.

368
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:12,186
Please. He had someone help him!

369
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,367
He had someone help him!

370
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,162
He's a lying sack of shit.

371
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,136
Mama, I'm telling the truth.

372
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,398
Please, hear me out!

373
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Wait, K.

374
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:26,933
I was on the other side of that door

375
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,134
Alright? Standing guard.

376
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:30,143
And this girl, she just came up to me.

377
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,366
She started to talk to me.

378
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:32,501
What did she look like?

379
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,994
She was wearing a dress

380
00:30:34,995 --> 00:30:37,382
with a green army jacket and combat boots.

381
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,493
Brown hair...

382
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
and brown eyes.

383
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Catch her name?

384
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:43,362
No... I...

385
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:44,580
What'd she say?

386
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,031
I dunno!

387
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:48,849
Look, we just came in here for a little bit of fun.

388
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,777
Alright? She said she was into me.

389
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,042
They were not alone.

390
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,310
Cara said they were alone.

391
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,194
There must be someone on the inside.

392
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,569
You must find this girl.

393
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:02,836
So I was able to help, right?

394
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:06,238
Now you know they have someone on the inside.

395
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:10,557
All will come out soon.

396
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,078
No. No, please!

397
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:13,266
(Laughter)

398
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,585
(Belch)

399
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:35,665
I swear if that airhead is lying to me.

400
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
I'll kill her.

401
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:44,357
Another busy day?

402
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:47,750
I guess you guys never get a day off,

403
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:48,751
do you?

404
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:49,919
(Muffled) How did you get here?

405
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,031
I have my ways.

406
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,716
You think Mama's the only one who can do voodoo?

407
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:54,450
(Muffled) Get her out.

408
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,718
Stay back!

409
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,452
Stay back or you'll be sorry.

410
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,310
(Voodoo babbling)

411
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:13,441
(Voodoo babbling intensifies)

412
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:16,239
What are you doing here?

413
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:17,950
I can be a hero too.

414
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:19,985
You can start with these two.

415
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:27,317
What now, huh?

416
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,639
Rip their masks off!

417
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Where is K Hole?

418
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Hell if I know.

419
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,360
You asked for me.

420
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:51,725
You want me to find her?

421
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:52,696
No.

422
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:54,453
Someone else will take care of that.

423
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,940
Just get back on the streets and make some sales.

424
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Alright.

425
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:03,186
Kalfu...

426
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
Why is this happening?

427
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,296
Why is this happening all now?

428
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,465
How may we help you, Chief?

429
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,866
I hear there may be an issue.

430
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:21,502
Well, Mama.

431
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,883
It seems like things have been

432
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:24,038
a little light lately.

433
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,882
Well, not to worry.

434
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,030
I see bright days ahead of us.

435
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:30,258
Oh, I'm not worried.

436
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:31,259
But you should be.

437
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:35,278
It seems there's some skimming going.

438
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:37,397
Skimming?

439
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:38,398
It looks like, uh...

440
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:42,815
K Hole has been overspending quite a bit lately.

441
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:45,861
It's not good for business

442
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:48,578
Even if she's good at what she does.

443
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,229
Mama, you called for me?

444
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,344
Good afternoon, Chief Check.

445
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,464
Hope all is well.

446
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:05,070
Well I hear things getting better all the time.

447
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:11,165
Cara...

448
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:13,023
Yes, Mama.

449
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:14,215
I need your help.

450
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:17,614
I am humbled. Help from me!

451
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:19,738
I live to serve.

452
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
(Voodoo chanting)

453
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,757
(Voodoo chanting)

454
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:12,797
Why do you summon me?

455
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,570
There has been a great number of

456
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:16,432
disturbances in this house.

457
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:17,841
Tell me,

458
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,921
where do these come from?

459
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,995
The houngan, Marinette.

460
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,639
The Mambo who freed her people from bondage.

461
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:27,500
How do I appease her?

462
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:29,998
It's too late, Dominique.

463
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,322
One of your blood prisoners

464
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,244
roam free here.

465
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,552
The spirit is looking to free

466
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:35,791
her people from bondage

467
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,344
as mar does free hers.

468
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:40,537
But how do I rid this house of this spirit?

469
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:44,885
You must make the spirit give herself up willingly to you.

470
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:47,015
Until that time, she is filled with the spirit of

471
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,551
Marnet and cannot be harmed by you.

472
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,506
Thank you, Kalfou.

473
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,760
Remember, Dominique.

474
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:01,655
I'll be coming to get what is mine.

475
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:04,408
I know.

476
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:06,998
I hope you do

477
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,626
(Coughing)

478
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:17,636
Where are we?

479
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,392
Wait. Where are we?! Where are we going?

480
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:21,633
Just calm down! It's me James!

481
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,201
-- so scary!

482
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:25,013
I don't want to be here anymore.

483
00:37:25,014 --> 00:37:26,333
There has to be a way out of here.

484
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,064
I don't want to be here anymore.

485
00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:29,169
Calm down, calm down. Sit down. Sit down!

486
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,351
What are we doing here?

487
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:34,041
You don't understand. That man, that thing!

488
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,106
He stuck a needle in my arm!

489
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,806
He stuck a needle -- He had scars all over him.

490
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:40,510
And then they held a knife to my neck

491
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,196
and they made me breathe in

492
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,119
Breathe in? Breathe in what?

493
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,197
Like a powder...

494
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:46,583
Zombie powder.

495
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:48,461
And then I was stuck in this nightmare.

496
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:50,397
My mom and dad were there and they were torturing me

497
00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:51,870
and I couldn't snap out of it!

498
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,580
You were lucky.

499
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,183
Lucky?!

500
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,144
I don't feel so lucky!

501
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:59,167
You never made it to the blood room.

502
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
The blood room?

503
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,238
Wow, this just gets better and better.

504
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:04,987
Enough of this.

505
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:06,080
Patricia, let's... Let's go now.

506
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,171
You found a way out?

507
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,181
Yeah... Sammie told me about this window.

508
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:10,553
What window?

509
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,810
(Crying) Please, stop!

510
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,733
Stop, please.

511
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:16,108
(Cries)

512
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:22,050
She doesn't need us.

513
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Patricia.

514
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:28,492
Please don't leave.

515
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
You understand now, don't you?

516
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
We have to stay in the nightmare forever.

517
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,832
Patricia, don't be scared.

518
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,464
You're... you're...

519
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,580
I'm trapped. Patricia we're all --

520
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,958
You're a... You're a ghost!

521
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,367
I'm not a ghost!

522
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:49,858
But you just --

523
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:51,125
Ghosts come from dead people,

524
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,781
I'm not dead!

525
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:54,208
This...

526
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
This isn't happening. Alright?

527
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:59,437
I'm arguing with a ghost!

528
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,120
Sammie. Sammie, I don't understand.

529
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,471
We're all being trapped here by Mama's black magic.

530
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
Where? Where is she keeping you?

531
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:09,190
Blood room.

532
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Okay, so you can take us there.

533
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,863
I can't.

534
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
I'm too scared.

535
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
But you're there.

536
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,112
So... Sammie.

537
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
I mean

538
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
How can we fight black magic?

539
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:26,948
I mean, come on.

540
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,154
We will protect you.

541
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:40,232
Patricia.

542
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:43,360
Listen, this is crazy. Alright?

543
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,152
I mean, look!

544
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:47,105
We're talking to a ghost.

545
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:51,606
I came back for you so we could get the hell out of here.

546
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:52,832
I know... but I.

547
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
I just can't leave her

548
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,595
I'm not stupid, alright. I know there's something

549
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:04,084
going on in here that I can't understand. But...

550
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
I mean. What can we do?

551
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,424
Huh?

552
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,632
I don't know

553
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,261
Me either.

554
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Go and get help.

555
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,090
Come back.

556
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,683
I'll come back for you.

557
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,998
We'll be here.

558
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:19,456
We?!

559
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,131
Oh yeah, that's right. You and, uh..

560
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:22,134
Casper here.

561
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,696
Alright.

562
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,024
Let's go to the blood room.

563
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,864
So, it is you Marinette chose.

564
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,728
Let's see how strong you really are.

565
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,944
(Voodoo words)

566
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:53,410
Kalfou.

567
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:57,599
(More voodoo words)

568
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:03,954
(Powerful voodoo words)

569
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:08,193
(The most powerful voodoo words)

570
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:23,259
Beware, child.

571
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,768
You will surrender yourself... to me.

572
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,142
I was... I was wondering if

573
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:36,616
I could have a few minutes of your time

574
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,617
to answer some questions?

575
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:41,798
I'm a Yale anthropology major

576
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:43,479
and I'm studying Haitian Voodoo

577
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
and its influence on history and culture.

578
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Really?

579
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,149
Yeah, I'm interested in getting to know

580
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,150
more real perspective of the religion,

581
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:52,801
the less Hollywood version.

582
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:55,456
Oh, by the way...

583
00:41:55,702 --> 00:41:56,982
Everyone calls me Sammie.

584
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,528
Okay...

585
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,863
Sammie.

586
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,775
Are you just here for me to make a

587
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,570
voodoo doll of your ex boyfriend

588
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,687
so you can stick it with needles all day?

589
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:07,392
No, I really want to learn!

590
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:09,829
There's some really interesting science behind Voodoo,

591
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,584
like the use of the powder of the blowfish.

592
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:12,864
Ah.

593
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,374
I see you've done your research.

594
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:18,058
Yeah, that's that's how you put people into a zombie state

595
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,776
to make them more susceptible to your charms.

596
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:21,056
Correct.

597
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:23,360
But our gods, they are real.

598
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,692
They're much more important than this...

599
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,480
blowfish powder.

600
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:31,009
I mean, of course, I meant no disrespect

601
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,832
but you know that

602
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:33,856
this powder is

603
00:42:34,112 --> 00:42:36,672
getting very popular on the streets as a recreational drug.

604
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:37,696
Zombie powder?

605
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:38,976
And your point?

606
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:40,256
Well...

607
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:42,437
The university has found that if you mix it

608
00:42:42,438 --> 00:42:44,438
with human blood, it increases its potency.

609
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,936
You sound as if you're making a recipe for a cake.

610
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:49,984
You must come to terms with

611
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,008
With

612
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:55,104
The soul and the emotions. The human element.

613
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,152
Well

614
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,224
When humans are in great fear...

615
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,296
It introduces chemicals into the bloodstream that

616
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:05,600
that are said to be very potent.

617
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:07,664
Really?

618
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:09,696
I must look into this.

619
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:13,058
I could help you find the studies if you like.

620
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:17,120
You can do much more than that, my dear.

621
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:24,022
(Scream)

622
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,186
Does anyone know his last name?

623
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:32,992
His last name's Wilder.

624
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,416
There it is!

625
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:45,730
And look at all the pretty Facebook pictures from their last vacation.

626
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,120
Don't people love to share?

627
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,216
Facebook sucks now that there's only old people on it.

628
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,008
Try Twitter.

629
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,736
Hello, I have some information concerning a Cassidy Wilder.

630
00:44:05,572 --> 00:44:07,224
I heard there's a reward?

631
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:11,412
Thank you. I'll contact him.

632
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,768
Looks like the area code is right here in Newark.

633
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:22,400
It seems a James Gates

634
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:25,216
lives at 235 3rd Avenue.

635
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:30,080
I think it's time to go door-to-door.

636
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:32,128
Spread the good word.

637
00:44:32,384 --> 00:44:34,147
Bring it to the people

638
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:36,641
Alright. Listen up, you screwheads.

639
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:39,112
Tonight, I want to see all this gone.

640
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:46,494
Seems like a lot to move in one night.

641
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:51,472
Listen up!

642
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:54,144
What you don't sell? You buy!

643
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,916
Open your mouth. Open your mouth!

644
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,135
Take it in!

645
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:01,176
Take. It. In.

646
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:03,872
Yeah?

647
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,426
Hold on...

648
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:10,129
You understand?

649
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,140
Alright. Yeah...

650
00:45:12,872 --> 00:45:14,408
I've always got my knife.

651
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,048
Stay back behind the door.

652
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:25,227
You heard Mama I'm in charge.

653
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:27,869
Do it.

654
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,924
Oh, how cute!

655
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:49,892
Hello, little girl. I'm Cara.

656
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:50,916
What's your name?

657
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,252
I'm Jamie.

658
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:53,843
Is your mommy home?

659
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,523
Jamie, what did I tell you about opening the door?

660
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,317
Oh, please don't get angry with her. She's so darling.

661
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:01,274
Let me introduce myself.

662
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:02,705
My name is Cara. Cara Stegman

663
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:05,009
I'm with the DeSilva church here in town.

664
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:08,161
And I heard that you and your husband want to practice voodoo.

665
00:46:08,162 --> 00:46:11,456
I'm sorry you must be mistaken. We don't practice voodoo.

666
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,783
You should learn more about it.

667
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,394
Mama is amazing.

668
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,977
I'm sorry. I really don't have time --

669
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:33,728
Hi James... tough day?

670
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:34,854
You look rough.

671
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:36,038
Yeah, I've had better. and finally get cleaned up though

672
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:39,399
Looks like I'm gonna be able to get home

673
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,214
and finally be able to get cleaned up though.

674
00:46:41,854 --> 00:46:43,197
Are you sure, James?

675
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:46,083
I'm sure you two little girls aren't going to stop me.

676
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:56,527
235 3rd Avenue?

677
00:46:57,878 --> 00:46:59,584
I know that place!

678
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:02,138
We were just nearby there.

679
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:09,387
Touch anyone in my family.

680
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:10,843
Anyone... I'll kill you.

681
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:11,743
Blah blah --

682
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:12,574
I'll kill you!

683
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:13,714
I'll kill you all!

684
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:16,215
If I have to die doing it, I'll kill you all.

685
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,623
Your daughter's eyes look just like yours.

686
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,861
Or maybe they're hazel.

687
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,184
Like your wife's.

688
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:27,437
Let me check.

689
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,782
Look, you moron.

690
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,896
Look. They're marbles.

691
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:48,725
Yeah, we got his attention.

692
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:51,461
Next time they will be real.

693
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:00,308
Hello, James?

694
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:02,837
You there?

695
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:04,351
Yes, he is.

696
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,496
One more time and they kill them both.

697
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,779
Mutant!

698
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:14,797
Daddy!

699
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:18,065
You know... You are really making this worse.

700
00:48:19,537 --> 00:48:21,537
Alright, I'll do it. I'll do it.

701
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:23,432
You have two hours or we start

702
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,141
sending back real body parts.

703
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:28,044
Where?

704
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,222
Get them to the church auditorium.

705
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,018
Two hours.

706
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:33,280
Starting now.

707
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:39,600
We are going back to where you found me?

708
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,496
That's the entrance to the blood room.

709
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,372
Not exactly.

710
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:48,102
Why can't you go into the blood room?

711
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,200
I told you. I'm scared.

712
00:48:51,968 --> 00:48:53,066
What are you scared of?

713
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:55,530
Mama?

714
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:57,152
That thing?

715
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,447
The Blood Punk.

716
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:01,384
That's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

717
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:03,744
I'm more scared of the blood prisoners.

718
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,024
Blood prisoners?

719
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,072
I can hear them all the time.

720
00:49:08,352 --> 00:49:10,144
And they get louder as I get closer.

721
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:13,124
They're... damaged.

722
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:15,264
Violent.

723
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:17,678
They'll never be the same.

724
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,904
We can only stop the dream.

725
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:24,311
But you're one of them.

726
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:29,343
So you're afraid of what you will become.

727
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,471
Yes.

728
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:42,886
So what now? We just wait?

729
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:45,216
Yes.

730
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,008
Okay.

731
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,288
Yo.

732
00:49:48,924 --> 00:49:49,963
Check what they've got to eat.

733
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:52,896
You realize...

734
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:54,290
You're going to be working for me

735
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,304
from now on?

736
00:49:55,898 --> 00:49:56,900
Doubtful.

737
00:49:57,504 --> 00:49:59,040
Mama put me in charge.

738
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:02,700
Finally, I will be able to spread Mama's message.

739
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:04,672
Mama's message?

740
00:50:04,928 --> 00:50:06,208
Mama's messages is just

741
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:07,744
"Do more drugs."

742
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,308
That's it.

743
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,584
You are so blind.

744
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,376
Or maybe just dumb.

745
00:50:13,632 --> 00:50:14,656
I'm not sure which.

746
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,728
Probably just dum -- I'd think twice if I were you.

747
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:19,778
K Hole got caught skimming.

748
00:50:20,288 --> 00:50:22,134
She won't be coming around anymore

749
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Leave my mommy alone!

750
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:38,793
(Laughs)

751
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:40,414
Good one kid.

752
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:44,352
Your time is coming.

753
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,912
She doesn't understand. Please!

754
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:51,520
Keep an eye on them.

755
00:50:52,288 --> 00:50:54,591
Oh yeah. They seem like a real handful.

756
00:50:54,592 --> 00:50:56,664
You know I would give my life for Mama.

757
00:50:56,855 --> 00:50:58,802
You may have to do that sooner than you think

758
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:00,992
you trustfund scumbag.

759
00:51:05,344 --> 00:51:05,856
Pardon.

760
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:07,922
This will be important.

761
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:13,792
Yes Mama?

762
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:18,912
Here ya go, kid.

763
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:19,936
Have some fun.

764
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,528
Everything is set.

765
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,590
And we wait for your instructions.

766
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:33,248
You are very lucky, Jamie.

767
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,064
Mama has made you the star of the show.

768
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:40,416
And after tonight...

769
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:44,806
She will have a seat at the right hand of Mama.

770
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,072
You people are all crazy!

771
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
(Laughing)

772
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,640
I thought you were afraid of the blood room.

773
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:03,712
This isn't the blood room.

774
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,414
The blood rooms down there where they're going

775
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:12,047
They're guards. -- Guards?

776
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:14,192
And the gas punks.

777
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,488
They're...

778
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:18,560
not very strong though and they're slow.

779
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:20,500
Good.

780
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,646
Okay. What's the plan?

781
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:26,819
I got it!

782
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,288
Play dead.

783
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:31,360
Play dead?

784
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:34,708
Go lie down there with that IV in your arm,

785
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,224
Gas punks will come out,

786
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:39,112
and they'll take you to the blood room.

787
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:40,576
And then what?

788
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:43,904
Can't do everything by myself, Patricia.

789
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:47,232
Remember? Ghost?

790
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:53,637
Yeah, this whole playing dead thing?

791
00:52:53,888 --> 00:52:55,168
I don't have an IV bag.

792
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:56,960
There's used ones down there.

793
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:00,032
Just hook one up and wait for a gas punk to come out.

794
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,640
Once we get down there...

795
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:06,070
you'll leave me, right?

796
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:07,968
I can't go in.

797
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:09,504
But, I'll never leave you.

798
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
Once I get in the room

799
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:16,504
Once you get in, you free everyone.

800
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:17,792
How?

801
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,716
You take their needles out and run.

802
00:53:19,717 --> 00:53:21,214
They'll all wake up.

803
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:23,072
Violent killers.

804
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:25,632
They'll protect you.

805
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,803
Believe me.

806
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,901
Okay

807
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:56,608
Tired yet?

808
00:53:57,382 --> 00:53:58,384
Why?

809
00:53:58,673 --> 00:53:59,424
Huh?

810
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:00,448
Why my family?

811
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,845
Why us?

812
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:03,396
I'm sorry, James.

813
00:54:03,636 --> 00:54:04,544
Why then?

814
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:06,716
With all your power what kind of threat are we?

815
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:10,018
You're not a threat to me.

816
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:12,042
But it seems that

817
00:54:12,224 --> 00:54:14,015
someone special

818
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:15,039
to me

819
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,856
cares about you and only appears for you both.

820
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:19,904
Who Sammie?

821
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,208
Yes, James.

822
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,742
Sammie.

823
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,280
So that's it

824
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,046
'cause she's a ghost, you can't control her.

825
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:32,905
Just try to bring her to the auditorium

826
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,544
and I promise that all of this will end.

827
00:54:37,312 --> 00:54:38,336
How about Patricia?

828
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,070
Sacrifices need to be made.

829
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,968
I can't do that.

830
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,760
I can't give you Patricia.

831
00:54:47,472 --> 00:54:48,576
No?

832
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,600
But she is mine.

833
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,648
You both were

834
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,859
as soon as you walked into my house.

835
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:59,245
I asked you both to leave but you both refused.

836
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,892
Alright.

837
00:55:06,496 --> 00:55:08,032
I'll do it

838
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:12,900
But, if you hurt my family,

839
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:17,292
I'll kill every one of you.

840
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:27,877
No appearance of Sammie

841
00:55:27,878 --> 00:55:29,878
at the auditorium?

842
00:55:30,098 --> 00:55:31,474
And I will kill

843
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:34,531
your entire family.

844
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,662
Slowly.

845
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:38,873
While you watch.

846
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:34,017
Patricia. Where's Sammie?

847
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
James!

848
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:11,064
(Voodoo noises.)

849
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:40,096
Sammie?

850
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,182
You found her.

851
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:44,608
We found her.

852
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:49,132
Wonder what happened to the Sammie we know.

853
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:50,335
What do you mean?

854
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:51,514
You know, the ghost one.

855
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:52,604
She still around?

856
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:55,178
I don't know.

857
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:56,992
She's not here.

858
00:57:57,662 --> 00:57:59,400
She said she couldn't come in here.

859
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,524
Alright, well...

860
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:02,112
Come on. Let's go.

861
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,478
That's not right. We can't just leave her here.

862
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,588
Besides, she asked me to free them all.

863
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,280
Yeah. That was before we had help.

864
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:12,304
Why don't we let the experts be the ones to help them?

865
00:58:12,305 --> 00:58:14,305
Come on.

866
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:17,216
Bye Sammie.

867
00:58:18,486 --> 00:58:19,510
We'll see you soon.

868
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:23,494
I can't wait for the cops to get here.

869
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:25,166
Yeah. They'll be here soon.

870
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,823
I saw a cop car patrolling the streets outside.

871
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:30,274
I was able to stop him and, um...

872
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:31,821
Told him what happened.

873
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:33,863
He called for backup.

874
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:35,134
Great.

875
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:39,461
Do you know which way to the auditorium?

876
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:41,426
He does not, Patricia.

877
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:42,833
Sammie!

878
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:44,509
We found you!

879
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:47,221
I was able to touch you. James went and got help.

880
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:49,627
Help's on the way for you and others.

881
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,027
He's lying!

882
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,481
What do you mean?

883
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:53,932
He sold us out to Mama.

884
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:56,127
They're all waiting for you in the auditorium.

885
00:58:56,512 --> 00:58:57,888
You don't understand.

886
00:58:57,888 --> 00:58:59,271
Don't understand?

887
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:02,391
What's going on James?

888
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,977
They went to my house, Patricia.

889
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:07,571
They got Donna and Jamie.

890
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:08,752
Donna and Jamie?

891
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:09,658
Yeah.

892
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,025
We have to go to the auditorium.

893
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:13,071
All of us. Including Sammie.

894
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:14,452
She's the one that Mama really wants.

895
00:59:14,453 --> 00:59:16,058
She doesn't even care about us.

896
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:18,358
It's always been about Sammie.

897
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,023
What does she want Sammie?

898
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:22,428
I don't know. I stay far away from her.

899
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:25,511
What is it about her?

900
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,100
I don't know. Something about because

901
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:29,001
she's a ghost, Mama can't control her.

902
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:33,826
We all have to surrender to her.  All of us.

903
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:35,631
Surrender?!

904
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:38,161
I will never surrender to Mama.

905
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:40,008
Sammie, I have no choice.

906
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:41,430
(Screams)

907
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:43,994
Sorry, this is...

908
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:45,663
Sorry?!

909
00:59:46,304 --> 00:59:48,096
I'm sorry too, James.

910
00:59:48,815 --> 00:59:50,094
I can still have a life

911
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:52,233
so I choose to fight!

912
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:55,106
Sammie?

913
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,640
Sammie. Please.

914
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:02,432
Please?

915
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,968
Help me.

916
01:00:04,224 --> 01:00:05,223
Alright?

917
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:06,572
I need you.

918
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,330
My family needs you.

919
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,904
This is my family.

920
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,976
Donna and Jamie.

921
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,053
Let's go to the auditorium.

922
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:31,684
Patsy.

923
01:00:32,364 --> 01:00:33,664
Call Cara for me please.

924
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,871
Yes Mama.

925
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,902
Thank you, Patsy.

926
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:45,696
Let's make this

927
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,744
easier for everyone.

928
01:00:53,045 --> 01:00:53,888
That is

929
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,936
so cool.

930
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,006
If they don't let my family go

931
01:00:59,006 --> 01:01:00,027
'cause we don't have Sammie?

932
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:01,571
I'm gonna die trying.

933
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:02,831
Me too. Wait!

934
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,128
We're in this together.

935
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:05,141
Let's not rush it.

936
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:07,183
You said they didn't want to hurt us.

937
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:09,670
Okay. But if I get a chance?

938
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:11,197
If we get a chance.

939
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:13,088
We go down together

940
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,214
Okay.

941
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:29,954
No more.

942
01:01:30,644 --> 01:01:34,848
That false Mambo bitch is going down.

943
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,156
Daddy!

944
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,259
Pooh Bear.

945
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:45,600
James! Who are these people?

946
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:46,620
What do they want?

947
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,983
Baby, just just stay calm alright?

948
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:50,640
It'll be over soon.

949
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:51,870
Well, James?

950
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,260
Where is she?

951
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,043
We told Sammie not to show up

952
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,160
until you free

953
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:59,172
Jamie and Donna.

954
01:01:59,273 --> 01:02:00,283
Really?

955
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:03,433
It's the only way we knew you'd keep your word.

956
01:02:04,032 --> 01:02:05,406
That is unfortunate.

957
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Your time is coming.

958
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:12,517
You don't have to follow me.

959
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:13,962
Together.

960
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:24,658
I am growing tired of this!

961
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:26,959
If I can't have Sammie

962
01:02:26,959 --> 01:02:30,032
then everyone that she cares about will die.

963
01:02:36,104 --> 01:02:38,868
All useless and weak.

964
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:41,920
No!

965
01:02:44,736 --> 01:02:45,760
Everyone stop.

966
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:49,940
Sammie.

967
01:02:50,624 --> 01:02:51,648
The first.

968
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:55,744
I will kill you.

969
01:02:56,256 --> 01:03:00,096
The pain ends now. For everyone.

970
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,936
It's been a long time since we last spoke, Sammie.

971
01:03:07,008 --> 01:03:08,800
Are you ready to surrender?

972
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:11,557
Surrender?!

973
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:14,944
You will be the one screaming for mercy!

974
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,320
O, Mambo Marinette.

975
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:24,277
Please grant me the power of Dantor.

976
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:27,262
Use my spirit as a vessel.

977
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:30,586
And help me bring down this false Mambo.

978
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:31,637
(Laughs)

979
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:34,146
I am not just some braindead being

980
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:37,157
you can scare with your childish tricks.

981
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:46,915
(Screaming)

982
01:03:47,636 --> 01:03:50,616
(Screaming intensifies)

983
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:04,526
(Choking)

984
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:06,447


985
01:04:06,448 --> 01:04:08,908
Kill her! Kill her!

986
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,693
Sammie.

987
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:16,970
Kill her!

988
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,160
Kill her!

989
01:04:18,209 --> 01:04:19,949
Are you sure about that, James?

990
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:21,610
Patsy, call Mutant.

991
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:23,837
On my command, you kill the family.

992
01:04:25,088 --> 01:04:27,111
I surrender.

993
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:32,388
(Screams)

994
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,209
Trisha...

995
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:44,441
Trisha. Trisha!

996
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,858
What happened?

997
01:04:46,445 --> 01:04:48,445
(Coughing)

998
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,949
Come on, come on.

999
01:04:54,784 --> 01:04:55,808
Finally.

1000
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,856
Got rid of that nuisance.

1001
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,208
Now...

1002
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:05,024
as promised.

1003
01:05:05,025 --> 01:05:06,049
Both of you,

1004
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,974
down to the blood room.

1005
01:05:27,868 --> 01:05:29,308
She could have beaten her.

1006
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,344
So why'd she stop?

1007
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:34,463
The same reason you came back to save me.

1008
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,127
To save Donna and Jamie.

1009
01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:57,877
It's Cara.

1010
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:59,483
Really?

1011
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:02,667
Hello? Where are you?

1012
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,368
We thought you were dead.

1013
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:06,464
That kid stabbed me.

1014
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:09,272
I'm going back into that house.

1015
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:11,208
I'm taking them all back to the blood room

1016
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,644
and hook them up personally

1017
01:06:13,157 --> 01:06:14,746
What is she saying?

1018
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:16,300
(Tinny phone conversation)

1019
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,935
She's going back to Mama to ask for forgiveness.

1020
01:06:20,106 --> 01:06:21,606
(scoffs)
Forgiveness?!

1021
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:23,997
Just meet us at the blood room entrance.

1022
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,914
We have a new member, her name's Corinne.

1023
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,268
She has this awesome little snake.

1024
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:30,997
Hi Cara.

1025
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:32,316
Who is this?

1026
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:44,388
What's up big guy?

1027
01:06:44,388 --> 01:06:45,669
Ready for round two?

1028
01:06:45,898 --> 01:06:46,907
I know I am.

1029
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,361
Patricia.

1030
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:52,255
You'll have your chance... soon.

1031
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:27,437
Rip the tubes out!

1032
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:31,938
Wake her up!

1033
01:07:48,877 --> 01:07:50,877
(Screaming)

1034
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,172
(Still screaming)

1035
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:08,805
Sammie. What's wrong?

1036
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:09,966
(Choking)

1037
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:11,123
Sa--

1038
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:12,362
Sammie, what are you doing?

1039
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:13,533
Sa-- No!

1040
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:23,692
Sammie.

1041
01:08:23,693 --> 01:08:24,885
Sammie, stop it!

1042
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:26,256
Please!

1043
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,892
It's me. Patricia.

1044
01:08:29,892 --> 01:08:31,616
Sammie. Get up!

1045
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:35,955
Notice how everyone you try to save wants to kill you?

1046
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,271
Maybe you should take a hint.

1047
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:39,587
Mama...

1048
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:42,400
Can I be of any assistance?

1049
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:43,921
Sammie!

1050
01:08:46,262 --> 01:08:47,066
Stop it!

1051
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:48,579
No, Cara.

1052
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,534
Sammie will be more than enough.

1053
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,338
Sammie. What are you doing?

1054
01:08:53,483 --> 01:08:55,263
Sammie! Sammie please!

1055
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,067
When Sammie is done... kill her.

1056
01:08:58,252 --> 01:09:00,252
Sammie. Sammie, please!

1057
01:09:00,783 --> 01:09:01,518
Stop!

1058
01:09:01,664 --> 01:09:04,447
Okay... As you wish

1059
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:07,741
Sammie.

1060
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,939
Sammie, wake up.

1061
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,305
Baron.

1062
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:12,311
I want her head on my shrine.

1063
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:14,494
Everyone... Let's get out of here.

1064
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:17,398
I've got to capture this.

1065
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:19,522
Sammie?

1066
01:09:19,973 --> 01:09:21,636
Sammie, it's me, Patricia.

1067
01:09:22,237 --> 01:09:24,223
Come on you dumb bitch. Kill her already.

1068
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:25,469
I'm running out of space.

1069
01:09:26,139 --> 01:09:27,361
Sammie!

1070
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,735
(Screaming)

1071
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:44,366
Yes! Sammie!

1072
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:21,435
Sammie.

1073
01:10:23,744 --> 01:10:24,512
She okay?

1074
01:10:25,024 --> 01:10:25,792
She breathing?

1075
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,471
How about my ten dollars now?

1076
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:31,672
(Laughing)

1077
01:10:34,972 --> 01:10:36,252
Yeah, she's okay.

1078
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:46,016
Hey, nice work, kiddo.

1079
01:10:46,562 --> 01:10:49,428
We really could've used that part of you a little bit earlier though.

1080
01:10:50,073 --> 01:10:51,645
I wish...

1081
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:53,337
but I -- I lose control.

1082
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:56,494
Once Marinette takes over my body I pretty much...

1083
01:10:56,495 --> 01:10:58,305
can't control myself.

1084
01:10:58,656 --> 01:11:01,659
But, you had control over it in the auditorium.

1085
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:04,465
It was very hard to stop the feeling.

1086
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,709
I couldn't stand the idea of Jamie being hurt.

1087
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,616
I would rather die in here

1088
01:11:11,616 --> 01:11:13,408
than have people be hurt because of me.

1089
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,688
Yeah, I know.

1090
01:11:14,944 --> 01:11:15,456
Look

1091
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,805
I really want to thank you, alright?

1092
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,166
Listen, when we get out of here.

1093
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,935
And we will get out of here.

1094
01:11:22,547 --> 01:11:23,763
I want you to meet Jamie.

1095
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,227
She can thank you personally.

1096
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,079
That's...

1097
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:30,034
That's very nice, but...

1098
01:11:31,064 --> 01:11:32,732
I don't think it's possible.

1099
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:37,085
I'm still damaged.

1100
01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:38,507
We all are.

1101
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:41,435
You seem fine right now.

1102
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:46,085
I believe that Marinette made the chain

1103
01:11:46,086 --> 01:11:47,924
and, as long as it's here,

1104
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,709
I can escape the rage.

1105
01:11:51,161 --> 01:11:53,161
So what about all of them?

1106
01:11:54,118 --> 01:11:55,523
As long as you have the chain

1107
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:57,524
they won't hurt you, they'll protect you.

1108
01:11:58,596 --> 01:12:01,649
Still, I think this is where we should say goodbye.

1109
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:03,660
Goodbye?

1110
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,719
There's a trash chute over there that they use

1111
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,493
to dispose of the drained bodies.

1112
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:10,653
It leads, eventually, onto the street.

1113
01:12:10,654 --> 01:12:11,624
Oh, hell no!

1114
01:12:11,977 --> 01:12:14,235
Look. That bitch is going down! Alright?

1115
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:15,379
I'm not going anywhere.

1116
01:12:15,435 --> 01:12:17,435
We're not going anywhere.

1117
01:12:18,187 --> 01:12:19,515
I don't think so, James.

1118
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:20,992
You need to go back to your family.

1119
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,147
The two of you have fought too long already.

1120
01:12:26,148 --> 01:12:27,978
It was never your battle to fight.

1121
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:30,464
It's time for us...

1122
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,379
to take down Mama.

1123
01:12:32,536 --> 01:12:33,595
Yeah. Us!

1124
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:34,645
Alright?

1125
01:12:35,506 --> 01:12:37,249
I agree. James needs to go home.

1126
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,180
Back to his family.

1127
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,815
You can notify the police and shut this place down.

1128
01:12:42,086 --> 01:12:43,520
But I'm not going anywhere.

1129
01:12:44,106 --> 01:12:45,502
Right? End of story.

1130
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:49,005
I'll make a splint for James' knee.

1131
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,521
Help him through the tunnel and then

1132
01:12:50,522 --> 01:12:52,480
come back and we fight this together.

1133
01:12:54,764 --> 01:12:56,959
Besides, I think you forgot something

1134
01:12:57,603 --> 01:12:58,731
What?

1135
01:12:59,072 --> 01:13:00,619
This belongs to me.

1136
01:13:00,939 --> 01:13:02,939
He bought it. Remember?

1137
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:05,536
Besides. It looks like you need this

1138
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:06,560
now more than ever.

1139
01:13:08,196 --> 01:13:09,234
That's very true.

1140
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:13,984
Dominique...

1141
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:15,847
You look upset.

1142
01:13:15,964 --> 01:13:18,336
Well, my problem continues to persist.

1143
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:20,128
Yes, I know.

1144
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:22,036
That is unfortunate.

1145
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:24,736
The end is near.

1146
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:27,464
Thank you for your concern.

1147
01:13:28,054 --> 01:13:29,590
How do I defeat Marinette?

1148
01:13:30,356 --> 01:13:31,989
There are always options.

1149
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,710
I'm listening.

1150
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:35,847
Marinette would like to kill you.

1151
01:13:36,256 --> 01:13:37,792
So, if you are dead

1152
01:13:38,058 --> 01:13:39,136
then she will leave.

1153
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,612
I do not understand

1154
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:48,288
I love it.

1155
01:13:48,695 --> 01:13:49,950
Glad you are pleased.

1156
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,508
We can still be together, Dominique.

1157
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:57,029
(Voodoo chanting)

1158
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:01,124
Aww, come on!

1159
01:14:03,049 --> 01:14:04,983
They must've locked it from the outside.

1160
01:14:05,435 --> 01:14:07,435
Mama sealed the door with her magic.

1161
01:14:07,814 --> 01:14:10,447
I wouldn't worry about it. It's gonna open soon.

1162
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:13,071
Mama's building an army to take back the blood room.

1163
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:15,085
Army? Okay...

1164
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:17,389
We need to be prepared for that.

1165
01:14:18,739 --> 01:14:19,772
I mean, are there any other weapons

1166
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:20,926
we could use here?

1167
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:23,131
We are ready.

1168
01:14:24,246 --> 01:14:26,246
We have our own army right here.

1169
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:29,127
They're waiting

1170
01:14:33,507 --> 01:14:35,507
(Voodoo chanting)

1171
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:38,044
Marinette! Marinette! (Voodoo word)

1172
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,132
We don't stop until we get to Mama.

1173
01:14:54,304 --> 01:14:56,128
O Marinette...

1174
01:14:56,722 --> 01:14:59,292
help me to defeat this false Mambo

1175
01:15:00,714 --> 01:15:02,047
and give me the power...

1176
01:15:02,048 --> 01:15:04,492
to raise your army!

1177
01:15:06,606 --> 01:15:11,626
(Voodoo chanting)

1178
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:14,674
(More Voodoo chanting)

1179
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:18,258
(Rival Voodoo chants)

1180
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:23,102
(Evil Voodoo chanting)

1181
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:27,381
(Rival Voodoo chanting cont.)

1182
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:35,025
(Evil chant)

1183
01:15:35,337 --> 01:15:38,977
(Rival chant)

1184
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:48,188
(Evil Voodoo climax)

1185
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:36,602
Uh... they're coming up the stairs.

1186
01:16:36,603 --> 01:16:37,733
They're?!

1187
01:16:38,084 --> 01:16:40,171
Sammie and Patricia... are...

1188
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:41,431
coming up the stairs!

1189
01:16:41,535 --> 01:16:43,765
And Sammie is looking really scary again.

1190
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:46,937
Complete failure.

1191
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:48,831
I have to call Mama and tell her.

1192
01:16:49,709 --> 01:16:51,178
Go down there and stop them.

1193
01:16:51,711 --> 01:16:52,800
Uhh...

1194
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:55,125
I'm really not sure I want to do that.

1195
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,534
You don't have to fight them.

1196
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:59,116
Just go down there and slow them.

1197
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,045
Get out of the way.

1198
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,329
I can't let you through.

1199
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:18,646
(Thud)

1200
01:17:22,048 --> 01:17:22,816
Soph...

1201
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,963
Sammie and Patricia are on their way up.

1202
01:17:24,964 --> 01:17:27,165
Tell Mama I'm getting out of here.

1203
01:17:30,974 --> 01:17:32,100
It was all Mama!

1204
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,683
I was just following orders.

1205
01:17:33,824 --> 01:17:35,104
I can. I can help you.

1206
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,713
How can you help us, Patsy?

1207
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:37,930
I can call them.

1208
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:39,420
I can call them.

1209
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,543
Bad move.

1210
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:54,864
(Phone ringing)

1211
01:17:58,892 --> 01:17:59,404
Hello?

1212
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:00,704
Hello?

1213
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:02,495
Are you there?

1214
01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:03,394
Tell Mama...

1215
01:18:04,032 --> 01:18:04,800
it's Marinette.

1216
01:18:09,408 --> 01:18:10,746
She said she was marionette

1217
01:18:10,747 --> 01:18:11,876
and hung up the phone.

1218
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,760
Where is Mutant now?

1219
01:18:14,162 --> 01:18:15,185
Setting up the blood room.

1220
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:15,808
Good.

1221
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,433
Mama, maybe it's best you try

1222
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:18,579
to get out of here while

1223
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,703
Mutant keeps them busy.

1224
01:18:19,704 --> 01:18:20,493
Run?

1225
01:18:20,672 --> 01:18:21,696
You want to run?

1226
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,788
You could set up in a new town.

1227
01:18:24,054 --> 01:18:24,790
You coward.

1228
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,423
You always run at the first sign.

1229
01:18:26,514 --> 01:18:27,543
It's not the first sign.

1230
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:28,496
Ha!

1231
01:18:28,497 --> 01:18:29,717
Enough.

1232
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:35,188
(Coughing)

1233
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:38,566
(Laughing)

1234
01:18:40,856 --> 01:18:41,888
So...

1235
01:18:42,502 --> 01:18:44,806
I hear you've been stealing from me.

1236
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:46,272
I'm sorry, Mama.

1237
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:48,320
I was really desperate and

1238
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:50,548
I just need a few extra bucks.

1239
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,160
A few extra bucks?

1240
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:55,409
Yeah, I promise...

1241
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,211
I'll pay every cent back. I just

1242
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:58,629
need to get...

1243
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:00,096
back on my feet.

1244
01:19:00,097 --> 01:19:00,865
You will...

1245
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:02,410
pay me back.

1246
01:19:03,168 --> 01:19:04,448
I just need some time.

1247
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:06,240
You will

1248
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,264
pay me back.

1249
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,254
Right

1250
01:19:08,255 --> 01:19:09,310
now.

1251
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:10,848
I don't have the money.

1252
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,292
Don't worry.

1253
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:15,968
Just do as I say

1254
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,672
or I will be taking a pound of your flesh.

1255
01:19:20,064 --> 01:19:22,066
Mama. Yeah -- no...anything. Anything.

1256
01:19:38,446 --> 01:19:39,452
What's up with this?

1257
01:19:39,453 --> 01:19:40,311
That's messed up.

1258
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:41,832
Idiots! Shut up.

1259
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:45,517
You don't scare me with your facepaint

1260
01:19:45,518 --> 01:19:47,631
and your Voodoo bullshit.

1261
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:50,013
You're the same coward you always been,

1262
01:19:50,013 --> 01:19:51,335
Sammie.

1263
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:54,983
Look at her.

1264
01:19:54,984 --> 01:19:56,289
This isn't fucking good.

1265
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:58,551
I don't care!

1266
01:19:58,690 --> 01:19:59,471
All of you!

1267
01:19:59,472 --> 01:20:00,553
Get her!

1268
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,610
(Yosemite Sam noises)

1269
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,418
(Yosemite Sam intensifies)

1270
01:21:06,891 --> 01:21:07,730
Idiots!

1271
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:09,621
Incompetent assholes!

1272
01:21:10,303 --> 01:21:11,792
Impossible morons!

1273
01:21:12,154 --> 01:21:13,633
Get that away from me!

1274
01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:15,344
Get your dirty hands out of my --

1275
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:17,525
Get back on your short bus.

1276
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:19,288
Put those back!

1277
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:20,945
You...!

1278
01:21:21,228 --> 01:21:24,018
You can run but you can't hide!

1279
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:26,600
I swear, I'll kick your goddamn teeth

1280
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:27,731
out of your skull!

1281
01:21:27,946 --> 01:21:28,947
Idiots!

1282
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:30,947
You (?) assholes!

1283
01:21:31,373 --> 01:21:33,202
Impossible morons!

1284
01:21:36,562 --> 01:21:38,051
Whoa! What the hell did you

1285
01:21:38,051 --> 01:21:39,246
take to look like that?

1286
01:21:39,247 --> 01:21:39,817
Give me some.

1287
01:21:40,114 --> 01:21:41,119
What happened here?

1288
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,210
I dunno. You tell me.

1289
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,240
As you can see, I'm not going anywhere.

1290
01:21:46,914 --> 01:21:48,000
That's true

1291
01:21:58,017 --> 01:21:59,036
Seems dead.

1292
01:21:59,366 --> 01:22:02,104
Guess you guys won't get your chance to kill her.

1293
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:15,423
Kill her!

1294
01:22:15,544 --> 01:22:16,568
Kill her now!

1295
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,373
What are you doing? She's not dead yet!

1296
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:27,186
(Spectral voice)
It must be terrible, child.

1297
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:30,342
To kill me, you have to kill your friend!

1298
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:33,868
Don't squeeze too hard.

1299
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:35,391
You can't kill me now.

1300
01:22:35,805 --> 01:22:37,494
You're running out of time.

1301
01:22:37,697 --> 01:22:38,966
You'll never stop me.

1302
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:41,017
I'll start all over again!

1303
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:52,858
Sammie...

1304
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:56,000
Noooooooo!

1305
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:57,411
(Glass shattering)

1306
01:23:08,552 --> 01:23:09,824
We need back up at the church.

1307
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:11,078
Franklin Street

1308
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:12,050
Yeah.

1309
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:13,390
Alright.

1310
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,752
(Screaming)

1311
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:39,707
(Heartbeat)

1312
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:41,318
(Heartbeat)

1313
01:24:01,488 --> 01:24:03,534
Seems like something happened to Sammie.

1314
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:05,477
What do you mean?

1315
01:24:05,617 --> 01:24:07,092
But, you know. Know how she's always talking

1316
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:08,159
about being damaged?

1317
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:10,696
Looks like she really is now.

1318
01:24:11,187 --> 01:24:12,211
How bad?

1319
01:24:12,502 --> 01:24:13,626
Pretty bad.

1320
01:24:13,903 --> 01:24:14,657
She, uh...

1321
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:15,767
She's

1322
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:18,036
Yelling and screaming.

1323
01:24:18,408 --> 01:24:19,492
And just...

1324
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:21,029
Talking nonsense.

1325
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:23,661
Well, has anyone taken a look at her?

1326
01:24:32,682 --> 01:24:34,220
Lock this place up.

1327
01:24:34,221 --> 01:24:36,655
I don't want anybody in here until I tell you so.

1328
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:38,370
Got it?

1329
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,062
That will not be a problem.

1330
01:24:41,613 --> 01:24:42,662
Alright.

1331
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:52,798
Hey Sammie.

1332
01:24:53,978 --> 01:24:54,746
How you doing?

1333
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:56,771
Hi! (Laughing)

1334
01:24:56,928 --> 01:24:58,317
I'm Sammie!

1335
01:24:59,115 --> 01:24:59,938
You're gonna be okay.

1336
01:25:00,108 --> 01:25:01,201
(Screaming)

1337
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:02,222
I'll kill you!

1338
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:04,535
I'll kill everyone!

1339
01:25:05,204 --> 01:25:06,593
(Screaming)

1340
01:26:38,089 --> 01:26:39,408
(Screaming)

1341
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:45,913
That must be the girl they found in the church.

1342
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:47,070
I heard they were giving her drugs

1343
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,249
and she went crazy!

1344
01:26:48,643 --> 01:26:50,923
I will have vengeance!

1345
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:58,889
(Screaming)

1346
01:27:14,686 --> 01:27:16,070
She claims she's Mama.

1347
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:17,511
Mama?

1348
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,406
Yes, the woman from the news that --

1349
01:27:19,407 --> 01:27:22,176
captured all those people and ran that church.

1350
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:25,974
It must be a protection mechanism.

1351
01:27:27,013 --> 01:27:29,013
No one can keep me here.

1352
01:27:29,556 --> 01:27:31,809
My power is infinite

1353
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:56,739
(Screaming)
