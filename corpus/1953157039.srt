1
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,035
Oh no, Malice.

2
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,589
Malice, stop.

3
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,195
Malice.

4
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,555
Malice.

5
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,714
Malice.

6
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,154
There you are.

7
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,310
Hard way or the easy way.

8
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,236
Malice.

9
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,315
Malice.

10
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,555
Yes.

11
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,028
Doctor Queenie.
We have a situation.

12
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,475
Oh really?

13
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,511
One of our patients escaped.

14
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,590
Malice.

15
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,672
You incompetent moron.

16
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,635
I locked her door.
I don't know what happened.

17
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,837
Find her.

18
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,991
I do everything for you.

19
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,155
Get out!

20
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,670
Oh no.

21
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,876
Not without me.

22
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,638
Hey, wait for me.

23
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,795
Rabbit.

24
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,475
Where are you rabbit?

25
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,675
Are you in there?

26
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,036
Rabbit?

27
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,669
Is this your home?

28
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,876
Weird.

29
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,675
What are you anyway?

30
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,827
Is this real or is it a costume?

31
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,230
At least I'm not walking
around bare-assed anymore.

32
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,435
There you are.

33
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,073
Where are you Malice?

34
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,436
Could you be... here?

35
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,796
My clothes.

36
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Don't move asshole.
- Is this a gun?

37
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,274
It's a really big one.
Are you trying to break in?

38
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,908
That is not necessary.

39
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,993
I need information.
I'm looking for a girl.

40
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:38,157
You better get off my property.

41
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,993
I'm gone already.

42
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,156
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

43
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,917
One.

44
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,947
Two...
- Wait, the car won't start.

45
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,991
I hope to God that car don't start.
- Wait.

46
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,558
Four.

47
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:01,990
Get the fuck out of here.

48
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,193
Did you see that?
- Baby, what happened?

49
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,635
My pack is bigger than his.

50
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:13,838
You showed that son of a jackal.
- Yes, I did.

51
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,719
The way you stuck out
that gun at him.

52
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,271
That made me so horny.

53
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,195
Hey, Rabbit.

54
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,749
I want it.

55
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,075
Hey, stop that.

56
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,353
Yes?

57
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,109
It's me.
- Tell me you have her.

58
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,032
Well, almost.
I am on her tail, Queenie.

59
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,470
It's doctor Queenie to you.

60
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,597
Doctor, please.

61
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,199
Listen.

62
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,154
I will really hurt you
if you don't find the girl.

63
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,954
But Queenie, I mean doctor Queenie.

64
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,276
You can't be serious.
- Oh, but I am.

65
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,795
She escaped, because you're
too busy jerking off.

66
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,275
Get her back and don't call
for no good reason.

67
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,790
Quid pro quo.
- What?

68
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,790
I do something for you,
you do something for me.

69
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,674
What do you mean?
- I want to take pictures of you.

70
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,071
What kind of pictures
do you want?

71
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,317
Let me guess.
- It's not what you think.

72
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,632
I'm an artistic photographer.
- Yeah right.

73
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:07,757
Come on, do I look
like a pervert to you?

74
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,234
We'll see.
- Awesome.

75
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,515
What's your name, sweetie?
- Malice. And you?

76
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,558
I'm Chester Catz, with a "z".

77
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,150
What where you doing
in the desert on your own?

78
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,113
Some crazy guy was chasing me.
- Some crazy guy?

79
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,508
Shit, dat is hem.
Dat is Jabbowski.

80
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,715
The guy I was telling about.

81
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,230
Don't stop, go.

82
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,469
Stop the car, sir.

83
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,273
What did that guy want from you?

84
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,433
He's after me and he's crazy.
That's for damn sure.

85
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,115
Where are you going?
- Curiosity killed the cat.

86
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,797
Can I get one of your
nicest rooms please?

87
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,511
That would be a hundred bucks.

88
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,709
Here you go. Thank you.

89
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,669
So, here it is.

90
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,748
What do you want me to do now?
- Wait a minute.

91
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,597
I got some stuff in here.

92
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,635
You'll look great in that.

93
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,314
Don't you think?
- No.

94
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,794
Come on.
You'll look hot in that.

95
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,352
Come on.

96
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,751
Two seconds.

97
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,715
I am not wearing that.

98
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,950
No, it's for me.

99
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,396
You're kidding.

100
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,870
How can you see anything?
- I got cat eyes.

101
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,591
Somebody had a weird childhood.
- Whatever.

102
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,790
Let's start.

103
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:48,153
Want to come to
the Matt Hadder party?

104
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,351
Ok, cool.
What kind of party is it?

105
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,108
You'll find out.
I just gotta see my friend.

106
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,910
It's gonna be fun.
- Sure.

107
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,233
Kater.
What's up buddy?

108
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:17,108
I'm good mate.
Listen, I need to come around.

109
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,113
Cool. See you in a bit.

110
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,434
Cats, caterpillars...

111
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,636
What's next? Monkeys?

112
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,671
What the fuck?

113
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:22,959
What happened?
What's going on?

114
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:25,758
Shit.

115
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,751
Is he dead?

116
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,992
Hey.

117
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,516
Are you awake?

118
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,274
That's it girls, come on.
Yeah, shake it. Nice.

119
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,878
Shake those titties.

120
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,590
That's how you do it.

121
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,119
Kater.

122
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:16,072
Catz, my long lost buddy,
how are you?

123
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,317
Sit. Look what the cat dragged in.

124
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,197
What a pretty kitty.

125
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,956
Kater, this is Malice.
- Sit here so I can look at you.

126
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,118
Hi there.

127
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,157
See those girls?
They're auditioning for me.

128
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:35,112
What do you think?
I like them titties.

129
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,515
I like very much.

130
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,719
Malice, do you want to join them?
- No thanks.

131
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,032
You don't like girls?
- I do, but not now.

132
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,437
A pity.
It would be a great show.

133
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,870
You know what?
If I had titts...

134
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,468
I would squeeze them
all day long.

135
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,753
I would suck and I'd lick the
nipples and make myself...

136
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,918
all horny and everything.
I swear, I would...

137
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,714
Do you think I'm strange?
- Everybody has his thing, Kater.

138
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,076
What's yours? Pussy or dick?

139
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:17,473
As long as it's hard or wet.
- Sweet. You're my kinda girl.

140
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,877
Can I please see your titts?
- What? No.

141
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,035
Keep your eyes on the girls.

142
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,829
Incoming, Catz.

143
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,519
Thanks man.

144
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,709
As for you...

145
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,474
Don't worry.
It's not gonna kill you.

146
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,710
It's not gonna hurt you.

147
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,879
Just take a little bite,
and you're gonna feel real great.

148
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,197
And now?
What's gonna happen?

149
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:58,230
Don't be so impatient. Just relax.

150
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,876
Sit back and enjoy the great show.

151
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,037
And if you'll excuse me.

152
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,312
This is the way I like it.
Catz?

153
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,589
What's with him?
- He does that all the time.

154
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,396
Malice, let's go.

155
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,309
Nice place.
- Ofcourse, I know. It's mine.

156
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,070
Hey Matt.

157
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,594
It's ladies night, your friend...

158
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,671
she don't need to pay.

159
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,273
How come I never get a free ride.
- Because.

160
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:02,834
Anyway, I'd love to stay
and chat...

161
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,918
but I gotta go, me so horny.

162
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,509
Where is he going?

163
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,638
The cat's gonna ride
a couple of kitties.

164
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,718
Cute, but...

165
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:20,149
in need of a haircut.

166
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,836
What did you do that for?

167
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,272
Don't ever criticize
a girl about her hair.

168
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,754
That bitch is hardcore.

169
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,796
Do you need an enema?

170
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,716
I'm gonna fuck the both of you.

171
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,956
You wanna join?

172
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,397
I'm gonna browse around first.

173
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,598
Enjoy the bunnies.

174
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,238
You're just in time pretty girl.

175
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,995
There was no better time.
- What do you mean?

176
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,429
My girl here likes to watch me.

177
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,831
She loves it when I make out
with another girl.

178
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,836
Why don't you come over here?

179
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,118
I need to talk to you sir.

180
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,276
No, you don't.

181
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,196
Yes, I do.

182
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,753
Do I know you?
- Sir, my name is Jabbowski.

183
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:17,111
I need to ask you some questions
about someone I'm looking for.

184
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,197
Are you Polish?

185
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,436
Are you kidding me?

186
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,076
Nice titties girls,
keep shaking them.

187
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,350
Lebowski. My long lost friend.
How are you?

188
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,868
You are mess, what happened to you?

189
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,071
What?
- I'm kidding.

190
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,111
Sit down, take a load off.

191
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,316
I prefer to stand.

192
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,149
Have you seen a girl
with an Asian guy?

193
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,880
As a matter of fact I did.

194
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,193
Can you tell me where?
- Well, they're...

195
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,198
not here.
- So, where are they?

196
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,313
You ask me all these
difficult questions.

197
01:06:17,919 --> 01:06:21,195
I am gonna ask you one more time.

198
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,517
Where is Malice?
- Malice, phallus.

199
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,315
Enjoy the show.
Don't you like my girls?

200
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,432
See those titties.
I want to squeeze them...

201
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,756
from now till next Christmas.

202
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,869
That's a weapon.
Is your dick that big?

203
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,230
Girls don't leave.
Come back.

204
01:06:41,439 --> 01:06:44,590
I ask one more time,
where are they?

205
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,193
At a party.
- Where is this party?

206
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,834
At Matt Hadder's.
- Where?

207
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,316
My stage is empty.
What was the question?

208
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,269
Where are they?
- On Purple Street. Leave me alone.

209
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,069
My girls just left,
you know how to get them back?

210
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,396
Or let me see your titties.

211
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,029
Now you've got confidence issues.

212
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,276
Let me get some pictures.

213
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,270
Where is Malice?
- She is in one of the rooms.

214
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,595
Shut up and don't move.

215
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,716
What?

216
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,632
I didn't realize
you had an appointment.

217
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,993
Shut up.
Well, if it isn't my little friend.

218
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,510
Where is she?
- I don't know. What do you want?

219
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,073
Don't tempt me,
I will shoot.

220
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,795
Why don't you take
your big gun, and go fuck...

221
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,276
Now look what you made me do.

222
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,078
Holy shit, what the fuck was that?

223
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:21,832
Queenie.

224
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:25,429
I have a license plate.
I need an address.

225
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,995
Where is Humptee?
- What?

226
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,196
Look there he goes.

227
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,552
What are you doing here?
- I wasn't just gonna stand there.

228
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,196
Stop the car Todd,
we're letting her out right here.

229
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,955
You can't let her out,
with that creep out there.

230
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,833
Okay, alright.

231
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:48,310
Todd, we gotta get there.
We only got two hours.

232
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,155
What about Humptee, we need him.
- I'll call him.

233
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,909
Are you alright?
Where are you?

234
01:17:56,599 --> 01:17:59,113
What do you mean, fuck off?

235
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:01,748
They were not after us. What?

236
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,435
He thinks that guy is after us.

237
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,069
Now what?
- Another cameraman?

238
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:11,668
He was the only one
available today.

239
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,348
Guys, why don't just ask her?

240
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
Because she is not qualified.

241
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,631
It's not like we're shooting
a Spielberg movie.

242
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,592
Have a little respect.

243
01:18:23,839 --> 01:18:27,798
We have years of experience.
This will be a masterpiece.

244
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,197
I'm getting paid
for the entire day.

245
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,637
She's right.
We put all our money into this.

246
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,594
We got to shoot today.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

247
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,394
Hey girl, you know
how to hold a camera?

248
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,118
Film us when we fuck.
- You get 250 bucks.

249
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,276
Say what?

250
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:49,788
It's not even hard.
Get the camera.

251
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,390
Aim it, push record
and I'll do the rest.

252
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,670
We've could have left you
with that shooterboy.

253
01:18:57,919 --> 01:18:59,955
I'll do it.
- Awesome.

254
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,752
You're gonna work with us
on a masterpiece.

255
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,830
What can I do you for young man?

256
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,838
I am looking for Mr. Todd Tweed.

257
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:22,238
He's with his brother Ted.
They're making their film.

258
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,635
Where can I find them?

259
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,910
They're at Ed's diner.

260
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,635
They're doing the
boy boy girl scene.

261
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,035
It's their DP shoot today.

262
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:35,791
DP?

263
01:19:35,999 --> 01:19:40,356
Double penetration, when
one boy fucks her in the vagina...

264
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,313
and the other one
in her asshole.

265
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:46,511
Haven't you ever seen
porn before, young man?

266
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:51,350
Where is this diner?
- It's on highway 69, exit 7.

267
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,479
Thank you.

268
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,831
One more thing, handsome.
- Yes, ma'am?

269
01:19:58,039 --> 01:19:59,995
You wanna fuck me?

270
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:12,517
This is great.
- This is nice.

271
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:19,034
The camera is in the car.
Lacie, get your outfit and makeup.

272
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:25,038
Scene five:. "The Diner".

273
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,470
That waitress is kinda hot.

274
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,478
Why don't we ask her
what's on the menu?

275
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:33,994
We'd like to order something.

276
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:38,109
What can I do you sweeties for?

277
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,153
You can do both of us.

278
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,316
How about a sandwich?

279
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,592
No, rabbit!

280
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,951
Put the gun down Jack.

281
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,312
Hold her down.
I need her ass.

282
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:40,835
Only eight more lives.
