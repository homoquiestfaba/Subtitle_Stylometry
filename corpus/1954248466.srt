1
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,324
HE ONLY TAUGHT
FOR 3 1 /2 YEARS,

2
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,794
YET IN ONE GENERATION

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,696
WHAT HE SAID
TRANSFORMED THE WORLD.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,065
ALL THE ARMIES
THAT EVER MARCHED,

5
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,893
ALL THE NAVIES
THAT EVER SAILED;

6
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,904
AND ALL THE KINGS
THAT EVER REIGNED, COMBINED,

7
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,496
HAVE NOT AFFECTED HISTORY

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,304
AS MUCH
AS THIS ONE SOLITARY LIFE.

9
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,536
NOW,
TWO THOUSAND YEARS LATER

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,308
HIS FOLLOWERS NUMBER
IN THE BILLIONS

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,643
AND COVER THE EARTH,

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,547
YET THE PRACTICE
OF MODERN CHRISTIANITY TODAY

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:58,547
SCARCELY RESEMBLES
THE EARLY TEACHINGS OF JESUS

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,954
PROPHEC Y FORETOLD
THIS WOULD HAPPEN...

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,746
CIRCA AD 91
PRISON ISLAND - PATMOS

16
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,864
A WOMAN,
A CHILD AND A DRAGON.

17
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,695
AT FIRST GLANCE
THIS MIGHT SOUND

18
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,294
LIKE THE INGREDIENTS
FOR A FRIGHTENING FAIRY TALE.

19
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,234
IN FACT, THE TROUBLING SCENES
THAT YOU JUST WITNESSED

20
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,106
ARE PART OF A TRUE
AND POWERFUL PROPHEC Y

21
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,011
GIVEN TO THE APOSTLE JOHN
NEARLY 2,000 YEARS AGO.

22
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,548
WHAT DOES THIS PROPHEC Y,

23
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,811
FOUND IN REVELATION 1 2,
TELL US?

24
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,318
DOES IT POINT TO SOME EVENT

25
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,282
THAT HAPPENED
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO

26
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,050
OR DOES IT DESCRIBE THINGS

27
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,116
THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE
IN THE NEAR FUTURE?

28
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,683
AND WHO DO THE WOMAN,

29
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,162
THE DRAGON
AND THE CHILD REPRESENT?

30
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,166
JOIN US NOW AS WE JOURNEY
DEEP INTO A WORLD

31
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,068
THAT FEW HAVE EVER SEEN
BUT ALL ARE A PART OF.

32
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,040
REVELATION: THE BRIDE,
THE BEAST AND BABYLON.

33
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,750
REVELATION: THE BRIDE,
THE BEAST AND BABYLON

34
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,949
IN THE LAST BOOK
OF THE BIBLE, REVELATION,

35
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,990
THE APOSTLE JOHN
WAS SHOWN A VISION

36
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,152
OF A GREAT STRUGGLE
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL,

37
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,819
A PROPHEC Y OF A BATTLE

38
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,989
THAT HAS BEEN RAGING
BEHIND THE SCENES

39
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,226
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

40
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
THE SECRETS
BEHIND THIS PROPHEC Y

41
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,999
HAVE BEEN SHROUDED
IN MYSTERY FOR CENTURIES...

42
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,835
UNTIL NOW.

43
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,272
FROM THE KINGDOMS
AND THE RULERS

44
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,934
THAT HAVE FALLEN
AROUND THE WORLD

45
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,342
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN
THAT STOOD UP TO FIGHT

46
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,879
FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN,

47
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,609
THIS IS THE STORY
OF CHRISTIANITY,

48
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,945
THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH

49
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,953
AND THE FOUNDATION
FOR THE FAITH OF BILLIONS.

50
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,847
''NOW A GREAT SIGN
APPEARED IN HEAVEN:

51
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,052
''A WOMAN
CLOTHED WITH THE SUN,

52
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,856
''WITH THE MOON
UNDER HER FEET,

53
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,160
''AND ON HER HEAD
A GARLAND OF TWELVE STARS...

54
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,893
''...THEN BEING WITH CHILD,

55
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,334
''SHE CRIED OUT IN LABOR
AND IN PAIN TO GIVE BIRTH...

56
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,201
''AND THE DRAGON
STOOD BEFORE THE WOMAN

57
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,967
''WHO WAS READY TO GIVE BIRTH,

58
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,408
TO DEVOUR HER CHILD
AS SOON AS IT WAS BORN.''

59
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,703
MANY BIBLE SCHOLARS
AND HISTORIANS

60
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,715
HAVE STUDIED THIS PROPHEC Y
OVER THE YEARS

61
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,082
AND AGREED THAT THE PROPHEC Y
OF REVELATION 1 2

62
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,780
POINTS TO AN EVENT

63
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,722
KNOWN AS ''THE MASSACRE
OF THE INNOCENTS''

64
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,089
WHICH OCCURRED
IN FIRST CENTURY JUDEA.

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
IN THE DECADES LEADING UP
TO THE BIRTH OF CHRIST,

66
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,093
THE ROMAN EMPIRE

67
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,995
HAD CONQUERED THE WHOLE
MEDITERRANEAN WORLD,

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,795
INCLUDING JUDEA.

69
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,927
AND AT VARIOUS POINTS
IN THAT HISTORY

70
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,733
THEY HAD DIFFERENT PEOPLE
RULING OVER IT.

71
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,401
TWENTY YEARS BEFORE JESUS
WAS BORN YOU HAVE KING HEROD,

72
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,343
A CLIENT KING FOR ROME.

73
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,041
WE HAVE DOCUMENTS
ABOUT HIM OUTSIDE THE BIBLE

74
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,413
THAT TELL US
THAT HE WAS VERY CRUEL.

75
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,918
HE WAS CAPABLE
OF KILLING HIS OWN SONS.

76
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,284
HE WAS RUTHLESS

77
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,813
AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO GET ON HIS BAD SIDE.

78
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,757
HEROD WAS VERY ANXIOUS

79
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,694
WHEN A SMALL DELEGATION
OF WISE MEN FROM THE EAST

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,253
CAME TO JERUSALEM

81
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,994
ANNOUNCING THEIR SEARCH
FOR THE NEWBORN KING OF THE JEWS.

82
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,797
WHY WOULD HEROD
BE UPSET ABOUT THAT?

83
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,033
BECAUSE THAT WAS HEROD'S TITLE
AS BESTOWED UPON HIM

84
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,837
BY THE ROMAN EMPIRE:
KING OF THE JEWS.

85
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,208
AND HE ASKS
HIS ASTROLOGERS,

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,769
''HOW LONG IS IT POSSIBLE

87
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,712
THIS CHILD
COULD HAVE BEEN BORN AGO?''

88
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,044
AND THEY DETERMINE

89
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,017
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN
MAYBE 2 YEARS AT MOST

90
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,144
SINCE THIS CHILD WAS BORN,
MAYBE LESS.

91
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:40,386
HE FINDS OUT FROM
THE PHARISEES AND THE SADDUCEES

92
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,486
EXACTLY WHERE THIS CHILD
WAS TO BE BORN

93
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,355
AND HE FINDS OUT
IT'S BETHLEHEM

94
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,195
AND HE WORRIED
ABOUT LOSING HIS THRONE.

95
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,963
AND SO HE HAS SUCH ANGER
AGAINST THIS CHILD

96
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,906
HE SENDS IN THE SOLDIERS
TO TRY AND KILL JESUS.

97
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,171
THE BIBLE TELLS US
THIS BARBARIC ACT

98
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,307
WAS INSPIRED BY MORE THAN JUST
THE TYRANNICAL JEALOUSY

99
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,011
OF AN OLD KING.

100
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,985
MANY BIBLE SCHOLARS BELIEVE

101
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,215
THAT IT'S PART
OF A MUCH BIGGER STRUGGLE

102
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,283
THAT HAS SPANNED THE AGES
AND IS STILL HAPPENING TODAY.

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,090
TO UNCOVER THE SECRETS
OF THIS PROPHEC Y

104
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,564
WE'RE GOING TO FIRST NEED
TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN CHARACTERS:

105
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,592
THE WOMAN, THE CHILD
AND THE DRAGON.

106
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,329
HE SAYS, ''THEN I SAW
ANOTHER SIGN, A WOMAN,

107
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,536
''CLOTHED WITH THE SUN,
WITH THE MOON UNDER HER FEET,

108
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,069
AND ON HER HEAD A CROWN
OF TWELVE STARS.''

109
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,844
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE WOMAN.

110
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,217
WE KNOW THAT SHE'S A SYMBOL
OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING.

111
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,385
DOES THE BIBLE TELL US
WHAT THIS WOMAN REPRESENTS?

112
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,556
''HUSBANDS LOVE YOUR WIVES,

113
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,622
''JUST AS CHRIST
LOVED THE CHURCH

114
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,267
AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR HER.''

115
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,165
WE GATHER FROM THIS

116
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,399
THAT THE CHURCH
IS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST.

117
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,465
NOT ONLY
IS SHE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST

118
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,377
BUT IN A CERTAIN SENSE,
SINCE NO MAN HATES HIS OWN FLESH,

119
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,280
THE CHURCH IS JESUS' BODY.

120
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,409
VERY CLEARLY A WOMAN,
IN SCRIPTURE,

121
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,385
REPRESENTS THE CHURCH.

122
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,288
YOU HAVE A WOMAN
AS REPRESENTATIVE OF GOD'S PEOPLE.

123
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,620
WE SEE THIS
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.

124
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,489
WE SEE IT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

125
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,392
JESUS COMES
FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

126
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,091
AND THEN THE CHURCH GROWS UP

127
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,963
AS SOMETHING
THAT JESUS DEVELOPS.

128
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,527
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS WOMAN
IS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH

129
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,267
TO A SPECIAL MALE CHILD.

130
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,968
WHO IS THE CHILD?

131
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,374
WE HAVE
A COUPLE OF INDICATIONS:

132
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,005
ONE: HE RULES WITH A ROD OF IRON
OVER THE NATIONS.

133
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,641
THAT'S A REFERENCE
TO THE OLD TESTAMENT

134
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,514
WHERE CLEARLY
GOD IS THE ONE

135
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,680
RULING OVER THE NATIONS
WITH A ROD OF IRON.

136
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,424
AND THEN HE SAYS
HE'S CAUGHT UP INTO HEAVEN

137
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,289
AND WHO IS CAUGHT UP
INTO HEAVEN?

138
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,691
JESUS CHRIST, RIGHT?

139
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,021
HE'S THE KING OF KINGS
AND LORD OF LORDS.

140
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,156
SO THESE TWO INDICATIONS
PRETTY DEFINITIVELY TELL US

141
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,064
THAT THIS IS JESUS.

142
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,626
NOW LET'S CONSIDER
THE ARCH VILLAIN

143
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,162
IN THIS IMPORTANT PROPHEC Y:
THE DRAGON.

144
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,568
''AND ANOTHER SIGN
APPEARED IN HEAVEN:

145
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,171
BEHOLD, A GREAT,
FIERY RED DRAGON...''

146
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,413
I WISH I COULD JUST GIVE YOU
A FANCIFUL THEORY HERE,

147
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,954
BUT THE BIBLE TELLS US
WHO THE DRAGON IS.

148
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,388
THE DRAGON IS THE DEVIL.

149
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,551
BOTH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
AND THE NEW TESTAMENT

150
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,094
WHO TRIES TO DESTROY?

151
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,027
THAT IS SATAN,
THE ANGEL, THE DEVIL.

152
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,359
AND SO HE ATTACKS

153
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,424
AS SOON AS CHRIST COMES
UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH;

154
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,366
THE ATTACK IS THERE.

155
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,265
''SO THE GREAT DRAGON
WAS CAST OUT,

156
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,639
''THAT SERPENT OF OLD,
CALLED THE DEVIL AND SATAN.

157
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,679
''WHO DECEIVES
THE WHOLE WORLD;

158
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,475
''HE WAS CAST TO THE EARTH,

159
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,415
AND HIS ANGELS
WERE CAST OUT WITH HIM.''

160
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,755
WHAT WE SEE HERE
IN THE FIRST PART OF REVELATION 1 2

161
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,650
IS A SYMBOLIC PORTRAYAL

162
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,684
OF THE AGE-OLD CONFLICT
BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN.

163
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,491
AND WE FIND THIS DESCRIPTION

164
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,260
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN

165
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,096
WHERE YOU HAVE
A SNAKE WITH WINGS.

166
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,137
WHAT'S A SNAKE WITH WINGS?
IT'S A FORM OF A DRAGON.

167
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,070
AND WE HAVE THIS SERPENT,
THIS DRAGON,

168
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,472
COMING ALL THE WAY DOWN
THROUGH SCRIPTURES.

169
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,033
ALL THROUGH THE LIFE
AND MINISTRY OF CHRIST

170
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,637
SATAN TRIED TO DISRUPT
JESUS' PLANS

171
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,615
TO PROVIDE SALVATION
FOR HUMANITY.

172
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,676
''BUT HE WAS WOUNDED
FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS,

173
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,121
''HE WAS BRUISED
FOR OUR INIQUITIES;

174
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,353
''THE CHASTISEMENT
FOR OUR PEACE WAS UPON HIM,

175
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,123
AND BY HIS STRIPES
WE ARE HEALED.''

176
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,794
AT VARIOUS POINTS
THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF SYNAGOGUES

177
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,797
AND WANTED
TO PUSH HIM OFF A CLIFF.

178
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,401
THEY TRIED TO SILENCE HIM.

179
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,065
THEY TORTURED HIM
TO DEATH PUBLICLY.

180
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,372
BUT SATAN'S SCHEME
TO DERAIL THE PLAN OF SALVATION

181
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,437
WAS UTTERLY SHATTERED
WHEN JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

182
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,250
''AND HER CHILD WAS CAUGHT UP
TO GOD AND HIS THRONE.''

183
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,786
WITH THE SON OF GOD
NOW PHYSICALLY BEYOND HIS REACH,

184
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,659
THE DEVIL DIRECTED ALL OF HIS FURY
AT THE FOLLOWERS OF JESUS,

185
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,721
THE NEW CHRISTIANS.

186
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,357
HE DID MUCH OF THIS

187
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,368
THROUGH THE CRUEL POWER
OF IMPERIAL ROME.

188
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,128
''NOW WHEN THE DRAGON SAW

189
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,140
''THAT HE HAD BEEN CAST
TO THE EARTH,

190
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,505
''HE PERSECUTED THE WOMAN

191
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,272
WHO GAVE BIRTH
TO THE MALE CHILD.''

192
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,714
CHRISTIANITY WAS A STRUGGLING,
SMALL PERSECUTED MINORITY

193
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,650
THAT DIDN'T HAVE OFFICIAL STATUS
IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE

194
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,846
AND THERE WERE
A SERIES OF PERSECUTIONS,

195
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,317
SOME OF WHICH
WERE QUITE SEVERE.

196
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,087
ONE OF THE ROLES OF RELIGION
IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE

197
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,253
WAS TO ENSURE
THE WELL-BEING OF THE STATE.

198
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,763
THE IDEA WAS IF THE GODS
WERE WORSHIPED PROPERLY

199
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,595
THEN THEY
WOULD FAVOR THE EMPIRE

200
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,259
AND IF THEY
WERE WORSHIPED IMPROPERLY

201
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,327
THEN BAD THINGS
WOULD HAPPEN TO THE EMPIRE

202
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,202
AS A RESULT OF DIVINE WRATH.

203
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:06,438
THEY DO NOT WANT
TO SACRIFICE TO THE GODS

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,776
AND THE GODS AT THAT POINT
INCLUDE THE EMPEROR.

205
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,510
SO IT'S EASY
TO CONSIDER THESE PEOPLE

206
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,108
RELIGIOUS SCAPEGOATS.

207
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,743
BASICALLY,
IF SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,788
PROBABLY IT'S BECAUSE
THERE ARE CHRISTIANS AROUND

209
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,450
WHO ARE REFUSING TO GIVE THE GODS
THEIR PROPER DUE.

210
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,254
OF COURSE
YOU HAVE TO PUNISH THEM

211
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,194
AND PUNISHMENT MEANT,
MOST OF THE TIME, DEATH.

212
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,560
WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT

213
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,795
WAS THAT CHRISTIANS
GATHERED TOGETHER

214
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,703
ALSO SEEMED TO MAKE LOVE
WITH THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

215
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,330
BECAUSE THERE
WERE RUMORS ABOUT THEM

216
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,171
THAT THEY COMMIT INCEST.

217
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,735
THE CHRISTIANS USED TO CALL
THEMSELVES ''BROTHER'' AND ''SISTER''

218
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,247
AND THEY USED TO EAT
THE FLESH OF CHRIST.

219
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,307
PEOPLE HEARD, APPARENTLY,

220
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,149
THAT CHRISTIANS
WERE EATING CHILDREN.

221
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,518
SO WHEN PAGANS
HEARD ABOUT THIS

222
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,921
THEY THOUGHT THE WORSE;
THEY ASSUMED THE WORST.

223
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,922
CHRISTIANS ARE PROGRESSIVELY
STRIPPED OF THEIR CIVIL OFFICES,

224
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,685
THEIR MILITARY OFFICES.

225
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,425
THEIR BOOKS ARE CONFISCATED.
THEIR CHURCHES ARE DESTROYED.

226
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,330
THEY'RE FORBIDDEN
TO MEET AND SO ON,

227
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,266
ALL BECAUSE THERE'S AN ANXIETY

228
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:09,171
THAT THIS IS REALLY UNDERMINING
THE WELFARE OF THE EMPIRE.

229
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,175
AS THE EARLY CHURCH SUFFERED

230
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,178
UNDER THIS WITHERING
PERSECUTION OF ROME,

231
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,943
THEIR LIVES BECAME A POWERFUL
TESTIMONY FOR TRUTH.

232
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,778
WHILE THE PAGANS LIVED
IN CONSTANT SUPERSTITIOUS FEAR,

233
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,550
THESE CHRISTIANS
FACED TORTURE AND DEATH

234
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,682
WITH A SUPERNATURAL PEACE.

235
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,354
BASICALLY, WHAT NERO DID
WAS HE FED THEM TO THE LIONS.

236
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,525
HE HAD THEM TIED TO PILLARS,
PUT PITCH ON THEM,

237
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,898
AND THEN HE SET THEM ON FIRE
AS HUMAN TORCHES

238
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,802
SO THEY COULD HAVE THE FESTIVITIES
CONTINUE ON INTO THE NIGHT.

239
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,239
HE HAD THEM STRETCHED,
PULLED INTO TWO,

240
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,641
BEING KILLED BY GLADIATORS.

241
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,839
JUST ABOUT EVERY CREATIVE WAY

242
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,281
THAT YOU CAN DISPOSE
OF CHRISTIANS.

243
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,819
WHEN FACING
THE PAINFUL END OF THEIR LIVES

244
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,355
THEY OFTEN SANG AND REJOICED.

245
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,685
AS THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIANS

246
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,453
PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE
FOR THEIR FAITH,

247
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,518
THEIR DYING PRAYERS AND BLOOD

248
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,655
ESSENTIALLY BECAME SEED
FOR THE NEW CHURCH.

249
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:13,570
PEOPLE ARE SO ENTHRALLED
BY HOW THESE CHRISTIANS ARE DYING

250
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,406
THAT IMMEDIATELY
THE REACTION IS, ''SIGN ME UP.''

251
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,911
AND SO THE CHRISTIANS
SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE.

252
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,572
THE MORE YOU KILLED THEM

253
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,343
THE MORE THEY STOOD
FOR THEIR FAITH.

254
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,907
IT IS TRUE AND I THINK
IT HAS TO BE EMPHASIZED,

255
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,476
THAT THE EARLY CHURCH SPREADS

256
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,752
DESPITE THE VERY CONCERTED
ATTEMPTS AT REPRESSION

257
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,955
OF EXTREMELY AUTOCRATIC
AND POWERFUL EMPERORS

258
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,361
WHO SET THEMSELVES VERY FIRMLY
AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS

259
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,626
AND YET THE EARLY CHURCH SURVIVES.

260
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,601
TERTULLIAN ARGUES,
WHENEVER SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

261
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,764
WHENEVER THERE'S A FAMINE,
OR WHENEVER THERE AN ILLNESS,

262
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,603
A PESTILENCE
THAT SWEEPS THROUGH,

263
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,906
EVERYBODY SAYS,
''THE CHRISTIANS TO THE LION,''

264
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,570
AND THEN HE SAYS SNIDELY,

265
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,706
''AS IF SO MANY
COULD BE FED TO SO FEW.''

266
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,048
AND HIS POINT
IS THAT YOU CAN'T DESTROY US ALL.

267
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,312
DURING THIS TIME
OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH,

268
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,881
CHRISTIANS ALL ACROSS
THE ROMAN EMPIRE

269
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,951
QUITE LITERALLY
WENT UNDERGROUND.

270
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,361
THIS LABYRINTH
OF TUNNELS AND CHAMBERS

271
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,990
BENEATH THE ROMAN CITIES

272
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,332
BECAME KNOWN
AS ''THE CATACOMBS.''

273
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:23,432
NOW, THE CATACOMBS
ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND.

274
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,771
FIRST, MANY PEOPLE IMAGINE

275
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,038
THAT THERE ARE CAVES
NATURALLY UNDER ROME

276
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,012
AND THE CHRISTIANS
SIMPLY WENT INTO THEM.

277
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,709
THE CATACOMBS,
ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION,

278
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,752
ARE NOT NATURAL CAVES.

279
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,754
THEY WERE EXCAVATED
BY THE CHRISTIANS.

280
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,690
AND SO THE CHRISTIANS MADE
A WHOLE LABYRINTH UNDERGROUND.

281
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,887
SOMETIMES SERVICES
WOULD BE HELD THERE

282
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,796
IN THE VERY TOMBS
OF THE MARTYRS.

283
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,700
THE SECOND POINT IS THE VERY ACT
OF BURYING YOUR DEAD

284
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,761
IS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT.

285
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,331
CHRISTIANS BELIEVE
IN A RESURRECTION OF THE BODY.

286
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,037
OF COURSE, THAT BELIEF
HAS SHIFTED AND CHANGED

287
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,410
OVER THE CENTURIES,
BUT FROM ALL WE UNDERSTAND,

288
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,678
EARLY CHRISTIANS BELIEVED
THAT THEY WOULD BE RESURRECTED

289
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,345
IN THAT ACTUAL
BODILY FORM, AND THEREFORE,

290
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,483
THEY CHOSE TO BURY THEIR DEAD,
NOT TO CREMATE THEM.

291
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,891
THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE SEEN
TO BE BURYING YOUR DEAD,

292
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,485
ESPECIALLY AT TIMES

293
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,929
WHEN THERE ARE INTENSE
WAVES OF PERSECUTION,

294
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,364
YOU'RE MORE OR LESS
SAYING TO THE POLICE,

295
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,870
''COME AND INVESTIGATE ME.
I MAY WELL BE A CHRISTIAN.''

296
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,638
IN AD 306, A NEW ROMAN EMPEROR
CAME INTO POWER

297
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,645
AND THINGS
BEGAN TO RAPIDLY CHANGE.

298
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,080
CONSTANTINE THE GREAT
WAS A CAPABLE MILITARY LEADER

299
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,482
AND A SHREWD POLITICIAN.

300
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,918
SO CONSTANTINE HAD TO FIGHT
A SERIES OF CIVIL WARS

301
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,580
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

302
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,055
HIS POLITICAL AIM
OF BECOMING EMPEROR

303
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,059
AND THAT'S HIS OWN
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL AIM

304
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,924
THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH CHRISTIANITY.

305
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,429
HE GOES DOWN FROM GAUL-
MODERN DAY FRANCE-

306
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,829
WHERE HIS POWER BASE WAS,

307
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,026
TO CONFRONT
HIS RIVAL MAXENTIUS, IN ITALY.

308
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,559
CONSTANTINE MOVES DOWN
FROM THE NORTH -

309
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,699
AND YOU THINK OF ITALY,
THERE'S THIS LONG STRETCH -

310
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,868
AND HE WINS ONE BATTLE
AFTER ANOTHER.

311
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,673
AS HE WAS MARCHING
WITH HIS ARMY

312
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,182
HE HAD A DREAM ONE NIGHT
WHERE GOD CAME TO HIM

313
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,078
AND TOLD HIM
''YOU WILL BECOME A CHRISTIAN

314
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,089
AND PUT THIS SIGN ON YOUR SHIELD
AND YOU WILL CONQUER.''

315
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,183
SHORTLY AFTER THAT
HE ACTUALLY HAD A VISION,

316
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,724
WHICH HISTORY TELLS US
WAS SEEN BY HIS ARMY

317
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,092
AS WELL AS
BY CONSTANTINE, HIMSELF.

318
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,964
HE LOOKED UP TO THE SUN
AND HE SAW A CROSS OF LIGHT ABOVE IT

319
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:34,131
AND THE GREEK WORKS
''EN TOUTU NIKA'': BY THIS, CONQUER.

320
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,735
THE STORY
THAT HE HAD HAD THIS DREAM

321
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,107
DOES APPEAR
AT A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE.

322
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,806
IT'S DESCRIBED BY EUSEBIUS.

323
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,472
THERE ARE DIFFERENT SOURCES.

324
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,948
THERE ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS,

325
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,951
BUT IT DOES SEEM
THAT CONSTANTINE DOES SAY,

326
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,487
''I'VE HAD
THIS DIVINE ENCOUNTER

327
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,920
''AND AN ANGEL HAS TOLD ME

328
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,584
THAT IN THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
I WILL CONQUER.''

329
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,056
CONSTANTINE
COMMANDED HIS TROOPS

330
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:02,533
TO ADORN THEIR SHIELDS
WITH THE CHRISTIAN SYMBOL.

331
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,170
HIS OPPONENT THEN
MOVES OUT OF THE CITY

332
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,106
TO FACE THE ONCOMING
CONSTANTINE WITH HIS ARMY,

333
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,075
WHICH HAS NOW
BEEN TRAINED QUITE A BIT

334
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,873
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY WON
SEVERAL VICTORIES

335
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,937
ON THE WAY DOWN
FROM THE NORTH,

336
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,811
FROM MILAN DOWN.

337
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,786
HIS OPPONENT MOVES ACROSS
THE RIVER AT THE MILVIAN BRIDGE,

338
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,517
HAS CONSTANTINE
AND HIS ARMY IN FRONT OF HIM,

339
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,527
THE RIVER
AND THE CITY BEHIND HIM;

340
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,586
NOT A GREAT SITUATION TO BE IN.

341
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,528
IF YOU DO NOT BEAT
THE ONCOMING ARMY,

342
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,930
YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO RETREAT.

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,558
SO HE LOSES.

344
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,071
SO FOR CONSTANTINE, WHO IS
CERTAINLY NOT YET A CHRISTIAN,

345
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,971
THIS IS A POWERFUL THING
BECAUSE HE HIMSELF BELIEVES

346
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,737
''THE CHRISTIAN GOD
HAS GIVEN ME VICTORY.''

347
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,108
THE CHRISTIAN GOD

348
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,908
IS MORE POWERFUL
THAN THESE OTHER DEITIES.

349
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,748
IT IS CLEAR THAT CONSTANTINE
MADE THE SYMBOL OF CHRISTIANITY

350
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,184
PART OF THE IMPERIAL STANDARDS

351
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,814
AND THAT HE FOUGHT
UNDER THAT SYMBOL AND HE WON.

352
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:02,121
BEING A GOOD ROMAN EMPEROR,
HE WOULD THEN THINK,

353
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:07,530
''YEAH, I GOT THE SIGN.
I'M ON THE RIGHT PATH.''

354
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,590
SO IF YOU'RE A PAGAN

355
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,660
OR JUST SOMEBODY
WHO'S CONFUSED ABOUT RELIGION,

356
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,936
YOU'VE HAD HERE
THIS CLASH OF DEITIES

357
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,738
AND WHO'S EMERGED ON TOP?

358
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,072
THE CHRISTIAN GOD.

359
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,943
YOU CAN DRAW
YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

360
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,210
GRADUALLY,
THE NATIONAL SENTIMENT

361
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,219
AGAINST CHRISTIANITY
BEGAN REVERSING.

362
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,084
DURING CONSTANTINE'S REIGN,

363
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,953
CHRISTIANS WENT
FROM BEING A PERSECUTED SECT

364
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,550
TO OPENLY HOLDING
POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE

365
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,721
IN THE COURTS AND PALACES
OF KINGS AND GOVERNORS.

366
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:43,996
SO A LARGE PART OF THE ELITES,
USED TO RUNNING THE SHOW,

367
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:49,166
AUTOMATICALLY THEN BECOME
ALSO THE LOCAL BISHOPS, ETC.

368
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,799
YOU KNOW, BECOME CHRISTIAN.

369
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,140
IT WASN'T SUCH A BIG LEAP
BECAUSE MOST OF THEM,

370
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,941
ANYWAY, BELIEVED
IN ONE SUPREME DIVINE BEING

371
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,039
WHICH HAD
DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS.

372
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,846
IF YOU WANT
TO ADVANCE IN THE ARMY

373
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,320
OR IN THE IMPERIAL CIVIL SERVICE,

374
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,619
THERE'S EVERY INCENTIVE
TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN

375
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,024
BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE
AT THE TOP ARE CHRISTIANS.

376
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,188
SO, IF YOU WANT
TO ADVANCE IN THE HIERARCHY,

377
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:16,360
WHETHER IT'S MILITARY,
CIVIL SERVICE, OR JUST AT COURT,

378
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,034
PEOPLE BECOME CHRISTIANS.

379
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,628
IT BECOMES VERY ATTRACTIVE

380
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,642
BECAUSE CONSTANTINE'S EDICT
OF TOLERATION MAKES IT SO.

381
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,077
''CONSTANTINE CAN RIGHTFULLY
CLAIM THE TITLE OF GREAT,

382
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,137
''FOR HE TURNED
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD

383
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,809
''INTO A NEW COURSE
AND MADE CHRISTIANITY,

384
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,047
''WHICH UNTIL THEN HAD SUFFERED
BLOODY PERSECUTION,

385
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,385
THE RELIGION OF THE STATE.''

386
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,658
AND SO AS PEOPLE
FROM AROUND THE ROMAN EMPIRE

387
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,649
AND SO AS PEOPLE
FROM AROUND THE ROMAN EMPIRE

388
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,217
ENTERED THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH,

389
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,785
THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM

390
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,627
MANY OF THEIR FORMER
PAGAN BELIEFS AND PRACTICES.

391
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,690
NOW THAT CHRISTIANITY
HAS BEEN GIVEN THE STATUS

392
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,898
AS A FULL LEGAL RELIGION,
THEN IT BECOMES ATTRACTIVE

393
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,702
SUBSEQUENTLY
IN THE NEXT GENERATIONS,

394
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:01,144
FOR A BROAD NUMBER
OF MEMBERS OF THIS UPPER ELITE.

395
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:07,413
NOW THE PERCENTAGE OF CHRISTIANS
IN THIS TOP 1 0<i>%</i> , 1<i>5%</i> , 2<i>5%</i>

396
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,918
INCREASES AND IT INCREASES
DRAMATICALLY IN THE TOP 1 <i>%</i> -2<i>%</i> .

397
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,719
THAT'S THE REAL CHANGE.

398
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,316
THAT IS WHEN CHRISTIANITY

399
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,124
REALLY BECOMES
THE CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TODAY,

400
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,256
BECAUSE NOW THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE SHOW,

401
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,824
THEY ARE NOW CHRISTIAN.

402
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,393
OVER TIME, CHURCH LEADERS
BEGAN TO EMBRACE

403
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,235
THE REGAL ROBES
AND FLAMBOYANT CEREMONY

404
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,901
THAT WAS PART
OF THE PAGAN RELIGIONS

405
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,241
AND IN PLACE
OF THE SIMPLE COMMANDS OF GOD,

406
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:38,874
THEY BEGAN TO TEACH SUPERSTITIONS
AND MAN-MADE TRADITIONS.

407
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,180
NOW, INSTEAD
OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH

408
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,312
CONVERTING THE HEATHEN WORLD,

409
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,221
THE PAGANS
WERE CONVERTING THE CHURCH.

410
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,919
THERE IS A TRAIN COMING OUT
OF THE FIRST CENTURY,

411
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,054
REPRESENTED BY THE DOCUMENTS
WE HAVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT

412
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,191
THAT DEMONSTRATE,
THE SHAPE OF THE CHURCH THERE,

413
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,759
GOING INTO THIS
LONG DARK TUNNEL

414
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,862
OF THIS 2ND
THROUGH <i>4</i>TH CENTURIES

415
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,134
AND THEN COMING OUT
IN THE <i>4</i>TH CENTURY,

416
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,732
OF THIS LONG, DARK TUNNEL,

417
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,869
AND THE TRAIN
OF THE CHURCH THAT COMES OUT

418
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,880
IS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE TRAIN
OF THE CHURCH THAT GOES IN

419
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,381
THAT YOU SAY,
''WHAT HAPPENED?''

420
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:19,115
IN AD 391 , BY THE ORDER
OF EMPEROR THEODOSIUS THE FIRST,

421
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,922
CHRISTIANITY BECAME
THE OFFICIAL STATE RELIGION OF ROME.

422
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,326
WORSHIP AT PAGAN TEMPLES
WAS OUTLAWED

423
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,298
AND ALL OTHER
RELIGIOUS PRACTICES CEASED.

424
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,062
YOU'RE TRYING TO
CHRISTIANIZE AN EMPIRE.

425
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,199
YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHRISTIANIZE A PAGAN CULTURE.

426
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:41,075
THE OLD BASILICAS
WERE BASICALLY PAGAN TEMPLES.

427
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,477
PUT A CROSS OVER IT.

428
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,141
PUT IN PAINTINGS
OF BIBLICAL SCENES,

429
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:49,449
BIBLICAL HEROES
AND SAINTS AND MARTYRS.

430
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,490
CHRISTIANS ARE VERY
PURPOSEFUL AND INTENTIONAL

431
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,082
ABOUT TAKING OVER
PAGAN TEMPLES

432
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,923
AND THERE'S
A NOTABLE CHURCH LEADER

433
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,261
WHO ACTUALLY WRITES THIS
IN A TREATISE THAT SURVIVES.

434
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,030
HE WRITES A REBUTTAL
OF PAGAN ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANITY

435
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,071
AND PART
OF HIS EVIDENCE IS HE SAYS,

436
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,537
''YOUR VERY OWN
PLACES OF WORSHIP

437
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,274
''ARE NOW CHRISTIAN
PLACES OF WORSHIP.

438
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,832
''WE HAVE TAKEN THEM OVER.

439
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,343
''WE HAVE CLEANSED OUT
THE IDOLATRY.

440
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,936
''WE HAVE SANCTIFIED THEM
AND WE HAVE MADE THEM PLACES

441
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,845
''WHERE THE ONE
TRUE GOD IS WORSHIPED.

442
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,440
''WHAT CLEARER EVIDENCE
COULD YOU WISH

443
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,543
''THAT YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM
OF BELIEF IS FALSE?

444
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,948
''WHERE ARE YOUR GODS
IF THEY'RE ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN?''

445
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,422
SO CHRISTIANS, ACTUALLY,

446
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,120
DELIBERATELY AT TIMES
AND PURPOSEFULLY, AS A STRATEGY,

447
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,962
TAKE PAGAN, NOT ONLY PLACES
BUT RITUALS OR IDEAS

448
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,297
AND, AS THEY THINK,
SUBVERT THEM

449
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,362
TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE
OF SPREADING CHRISTIANITY.

450
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,031
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

451
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,303
IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH
THEY THINK THIS THROUGH

452
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,039
AND SAY, ''AT WHAT POINT
IS IT LEGITIMATE TO DO THIS

453
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,512
AND AT WHAT POINT

454
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,106
DO WE PERHAPS BEGIN
TO BE TAKING ON OTHER IDEAS?''

455
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,980
THE SPEED
WITH WHICH THE EARLY CHURCH

456
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:59,891
TOBOGGANED INTO APOSTASY
WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY.

457
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,526
AS MILLIONS OF PAGANS
HASTILY JOINED THE CHURCH,

458
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,153
THEY WERE NATURALLY RELUCTANT

459
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,323
TO DISPOSE
OF THEIR IDOL TREASURES.

460
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,991
THE ROMANS AND THE GREEKS

461
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,298
WERE SO USED TO BEING SURROUNDED
BY SYMBOLS OF THEIR DEITIES,

462
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,430
THEY BEGAN DOING
THE SAME THING WITH CHRISTIANITY.

463
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,407
SO MANY
OF THESE NEW CONVERTS

464
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,603
JUST RELABELED THEIR IDOLS
WITH CHRISTIAN NAMES

465
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,313
LIKE PAUL, MARY AND PETER.

466
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,316
A STATUE OF JUPITER
BECAME A STATUE OF PETER.

467
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,851
AND WE KNOW THAT

468
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,251
BECAUSE IT HAS A SUN DISC
RIGHT OVER ITS HEAD

469
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,085
THAT INDICATES
THAT THIS IS NOT PETER

470
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,387
BUT IT'S A PAGAN STATUE
THAT'S BEEN RENAMED.

471
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,983
INSTEAD OF ROMULUS AND REMUS,

472
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,962
''HEY, WHY NOT THE MARTYRS,

473
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,931
THE GREAT MARTYRS
COSMOS AND DAMIAN, RIGHT?''

474
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,433
THE REPRESENTATIONS OF ISIS,

475
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,526
WHICH IS ORIGINALLY
AN EGYPTIAN GODDESS

476
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,062
BUT HAS BECOME VERY GREEK
ALREADY BECOMES, ESSENTIALLY,

477
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,631
THE REPRESENTATION
OF MARY CARRYING HER CHILD.

478
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,140
YOU HAVE
A MOTHER AND CHILD TRADITION

479
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,237
ALL THE WAY DOWN
THROUGH HISTORY.

480
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,579
YOU HAVE IT IN MITHRAISM,
YOU HAVE IT IN BABYLON,

481
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,119
YOU HAVE IT
ALL THE WAY BACK IN PERSIA.

482
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,587
IT APPEARS THAT MARY ACQUIRED
SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS

483
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,989
THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
SOME OF THESE OTHER GODDESSES.

484
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,361
SHE WEARS A DARK BLUE COAT
AND SHE STANDS ON THE HALF MOON.

485
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:18,232
SHE IS THE MOTHER OF ALL GODS,
ISIS CARRYING HER SON HORUS,

486
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,567
THAT IS THE IMAGE
THAT GETS A NEW NAME

487
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,040
AND NOW THE NAME
IS MARY CARRYING THE CHILD JESUS.

488
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,272
OR A DEPICTION
OF THE GOD HERMES,

489
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,143
HE IS SHOWN AS CHRIST
THE GOOD SHEPHERD.

490
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,308
ASCLEPIOS
IS THE ICONOGRAPHIC MODEL

491
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,410
FOR A LOT
OF THE DEPICTIONS OF JESUS, YES.

492
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,979
A YOUNG VIBRANT GOD
WITH CURLY HAIR

493
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,424
DOWN TO ABOUT HERE
AND A LITTLE BEARD.

494
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,463
SOON THE STATUES
OF THE SAINTS AND EVEN JESUS

495
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,192
BEGAN ADORNING THE CHURCHES.

496
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,666
EVEN THOUGH GOD
CLEARLY FORBIDS THIS PRACTICE

497
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,259
IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS,

498
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,032
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO REVERE

499
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,437
AND TO PRAY
TO THESE RELABELED IDOLS.

500
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,003
''THOU SHALT NOT MAKE
UNTO THEE ANY GRAVEN IMAGE

501
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,107
''OR ANY LIKENESS OF ANYTHING
THAT IS IN HEAVEN ABOVE

502
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,708
''OR THAT IS
IN THE EARTH BENEATH

503
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,386
''OR THAT IS IN THE WATER
UNDER THE EARTH.

504
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:15,154
THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN THYSELF
TO THEM, NOR SERVE THEM.''

505
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,620
RELATED TO THE LAST POINT

506
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,155
IS THE VENERATION OF MARY
THE MOTHER OF JESUS.

507
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,100
WHILE IT IS TRUE MARY
WAS A FAITHFUL WOMAN

508
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,331
AND GREATLY HONORED
TO BE HIS MOTHER,

509
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,100
THE SCRIPTURES TEACH NOWHERE

510
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,642
THAT SHE IS TO BE DEIFIED
OR WORSHIPED.

511
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,235
MARY HAD ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT
IN ANCIENT CHRISTIAN HISTORY,

512
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,711
BUT OVER THE MIDDLE AGES

513
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,272
SHE BECOMES ELEVATED ALMOST
TO A- LOOKING AT IT DETACHEDLY-

514
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,478
ALMOST TO THE RANK
OF A SEMI-DEITY.

515
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,613
THE VIRGIN MARY
WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE ONE

516
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,682
WHO WOULD SPEAK UP
FOR GUILTY HUMAN BEINGS

517
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,491
TO HER SUPREMELY
VIRTUOUS AND JUDGMENTAL

518
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,158
AND RATHER CENSORIUS SON.

519
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,530
VERY STRANGE IMAGE,

520
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,570
BUT THAT'S HOW THE RELIGIOUS ART
OF THE PERIOD SHOWS IT.

521
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:04,336
THE BIBLE DOES NOT VENERATE MARY
AS A SPECIAL SAINT.

522
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,106
IT LIFTS HER UP AS A PURE,
WONDERFUL WOMAN

523
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,615
USED BY GOD
TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE MESSIAH.

524
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,744
YET,
AT THE COUNCIL OF NICEA IN 32<i>5</i>,

525
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,256
THE CHURCH ELEVATED MARY
TO THE STATURE OF A GODDESS

526
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,758
AND CO-MEDIATOR WITH CHRIST.

527
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,624
EVEN AS EARLY
AS THE LATE <i>4</i>TH CENTURY,

528
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,097
CHURCHES WERE BEING DEDICATED
TO THE VIRGIN MARY.

529
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,726
BUT SADLY, THESE WERE NOT
THE ONLY ERRORS

530
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,498
THAT SLIPPED IN
DURING THIS TIME.

531
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,605
DURING THE APOSTOLIC AGE,
BAPTISM WAS A SACRED CEREMONY

532
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,701
RESERVED ONLY
FOR THOSE OLD ENOUGH

533
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,543
TO MAKE
A RATIONAL DECISION FOR CHRIST.

534
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,446
IT WAS A PUBLIC TESTIMONY

535
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,645
OF ACCEPTING CHRIST
AND HIS FORGIVENESS.

536
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,053
BAPTISM LITERALLY
REPRESENTS BEING DEAD

537
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,750
AND BURIED TO OUR OLD LIFE

538
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,089
AND BEING RESURRECTED,
OR BORN AGAIN,

539
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,719
TO A NEW LIFE IN CHRIST.

540
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,492
IT COMES TO BE,
IN THE COURSE OF THE CENTURIES,

541
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:05,195
SEEN MORE AS A RIGHT
OF INITIATION INTO CHRISTIANITY

542
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,831
AND SO IT BEGINS HAPPENING
AT EARLIER STAGES OF LIFE,

543
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,699
WHEN YOU'RE SORT OF
IN LATE CHILDHOOD

544
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,744
OR EARLY ADOLESCENCE
AND DEEMED READY,

545
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,212
TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT
TO YOUR FAITH.

546
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,445
THE BAPTISM CEREMONY WAS ALSO
PERFORMED IN A LAKE OR A RIVER

547
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,748
WHERE A PERSON
COULD BE FULLY SUBMERGED,

548
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:27,281
SIGNIFYING THEY WERE
FULLY WASHED FROM THEIR SINS.

549
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,825
THE PRACTICE OF BAPTISM

550
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,794
WAS GRADUALLY ALTERED
BY THE CHURCH.

551
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,388
HUNDREDS
OF YEARS AFTER CHRIST,

552
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,695
SPRINKLING AND POURING
WERE INTRODUCED

553
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,601
AS A MORE CONVENIENT
MODE OF BAPTISM.

554
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,536
THIS ACTUALLY UNDERMINED

555
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,439
THE POWERFUL SYMBOLISM
OF THE SERVICE

556
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,670
AND IT CONTRADICTS
THE EXAMPLE OF JESUS,

557
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,372
WHO WAS BAPTIZED BY IMMERSION.

558
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,778
THAT CONTINUES
TO BE THE CASE

559
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,840
UP UNTIL ABOUT
THE 1 2TH CENTURY, ACTUALLY,

560
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,612
BECAUSE
THE 1 2TH CENTURY IS A TIME

561
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,247
WHEN THEOLOGIANS ARE REALLY
RE-EXAMINING CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE

562
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,850
AND THEY COME TO CONCLUDE
THAT ORIGINAL SIN,

563
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:05,657
THE SIN THAT ALL OF HUMANITY
HAS AS A RESULT OF THE FALL

564
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,254
IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN,

565
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,493
EXISTS IN THE SOUL
FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH.

566
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,262
THERE WAS
THIS UNBIBLICAL CONCEPT

567
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,499
THAT A CHILD
COULD SIN RIGHT AWAY

568
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,301
AND SO,
THEREFORE, IF HE SINNED,

569
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,399
HE WAS IN DANGER
OF GOING TO HELL

570
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,875
AND BURNING
FOREVER IN HELL.

571
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,139
THE ONLY WAY
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM

572
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,646
WAS TO BAPTIZE HIM

573
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,774
AND HE HAD TO BE BAPTIZED
INTO THE CHURCH.

574
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,784
IF YOU WEREN'T
A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH,

575
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,319
IT WAS TICKETS FOR YOU.

576
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,752
SO THEOLOGIANS SAY,
''YOU KNOW WHAT?

577
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,154
''WE NEED TO START BAPTIZING
BABIES IMMEDIATELY.

578
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,192
''AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AFTER THEY'RE BORN

579
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,160
SO THAT IN CASE THEY DIE- ''

580
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,661
OF COURSE, THIS IS A PERIOD

581
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,699
WHEN INFANT MORTALITY IS HIGH
AND A LOT OF BABIES DO DIE-

582
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,001
''THEY CAN GET INTO HEAVEN.''

583
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,262
''THEY CAN GET INTO HEAVEN.''

584
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,596
ANOTHER CHRISTIAN TRUTH

585
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,603
THAT WAS ALTERED
BY PAGAN INFLUENCE

586
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,502
WAS THE LORD'S SUPPER.

587
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,371
JESUS INSTITUTED
THE COMMUNION SERVICE,

588
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,740
ALSO KNOW BY SOME
AS THE EUCHARIST,

589
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,302
TO BE A BEAUTIFUL,
YET SIMPLE CEREMONY

590
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,849
WHERE HIS FOLLOWERS
WOULD DRINK UNFERMENTED WINE

591
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,181
AND EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD.

592
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,483
THESE SYMBOLS
OF JESUS' SINLESS BODY AND BLOOD

593
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,386
ARE DESIGNED
TO HELP BELIEVERS

594
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,858
REMEMBER THE SACRIFICE
AND THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST.

595
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,388
BY FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT RITE
FOR LATE MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANS

596
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,865
WAS THE EUCHARIST
OR COMMUNION,

597
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,403
OR AS THEY MOST COMMONLY
CALLED IT, THE MASS.

598
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,769
MEN AND WOMEN
ALL COME TOGETHER

599
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,432
AND TAKE THE SACRAMENT.

600
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,306
THEY CELEBRATE WHAT WE
WOULD CALL COMMUNION,

601
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,369
TAKING THE BODY AND BLOOD
OF JESUS CHRIST.

602
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,974
BUT AGAIN, UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF HEATHEN RITUALS,

603
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,548
THE HOLY COMMUNION SERVICE

604
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,951
WAS GRADUALLY CHANGED
BY CHURCH LEADERS

605
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,216
INTO A MYSTICAL CEREMONY.

606
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,488
IN THIS NEW RITUAL, FERMENTED
WINE WAS USED AND THE PRIEST,

607
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,927
ALLEGEDLY
HAD THE POWER TO TRANSFORM

608
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,487
THE BREAD AND THE WINE

609
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:51,331
INTO THE ACTUAL BODY
AND BLOOD OF CHRIST.

610
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,632
THIS IS TRANSUBSTANTIATION,

611
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:58,642
THE NOTION THAT A PRIEST
TRANSFORMS THE EUCHARIST

612
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,304
INTO THE BODY
AND BLOOD OF CHRIST

613
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,677
THROUGH THE PRONUNCIATION
OF THE FORMULA

614
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,741
''HOC EST ENIM CORPUS MEUM'':
''THIS IS MY BODY.''

615
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,480
THEY WERE POWERFUL WORDS

616
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,614
BELIEVED TO HAVE THE PROPERTY
THAT WHEN THEY WERE UTTERED

617
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,354
GOD TRANSFORMED THE NATURE
OF THE BREAD AND THE WINE

618
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:21,330
INTO THE BODY AND BLOOD
OF A RISEN JESUS CHRIST.

619
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,959
EVEN TO THE POINT
WHERE LATER ON THEY SAY,

620
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,503
''WE ARE CREATING GOD''

621
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,802
BY SPEAKING THE WORDS
OF MYSTAGOGIA.

622
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,035
ESSENTIALLY,
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ALTAR

623
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:37,646
WAS THAT BREAD BECAME BODY,
WINE BECAME BLOOD,

624
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,741
BUT THEY JUST STILL
LOOKED LIKE BREAD AND WINE.

625
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:44,310
THIS OFFERING
OF THE SACRIFICE IN THE EUCHARIST,

626
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,619
THIS SACRIFICE OF PRAISE,
THIS COMMUNAL MEAL

627
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,285
NOW BECOMES NOT
A REMEMBRANCE OF THE SACRIFICE

628
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,855
BUT A SACRIFICE IN AND OF ITSELF
AND IS GIVING SALVATION.

629
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:59,494
THEY BELIEVED
AND THEY TAUGHT THAT IN THE MASS

630
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,472
JESUS CHRIST,
IN THE PERSON OF THE PRIEST,

631
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,534
SACRIFICES CHRIST
TO GOD THE FATHER

632
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:13,778
AND, THEREBY WINS GOOD,
WINS QUANTUM OF HOLINESS,

633
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,785
WHICH THE CHURCH
CAN THEN ASSIGN

634
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,617
TO THE BENEFICIARIES
OF THAT MASS.

635
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,489
BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT BY CELEBRATING A MASS

636
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,587
YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING GOOD
WHICH WAS OFFERED UP TO GOD,

637
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,825
THERE WAS
A THEOLOGICAL RATIONALE

638
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,733
FOR DOING IT LOTS
AND LOTS OF TIMES.

639
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,762
BY 1 <i>4</i>1<i>5</i> AD,
AT THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE,

640
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,774
CHURCH LEADERS
FURTHER DECREED

641
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,367
THAT ONLY THE PRIESTS
COULD DRINK THE WINE

642
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,879
AND THE LAITY
WOULD ONLY RECEIVE THE BREAD;

643
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,744
YET THE BIBLE
CLEARLY SAYS

644
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,649
THAT WHEN JESUS ESTABLISHED
THE COMMUNION SERVICE

645
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:51,449
THEY ALL DRANK FROM IT.

646
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:51,722
ABOUT 300 YEARS AFTER CHRIST
THE CHURCH BEGAN TO DEVIATE

647
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,658
ABOUT 300 YEARS AFTER CHRIST
THE CHURCH BEGAN TO DEVIATE

648
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,956
FROM ANOTHER
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS;

649
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,497
SPECIFICALLY
THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT

650
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,827
THAT REQUIRES BELIEVERS

651
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,801
TO REMEMBER THE <i>7</i>TH DAY
AS THE SABBATH.

652
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,868
''REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY,
TO KEEP IT HOLY.

653
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,933
''SIX DAYS YOU SHALL LABOR
AND DO ALL YOUR WORK

654
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,534
''BUT THE SEVENTH DAY

655
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,445
IS THE SABBATH
OF THE LORD YOUR GOD.''

656
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,841
IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE
JEWS ARE AN OLD RELIGION

657
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,079
AND OLD RELIGIONS
ARE RESPECTED.

658
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,588
WHEN THE JEWS
KEPT FIGHTING AGAINST ROME

659
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:30,684
WHAT HAD BEEN AN UMBRELLA
OF SAFETY UNDER JUDAISM

660
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,821
BECOMES A LIGHTNING ROD
TO CHRISTIANITY

661
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,061
THE CHRISTIANS
BECOME ALIENATED FROM THE JEWS

662
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,762
JEWS PERSECUTED THEM

663
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,101
AND SO THEY TRIED TO DISTANCE
THEMSELVES FROM THE JEWS.

664
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,834
CHURCH LEADERS
BEGAN TO DEVALUE

665
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,843
THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

666
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,540
IN PREFERENCE FOR THE MORE
POPULAR ROMAN SUNDAY.

667
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,173
SOME CHRISTIANS
MISTAKENLY THOUGHT

668
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,419
THAT YOU SHOULD FAST
ON THE SABBATH

669
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,953
BUT YOU COULD FEAST ON SUNDAY.

670
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,613
THAT'S WHAT THE PAGANS DID,

671
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,123
THEY FEASTED ON SUNDAY,
FASTED ON SATURDAY.

672
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,023
NOT A JEWISH CONCEPT,

673
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,063
THE JEWS FASTED FRIDAY
AND FEASTED SABBATH,

674
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,189
BUT THAT'S HOW
SOME CHRISTIANS THOUGHT OF IT.

675
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,731
SO IF YOU'RE FASTING ON ONE DAY
AND YOU'RE FEASTING ON THE NEXT,

676
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,635
YOU CAN GUESS WHICH DAY
BECOMES THE MORE POPULAR DAY.

677
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,935
AND CHRIST
IS RESURRECTED ON A SUNDAY

678
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,669
THERE'S A VERY NATURAL
TENDENC Y, THEREFORE,

679
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,711
TO MARK THAT
AND CELEBRATE THAT.

680
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,040
THERE'S A THIRD REASON

681
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,604
AND THAT IS
THE INFLUENCE OF SUN WORSHIP

682
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,479
THAT CREEPS INTO THE CHURCH

683
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,486
AND WHEN SUN WORSHIP BEGINS
TO CREEP INTO THE CHURCH,

684
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,852
CONSTANTINE
CAN MAKE USE OF THAT

685
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,721
TO LEAD
TO THE EXALTATION OF SUNDAY,

686
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,054
THE DAY OF THE SUN,

687
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,153
AS BEING THE DAY
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WORSHIP ON.

688
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,754
THIS GRADUAL DEPARTURE

689
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,799
FROM GOD'S LAW
OVER THE CENTURIES

690
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,994
HAS BECOME SO WIDELY ACCEPTED

691
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,095
THAT MOST ARE SHOCKED
TO LEARN THAT SUNDAY KEEPING

692
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,970
HAS NO FOUNDATION
IN THE BIBLE.

693
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,741
IN AD 313 CONSTANTINE
PUBLISHED THE EDICT OF MILAN,

694
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,611
ESTABLISHING SUNDAY
AS A DAY OF REST.

695
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,980
THE EMPEROR'S SUNDAY LAW

696
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,178
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH CHRISTIANITY,

697
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,814
IT WAS ACTUALLY TO HONOR
THE MAIN GRECO-ROMAN SUN GOD

698
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,256
CALLED HELIOS, OR APOLLO.

699
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,552
THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE
BECAME A CONVERT TO CHRISTIANITY

700
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:16,623
AND ALSO, BECAUSE HE REMAINED
PARTIAL TO THE SUN GOD,

701
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,963
THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE

702
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,971
MOVED THE DAY OF WORSHIP
FROM SATURDAY THE SABBATH,

703
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,567
AS HAD BEEN TRADITIONAL
IN JUDAISM, OBVIOUSLY,

704
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,135
TO SUNDAY,
THE DAY OF THE SUN GOD.

705
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:33,877
AND EVER SINCE CHRISTIAN FOLKS,
AT LEAST FOR THE MOST PART,

706
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,920
OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE HELD
THEIR DAY OF WORSHIP ON SUNDAY

707
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,819
RATHER THAN SATURDAY.

708
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,756
THIS IS CLEAR FROM ANOTHER
EDICT OF CONSTANTINE,

709
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,660
GIVEN IN AD 321 ,
WHEN THE EMPEROR ORDERED:

710
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,891
''ON THE VENERABLE
DAY OF THE SUN

711
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,833
''LET THE MAGISTRATES AND PEOPLE
RESIDING IN CITIES REST,

712
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,530
AND LET ALL WORKSHOPS
BE CLOSED.''

713
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,133
NOTICE, THE EDICT
USES THE WORD ''SUN,'' S-U-N.

714
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,770
IT'S ALSO RECORDED
THAT CONSTANTINE THE GREAT

715
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,246
MADE A LAW
FOR THE WHOLE EMPIRE

716
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,684
THAT SUNDAY SHOULD BE KEPT
AS A DAY OF REST.

717
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:13,747
OBVIOUSLY, THIS CHANGE DID NOT
INFILTRATE THE CHURCH OVERNIGHT.

718
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:17,726
HISTORY TELLS US THAT FOR DECADES
THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH,

719
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,925
TOGETHER WITH SUNDAY,
WERE BOTH OBSERVED AS HOLY DAYS.

720
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,796
THE VERY, VERY EARLY CHURCH

721
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,063
CLEARLY IS STILL WORSHIPING
ON THE JEWISH SATURDAY

722
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,934
IN THE TIMES
OF THE APOSTLES,

723
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:31,771
BUT BY THE MID
TO LATE 3RD CENTURY,

724
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,106
THAT HAS LARGELY
BEEN ABANDONED

725
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,237
OR IS IN THE PROCESS
OF BEING ABANDONED.

726
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:41,149
BY THE EARLY FOURTH CENTURY,
IN MANY PARTS OF THE ROMAN WORLD,

727
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,243
CHRISTIANS ARE GENERALLY
WORSHIPING ON SUNDAY.

728
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,915
A LOT OF CHRISTIANS,
DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME,

729
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,753
WOULD OBSERVE THE SABBATH

730
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,261
AND THEN ON SUNDAY
THEY WOULD HAVE A SERVICE

731
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,887
REMEMBERING THE RESURRECTION

732
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,363
AND THEN THEY'D GO
ABOUT THEIR REGULAR WORK.

733
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,931
IT'S DURING
THE TIME OF CONSTANTINE

734
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,962
IN WHICH THE IDEA OF TRANSFERRING
THE SOLEMNITY OF THE SABBATH

735
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,168
TO SUNDAY IS FIRST EXPRESSED.

736
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,006
CENTURIES EARLIER
THE PROPHET DANIEL

737
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,708
HAD FORETOLD
A RELIGIOUS POWER WOULD ARISE

738
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,775
THAT WOULD THINK
TO CHANGE TIMES AND LAWS.

739
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,947
WITHIN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
THERE'S ONLY ONE LAW

740
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,618
THAT IS ALSO A TIME: THE SABBATH.

741
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,259
THE DOCTRINE OF HELLFIRE

742
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,696
WAS ALSO DISTORTED
BY PAGAN MYTHOLOGY.

743
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,256
IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION

744
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,895
THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT FOLLOWING
THE GREAT JUDGMENT DAY

745
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,769
THE LOST WILL BE CAST
INTO A LAKE OF FIRE.

746
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,241
AT THAT TIME,
EACH PERSON IS PUNISHED

747
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,335
ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY DESERVE

748
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,644
AND THEN THEY'RE TOTALLY CONSUMED
AND ETERNALLY PERISH.

749
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,980
''AND DO NOT FEAR THOSE
WHO KILL THE BODY

750
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,986
''BUT CANNOT KILL THE SOUL,

751
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,648
''BUT RATHER FEAR HIM
WHO IS ABLE TO DESTROY

752
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,215
BOTH SOUL AND BODY IN HELL.''

753
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,091
''FOR THE LIVING KNOW
THAT THEY WILL DIE,

754
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,894
BUT THE DEAD KNOW NOTHING.''

755
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,392
THE PRIESTS
BEGAN TO TEACH THAT HELL

756
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:09,030
WAS A PLACE OF ETERNAL TORMENT
RULED BY THE DEVIL

757
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,904
AND IT BEGAN
AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH.

758
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,807
THE FALLEN CHURCH
WAS ABLE TO USE

759
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,972
THIS FRIGHTFUL CONCEPT
OF NEVER-ENDING TORTURE

760
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,279
TO TERRORIZE AND MANIPULATE
BOTH THE KING AND THE COMMONER.

761
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,185
MOST TRAGIC OF ALL,
THIS FALSE TEACHING

762
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:29,352
PORTRAYS JESUS AS SOME SORT
OF SADISTIC FIEND.

763
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,191
IT'S ENCOURAGED
SOME ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTICS

764
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,060
TO CHALLENGE CHRISTIANITY

765
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,463
AND CHRISTIANITY'S IDEA
OF A LOVING GOD

766
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,996
IF HE DOES SOMETHING

767
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,003
THAT IS WORSE
THAN EVEN WHAT HITLER DID.

768
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,301
NO MATTER
WHAT SOMEBODY HAS DONE,

769
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,706
IS BILLIONS
OF YEARS OF TORTURE,

770
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,903
FITTING THE CRIME?

771
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,208
SO THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE HATED GOD

772
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:55,014
AND HAVE LEARNED TO HATE GOD
BECAUSE OF THIS.

773
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,851
ANOTHER PAGAN CONCEPT
THAT INFILTRATED CHRISTIAN THINKING

774
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,221
WAS REGARDING THE AFTERLIFE.

775
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:05,194
PURGATORY IS THE IDEA
THAT TEACHES THAT AT DEATH

776
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,254
SOME PEOPLE WILL ENTER
A TEMPORARY HELLFIRE

777
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,096
WHERE THEY'RE PURIFIED
FOR HEAVEN.

778
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,363
PURGATORY'S A HALFWAY HOUSE,

779
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,304
HALFWAY, KIND OF,
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL.

780
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,274
AND THE THING WITH PURGATORY
IS YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM IT.

781
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,972
AS THE MASS SAYS,
''CONSIGNED TO FLAMES OF WOE,''

782
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:27,507
IT'S FILLED WITH VERMIN,
IT'S FILLED WITH SULPHURIC SMELLS,

783
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,276
IT MAY BE QUITE A BIT
BETTER THAN HELL,

784
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,289
BUT IT'S NO PICNIC EITHER.

785
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,825
THE CHURCH DEVELOPS GRADUALLY

786
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,795
AND, AGAIN, IT GROWS
ON THE CHURCH BY SLOW DEGREES,

787
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,459
THE IDEA
THAT ANYONE WHO DIES

788
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:49,370
WITH THEIR WORKS
OF SATISFACTION INCOMPLETE

789
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,431
WILL PROBABLY
HAVE TO PAY THEM OFF

790
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,775
IN SOME PLACE
OF POST-MORTEM SUFFERING.

791
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,247
THEY ARE SUFFERING
IN ORDER TO BE PURIFIED,

792
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,911
PURGED FROM THEIR SINS
AND OFFENSES

793
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,148
WHICH THEY'VE COMMITTED IN LIFE.

794
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,190
MEDIEVAL PEOPLE BELIEVED

795
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,285
ALMOST EVERYONE
WILL BE SAVED AND REDEEMED,

796
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,230
WHO IS A BAPTIZED
MEMBER OF THE CHURCH.

797
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:21,499
BUT ALMOST EVERYONE WILL ALSO
HAVE TO MAKE SATISFACTION

798
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,405
FOR THE SINS
THAT THEY'VE COMMITTED

799
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,807
AND THAT THEY
HAVEN'T CONFESSED

800
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,074
BY SPENDING SOME
TIME IN PURGATORY.

801
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,412
SO THE REAL TASK THEN

802
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,419
IS TO REDUCE
THE TIME IN PURGATORY.

803
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,318
MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND
PURGATORY AND HELL.

804
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,119
THERE'S AN IDEA YOU CAN
GET OUT OF HELL; YOU CAN'T.

805
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,523
IF YOU GO TO HELL THAT'S IT.
THERE'S NO RELEASE.

806
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,062
YOU'RE VERY, VERY WICKED
AND YOU'RE JUST DOOMED.

807
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,189
BUT MOST PEOPLE,

808
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,358
WE HAVE A LOT
OF BAD THINGS IN US

809
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,561
SO HOW CAN WE
BE MADE GOOD FOR HEAVEN?

810
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,002
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT
PURGED OUT OF US

811
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,937
AND THUS
YOU GET THE WORD 'PURGATORY'.

812
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,202
THEREFORE,
MOST CHRISTIANS BELIEVE

813
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,143
THAT THEIR RELATIVES
ARE SUFFERING IN PURGATORY

814
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,112
AND PURGATORY
IS NOT A NICE PLACE.

815
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,446
YOU'RE THERE
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

816
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,213
THE IDEA OF PURGATORY

817
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,050
DATES BACK
CENTURIES BEFORE JESUS' TIME.

818
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,216
WRITINGS FROM PLATO,
AS EARLY AS <i>4</i>00 BC,

819
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,487
HELP SHED LIGHT
ON WHERE THIS CONCEPT

820
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,462
OF PURIFICATION
AND PUNISHMENT CAME FROM.

821
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,897
HOWEVER, PURGATORY
DIDN'T BECOME REGARDED

822
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,494
AS AN ACTUAL PLACE
UNTIL CENTURIES LATER.

823
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,903
BETWEEN 1 1 60 AND 1 1<i>8</i>0 AD,

824
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,568
THEOLOGIANS DEVELOPED
THE DOCTRINE OF PURGATORY

825
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,134
LEADING TO THE FORMAL
ACCEPTANCE OF IT

826
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:39,444
AT THE SECOND COUNCIL
OF LYONS IN 1 2<i>7 4</i>.

827
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:46,319
THE CHURCH THEN OFFERS
TO SUPPORT THE DEAD IN PURGATORY

828
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,649
BY ITS PRAYERS
AND BY ATTRIBUTING TO PEOPLE

829
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,194
THE BENEFITS OF THE SACRAMENTS,
ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNION.

830
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,062
THIS IS ALL PERFECTLY ORTHODOX.

831
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,602
THE CHURCH BELIEVED
THAT THIS IS DOING GOOD

832
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,365
AND LAYPEOPLE
SEEMED TO BE WILLING

833
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,032
TO PUT LARGE AMOUNTS
OF MONEY INTO IT

834
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,405
AND YOU HAVE

835
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,003
AN EXTRAORDINARY
PROLIFERATION OF INSTITUTIONS

836
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,139
FOUNDED PRINCIPALLY FOR PRIESTS

837
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,912
TO SAY MASSES FOR THE SOULS
OF THE DEPARTED,

838
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,613
PARTICULARLY
IN THE 1 <i>4</i>TH AND 1<i>5</i>TH CENTURIES.

839
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,588
THIS DOCTRINE WAS FABRICATED

840
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,024
TO MANIPULATE THE MASSES
FOR FINANCIAL GAIN.

841
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,459
PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO PAY
HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY

842
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,019
TO RELEASE A LOVED ONE

843
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,621
FROM THE TORTURES
OF PURGATORY.

844
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,065
OF COURSE, BELIEVERS
COULD NEVER REALLY BE SURE

845
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,103
WHEN SOMEONE LEFT PURGATORY,

846
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,501
SO THE MONEY KEPT FLOWING

847
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,404
INTO THE POCKETS
OF CORRUPT PRIESTS.

848
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,941
THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH

849
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,443
WOULD HAVE PEOPLE
GOING OUT TO RAISE MONEY

850
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,003
AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
TO GIVE THEIR MONEY TO THE CHURCH,

851
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,343
BUY PEOPLE OUT OF PURGATORY,

852
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,476
SO THEY COULD FUND
THESE ELABORATE BUILDINGS.

853
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,247
THIS BELIEF IN PURGATORY

854
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,686
IS ALSO BUILT
ON THE DANGEROUS CONCEPT

855
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,190
THAT THE WORKS
AND THE PRAYERS OF THE LIVING

856
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:59,127
CAN SOMEHOW ALTER
THE DESTINY OF THE DEAD,

857
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:04,099
YET JESUS MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THERE IS NO LIMBO OR PURGATORY.

858
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,467
AFTER DEATH, A PERSON'S
NEXT CONSCIOUS THOUGHT

859
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,336
WAS THE RESURRECTION
AND THEIR ETERNAL REWARD.

860
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,473
''DO NOT MARVEL AT THIS;
FOR THE HOUR IS COMING

861
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,411
''IN WHICH ALL
WHO ARE IN THE GRAVES

862
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,211
''WILL HEAR HIS VOICE
AND COME FORTH;

863
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,720
''THOSE WHO HAVE DONE GOOD,
TO THE RESURRECTION OF LIFE,

864
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,482
''AND THOSE WHO HAVE DONE EVIL

865
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,753
TO THE RESURRECTION
OF CONDEMNATION.''

866
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:30,994
CENTRAL IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE

867
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,393
CENTRAL IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE

868
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:36,160
IS THE TEACHING
OF HOW WE OBTAIN FORGIVENESS.

869
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,428
THIS WAS ANOTHER
MAJOR BIBLE TRUTH

870
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,266
THAT SUFFERED
DURING THIS AGE OF COMPROMISE.

871
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,535
IT WAS TAUGHT THAT IF A PERSON
WISHED TO BE FORGIVEN,

872
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:48,476
HE OR SHE MUST FIRST CONFESS
THEIR SINS THROUGH A PRIEST,

873
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,446
THROUGH A RITE CALLED
THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE,

874
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,382
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN
AS ''CONFESSION.''

875
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:59,081
SO IN ORDER TO MAKE UP
FOR OUR INSUFFICIENT GOODNESS

876
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,023
AND OUR ACTUAL WRONG ACTIONS,

877
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,085
WE MUST ALL-
LAYPEOPLE AS WELL AS CLERGY-

878
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,655
WE MUST ALL CONFESS OUR SINS
AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR,

879
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:14,363
AND PREFERABLY MORE OFTEN
THAN THAT, TO A PRIEST.

880
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,669
THIS WAS A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT
ON SEVERAL COUNTS.

881
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,801
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S TAUGHT
NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE.

882
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:25,242
SECONDLY, IT PUTS A MORTAL MAN
IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST

883
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,682
AND IT MADE GOD SEEM DETACHED
FROM THE AVERAGE PERSON.

884
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,516
OF COURSE, AT THE TIME,
IT ALSO PLACED THE PRIEST

885
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,180
IN AN AWKWARD POSITION

886
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,054
TO HEAR ABOUT
ALL THE WICKED DEEDS

887
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,093
OF HIS PARISHIONERS.

888
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,688
WHEN ONE GOES TO A PRIEST
IN THE MIDDLE AGES,

889
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:46,498
THERE ARE REALLY THREE THINGS
THAT ARE ACCOMPLISHED

890
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,697
THROUGH CONFESSING ONE'S SIN.

891
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,367
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU MAKE THE CONFESSION,

892
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,275
THE PRIEST GRANTS
THE WORDS OF ASSURANCE

893
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,746
THAT THE SIN
IS ABSOLVED- IT'S GONE-

894
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,683
BUT A PERSON,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE VIOLATED

895
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,654
THE LAWS OF THE CHURCH
AND THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST,

896
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:09,681
HAS TO PERFORM
A WORK OF SATISFACTION

897
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,284
IN ORDER TO MAKE UP

898
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,194
FOR THE FACT
THAT THEY HAVE SINNED.

899
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,633
THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT MANKIND
IS HELPLESS TO SAVE HIMSELF.

900
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,865
THIS IS WHY JESUS
CAME TO THIS WORLD.

901
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,131
THE SCRIPTURES TEACH
THAT SALVATION DEPENDS ENTIRELY

902
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,235
UPON OUR TRUST IN GOD
FOR MERC Y AND GRACE,

903
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,143
THAT WE DON'T DESERVE IT;

904
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,476
IT'S A MAGNIFICENT GIFT

905
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,881
THAT CAN NEVER BE EARNED
BY OUR EFFORTS OR GOOD WORKS.

906
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,815
EVEN OBEDIENCE
COMES THROUGH A GIFT OF GRACE.

907
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,517
THE NEW TESTAMENT DOCTRINE
OF SALVATION BY FAITH

908
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,584
IS WIDELY TAUGHT
AND UNDERSTOOD TODAY,

909
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,562
BUT DURING THE DARKNESS
OF THE MIDDLE AGES

910
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,828
IT WAS EASIER TO CONVINCE
THE ILLITERATE MASSES

911
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,869
THAT THEY NEEDED
TO PERFORM GOOD DEEDS

912
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,427
IN ORDER TO EARN GOD'S FAVOR.

913
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,370
THE PEOPLE WERE TAUGHT
THAT IF A SINNER

914
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,773
WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE
OF APPEASING GOD,

915
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,210
HE OR SHE WOULD NEED TO PAY
HUGE SUMS OF MONEY,

916
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,271
PERFORM PAINFUL
ACTS OF PENANCE,

917
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,874
OR MAKE
SOME WEARY PILGRIMAGE.

918
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,543
THIS WOULD OFTEN INCLUDE

919
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,181
AN ASSIGNMENT TO RECITE
CERTAIN PRAYERS OVER AND OVER

920
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,487
AS A REQUIREMENT
TO OBTAIN FORGIVENESS.

921
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,393
FORTY ''HAIL MARYS''
AND TEN ''OUR FATHERS''

922
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:23,559
AND PUTTING A COIN
IN THE COLLECTION BOX.

923
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,625
IN THE HEATHEN RELIGIONS
OF THE WORLD

924
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,364
THE IDEA
OF REPETITIVE PRAYERS OR CHANTS

925
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,905
WAS NOTHING NEW.

926
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:33,602
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT YOU COULD
APPEASE OR INFLUENCE THE GODS

927
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,838
BY CONSTANT ECHOING OF PRAYERS

928
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,280
OR BY USING
SPECIAL MAGICAL WORDS.

929
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,443
JESUS CLEARLY WARNED
AGAINST THIS FORM OF PRAYER.

930
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,313
''AND WHEN YOU PRAY,

931
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,451
''DO NOT USE VAIN REPETITIONS
AS THE HEATHEN DO.

932
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,858
''FOR THEY THINK

933
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,397
THAT THEY WILL BE HEARD
FOR THEIR MANY WORDS.''

934
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:54,564
CORRUPT CHURCH LEADERS KNEW,

935
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,225
CORRUPT CHURCH LEADERS KNEW,

936
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,327
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ANY
LASTING POWER OVER GOD'S PEOPLE,

937
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,701
THEY WOULD NEED
TO SEPARATE THEM

938
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,330
FROM THE ONE THING

939
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,433
THAT THEY KNEW
COULD EXPOSE THESE DECEPTIONS:

940
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,377
THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.

941
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,313
THE BIBLE WAS NOT INITIALLY
WITHHELD FROM THE PEOPLE,

942
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,906
IT WAS ACCESSIBLE.

943
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:18,421
BUT, IN TIME,
WHEN PEOPLE SAW DIFFERENCES,

944
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,251
THEY CHALLENGED THE CLERGY.

945
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,953
AND SO IT WAS
IN THEIR INTEREST, OVER TIME,

946
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:28,487
NOT TO MAKE AVAILABLE
THE BIBLE TO THE PEOPLE.

947
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:32,729
ONLY THE PRIESTS
CAN INTERPRET SCRIPTURE

948
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,601
BECAUSE THEY COMBINED
SCRIPTURE WITH TRADITION

949
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,334
AND SO TRADITION
INTERPRETED SCRIPTURE

950
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,807
AND THE ONLY ONES

951
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,436
WHO UNDERSTOOD THIS LONG
TRADITION WERE THE PRIESTS

952
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,480
AND THEY COULD READ
THE SCRIPTURES

953
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,346
MANY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE
COULDN'T EVEN READ THE SCRIPTURES

954
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,908
AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY INTERPRETED SCRIPTURE

955
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,252
IN A WAY THAT WOULD
HARMONIZE WITH TRADITION.

956
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,622
SO FROM THE <i>5</i>TH CENTURY
TO THE 1<i>5</i>TH CENTURY,

957
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,820
1 ,000 YEARS OF HISTORY,

958
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,989
IT WAS TAUGHT AND ACCEPTED
THAT ONLY RELIGIOUS LEADERS

959
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,660
WERE QUALIFIED ENOUGH
TO EXPLAIN THE SACRED TEXTS.

960
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,397
THE COMMON MAN WAS TOLD

961
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,905
HE COULD NEVER HOPE
TO UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES

962
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,635
WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF A PRIEST.

963
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,700
WITH THIS LETHAL DECEPTION,

964
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,372
THE CHURCH LAITY
WAS KEPT IN DARKNESS.

965
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,881
MEANWHILE,
THE VISIBLE CHURCH,

966
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,578
ONCE A BIBLICAL
BASTION OF TRUTH,

967
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:25,644
HAD DEGRADED INTO A CORRUPT
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION

968
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,782
TRIMMED
WITH SPIRITUALISTIC CEREMONIES.

969
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,020
IT'S NO WONDER
THAT THIS TIME PERIOD

970
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,962
OF CULTURAL, ECONOMIC
AND SPIRITUAL DETERIORATION

971
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,365
IS KNOWN AS ''THE DARK AGES.''

972
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:44,065
IT'S TRAGIC HOW,
IN JUST A FEW SHORT CENTURIES,

973
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,366
THE WONDERFUL LIGHT
THAT HAD BEEN BLAZING

974
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,638
FROM THE LUMINOUS
BRIDE OF CHRIST

975
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,840
HAD BEEN ECLIPSED
BY PAGAN TRADITIONS.

976
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,351
NOW A VERY DIFFERENT
KIND OF WOMAN

977
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,355
EMERGED TO TAKE HER PLACE.

978
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,392
''AND I SAW A WOMAN
SITTING ON A SCARLET BEAST,

979
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,689
''WHICH WAS FULL
OF NAMES OF BLASPHEMY,

980
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,559
''HAVING SEVEN HEADS
AND TEN HORNS.

981
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,395
''THE WOMAN WAS ARRAYED
IN PURPLE AND SCARLET

982
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,834
''AND ADORNED WITH GOLD
AND PRECIOUS STONES AND PEARLS,

983
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,396
''HAVING IN HER HAND A GOLDEN CUP
FULL OF ABOMINATIONS

984
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,102
''AND THE FILTHINESS
OF HER FORNICATION.

985
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,743
''AND ON HER FOREHEAD
A NAME WAS WRITTEN,

986
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,442
'''MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,
THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS

987
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,007
''AND THE ABOMINATIONS
OF THE EARTH.'

988
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,953
''I SAW THE WOMAN DRUNK
WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS

989
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,786
''AND WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE MARTYRS OF JESUS.

990
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,919
AND WHEN I SAW HER I MARVELED
WITH GREAT AMAZEMENT.''

991
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,360
IN REVELATION CHAPTER 1 <i>7</i>,
JOHN SEES A WOMAN

992
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,404
WHO HE DESCRIBES
AS STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT

993
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,906
FROM THE PURE WOMAN
OF REVELATION 1 2.

994
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:54,000
WHO IS THIS NEW
BLOODTHIRSTY HARLOT

995
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,444
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE BIZARRE BEAST THAT SHE'S RIDING?

996
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,382
IF YOU'RE NOT SITTING DOWN,
THIS MIGHT BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

997
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,820
YOU MAY FIND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO HEAR A BIT SHOCKING.

998
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,858
THERE'S ONLY ONE EMPIRE,
ONE CHURCH,

999
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:13,555
ONE INSTITUTION THAT MATCHES
THE CRITERIA IN THIS PROPHEC Y:

1000
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,463
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.

1001
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,434
THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT
ALL THE PEOPLE WITHIN THIS FAITH

1002
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,097
ARE BAD, INSINCERE, OR LOST.

1003
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,868
THE CATHOLIC PEOPLE
ARE AMONG THE MOST KIND

1004
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,171
AND HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
A PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF GOOD

1005
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,105
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

1006
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,670
THIS IS REALLY
ABOUT A BIGGER STRUGGLE

1007
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,444
BETWEEN SPIRITUAL POWERS
AND INSTITUTIONS

1008
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,646
BATTLING OVER THE TRUTH
OF SCRIPTURE.

1009
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,951
BUT NOW WE NEED
TO PULL BACK THE VEIL

1010
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:44,084
AND REALLY
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE FACTS.

1011
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,686
IN REVELATION 1 <i>7</i>:1 ,

1012
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:51,063
WE OBSERVE THIS HARLOT WOMAN
SITS ON ''MANY WATERS.''

1013
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,659
FORTUNATELY THE ANGEL EXPLAINS

1014
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,171
THE MEANING OF THIS SYMBOL
FOR US IN VERSE 1<i>5</i>.

1015
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,139
''THEN HE SAID TO ME,

1016
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,145
'''THE WATERS WHICH YOU SAW,
WHERE THE HARLOT SITS,

1017
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,946
ARE PEOPLES, MULTITUDES,
NATIONS, AND TONGUES.'''

1018
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,742
SO THE WOMAN REIGNS

1019
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,017
OVER A DENSELY
POPULATED CIVILIZATION.

1020
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,819
YOU'VE PROBABLY
HEARD THE EXPRESSION

1021
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,019
''ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME.''

1022
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,085
DURING THE ZENITH OF THEIR RULE,

1023
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:24,099
THE ROMANS HAD BUILT A NETWORK
WITH <i>5</i>0,000 MILES OF ROADS

1024
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,466
CIRCULATING THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE EMPIRE.

1025
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,995
JUST AS IMPERIAL ROME
BEGAN TO UNRAVEL,

1026
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,237
THE CHURCH IN ROME
WAS GAINING IN STRENGTH.

1027
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,945
IN EFFECT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

1028
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,710
KIND OF RUSHES IN
TO FILL THE POWER VACUUM

1029
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,981
THAT IS LEFT
BY THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

1030
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,181
AND YOU GET INTO SITUATIONS
WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE,

1031
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,588
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE <i>5</i>TH CENTURY,
WHEN ATTILA THE HUN

1032
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,024
IS ADVANCING
ON THE CITY OF ROME WITH HIS ARMY,

1033
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:53,062
THE EMPEROR IS NOT THE ONE
WHO GOES OUT TO STOP HIM,

1034
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,858
THE POPE IS,
THE BISHOP OF ROME.

1035
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,195
THIS KIND OF PROMINENCE,

1036
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,201
POLITICAL PROMINENCE
AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS PROMINENCE,

1037
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:03,103
COMES TO REALLY DEFINE
THE POPE'S ROLE.

1038
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,107
THE PROPHEC Y ALSO INDICATES

1039
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:10,135
THAT THE WOMAN IS RIDING A BEAST
WITH SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS.

1040
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,011
OBVIOUSLY
THESE THINGS ARE SYMBOLS.

1041
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,849
THIS CREATURE HERE CLEARLY
REPRESENTS THE SAME MONSTER

1042
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,889
WITH SEVEN HEADS
AND TEN HORNS THAT WE JUST SAW

1043
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,857
WARRING WITH THE BRIDE
OF CHRIST IN CHAPTER 1 2

1044
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,621
AND IT'S THE SAME BEAST

1045
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,061
THAT THE WORLD IS COMPELLED
TO WORSHIP IN CHAPTER 13.

1046
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:32,568
SO WHAT DO THESE SEVEN HEADS
AND TEN HORNS REPRESENT?

1047
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,029
''THE SEVEN HEADS
ARE SEVEN MOUNTAINS

1048
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,734
ON WHICH THE WOMAN SITS.''

1049
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,709
''THE TEN HORNS
WHICH YOU SAW ARE TEN KINGS...''

1050
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,939
THERE IS ONLY
ONE CITY IN THE WORLD

1051
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,814
THAT SITS
ON SEVEN HILLS LIKE THIS,

1052
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,319
ONE MAJOR CITY,
AND THAT'S THE CITY OF ROME.

1053
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,783
SO THERE IS NO DOUBT
IN MOST EXPOSITOR'S MINDS

1054
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,792
THAT WHEN JOHN
IS TALKING ABOUT THIS WOMAN,

1055
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,589
HE IS TALKING ABOUT ROME.

1056
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:04,601
SO YOU SEE THE CONNECTION HERE,
SEVEN HEADS, SEVEN MOUNTAINS.

1057
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,637
YOU GO IN REVELATION 1 2:
SEVEN HEADS.

1058
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,104
REVELATION 13
DEALS WITH SEVEN HEADS.

1059
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,698
THERE IS A CONTINUITY HERE.

1060
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:16,803
''IT IS WITHIN THE CITY OF ROME,
CALLED THE CITY OF SEVEN HILLS,

1061
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,781
''THAT THE ENTIRE AREA
OF VATICAN STATE PROPER

1062
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,114
IS NOW CONFINED.''

1063
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,313
THERE IS ONLY ONE CHURCH

1064
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,050
THAT IS ALSO
AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY

1065
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:32,254
AND HAS POLITICAL
WORLD POWER: THE VATICAN.

1066
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,321
THIS COUNTRY, WITH THE WORLD'S
SMALLEST POPULATION,

1067
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,060
WAS ESTABLISHED
AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE

1068
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,262
WITH 1 09 ACRES WITHIN ROME.

1069
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,806
BEHIND THE WALLS OF VATICAN CITY

1070
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,864
THERE ARE LESS
THAN 1 ,000 PEOPLE

1071
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:49,776
LIVING WITHIN THIS SMALL COUNTRY
THAT IS GOVERNED BY THE POPE

1072
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:54,909
WHO HAS ABSOLUTE EXECUTIVE,
LEGISLATIVE, AND JUDICIAL POWERS.

1073
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,952
AMBASSADORS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

1074
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,750
MEET WITH THE POPE
AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES

1075
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,688
SEEKING THE INFLUENCE
AND GUIDANCE

1076
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:05,023
OF THIS INTERNATIONAL
RELIGIOUS POWER.

1077
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,790
EVEN THE UNITED NATIONS

1078
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:11,197
WILL ASSEMBLE
TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE POPE.

1079
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,895
WHEN THE WESTERN
ROMAN EMPIRE FELL,

1080
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,066
THEIR TERRITORY FRAGMENTED
INTO TEN PRIMARY DIVISIONS.

1081
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,838
THE TEN HORNS REPRESENT
THE TEN KINGS OR KINGDOMS

1082
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,937
INTO WHICH IMPERIAL ROME
WAS EVENTUALLY SPLIT.

1083
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,381
THE TEN HORNS
ARE A DESCRIPTION OF ROME

1084
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,909
WHICH BREAKS UP
INTO TEN SMALLER KINGDOMS.

1085
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,353
THROUGHOUT HISTORY

1086
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,722
CATHOLICISM HAS BEEN
DOMINATING MANY KINGDOMS.

1087
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:40,923
SO YOU HAVE THE CHURCH
RIDING ON A POLITICAL POWER.

1088
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,830
YOU SEE, BECAUSE THE WOMAN
RIDES THE BEAST

1089
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,425
AND SO FOR MANY CENTURIES
SHE WAS IN CONTROL.

1090
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,070
YOU HAVE A UNION
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

1091
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,971
THE NAMES OF BLASPHEMY

1092
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,373
IS ANOTHER KEY ELEMENT
TO THIS PROPHEC Y

1093
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,242
THAT POINTS DIRECTLY
AT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.

1094
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,842
''WE HOLD UPON THIS EARTH
THE PLACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY.''

1095
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,354
THIS PUTS A MORTAL MAN
IN THE POSITION OF GOD

1096
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,825
AND IS ULTIMATELY
THE VERY DEFINITION OF BLASPHEMY.

1097
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,088
THIS IS NOT MEANT
TO QUESTION THE SINCERITY

1098
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,130
OF ANY SPECIFIC POPE,

1099
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,223
BUT THE PROPHEC Y IS ADDRESSING
THE OFFICE THAT HE HOLDS

1100
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,701
AND THE INSTITUTION
HE REPRESENTS.

1101
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,467
THE WOMAN IS ALSO CLOTHED
IN UNIQUE COLORS.

1102
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,802
SHE HAS SPECIFIC COLORS
THAT ARE MENTIONED HERE,

1103
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,402
NOT THE COLOR
OF WHITE ANYMORE,

1104
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,846
BUT NOW WE HAVE COLORS
THAT REPRESENT,

1105
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,850
STRANGELY ENOUGH,
TWO THINGS:

1106
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,216
ROYALTY AND PROSTITUTION.

1107
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,221
AND SPECIFIC COLORS
THAT WE HAPPEN TO SEE

1108
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,747
COMING OUT IN THE HISTORIC
CHRISTIAN CHURCH LATER ON

1109
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,225
IN THE COLORS OF THE PRIESTS

1110
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,023
OF THE HISTORIC
CHRISTIAN CHURCH.

1111
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,222
NOT ONLY
WERE THESE THE PRINCIPLE COLORS

1112
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,959
OF THE ROMAN CAESARS,

1113
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,501
BUT ACCORDING
TO THE CATHOLIC ENC YCLOPEDIA,

1114
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,499
PURPLE IS THE OFFICIAL
COLOR OF BISHOPS

1115
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,332
AND SCARLET FOR CARDINALS.

1116
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,002
IN ADDITION TO THE SCARLET
AND THE PURPLE,

1117
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,511
WE SEE THAT THIS HARLOT,
OR CORRUPT CHURCH,

1118
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,079
POSSESSES VAST MINERAL RICHES.

1119
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,950
WHEN ONE CONSIDERS ITS COUNTLESS
ARTISTIC TREASURES OF GOLD,

1120
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,012
SILVER AND PEARLS,
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH

1121
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,153
IS BY FAR THE WEALTHIEST
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION ON EARTH.

1122
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,062
EVERY YEAR TOURISTS
COME FROM AROUND THE WORLD

1123
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:27,125
TO VIEW THE GLITTERING OPULENCE
OF THE ROMAN CHURCH.

1124
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,807
ANOTHER DISTURBING MARK
OF THIS WOMAN

1125
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,308
IS FOUND IN VERSE 6.

1126
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,247
''I SAW THE WOMAN DRUNK
WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS

1127
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:41,408
AND WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE MARTYRS OF JESUS.''

1128
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,850
HISTORY REVEALS
THAT THE ROMAN CHURCH

1129
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,787
WAS THE WORST OPPRESSOR
OF CHRISTIANS AND JEWS

1130
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,289
OVER THE CENTURIES.

1131
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,522
IN FACT, HISTORIANS TELL US
OVER <i>5</i>0 MILLION MARTYRS

1132
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:56,122
FELL VICTIM TO THE TERRIBLE
INQUISITIONS AND PERSECUTIONS

1133
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,861
OF THE CHURCH OF ROME.

1134
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,197
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE

1135
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,431
IS A PROPHEC Y
SAYING THAT THE CHURCH

1136
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,372
WOULD ENGAGE
IN INCREDIBLE PERSECUTION

1137
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,306
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT TOOK PLACE.

1138
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,837
AND THE CHURCH STARTED
A LEGAL PROCESS, A LEGAL SYSTEM,

1139
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,942
KNOWN AS 'INQUISITION'
TO INTERROGATE THESE PEOPLE,

1140
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,954
TO FORCE AS MANY
AS POSSIBLE TO RECANT

1141
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,513
AND TO RETRACT THEIR IDEAS

1142
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,322
AND TO GRAB HOLD
OF THE LEADERS OF THE MOVEMENT

1143
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,590
AND TO STOP THEM
SPREADING ANY FURTHER.

1144
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,823
THE HIGHEST NUMBER
OF DEATHS EVER RECORDED

1145
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,300
OCCURRED WHEN THE CHURCH

1146
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,496
PERSECUTED THOSE
WHO DISAGREED WITH THEM

1147
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,541
AND THAT LEVEL OF REPRESSION

1148
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,873
CONTINUES
THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGES.

1149
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,437
SO THIS WOMAN, OR CHURCH,
IS A PERSECUTING POWER

1150
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,718
THAT OPPRESSES
CHRIST'S TRUE FOLLOWERS.

1151
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:48,945
THAT OPPRESSES
CHRIST'S TRUE FOLLOWERS.

1152
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,282
WE'LL BE LOOKING
AT SEVERAL BRAVE SOULS

1153
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,912
THAT RISKED THEIR LIVES

1154
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,550
TO SPEAK UP AGAINST
THE CORROSIVE PAGAN INFLUENCES

1155
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,093
AND TO SHARE GOD'S WORD

1156
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,220
DURING THIS TIME
OF SPIRITUAL DARKNESS.

1157
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,333
''THE PEOPLE
WHO WALKED IN DARKNESS

1158
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,232
''HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT:

1159
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:10,295
''THOSE WHO DWELT IN THE LAND
OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH,

1160
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,603
UPON THEM
A LIGHT HAS SHINED.''

1161
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,442
LIVING IN LYONS, FRANCE,
THERE WAS ONE YOUNG MAN

1162
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,507
WHO WOULD ALTER
THE COURSE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY.

1163
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,452
PETER WALDO,
ALSO KNOWN AS VALDES,

1164
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,422
A VERY WEALTHY
AND EDUCATED YOUNG MERCHANT

1165
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,016
HAD A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.

1166
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,063
A YOUNG FRIEND
OF WALDO'S DIED SUDDENLY.

1167
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,597
REALIZING THE BREVITY OF LIFE

1168
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,361
AND THE VANITY
OF WORLDLY TREASURE,

1169
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:42,393
WALDO MADE A FIRM DECISION
TO FORSAKE ALL FOR CHRIST.

1170
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,337
HE GAVE HIS WEALTH TO THE POOR

1171
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,069
AND BECAME
AN ITINERANT PREACHER.

1172
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,635
WALDO TAUGHT THAT THE BIBLE
SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD LITERALLY

1173
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,374
AND FREELY
PROCLAIMED TO THE PEOPLE

1174
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,245
IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.

1175
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,614
HE ENCOURAGED BELIEVERS

1176
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,347
TO LIVE LIVES
OF SIMPLICITY AND POVERTY

1177
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,683
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

1178
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,483
HE BOLDLY DENOUNCED
THE EXCESSES OF THE PRIESTS.

1179
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,187
BY AD 1 1 <i>7</i>0 PETER WALDO

1180
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,492
HAD GATHERED
A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS

1181
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,054
WHO WERE REFERRED TO

1182
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,569
AS 'THE POOR OF LYONS'
OR WALDENSIANS.

1183
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,002
PETER WALDO,
BY CONVENTIONAL SCHOLARSHIP,

1184
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,267
IS THE FOUNDER OF THE WALDENSES,

1185
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,105
A GROUP
OF BIBLE-BELIEVING INDIVIDUALS

1186
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,145
LIVING IN FRANCE AND ITALY.

1187
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,511
HE WAS A CATHOLIC LAYMAN
WHO BECAME INSPIRED

1188
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:30,450
BY THE PREACHING
REGARDING THE EARLY CHURCH

1189
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,455
AND HE STARTED A GROUP
OF TRAVELING PREACHERS

1190
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,582
WHO WOULD TEACH THE GOSPEL.

1191
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,491
HE SPOKE AGAINST
TRANSUBSTANTIATION AND THE MASS,

1192
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,429
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME
WALDENSES WHO SEEM TO GO TO MASS

1193
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,466
AND THEN
DO THEIR OWN WORSHIPS AS WELL.

1194
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,334
ONCE OFFICIALLY-TRAINED
INQUISITORS ARE OUT IN EUROPE,

1195
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:53,239
THEY START FINDING PEOPLE WHOM
THEY START CALLING 'WALDENSES'

1196
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,335
OR FOLLOWERS OF VALDES
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1197
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,380
SO SPRINKLED ACROSS EUROPE

1198
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:02,077
YOU GET THESE LITTLE CELLS
OF COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE

1199
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,585
WHERE LAYPEOPLE ARE MOSTLY,

1200
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:07,555
LET'S BE HONEST, THEY'RE MOSTLY
GOING TO CATHOLIC CHURCHES

1201
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,523
MOST OF THE YEAR.

1202
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,618
BUT ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR,
MAYBE EVERY YEAR OR 2,

1203
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:17,155
THEY WILL HAVE A TRAVELING TEAM
OF WALDENSIAN PASTORS

1204
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,066
WHO WILL ARRIVE
AND TALK TO THEM.

1205
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,398
EVERYWHERE HE WENT

1206
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,998
PETER WALDO SAW PEOPLE
HUNGERING FOR TRUTH.

1207
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,474
HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS
A FAMINE IN THE LAND

1208
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,239
FOR THE WORD OF GOD,
SO WALDO PAID A CLERIC

1209
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,476
TO ASSIST HIM
IN TRANSLATING THE NEW TESTAMENT

1210
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,450
INTO THE FRANCO VERNACULAR.

1211
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:42,014
THE STORY IS THAT VALDES
COMMISSIONED TWO LEARNED,

1212
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,525
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE IN LYONS

1213
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,428
TO PREPARE A TRANSLATION
OF PART OF THE BIBLE

1214
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,796
AND SOME SAYINGS
OF THE FATHERS

1215
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,501
INTO THE VERNACULAR LANGUAGE.

1216
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,628
SOMETHING BETWEEN
FRENCH AND PROVENCAL-

1217
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,696
IT'S REALLY
KIND OF HARD TO DESCRIBE-

1218
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,675
BUT IT SEEMS
TO HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRADITION

1219
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:04,577
THAT THE WALDENSIAN COMMUNITIES

1220
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,515
WOULD TRY TO ACQUIRE
COPIES OF SCRIPTURE

1221
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,814
IN THE COMMON LANGUAGE
OF THE PEOPLE.

1222
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,681
AND THEY WOULD CARRY
SCRIPTURES AROUND WITH THEM.

1223
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,815
THEY WOULD ACT
AS MERCHANTS AND TRADERS,

1224
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,686
SHARE THE SCRIPTURES
WITH THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY WENT.

1225
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,662
THERE'S EVEN REFERENCES TO THEM
SENDING THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE

1226
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,632
TO THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES
AND COLLEGES OF THE LAND

1227
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,225
SO THEY COULD SHARE
THEIR FAITH THERE

1228
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,568
AND ALSO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING
OF CONTEMPORARY THEOLOGY

1229
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,736
AND USE IT TO REACH OUT
TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY.

1230
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,279
BUT THE ROMAN CHURCH
COULD NOT LONG TOLERATE

1231
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,406
THIS FREE PREACHING
OF THE GOSPEL BY PEASANTS.

1232
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,816
DURING THE THIRD
LATERAN COUNCIL IN 1 1 <i>7</i>9,

1233
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:47,652
WALDO'S IDEAS WERE OFFICIALLY
CONDEMNED AS HERESY

1234
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,190
AND SOON AFTER,

1235
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,489
HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS
WERE EXCOMMUNICATED.

1236
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,326
DRIVEN AWAY FROM LYONS,
THE WALDENSIANS SETTLED

1237
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,799
IN THE HIGH VALLEYS OF PIEDMONT
AND THE FRENCH ALPS.

1238
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:03,828
HERE, AMONG THEIR FAMILIES,
THE BIBLE WAS MADE THE CHIEF STUDY.

1239
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:07,398
THE GOSPELS OF MATTHEW AND JOHN
WERE COMMITTED TO MEMORY,

1240
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,808
ALONG WITH MANY
OF THE EPISTLES.

1241
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,403
WITH NO PRINTING PRESS,

1242
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,846
THE WALDENSIANS
WERE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED

1243
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,885
IN HAND-COPYING THE SCRIPTURES.

1244
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,553
KNOWN FOR THEIR STRICT
ADHERENCE TO THE BIBLE,

1245
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,557
THESE LAY PREACHERS
SPREAD THEIR TEACHINGS ABROAD

1246
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,718
WHILE TRAVELING
AS PEDDLERS.

1247
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,352
TO AVOID ARREST,

1248
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:29,330
THEY'D SOMETIMES SEW
HAND-COPIED PASSAGES OF THE BIBLE

1249
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,263
INTO THE LINING
OF THEIR GARMENTS

1250
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,665
AND THEN THEY'D
CAREFULLY SHARE THEM

1251
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,260
WHEN THEY DETECTED
AN OPEN HEART.

1252
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,172
EVEN FOLLOWING THE DEATH
OF PETER WALDO IN 1 21<i>8</i>,

1253
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,539
THE ROMAN CHURCH

1254
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,171
CONTINUED TO FIERCELY
PERSECUTE THE WALDENSIANS.

1255
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,779
FOR CENTURIES, MANY WERE TRIED
AND SENTENCED TO DEATH

1256
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,847
IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

1257
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,725
THE HOLY SPIRIT STIRRED
UPON MANY WITHIN THE CHURCH

1258
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,465
WHO COURAGEOUSLY STOOD UP
AND CALLED FOR REFORM.

1259
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,269
ONE SUCH MAN
WAS JOHN WYCLIFF,

1260
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,469
AN ENGLISH THEOLOGIAN
AND LAY PREACHER,

1261
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,944
TRANSLATOR,
AND TEACHER AT OXFORD.

1262
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,274
HIS EDUCATION PROVED
TO BE A GREAT ASSET TO HIM

1263
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,944
AS HE BEGAN TO ADDRESS
THE CANCEROUS ERRORS

1264
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,552
THAT WERE SPREADING
AMONG GOD'S PEOPLE.

1265
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,453
WYCLIFF NEVER WANTED
TO SET HIMSELF UP

1266
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,515
AGAINST THE CHURCH'S LEADERS,

1267
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,823
BUT AS HE SAW
THE GLARING CONTRADICTIONS

1268
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:36,558
BETWEEN WHAT THE BIBLE SAID
AND WHAT THE CHURCH WAS DOING,

1269
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,600
HE COULD NOT KEEP SILENT.

1270
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:42,229
WELL, WYCLIFF IS REALLY
A RATHER UNUSUAL PERSON

1271
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:46,799
TO HAVE BECOME A HERETIC
BECAUSE HE WAS AN OXFORD DON,

1272
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,605
HE WAS VERY MUCH

1273
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:52,614
BROUGHT UP WITHIN THE POWER
STRUCTURE OF THE CHURCH

1274
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:57,676
AND, YET, HE WAS DISTRESSED
BY WHAT HE SAW AROUND HIM.

1275
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,311
AS HE SAW ROME

1276
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:02,414
SUBSTITUTING TRADITION
FOR THE HOLY SCRIPTURE,

1277
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:03,788
HE ACCUSED THE PRIESTHOOD

1278
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,349
OF WITHHOLDING
THE BREAD OF LIFE

1279
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,988
FROM THE SPIRITUALLY
STARVING PEOPLE.

1280
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:11,665
HE BELIEVED THAT THE BIBLE
WAS A SUPREME AUTHORITY

1281
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:16,865
AND HE COMMISSIONED
THE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.

1282
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:19,669
HE HAD SOME FOLLOWERS
CALLED LOLLARDS

1283
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:23,303
THAT WENT AROUND DISTRIBUTING
SCRIPTURE AND PREACHING.

1284
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,813
THEY DID BELIEVE
IN BIBLE READING.

1285
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:28,850
THEY DID READ WYCLIFF'S BIBLE

1286
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:34,379
AND THEY DID BELIEVE
IN THE SAME KIND OF SIMPLER PIETY

1287
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:38,757
THAT THE WALDENSIANS
AND OTHERS HAD ADVOCATED

1288
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,819
AS EARLY AS THE 1 2TH CENTURY.

1289
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,693
THIS WAS THE GREATEST GIFT

1290
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,790
HE COULD GIVE
THE COMMON PEOPLE.

1291
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,597
NO DOCUMENT HAS ALTERED
THE COURSE OF HISTORY

1292
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,265
MORE THAN THE ENGLISH
TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.

1293
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,036
HE BROUGHT FORWARD
SOME OF THE TRUTHS

1294
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,972
THAT PROTESTANTISM
WOULD LATER BRING FORWARD

1295
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,741
AND AS I JUST SUGGESTED,

1296
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,840
HIS TEACHINGS, EVEN THOUGH
IT'S CENTURIES BEFORE,

1297
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,876
IS PREPARING THE WAY
FOR MANY PEOPLE IN ENGLAND

1298
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,981
TO ACCEPT THE REFORMATION
WHEN IT COMES.

1299
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,548
WYCLIFF HAD THE AUDACITY

1300
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,720
TO DECLARE THAT THE UNIVERSAL
AUTHORITY OF THE POPE

1301
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,320
WAS UNBIBLICAL.

1302
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:19,858
IT WAS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS
THAT ON MAY 22, 13<i>77</i>

1303
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,698
POPE GREGORY THE 1 1 TH

1304
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,966
CONDEMNED THE WRITINGS
OF JOHN WYCLIFF

1305
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,837
STATING THAT HIS TEACHINGS

1306
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,672
WERE DANGEROUS
TO THE CHURCH AND THE STATE.

1307
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:32,339
WYCLIFF CONTINUED TO TEACH
SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ALONE

1308
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,645
AND THAT THE SCRIPTURES
WERE INFALLIBLE

1309
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,810
RATHER THAN THE ROMAN CHURCH.

1310
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,083
OVER TIME, HIS WRITINGS
AND WORK OF REFORM

1311
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,517
SPREAD OUT LIKE SEISMIC WAVES

1312
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:45,424
INFLUENCING MILLIONS
OF GOD'S PEOPLE.

1313
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,021
THEY CAN BE READ ANYWHERE
WHERE THERE ARE SCHOOLMEN,

1314
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:53,057
WHERE THERE ARE SCHOLASTIC
THEOLOGIANS WHO CAN PICK THEM UP.

1315
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:53,335
THEY DO TRAVEL
AND THEY TRAVEL TO BOHEMIA

1316
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,735
THEY DO TRAVEL
AND THEY TRAVEL TO BOHEMIA

1317
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:59,536
AND THEY INSPIRE
JOHN HUSS AS WELL.

1318
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:04,705
AND HUSS SHARES THE ATTACK
ON TRANSUBSTANTIATION,

1319
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,513
ON CLERICAL POWER
AND ON, AS WITH WYCLIFF,

1320
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,450
ON THE WEALTH OF THE CHURCH.

1321
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,388
HUSS WAS ONLY A YOUNG BOY
WHEN WYCLIFF PASSED AWAY,

1322
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,790
BUT WYCLIFF'S WORKS
HAD A POWERFUL INFLUENCE

1323
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,658
ON HIS LIFE
AND HIS FUTURE MISSION.

1324
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:24,426
JOHN HUSS
WAS A BOHEMIAN PREACHER,

1325
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,865
ALSO A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR

1326
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,562
AND ALSO
KING'S CHAPLAIN FOR AWHILE.

1327
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:34,132
HE'S ENTRUSTED, EVENTUALLY
WITH THE OFFICE OF PREACHING

1328
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,870
AT A LITTLE CHAPEL
THAT HAS JUST BEEN FOUNDED,

1329
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,848
THE BETHLEHEM CHAPEL.

1330
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,714
LIKE WYCLIFF, JOHN HUSS
PREACHED THE SCRIPTURES

1331
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,413
IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE

1332
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,615
A PRACTICE THAT THE CHURCH
HAD NOW FORBIDDEN

1333
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,386
IN FAVOR
OF THE LOST LANGUAGE OF LATIN.

1334
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,757
HE DID PREACH
IN THE VERNACULAR LANGUAGE

1335
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,959
AND THE BOHEMIANS HAD HAD
SCRIPTURE IN THEIR LANGUAGE

1336
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,625
DESPITE CHURCH COUNCILS.

1337
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,033
AND IT'S FROM THAT

1338
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:05,039
THAT HE COMES INTO CONTACT
WITH THE TEACHINGS OF WYCLIFF

1339
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:11,979
AND HE ESPECIALLY IS DRAWN TO
THE ATTACK ON TRANSUBSTANTIATION,

1340
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:16,108
ON THE ATTACK ON THE WEALTH
AND INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH.

1341
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,848
WALKING THROUGH TOWN ONE DAY,
HUSS NOTICED A COUPLE OF PAINTINGS

1342
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:24,086
THAT TWO MEN HAD DISPLAYED
AS A SILENT PROTEST.

1343
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,652
EACH OF THE CANVASES
PORTRAYED A DIFFERENT SCENE.

1344
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,995
ON ONE WAS THE IMAGE
OF THE LOWLY JESUS

1345
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:35,196
HUMBLY ENTERING JERUSALEM
WITH HIS TRAVEL-WORN DISCIPLES.

1346
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,531
ON THE OTHER CANVAS
WAS AN IMAGE OF THE POPE

1347
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,041
DRESSED IN RICH
AND LUXURIOUS CLOTHING,

1348
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,668
CARRIED ON A LITTER

1349
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,838
AND FOLLOWED
BY A REGAL PROCESSION.

1350
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,747
THE PAINTINGS CERTAINLY
PRESENTED A CONTRAST

1351
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,181
BETWEEN JESUS,

1352
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,617
WHO SAID
THAT FOXES HAVE HOLES

1353
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,120
AND THE BIRDS
OF THE AIR HAVE NESTS

1354
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,215
AND THE SON OF MAN
HAS NOWHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD,

1355
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,858
WITH THE MAGNIFICENT SPLENDOR

1356
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:03,126
OF THE PAPAL PALACE
AND THE PAPAL ENTOURAGE.

1357
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,894
MOVED BY THIS KNOWLEDGE,

1358
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,800
HE BEGAN TO PUBLICLY DENOUNCE
THE PRIDE, AMBITION,

1359
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,770
AND CORRUPTION OF THE CLERGY

1360
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:13,137
AND HE FEARLESSLY CALLED
FOR THE CHURCH TO REFORM.

1361
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,110
IF YOU MUST INTERPRET SCRIPTURE
ACCORDING TO TRUTH,

1362
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:20,114
TRUTH IS DEFINED
BY WHAT THE CHURCH BELIEVES.

1363
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:23,151
HOW DO YOU CORRECT
AN ERROR IN THE CHURCH?

1364
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,949
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHECK ON MISTAKES.

1365
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,012
THERE IS NO CORRECTING
THE CHURCH.

1366
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,651
AND THAT, I THINK,
IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW

1367
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:36,790
OF WHAT ALLOWED THE CHURCH
TO START GOING WRONG

1368
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,060
AND KEEP GOING WRONG.

1369
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:42,262
JOHN HUSS WAS INVITED
TO COME TO CONSTANCE, GERMANY

1370
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,200
TO DEFEND HIS CRITICISM
OF THE CHURCH OF ROME.

1371
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:49,506
SIGISMUND, KING OF HUNGARY,
AND LATER, THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE

1372
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,069
GUARANTEED HIM A SAFE PASSAGE,

1373
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,207
BUT IMMEDIATELY
UPON HUSS' ARRIVAL IN THE CITY,

1374
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,775
HE WAS ARRESTED
AND PLACED IN THE DUNGEON

1375
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,718
AT GOTTLIEBEN CASTLE.

1376
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,915
KING SIGISMUND
WAS GREATLY ANGERED

1377
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,583
AT THE IMPRISONMENT OF HUSS

1378
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,650
AND HE THREATENED
THE CHURCH COUNCIL

1379
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,889
BUT THE COUNCIL
CONVINCED SIGISMUND

1380
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,592
THAT PROMISES MADE
TO A HERETIC WERE NOT BINDING.

1381
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:15,125
ON JULY 6, 1 <i>4</i>1<i>5</i>,
THE COUNCIL GATHERED

1382
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,230
INTO THE CATHEDRAL
AFTER MASS AND LITURGY

1383
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:22,038
AND JOHN HUSS
WAS THEN LED IN FOR HIS TRIAL.

1384
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,911
HE WAS ASKED
TO DEFEND HIS POSITIONS.

1385
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,575
IN THE ACT OF DEFENDING THEM

1386
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,711
HE WAS FOUND
TO HAVE VOICED A HERESY

1387
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,724
AND SO HE WAS SEIZED
AND TRIED FOR HERESY.

1388
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,819
GUARDS THEN LED HUSS
AWAY TO BE EXECUTED.

1389
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,559
AT THE PLACE OF HIS EXECUTION,
HUSS STOOD FIRM.

1390
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,863
AS THE FLAMES ROSE ABOUT HIM,

1391
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:51,133
HE WAS ACTUALLY
ABLE TO LIFT HIS VOICE IN SONG.

1392
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,073
AMONG HIS DYING WORDS,
HUSS PREDICTED,

1393
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,976
''IN A HUNDRED YEARS
GOD WILL RAISE UP A MAN

1394
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:00,345
WHOSE CALLS FOR REFORM
CANNOT BE SUPPRESSED.''

1395
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,152
RAISED IN A HUMBLE HOME
IN MANSFIELD, GERMANY,

1396
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,984
MARTIN LUTHER, THEOLOGIAN,
AUTHOR, COMPOSER,

1397
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,991
AND PRIEST WAS ARGUABLY

1398
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,027
THE BEST KNOWN
RELIGIOUS REFORMER

1399
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,688
OF THE 1 6TH CENTURY.

1400
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:18,790
LUTHER WAS BORN
ON NOVEMBER 1 0, 1 <i>48</i>3,

1401
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:22,894
NEARLY <i>7</i>0 YEARS
AFTER THE MARTYRDOM OF JOHN HUSS.

1402
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,235
BORN INTO A HARDWORKING
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY,

1403
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,605
WITH SEVERAL
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

1404
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,009
LUTHER DEVELOPED A FIRM
CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY.

1405
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,049
THE LUTHER FAMILY
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN,

1406
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,017
TO SOME EXTENT,
A FAMILY OF OVER-ACHIEVERS.

1407
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:38,610
THEY WERE VERY STRICT,

1408
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,279
ACCORDING
TO LUTHER'S LATER STORIES.

1409
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,824
THEY WERE VERY STRICT
ON THE YOUNG MARTIN

1410
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,620
AND THEY CERTAINLY SAW

1411
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,254
THAT THE WAY FORWARD FOR THEIR SON
WAS THROUGH EDUCATION.

1412
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,025
BUT WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,

1413
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:53,227
HE WAS INTENDED
TO BECOME A LAWYER.

1414
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,997
HOWEVER,
A DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE

1415
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,699
FOREVER ALTERED
THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE.

1416
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:03,734
LUTHER IS CAUGHT IN A THUNDERSTORM
AND FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.

1417
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,838
HE'S OUTSIDE AND HE FEARS
HE'LL BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

1418
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,281
LIGHTNING WAS STRIKING
IN FRONT OF HIM AND BEHIND HIM

1419
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:13,185
AND ON BOTH SIDES OF HIM
AND SO IN TERROR HE CRIES OUT

1420
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,689
AND PROMISES
THAT IF A SAINT WILL SAVE HIM,

1421
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,385
HE WILL BECOME A MONK.

1422
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:23,295
HE CALLED OUT TO SAINT ANNE,
THE SAINT OF HOPELESS CAUSES.

1423
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:28,667
''SAINT ANNE, DELIVER ME
AND I'LL BECOME A MONK<i>!</i>''

1424
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,671
AND HE KEPT HIS WORD.

1425
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,071
IN SPITE
OF HIS FATHER'S ANGRY PROTESTS,

1426
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,009
LUTHER DROPPED
HIS LAW STUDIES, SOLD HIS BOOKS,

1427
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,707
AND ENTERED A CLOSED
AUGUSTINIAN MONASTERY AT ERFURT

1428
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,411
AND FULLY DEDICATED HIS TIME
TO THE MONASTIC LIFE.

1429
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,682
FOLLOWING HIS DESPERATE
LONGING FOR SALVATION,

1430
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,020
HE PRACTICED FREQUENT FASTINGS,
LONG HOURS OF PRAYER,

1431
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,890
AUSTERE LIVING
AND ENDLESS CONFESSION.

1432
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,995
''IF ANYONE COULD HAVE GAINED
HEAVEN AS A MONK

1433
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,797
THEN I WOULD, INDEED,
HAVE BEEN AMONG THEM.''

1434
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,203
HE FOUND
AN ELDER CONFESSOR THERE

1435
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:09,233
WHO REALIZED THAT LUTHER
HAD A PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE SOUL

1436
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,972
AND THIS CONFESSOR REALIZED

1437
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:14,174
THAT LUTHER
NEEDED TO TEACH THE BIBLE.

1438
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:20,085
SO HE BECOMES SIMULTANEOUSLY
PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY,

1439
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,282
PREACHER IN THE TOWN CHURCH,

1440
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,723
AND A MEMBER
OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY

1441
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,852
IN THE AUGUSTINIAN HOUSE.

1442
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,955
HE'S BASICALLY DOING THREE JOBS.

1443
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,830
AT WITTENBERG HE LEARNED
TO STUDY THE BIBLE

1444
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,732
IN ITS ORIGINAL TONGUES.

1445
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,863
SOON, HE BEGAN
TO FREELY SHARE THE TRUTHS

1446
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,908
THAT HE WAS LEARNING
IN HIS LECTURES

1447
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,205
AND HIS LISTENERS
WERE DELIGHTED.

1448
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,075
IN 1<i>5</i>1 0,
LUTHER MADE A PILGRIMAGE

1449
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,944
TO VISIT THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE CHURCH

1450
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,006
IN THE HOLY CITY OF ROME.

1451
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,247
HE WAS SICKENED TO WITNESS
THE TERRIBLE GREED AND WICKEDNESS

1452
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,950
THAT HE SAW
AMONG ALL CLASSES OF THE CLERGY.

1453
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,254
HIS GREAT EXPECTATION
OF THE HOLY CITY

1454
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,919
WAS CRUSHED AS HE BEHELD

1455
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:03,897
THE DECADENT LIFESTYLES
OF THE MONKS AND THE PRIESTS.

1456
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,297
THIS WAS IN STARK CONTRAST

1457
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:08,234
TO HIS VERY
FRUGAL LIFE IN GERMANY.

1458
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,863
BUT LUTHER'S
MOST UNSETTLING REVELATION

1459
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,237
WAS YET TO COME.

1460
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,175
HE WENT TO ROME AND HE WAS
CLIMBING UP THE STAIRS THERE

1461
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,837
AND HEARS A VOICE-

1462
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,438
NOT NECESSARILY A VERBAL ONE,
BUT ONE IN HIS HEAD-

1463
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,347
''THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.''

1464
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,046
AND SO CLIMBING UP THESE,
PILATE'S STAIRS, ON HIS KNEES,

1465
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,284
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO EARN YOU
SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE

1466
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,452
OF NOT BURNING
IN PURGATORY FOR TOO LONG.

1467
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,497
AND IT JUST DAWNED ON HIM
AS HE LOOKED AROUND,

1468
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,225
''WHAT ARE WE DOING?

1469
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:40,166
THE BIBLE SAYS
THIS COMES BY FAITH.''

1470
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,169
AND HE GOT UP OFF HIS KNEES

1471
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,228
AND THIS SEEMED TO BE
A TURNING POINT.

1472
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,898
LUTHER FINALLY UNDERSTOOD

1473
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,499
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUSTING
IN THE MERITS OF CHRIST

1474
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,943
FOR FORGIVENESS.

1475
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,914
AFTER RETURNING FROM ROME IN 1<i>5</i>1 2,

1476
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,212
LUTHER WAS AWARDED
THE DOCTORATE OF DIVINITY

1477
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,378
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WITTENBERG

1478
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:01,115
AND HE BEGAN
TO BOLDLY PREACH TO THE PEOPLE

1479
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:04,124
THAT CHRISTIANS SHOULD NOT
ACCEPT ANY DOCTRINE

1480
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,820
UNLESS IT CAME FROM THE BIBLE

1481
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,126
AND IT WAS THIS PRINCIPLE
OF ''SOLA SCRIPTURA''

1482
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,292
THAT WOULD BECOME THE BATTLE CRY
OF THE REFORMATION.

1483
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:18,169
IT'S IN A SERIES
OF THREE TREATISES IN 1<i>5</i>20

1484
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,370
THAT HE PRESENTS
THE NOTION THAT NOW,

1485
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,412
SINCE THE TRADITION
OF THE CHURCH

1486
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,472
HAS BECOME SO CORRUPTED
BY HUMAN INNOVATION,

1487
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,314
THAT THE CHURCH
SHOULD ONLY FOLLOW

1488
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,581
THE TESTIMONY OF THE SCRIPTURES.

1489
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,852
THIS IS THE COMMON THREAD

1490
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:41,294
IN THE STORY THAT DESCRIBES
THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH.

1491
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,388
IT'S WHEN PEOPLE LOST SCRIPTURE

1492
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,365
AND THE ABILITY TO READ
SCRIPTURE FOR THEMSELVES

1493
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,924
AND THERE WAS A BARRIER

1494
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,902
BETWEEN THEM AND SCRIPTURE
AND THEM AND CHRIST.

1495
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,462
AND THEN IT BEGAN TO RECOVER

1496
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,440
WHEN MARTIN LUTHER
AND HIS COLLEAGUES

1497
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,170
DECIDED THAT SCRIPTURE
REALLY WAS THE AUTHORITY,

1498
01:16:56,244 --> 01:17:00,237
''SOLA SCRIPTURA,
TOTA SCRIPTURA, PRIMA SCRIPTURA''

1499
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,910
AND THEY BEGAN
TO CLIMB BACK OUT.

1500
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,578
ABOUT THIS SAME TIME,

1501
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,918
ROME WAS BREAKING GROUND
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION

1502
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:11,619
OF THE MAGNIFICENT
NEW SAINT PETER'S BASILICA.

1503
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:14,423
THE CHURCH SENT JOHN TETZEL,
A DOMINICAN FRIAR,

1504
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:17,624
TO GERMANY
TO SELL INDULGENCES

1505
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:21,567
IN ORDER TO RAISE THE FUNDS
NECESSARY FOR THE CATHEDRAL.

1506
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,104
THE CHURCH BELIEVES,

1507
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,332
NOT ONLY
THAT ITS SERVICES AND OFFERINGS

1508
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,931
CAN HELP THE DEAD,

1509
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:30,968
BUT ALSO THAT THE HEAD
OF THE CHURCH IN THE WEST, THE POPE,

1510
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:36,109
CAN, OUT OF THE SUPER
ABUNDANCE OF SAVED UP GRACE,

1511
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,914
WHICH IS IN THE POSSESSION
OF THE CHURCH,

1512
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,921
THE CHURCH
CAN SIMPLY DECLARE

1513
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:46,052
THAT SOMEONE'S PENALTIES
OWED AFTER THEY DIED

1514
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,561
ARE JUST WIPED OUT.

1515
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:50,427
THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED
AN INDULGENCE.

1516
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,024
THE FULL PLENARY INDULGENCE

1517
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,399
ABSOLVED A PERSON
OF ALL THE SINS

1518
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,270
THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED
UP TO THAT TIME

1519
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:04,074
AND THUS SPEEDED YOU,
ACCORDING TO CHURCH TEACHING,

1520
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:08,173
THROUGH PURGATORY
DIRECTLY INTO HEAVEN.

1521
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,548
BY VERY LATE
IN THE MIDDLE AGES,

1522
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,383
THE CHURCH
HAS GOT INTO ITS HEAD

1523
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:17,448
THAT IT CAN SAY TO PEOPLE,

1524
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,993
''IF YOU ARE WILLING

1525
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,428
''TO MAKE AN OFFERING
TO THE CHURCH,

1526
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,590
''THE CHURCH
WILL GIVE AN INDULGENCE

1527
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,657
''IN THE MANNER OF AN OFFERING,

1528
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:32,537
''FOR YOUR DEPARTED FAMILY,
FRIEND, RELATIVE, LOVED ONE

1529
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,373
AND THAT LOVED ONE WILL ESCAPE
THE PAINS OF PURGATORY,''

1530
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,379
SUPPOSEDLY IMMEDIATELY.

1531
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,712
THIS BECAME,
BY THE 1 <i>4</i>TH AND 1<i>5</i>TH CENTURY,

1532
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,047
A VERY POPULAR BELIEF

1533
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:47,145
AND PEOPLE
CLAMORED FOR INDULGENCES.

1534
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:48,519
WHEN LUTHER LEARNED

1535
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,990
THAT HIS MEMBERS
WERE PURCHASING INDULGENCES,

1536
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,583
HE WAS OUTRAGED.

1537
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:56,119
AS THE PEOPLE CAME TO HIM
TO CASH IN THEIR INDULGENCES,

1538
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,564
HE FLATLY REFUSED
TO HONOR THEM.

1539
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,568
LUTHER DECLARED
THAT WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO DO

1540
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:05,538
WAS TO SINCERELY REPENT
AND TURN FROM THEIR SINS.

1541
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:09,236
THIS WAS THE FIRST ISSUE
THAT FORCED LUTHER INTO BATTLE

1542
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,575
WITH HIS OWN BELOVED CHURCH.

1543
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:14,615
ON OCTOBER 31 , 1<i>5</i>1 <i>7</i>,

1544
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,708
LUTHER NAILED
HIS FAMOUS PROTEST

1545
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:20,721
TO THE DOORS OF ALL THE SAINTS
CHURCH IN WITTENBERG.

1546
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:23,485
WHAT ARE THE 9<i>5</i> THESES
THAT HE FAMOUSLY NAILS

1547
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:26,026
TO THE DOOR
OF WITTENBERG CASTLE CHURCH?

1548
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,063
IT'S AN ACADEMIC INVITATION
TO A DEBATE.

1549
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:31,793
YOU WRITE DOWN
9<i>5</i> THESIS STATEMENTS

1550
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,729
AND YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING,
''HERE ARE MY PROPOSALS''

1551
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,203
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
MORE STRONGLY WORDED

1552
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,433
THAN YOU MAY THINK
BECAUSE IT'S A DEBATING POINT;

1553
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,477
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A DISPUTATION.

1554
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:48,642
THE 9<i>5</i> THESES IS JUST
A SERIES OF 9<i>5</i> PROPOSITIONS

1555
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:53,051
THAT HE INTENDS TO SPARK
A UNIVERSITY DEBATE ON.

1556
01:19:53,121 --> 01:20:00,050
AND THIS IS STANDARD ISSUE
LATE MEDIEVAL ACADEMIC PRACTICE.

1557
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,525
SO LUTHER IS ENGAGING

1558
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,566
IN A VERY NARROWLY
ACADEMIC EXERCISE.

1559
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:09,161
IT'S LIKE PUBLISHING A PAPER
IN A SCHOLARLY JOURNAL TODAY.

1560
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,636
AS A HISTORIAN MYSELF AT TIMES,

1561
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,265
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY EXPECTING
VERY MANY PEOPLE TO READ THIS,

1562
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,174
YOU'RE JUST GOING
INTO A VERY NARROW CIRCLE.

1563
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,735
SO HE TAKES IT
AND HE NAILS IT TO THE DOOR

1564
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,406
OF WITTENBERG CASTLE CHURCH

1565
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,744
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE TRADITIONAL PLACE

1566
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,445
YOU POST INVITATIONS
FOR A DISPUTATION.

1567
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,420
SO HE'S NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING,
NECESSARILY, TO COME OF THIS.

1568
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,389
AND THIS GOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S ATTENTION,

1569
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:31,118
INCLUDING THE POPE'S.

1570
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,388
AS FAR AS LUTHER'S CONCERNED,
HE'S NOT PROMOTING SOMETHING

1571
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,191
THAT THE CHURCH
WOULD BE HOSTILE TO,

1572
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,528
HE BELIEVES HE'S PROMOTING THINGS
THAT THE CHURCH WILL WELCOME.

1573
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,660
AND, INDEED, IF YOU GO BACK
TO THE EARLY CHURCH FATHERS,

1574
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,294
INCLUDING AUGUSTINE,

1575
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,464
YOU CAN FIND
MANY THINGS IN THEIR WRITINGS

1576
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,871
IN ACCORD WITH LUTHER'S IDEAS.

1577
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,337
SO LUTHER ACTUALLY EXPECTS
PEOPLE TO SORT OF SAY,

1578
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,505
''OH, GREAT.
THANKS FOR POINTING THAT OUT.''

1579
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,139
WHICH WAS PERHAPS A TRIFLE NA<i></i>VE

1580
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:58,414
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT COMES
FROM HIM BEING AN ACADEMIC.

1581
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:02,513
BUT LUTHER IS NOT TRYING
TO SET UP ANOTHER MOVEMENT-

1582
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:03,853
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

1583
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,552
BUT THE REALITY, OF COURSE,

1584
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,356
IS THAT THE CHURCH
DOES NOT WELCOME

1585
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,294
MUCH OF WHAT LUTHER
HAS TO SAY.

1586
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,355
AND A BULL WENT OUT-

1587
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:14,459
A PAPAL BULL
MEANING A KIND OF DECLARATION -

1588
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,697
CONDEMNING LUTHER
AND HIS WRITINGS

1589
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:21,208
AND SAYING THEY SHOULD BE
CONSIGNED TO THE FLAMES.

1590
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:23,437
THE BULL WAS DELIVERED AT WITTENBERG

1591
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:27,845
AND INSTEAD OF CONSIGNING
THE WRITINGS TO THE FLAMES,

1592
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,851
LUTHER HAD A BIG GATHERING
IN WITTENBERG

1593
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,353
AND CONSIGNED
THE BULL TO THE FLAMES

1594
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,753
AND THERE WAS A BURNING
OF THIS PAPAL BULL

1595
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:40,352
AND THIS, OF COURSE,
WAS A ''THROW DOWN'' NOW, RIGHT?

1596
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,225
THE CHALLENGE
HAD BEEN SENT OUT

1597
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,288
AND THE CHALLENGE
HAD BEEN RESPONDED TO.

1598
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,663
AND THAT'S WHEN LUTHER SAYS,

1599
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,202
''RIGHT, IF YOU CONDEMN ME
I WILL CONDEMN YOU,''

1600
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,364
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
THIS IS A MATTER OF TRUTH.

1601
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,839
AND SO, IF THE CHURCH
IS CONDEMNING BIBLICAL TRUTH

1602
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,673
THEN THE CHURCH
MUST ACTUALLY BE ANTICHRIST

1603
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,713
AND HE CALLS IT THAT
AND, OF COURSE,

1604
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,304
ONCE YOU CALL
SOMEBODY ANTICHRIST,

1605
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:04,443
IT'S RATHER HARD TO REACH
CONSENSUS AND COMPROMISE.

1606
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,783
SO THE GERMAN EMPEROR
ORGANIZED A HEARING

1607
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:08,880
AND ALL THE IMPORTANT
PRINCES AND PRIESTS

1608
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,824
WERE ASSEMBLED
FOR AN HISTORIC MEETING

1609
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,656
AT A PLACE CALLED WORMS.

1610
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,286
SO THERE WERE
REPRESENTATIVES HERE

1611
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,388
OF ALL THE DIFFERENT
PRINCES, NOBLES,

1612
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,933
AND FREE CITIES OF THE EMPIRE

1613
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,869
AND LUTHER GOES, BELIEVING
HE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO DEBATE.

1614
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,964
THE CHURCH KNOWS
THAT LUTHER'S A BRILLIANT DEBATER

1615
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,471
AND THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE.

1616
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,306
HE WAS PULLED UP
BEFORE THE GROUP.

1617
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,608
HE WAS SHOWN
A PILE OF HIS BOOKS.

1618
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:37,641
HE WAS ASKED TWO QUESTIONS:
''ARE THESE BOOKS YOURS?''

1619
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:40,517
AND ''WILL YOU RECANT?''

1620
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:43,989
WILL YOU WITHDRAW
THE TEACHINGS YOU'VE MADE IN THEM?

1621
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:46,591
AND HE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY REPLY.

1622
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,289
HE SAID,
''WELL, YES THEY ARE MY BOOKS

1623
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,525
BUT THERE'S MANY THINGS
WRITTEN THERE

1624
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:55,330
AND I NEED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.''

1625
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,338
HE ALMOST LOSES HIS NERVE ,
BUT ULTIMATELY HE DOESN'T,

1626
01:22:58,406 --> 01:22:59,964
THE NEXT DAY HE COMES IN

1627
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,942
AND HE STARTS TO PLAY
WITH WORDS AND THEY SAY,

1628
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,479
''ARE ALL THESE YOUR WORKS
AND DO YOU RECANT THEM?''

1629
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,482
HE SAYS, ''DO YOU ASK ME
TO RECANT ALL MY WORKS

1630
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,949
''BECAUSE SOME OF MY WORKS

1631
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,747
''EVERYONE IN THE CHURCH
WOULD AGREE WITH?

1632
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,344
''I'VE WRITTEN AGAINST CERTAIN EVILS

1633
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,979
THAT THE CHURCH
GENERALLY AGREES ARE WRONG.''

1634
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:16,921
HE'S TRYING
TO GET INTO A DEBATE

1635
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,926
AND THE AUTHORITIES
AREN'T HAVING ANY OF THIS.

1636
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,586
THEY SAY, ''NO, NO, NO.

1637
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,324
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY-
ARE YOU GOING TO RETRACT THESE?

1638
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,695
ARE YOU GOING TO RECANT?''

1639
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,393
IT'S AN HEROIC MOMENT
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE,

1640
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,026
AS FAR AS LUTHER IS CONCERNED,

1641
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:30,498
HE BELIEVES
IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO HIS DEATH.

1642
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,709
''UNLESS I AM CONVINCED
BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE SCRIPTURES

1643
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,406
''OR BY CLEAR REASON,

1644
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,676
''FOR I DO NOT TRUST
EITHER IN THE POPE

1645
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,274
''OR IN COUNCILS ALONE,

1646
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,751
''SINCE IT IS WELL KNOWN
THAT THEY HAVE OFTEN ERRED

1647
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,549
''AND CONTRADICTED THEMSELVES,

1648
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,681
''I AM BOUND
BY THE SCRIPTURES I HAVE QUOTED

1649
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,524
''AND MY CONSCIENCE
IS CAPTIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD.

1650
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,860
''I CANNOT AND WILL NOT
RECANT ANYTHING

1651
01:23:56,931 --> 01:24:00,765
''SINCE IT IS NEITHER SAFE NOR RIGHT
TO GO AGAINST CONSCIENCE.

1652
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:04,327
''HERE I STAND.
I CAN DO NO OTHER.

1653
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,307
MAY GOD HELP ME.
AMEN.''

1654
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,640
THE COUNCIL DID NOT HAVE MUCH
IT COULD SAY IN REPLY.

1655
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,306
LUTHER WAS DECLARED AN OUTLAW.

1656
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,839
HIS LITERATURE WAS BANNED
AND HIS ARREST ORDERED.

1657
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,547
THE DOCUMENT SAID,
''WE WANT HIM TO BE APPREHENDED

1658
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,614
AND TO BE PUNISHED
AS A NOTORIOUS HERETIC.''

1659
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,682
NOW LUTHER
HAD BEEN GIVEN A SAFE CONDUCT

1660
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,694
TO THE DIET OF WORMS,

1661
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,595
JUST AS HUSS HAD BEEN GIVEN
TO THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE

1662
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,929
JUST OVER 1 00 YEARS EARLIER.

1663
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,730
AND THERE WERE THOSE AUTHORITIES

1664
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,862
WHO URGED THE HOLY
ROMAN EMPEROR, CHARLES THE V,

1665
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,906
TO IGNORE THE SAFE CONDUCT,

1666
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:42,966
JUST AS THE EMPEROR SIGISMUND
HAD WITH HUSS' SAFE CONDUCT.

1667
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:45,706
CHARLES THE V
DIDN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN

1668
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,611
AS THE SECOND EMPEROR
THAT HAD RENEGED

1669
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:51,914
IN A GOOD-FAITH
CONDUCT PASSAGE AND SO,

1670
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,510
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

1671
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:54,987
THIS REASON
AND MAYBE SOME OTHERS,

1672
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:59,891
HE ALLOWED LUTHER
TO LEAVE TOWN AND START HOME.

1673
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,020
THE THOUGHT
WAS HE WOULD PROBABLY BE KILLED

1674
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,621
BY SOMEONE ON THE WAY

1675
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,825
BECAUSE THERE WAS
AN OPEN PRICE ON HIS HEAD.

1676
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,392
INSTEAD, OF COURSE,
LUTHER IS KIDNAPPED

1677
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,564
BY AN ARMED GROUP OF MEN

1678
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,630
WHO WERE ACTUALLY
WORKING FOR FREDERICK THE WISE

1679
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,972
WHO DECIDES HE NEEDS
TO TAKE LUTHER OUT OF CIRCULATION

1680
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,568
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1681
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:18,976
TO WARTBURG CASTLE,

1682
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,605
WHICH THE ELECTOR
FREDERICK KNEW ABOUT

1683
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:22,616
BUT NOBODY KNEW
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO LUTHER.

1684
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:24,515
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS DEAD.

1685
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:26,884
FOR THE NEXT YEAR,
FROM THIS LONELY EXILE,

1686
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,719
WHICH LUTHER REFERRED
TO AS 'MY PATMOS',

1687
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:33,659
THE FORMER PRIEST CONTINUED
HIS WORK OF PROLIFIC WRITING.

1688
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:36,788
HE EVEN MANAGED
TO TRANSLATE THE NEW TESTAMENT

1689
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,959
FROM GREEK
INTO THE GERMAN LANGUAGE.

1690
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,763
NOW, ABOUT <i>7</i>2 YEARS

1691
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:45,135
BEFORE LUTHER COMPLETED
HIS NEW TESTAMENT TRANSLATION,

1692
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,470
GUTENBERG CHANGED HISTORY

1693
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,874
WITH THE INVENTION
OF THE PRINTING PRESS.

1694
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,105
WITH THIS WONDERFUL
NEW TECHNOLOGY,

1695
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,614
THE TRUTH OF GOD'S WORD
BEGAN TO SPREAD

1696
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,708
LIKE THE LEAVES
OF AUTUMN ALL THROUGH EUROPE.

1697
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:00,549
AND SO, IN THE MIDST
OF THIS GREAT REFORMATION,

1698
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:04,080
THE LORD ARMED HIS PEOPLE
WITH THE SWORD OF HIS WORD.

1699
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,922
AROUND THIS SAME TIME,

1700
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,191
SEVERAL OTHER POWERFUL
CHAMPIONS OF TRUTH ROSE UP

1701
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,625
FROM WITHIN THE CHURCH OF ROME.

1702
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:15,533
AMONG THESE BRAVE MEN CALLING
FOR A RETURN TO THE SCRIPTURES

1703
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:19,198
WERE PHILIPP MELANCTHON,
WILLIAM TYNDALE, JOHN CALVIN,

1704
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:22,534
AND JOHN KNOX,
JUST TO NAME A FEW.

1705
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,909
AS THE REFORMERS PREACHED
AND THE PRINTING PRESS CLATTERED,

1706
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,143
THE TEEMING MASSES
STUDIED THE WORD OF GOD.

1707
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,082
GRADUALLY THE LIGHT OF TRUTH

1708
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:34,849
BEGAN TO DISSOLVE THE SHACKLES
OF ERROR AND SUPERSTITION

1709
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,790
THAT HAD BOUND
THE PEOPLE FOR AGES.

1710
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,952
LIKE A BREATH
OF FRESH SPRING AIR,

1711
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,896
EUROPE EXPERIENCED
A RELIGIOUS RENAISSANCE.

1712
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,596
''AND YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH

1713
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,002
AND THE TRUTH
SHALL MAKE YOU FREE.''

1714
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:57,172
THE BOOK OF REVELATION ALSO
FORETELLS THAT IN THE FINAL DAYS

1715
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,008
THE DRAGON, SATAN,

1716
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,480
WILL ONCE AGAIN
INTENSIFY HIS EFFORTS

1717
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,074
TO PERSECUTE
THE CHURCH OF GOD.

1718
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,710
THEY ARE IDENTIFIED

1719
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,846
AS THE ONES WHO KEEP
THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD

1720
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,949
AND HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS.

1721
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:15,052
REVELATION WARNS
THAT IN THE LAST DAYS

1722
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:19,065
THERE WILL BE A VERY CONVINCING
COUNTERFEIT OF GOD'S REAL CHURCH

1723
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,727
THAT COMPROMISES
THE TRUTH OF SCRIPTURE.

1724
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:27,264
JESUS WARNS IT WILL NEARLY
DECEIVE THE WHOLE WORLD.

1725
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,841
''FOR FALSE CHRISTS
AND FALSE PROPHETS WILL RISE

1726
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,678
''AND SHOW SIGNS
AND WONDERS TO DECEIVE,

1727
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,218
IF POSSIBLE, EVEN THE ELECT.''

1728
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,053
SHORTLY AFTER THIS FINAL DECEPTION
CHRIST WILL RETURN.

1729
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:46,759
AND HE WILL COME FOR A CHURCH
THAT HAS BEEN PURIFIED

1730
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,922
FROM ALL THE FALSE
TRADITIONS AND PAGANISM.

1731
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,295
IT WILL BE A CHURCH

1732
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:53,227
THAT REQUIRES
A ''THUS SAYETH THE LORD''

1733
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:55,997
FOR EVERY DOCTRINE
THAT IT HOLDS.

1734
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,937
JESUS ALSO SAID
THAT WHEN HE RETURNS,

1735
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,531
THE WORLD WILL BE ABSORBED

1736
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,873
IN SELFISHNESS,
VIOLENCE AND MUTINY.

1737
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,846
''AND YOU WILL HEAR
OF WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS.

1738
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,815
''FOR NATION
WILL RISE AGAINST NATION

1739
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,684
''AND THERE WILL BE FAMINES,
PESTILENCES AND EARTHQUAKES.

1740
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:16,053
''THE LOVE OF MANY
WILL GROW COLD

1741
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,888
AND THEN THE END WILL COME.''

1742
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,760
THIS SPIRITUAL WAR HAS BEEN RAGING
DOWN THROUGH THE AGES

1743
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,857
AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS PROPHEC Y
IS FAST FULFILLING.

1744
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:31,962
AS THE BATTLE INTENSIFIES,
WE'RE ALL FACED WITH A CHOICE.

1745
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,833
''CHOOSE FOR YOURSELVES
THIS DAY WHOM YOU WILL SERVE.''

1746
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:40,313
FRIENDS, WE'VE JUST SEEN

1747
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,975
HOW THE GLORIOUS LIGHT
OF GOD'S CHURCH

1748
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:45,042
WAS OVERSHADOWED AND DISTORTED

1749
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:48,088
THROUGH THE INFLUENCE
OF MYTHOLOGY.

1750
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,623
WE'VE ALSO SEEN

1751
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,852
HOW EARLY CHRISTIANS
WERE GRADUALLY ENTICED

1752
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,224
TO ADOPT PAGAN RITUALS
AND TRADITIONS

1753
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,820
IN PLACE OF BIBLICAL TRUTH.

1754
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,731
BUT THEN GOD ROSE UP
FAITHFUL MEN AND WOMEN

1755
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:03,737
TO RESIST THE ERRORS
OF AN ENTIRE EMPIRE.

1756
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:06,171
HISTORY IS NOW REPEATING ITSELF.

1757
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,869
SOON ALL WILL EITHER
JOIN THE BRIDE OF CHRIST

1758
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,276
OR FOLLOW THE BEAST OF BABYLON.

1759
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,338
WHERE WILL YOU STAND?

1760
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,042
THE BIBLE IS CLEAR.

1761
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:18,642
THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE.

1762
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,245
THE DECISION
IS ULTIMATELY YOURS.

1763
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:42,234
''SURELY I AM COMING QUICKLY.''
REVELATION 22:20 NKJV
