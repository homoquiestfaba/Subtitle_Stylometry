Hey Sweetie. I am not going back to that school ever again!

What is it this time? It's everything!

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,860
The teachers are awful. All the kids in my classes act like 3rd graders.

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,900
And the whole building smells like potatoes.

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,970
Do you know what they made me do today?

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,980
They made me play field hockey. I had to run around. Outside.

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,020

Well, did you score? I don't even know how to score!

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,090
I just kept running around in circles with that stick thingy til somebody blew the whistle.

Wish I could

53
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
go back to my old school. Your old school is twice as expensive.

Didn't anything good happen today? Yes!

56
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,300
I came up some more birthday ideas for you.

Oh, boy. The second page is almost all boots and shoes;

58
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,400
I tried to keep everything in categories so it wouldn't be confusing. Thanks

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,430
so much. Mom, you didn't even look at it.

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,480
Sweetheart, I've been trying to tell you. Things are not going to be quite the same this year. Our finances are

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,550
not great. (sigh) Plus all the end of the year stuff here,

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,610
board meetings, uhh, why does your birthday have to be on Christmas?!?

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,630

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,660

Hey! No hanging out in front of the building. You need to get upstairs and do your homework. And no internet til

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,780

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,940

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,960
I ever heard of. It's called avoiding lawsuits.

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,980
My mother never baked Winter cookies. We haven't ever

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,030
hung Winter stockings on the fireplace. And we don't

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,080
walk around the neighborhood going Winter caroling. Are you through?

76
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,110
Oh, Scotia. Yeah? You need to send an email out to

77
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,130
everybody and let them know it's just going to be well drinks this year. If anybody wants the top shelf stuff

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,150
they're going to have to pay extra. Oh, and there's a box of ornaments out in the hallway by the

79
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,180
elevator. Get Maintenance to do something with that. I'll tell them

80
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,210
to put it by the Winter Tree in the lobby.

You all right? No, I'm not!

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,550
Can I help you? No, but it looks like you could use some help. Yeah, well that's because -

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,690
You okay?

88
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,740
Um, yeah...yeah. I was just...

89
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,810
you took me off guard, cause from down there you looked like...

90
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,890
[laughs] Never mind. I'm Tony Vincent.

91
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,970
Hi Tony. Looks like you got quite a job

92
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,030
going here. Yeah. What's it going to be? Uh, a new

93
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,100
stable for the Nativity scene. A street gang spray painted the old one at the end of

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,130
last year. That's a shame.

95
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,160
You know, I used to work in my father's wood shop. If you like, I could give you a hand. Thanks,

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,180
that's very kind of you, but I think I can manage. Good enough.

97
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,200
I will tell you that if you wet the nail first it goes in a lot easier.

98
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,240
Thanks. I'll give it a try. Take care now. Yeah, you too.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,420
Uh, just wettin the old

100
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,460
nail up. Only way to get the little suckers

101
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,470
to go in right.

102
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,520
This all you've got done? You've been out here

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,570
for two hours. Yeah, well, you know I'm really not too good

104
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,590
at this kind of thing. We should really think about hiring someone- No, no, no

105
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,630
we can't be spending good money to hire somebody to do something we can do ourselves.

106
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,680
But... And should you ever get finished here, the handrail

107
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,700
on the back steps has come loose again. We don't need some old lady suing us

108
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,710
because she fell and broke her hip. I'll be back later.

109
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,720
Don't forget to change the hymn numbers in the foyer. Okay.

110
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,810
Hey, Tony! [thud!]

111
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,020
Hi Tony. Oh, hi. How are you today?

112
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,070
Um, fine. What happened to your hand?

113
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,090
I, uh...accident with an...well...

114
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,130
hammer. Aw, you poor thing. Well have a

115
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,190
good evening. Oh, Tony...could I ask you a favor?

116
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,250
Sure. I've got late stuff going on at work every night this week

117
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,280
and I really hate for Max to be alone in the evenings. Do you think she

118
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,340
could possibly get off the bus at your church and come home with you? Yeah. Sure.

119
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,380
Not a problem. Oh, you're the best. Sometimes I don't know what we'd do without you.

120
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,450
That's what neighbors are for. Bye now.

121
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,660
Hi Cupcake. Hi. How's the homework tonight?

122
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,680
It's homework, Mom.

123
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,710
Mmm, something smells good.

124
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,740
What are you talking about? The dinner you made. I'm just saying

125
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,750
it smells good. And I'm starving.

126
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,780
Mom, you were supposed to bring dinner home.

127
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,820
I was?

128
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,870
We caught up with Blaine Pollett, director of the local chapter of The National Civil Freedom Coalition

129
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,890
I don't have anything against Christmas. I just think church and state need to stay

130
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,900
separated. And I'm going to do every-

131
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,920
But Papa, it's Christmas. You just have

132
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,940
to believe. I know, Pumpkin. But doesn't

133
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,960
Santa make dreams come true? So what do you want to try

134
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,000
now? What was that last stuff? That was

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,040
Fat-Free Ranch Dressing. I'll have another one of those.

136
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,080
Please tell me you haven't

137
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,100
forgotten my birthday cake from Blumenthals. Sweetheart...

138
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,120
Blumenthals is all the way on the other side of town. Does that mean

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,140
you haven't? You know they need a three week advance this time of year.

140
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,180
Don't have a cow, Honey, I'll get it taken care of.

141
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,220
I hope so.

142
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,260
Have a cow? Where'd you get that one?

143
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,300
It's an expression. Don't see how a person

144
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,340
can have a cow. Well, I'm glad I brought it up.

145
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,420
So...

146
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,470
you want to get a tree this weekend? Maybe do a little decorating? Why?

147
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't know. It's Christmas time. We're supposed to do that kind of stuff.

148
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,510
Do you really want to lug a tree all the way up here?

149
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,550
Well, I'm sure Tony would give us a hand. I don't see the point.

150
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,590
Do all that stuff. Put things up everywhere. Then you just have to turn around

151
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,630
and take it all back down again. Yeah, I guess you're right.

152
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,640
Hey, speaking of Tony. You need to get off the bus at his church and let him bring you home the rest

153
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,660
of the week. I've got work stuff every night. Do I

154
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,710
have to? Oh, come on, Sweetie, you're crazy about Tony.

155
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,770
Plus it's only for a few hours. Okay.

156
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,040
Excuse me, but what are you doing? Do you know you left your

157
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,060
tools out last night? Did I?

158
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,110
Good thing it didn't rain. Yeah. Uh...

159
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,160
why are you here? I was walking by

160
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,210
- noticed you hadn't made a lot of progress. Saw the tools. Yeah, well

161
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,250
that's very nice of you, but I can take it- No, sit. Finish your coffee. Yeah?

162
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,270
Yeah. I'm on a roll here.

163
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,360
So you think Chicago's going to make the playoffs? Not with the way Wishman's been playing.

164
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,400
It's like he never has an open receiver. Every defense in the league

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,450
knows it. Yeah, but when he was at Green Bay he didn't need a good receiver because he had his legs

166
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,460
[traffic sounds]

167
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,670
From the way you've all been buzzing around the last few weeks, I know you're all

168
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,720
very familiar with this word. Raise your hands. What's the first thing that pops

169
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,750
into your head when you see or hear the word Christmas?

170
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,790
Family time. Okay. Kelly? The mall.

171
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,830
Allright. Red and green? Okay. The Nutcracker.

172
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,890
Allright. Presents. Miracle on 34th Street.

173
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,910
Max.

174
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,940
Huh? [laughter] How about you?

175
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,980
How about me what?

176
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,040
Retail spike? Allright.

177
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,110
Now, those of you who didn't get to answer, you're all going to have your chance.

178
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,120
Your assignment going into the break:

179
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,150
What is

180
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,170
Christmas? 500 words. Single spaced.

181
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,190
Now this marks our final grade for this semester. So those of you who need the extra help, this could

182
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,200
be your last chance. [school bell rings]

183
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,300
Max?

184
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,310
Could you come here, please?

185
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,320
You know, you've dropped almost

186
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,340
two full letter grades this past six weeks. I've just had a lot

187
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,410
on my mind. Be that as it may, any more slipping, and you could be looking at failing this

188
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,460
class. Yes, ma'am. I suggest you do some outstanding

189
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,510
work on this essay assignment. Otherwise, your GPA's going to have some serious problems.

190
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,530
Okay. How about

191
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,590
you let write on a different subject? Something I can really get into. Like

192
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,630
Paris. Or horses. I think I'd be a lot better off-

193
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,640
Nice try. That's all.

194
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,850
Here you go.

195
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,890
Thanks.

196
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,910
Looking good here. You know, I really appreciate your help.

197
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,920
To be totally honest, I'm not much of a carpenter.

198
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,970
Really? I never would have guessed.

199
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,060
Do you live around here?

200
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,170
Not exactly. So you're just passing through? You might say that.

201
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,190
Where you staying? Nowhere in particular.

202
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,190
Oh, I see.

203
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,230
This your church? No, I'm just the Asociate Pastor.

204
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,330
Reverend Black runs things. While you fix Nativity scenes and

205
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,420
handrails. Yeah, well, we've been losing money lately, so I've had to

206
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,520
pick up a lot of the slack here and there. Losing money?

207
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,540
You know. Tithes and offerings aren't coming in like they should be

208
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,550
so the whole budget suffers. Mainly because attendance is

209
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,560
in decline. Why do you think it's in decline?

210
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,680
Who knows? I mean, we've got our core families, just not many new people.

211
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,690
Then when people move out of town or die,

212
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,750
well, there you go. Are you telling the truth?

213
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,810
About what? I mean are you telling the truth from the pulpit?

214
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,840
Oh, well, Reverend Black handles the sermons.

215
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,920
The last few years he's tried to jazz things up, you know? More current event kind

216
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,930
of stuff, tips on how to lead a happy life. Not working?

217
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,980
Evidently not. But you didn't hear that

218
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,030
from me. There's Reverend

219
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,090
Black now.

220
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,150
So

221
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,210
how long do you expect to be in town? Long as I need to be.

222
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,230
Would you excuse me, uh -

223
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,250
gosh, I've been talking to you all day. What is your name?

224
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,300
Jes works for me. Jes. Would you excuse me? Sure.

225
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,460
[knock]

226
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,550
Come in.

227
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,570
Tony,

228
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,600
who's that bearded man working on your project? His name's Jes.

229
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,650
He's passing through town and he's really handy with things.

230
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,680
So he's a drifter. Well,

231
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,710
I guess. Maybe. But I bet he'd stay around long enough to finish

232
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,750
the creche and fix things like the handrail and whatever else we needed.

233
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,790
For free? Well, for a warm place to stay I bet.

234
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,800
We've got that room with the cot out in the maintenance shed.

235
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,870
So you really want to get out of work that badly, huh?

236
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,900
It's just that I've got so much else to do. I've got to dress the pulpit, do the Christmas

237
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,920
bake sale, hospital visits- I've told you before. Visiting in person

238
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,950
is not the most efficient way to do that. In the time it takes you to drive

239
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,980
to one hospital, you could contact over a hundred parishioners by email.

240
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,010
Sometimes an email doesn't get it.

241
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,070
What was that?

242
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,090
Nothing. So how about it?

243
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,120
Allright. Go ahead.

244
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,130
But if he asks for any wages, it comes out of your

245
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,150
pocket, understand? Understood. And Tony - Yes?

246
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,190
Does he believe in God? I don't know. I didn't ask him.

247
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,220
[office sounds]

248
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,230
Ms. Westray? Yes?

249
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,260
Your mother's on Line 3. You can take it in Mike's office if you want.

250
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,360
Hello?

251
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,420
Hey, what's up?

252
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,480
Are you guys all packed?

253
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,540
For the last time, no. We'll be fine.

254
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,720
This Christmas is just one more thing we have to learn

255
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,770
to do alone.

256
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,820
Yeah, she's fine. She hates her new school.

257
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,870
Yeah, fixated on her birthday, regardless of what the rest of the world is

258
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,930
celebrating.

259
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,990
Yeah, it's great. They've actually put me in charge of the Winter Gala.

260
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,050
Christmas Party, Mom.

261
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,140
Even though I'm the last person in the world they should have picked.

262
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,150
Well, I haven't even decorated my own

263
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,160
house.

264
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,180
Well, let's just say I don't have a lot to offer

265
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,260
in the way of Christmas cheer...or Winter...holiday...

266
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,270
whatever.

267
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,310
Okay, I'm going to let you get going.

268
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,330
Have a great time on the cruise. I'll see

269
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,360
you next month. Okay, bye now.

270
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,500
Hey, Max. How you doing? Okay. How long til we go

271
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,520
home? Just a bit. Right now I've got to run over to the printer.

272
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,570
Hey, why don't you come over here and keep Jes company? Who?

273
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,630
Jes. He's the guy working on our Nativity scene.

274
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,700
Is he supposed to be working on the Nativity, or living inside it?

275
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,720
Yeah, he does kind of look like Him doesn't he?

276
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,770
It's a little creepy, Tony. Yeah, well, anyway,

277
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,820
have a seat and I'll be right back.

278
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Hi. Hi. Where's Tony? He had

279
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,020
to run to the printer. He'll be right back.

280
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,050
What's your name? What?

281
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,090
What's your name? Max. Max?

282
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,100
It's short for Maxine. I was named after my great grandmother.

283
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,130
I think there was money involved. You got a middle name?

284
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,160
Noelle.

285
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,210
I was born on Christmas Day. How do you like that?

286
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,270
So was-

287
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,300
So...

288
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,350
how was school today? How was school today?

289
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,390
What are you, my uncle?

290
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,430
It stunk, okay? Why did it stink?

291
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,480
Well for starters, I'm about to flunk a class, and I have to write a stupid essay on

292
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,530
What is Christmas. That's a problem for someone named

293
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,550
Noelle, born on December 25th? To me

294
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,580
December 25th is my birthday. Everything else is just- Background?

295
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,660
Whatever. And let me guess,

296
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,660
since you were born on Christmas Day, you've always felt short changed, right?

297
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,730
Well, how would you feel? People born in February or July don't have to deal with

298
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,810
getting their birthday and Christmas presents combined. Or having nobody to

299
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,890
celebrate with because doing Christmas stuff. I mean, can't there be something

300
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,920
just for me and nobody else? Is that so selfish?

301
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,960
Actually that's the definition of selfish. Very funny.

302
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,040
Nevertheless -

303
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,110
there should be plenty of angles you can write on, even if you're not that much into the holiday.

304
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,120
LIke what? Well, for instance, um -

305
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,130
historical. Did you know that the first Nativity Scene was built over 700

306
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,160
years ago? An Italian guy named Francis came up

307
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,170
with the idea for the villagers who wer illiterate and couldn't read the story of

308
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,230
Mary and Joseph. Could you hand me that, please?

309
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,240
Here in the United States, it's called A Nativity Scene.

310
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,300
In France it's referred to as creche. Spanish speaking people call it

311
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,340
Nacimiento. Francis also

312
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,370
came up with the idea for Christmas carols. Do you like, write

313
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,420
encyclopedias or something? No. Just familiar with the subject

314
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,480
matter. See that didn't take so long.

315
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,550
You two been hitting it off? Yeah. You bet.

316
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,620
You know, I think I'm going to knock off a little early and go ahead and get Max home. You all set here?

317
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,690
Yeah, fine. I laid some fresh blankets and towels on the cot, and there's a

318
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,790
new soap in the bathroom. Water's in the mini fridge. Great. See you tomorrow.

319
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,870
Nice meeting you, Max. Yeah. You too.

320
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,010
So who is that guy? Well, I really don't know much about him.

321
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,020
Except that he's pleasant, seems to be knowledgeable

322
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,040
about a lot of subjects, and he's strong as an ox. And he looks

323
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,080
just like Jesus and he's building you a manger. Yeah.

324
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,130
That too. And he just showed up one day? Yep.

325
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,150
Just showed up. I kind of get the feeling he might've been a teacher at some

326
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,180
point in time, just by the way he talks, you know? He sure launched

327
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,210
into that history lesson without any problem.

328
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,260
[car starts]

329
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,330
[tv sounds]

330
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,440
Hey, Sweetie. Hi. Finish your homework?

331
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,490
Yes.

332
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,560
Well, it's nice to see you've been making good use of your

333
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,570
time. I thought you weren't into decorating.

334
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,600
That doesn't count birthdays.

335
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,670
Oh...

336
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,720
something came in the mail for you today. What?

337
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,760
Birthday card from Nanna! Yes!

338
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,800
She told me she's putting two hundred bucks in it this year!

339
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,860
I also got a call from one of your teachers. Mrs. Torretti?

340
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,930
Uh oh. She told me your grades have dropped

341
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,940
significantly. As in, might fail?

342
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,980
Okay. I'll make a deal with you. I promise not

343
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,050
to get all defensive if you promise not to give me a lecture. Fair enough.

344
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,070
And I'll make a deal with you. This

345
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,110
stays in here until those grades come up. And if you fail the class, it goes right

346
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,120
back to Nanna. You wouldn't!

347
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,150
Want to try me?

348
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,180
[door slam]

349
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,300
Okay, can I ask you

350
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,470
something? Uh huh. Why are you walking around with your shirt like that?

351
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,530
Huh? Oh. That. They made me turn my shirt inside out at school because it

352
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,580
said something inappropriate. Really? What did it say?

353
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,650
Merry Christmas. Um -

354
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,720
this is where I have to go. Okay. See ya.

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,760
Hey, Max. How's it going? Okay.

356
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,810
How was school today? Fine. Can I talk to you?

357
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,820
Yeah, sure. Just let me tie this off.

358
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,890
There.

359
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,900
Shoot.

360
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,960
Okay, here's the deal. I have got to ace this essay I told you about.

361
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,020
I need you to give me some more Christmas history facts. Just as many as you

362
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,090
can come up with. What was that Nativity inventor guy's name again?

363
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,180
You know what? It's some kind of coincidence

364
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,210
you came here needing something from me today, because I've got a job for you. Well, really

365
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,350
for both of us. Tony needs

366
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,380
us to make a cake for the bake sale. Come again?

367
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,420
Actually, I volunteered us. He had to take Communion over to the nursing home.

368
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,490
Come on.

369
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,550
I really haven't done this sort of stuff before.

370
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,550
My mom usually takes care of all the cooking. Well, sort of.

371
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,600
You'll do fine. Just need

372
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,620
this.

373
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,630
And this. And this.

374
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,900
Wait a minute. What? You've got to measure it.

375
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,990
Nah, it's be fine. No, you're going to ruin the whole

376
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,010
cake. Says who? Says the box.

377
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:02,060
You're very by the book, aren't you? No. I just think if you're gonna-

378
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,250
Stir it up and I'll flour the pan.

379
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,280
I think it needs a little more milk.

380
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,840
What is going on here?!?

381
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,850
Nothing.

382
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,890
And the church basement is most certainly not the place for a

383
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,910
handyman and a child to have play hour. I mean, not to mention what might've happened if- Um...

384
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,920
could you just...give me one minute?

385
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,050
It, uh, looks like I'm going to be a while here. Would you mind taking Max home? You can

386
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,120
use my car. That's okay. We can walk. Great.

387
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,180
Max, tell your mom I said he's okay. See ya.

388
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,200
Walk? Yeah.

389
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,230
It can't be that far. Come on. Well, since we're walking

390
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,280
will you help me with ideas for my essay now? You bet.

391
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,340
And the nave will need to be

392
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,400
vacuumed on Tuesday, and, uh,

393
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,470
don't forget to reset the chairs for the morning devotional with the ladies. The poinsettias will

394
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,510
be arriving in two days. Don't let the driver give you any guff about a

395
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,570
holiday service charge. And...don't

396
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,620
move into my office. I'll only be gone a few days.

397
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,640
I need to get to the airport.

398
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,710
I'll finish the Christmas sermon on the plane ride

399
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,720
home. Oh, and one last thing: you need to get going on those

400
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,740
proposals for the Budget Director. This coming year, we need more

401
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,790
programs. More incentives for the parishioners.

402
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,850
This place needs to be like a well-run

403
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,880
machine with gears to keep it all funded.

404
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,920
A church needs to be a...what's the best way to

405
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,950
say it... How about a place to worship and to connect people

406
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,960
with Jesus? Excuse me?

407
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,980
I said how- I heard

408
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,010
what you said. It's just that I've never detected quite that tone

409
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,050
from you before. Well... You've been spending a lot of time with that

410
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,080
vagabond cakemaker. Did that little comment have anything to- We just talk

411
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,100
about carpentry and stuff. That's all. There's not a problem here. There better

412
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,140
not be. A man like that obviously

413
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,170
doesn't have a lot of rules in his life. That's not a characteristic that a

414
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,190
young minister needs to emulate. While I'm

415
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,220
gone, just try to maintain things the way they are. Let's do the best we can to get through this

416
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,270
holiday in one piece.

417
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,290
[door shut]

418
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,380
...that was Chicago

419
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,440
...then my dad ran off with somebody he met at his health club -

420
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,510
they moved somewhere and ran up a bunch of bills, so some lawyer just had to burn all of our

421
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,610
assets. You mean froze. Oh yeah, froze.

422
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,720
That's why me and my mom had to move where we live now. Tough year, huh?

423
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,820
Yeah. And I really miss my horse. We had to get rid of him when

424
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,940
we moved. You like horses. Love horses.

425
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,960
Hey, how's it going?

426
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,970
Fine. Got a cigarette? I'm afraid I don't.

427
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,990
Give me your money.

428
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,030
I don't have any. I'm not fooling around, man,

429
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,070
just give it to me. Now!

430
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,180
Why are you doing this? What? I said why are you doing this,

431
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,230
you're not that kind of person. You don't know anything about me, man.

432
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,250
You want to know why?

433
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,290
I haven't had work in almost a year.

434
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,300
And I am covered up in bills.

435
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,340
And now my little girl's been sick. She keeps

436
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,400
getting worse. I need money.

437
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,450
Go home to your family.

438
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,500
What did you say? I said, go home.

439
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,530
Your daughter's well.

440
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,590
Daniel?

441
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,630
Yeah? Can I have that?

442
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,830
Weren't you scared? Nah.

443
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,860
No bullets. Well, how'd you know that? I just knew.

444
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,890
Come one. We better get you home. Okay, so

445
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,940
where was I? Oh, yeah, horses. Horses. So, my horse's

446
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,990
name was Lucky. He had a white face and...

447
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,030
Thank God you didn't get hurt, or

448
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,070
worse. I could just ring Tony's neck for letting somebody else bring you

449
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,110
home. Mom, I told you I was allright. The gun

450
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,130
didn't even have bullets in it. Well, he didn't know that!

451
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,170
So..for your birthday, we'll do the cake from

452
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,240
Blumenthals, have chicken tettrazzini for dinner, and have you thought about

453
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,250
who you'd like to come? Well, since I don't have any real friends,

454
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,270
and even if I did, it would still be Christmas to them. And with Grandma

455
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:06,280
and Grandpa in the Caribbean, and Dad wherever,

456
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,310
it's safe to say it'll just be you and me. Yeah.

457
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,360
Well, sorry about all that. But at least I know I'm still getting my two hundred

458
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,410
bucks from Nanna. So the essay's going okay? Yeah,

459
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,430
real okay. Jes has given me tons of great stuff to look up.

460
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,460
So you're learning alot? Learning? I'm just trying to

461
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,510
come up with 500 words. But you know what? What?

462
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,560
All this stuff I'm finding. There hasn't been anything about the

463
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,600
North Pole, or Rudolph, or Black Friday. So what are you

464
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,670
finding stuff about? Well...Jesus being born.

465
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,740
Some of this stuff doesn't even seem like the same holiday. Yeah.

466
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,810
Even when I was little, Christmas was different. We never had this big

467
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,820
shopping blowout the day after Thanksgiving. My parents never went

468
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,830
to huge office parties, I don't think I ever even saw Mom or Dad stressed out.

469
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,870
So what did you guys do? I

470
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,900
sang in the choir Christmas Eve. We got all

471
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,920
dressed up and went to candlelight service. No presents? Oh.

472
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Yeah. We did gifts. For the longest

473
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,960
time, we did this really cool thing. What did you do?

474
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,000
My brother and I would each get three gits. Just

475
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,080
three? Yeah. And then, we'd

476
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,090
unwrap them and get to keep two. Well, what about the third one?

477
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,130
We'd rewrap them ourselves and

478
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,180
on Christmas night, Dad would drive us down to some

479
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,220
poor family's house and we'd give the gifts to their kids.

480
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,290
And then we'd come home.

481
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,410
These days, you'd probably get sued for trespassing with a Christmas gift.

482
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,460
Oh, I don't have to work late

483
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,530
tomorrow night after all, so no need to get off the bus at Tony's church. Uh, is it

484
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,590
okay if I do anyways? Why would you want to?

485
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,610
Oh, so you can get that Jes guy to finish writing your essay for you?

486
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,630
Mom, he's not writing it for me. He just gives me really good ideas.

487
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,670
I'm serious. This guy's like a computer. He knows stuff I can't even find online.

488
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,680
We're talking extra credit here.

489
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,730
Allright.

578
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,330
Twas the night before Christmas, and a Beautiful Young Girl

579
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:24,340
and a Devoted Carpenter had been traveling

580
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,380
to the Devoted Carpenter's hometown. Now the Beautiful Young Girl

581
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,420
was about to have a baby, and The Devoted Carpenter was her new

582
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,420
husband. And she had been riding on the back of a donkey for three

583
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,430
days and three nights - and she was so tired she could

584
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,460
barely hold her head up. When they got to The Devoted Carpenter's

585
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,500
hometown, there was no place for them to stay.

586
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,520
Back then, there weren't hotels on every corner, so

587
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,540
The Devoted Carpenter remembered a Place Where the Animals Stayed

588
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,560
now, it wasn't clean. It wasn't even made for people.

589
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,600
But it was the best they had. So The Devoted Carpenter

590
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,660
took The Beautiful Young Girl and made her a soft place in the hay

591
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,700
right next to a mother goat and her three little ones.

592
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,740
While The Beautiful Girl laid there, she knew it was time. Her

593
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,800
baby was about to be born. Right there. In that Place Where the

594
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,820
Animals Stayed. Now, not far from there, some

595
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,850
Sheepherders were working in the fields, making sure that none of their sheep wandered off

596
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:32,870
so they'd all be ready to move out when morning came.

597
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:36,890
While the Sheepherders were sitting on the hill, listening to the silence of the countryside,

598
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,920
they were almost knocked over by what they saw. What

599
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,990
did they see? It was a Great Angel,

600
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:49,050
right in front of them. Shining so bright that they almost had to look

601
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,130
away, but they just couldn't. And chills ran down the

602
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,150
Sheepherders' spines when The Great Angel began to speak.

603
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,220
What did The Great Angel say? The Great Angel said, 'Don't

604
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,270
be afraid, because I'm here to tell you something amazing.

605
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:09,340
Right now, in a little town not far from here,

606
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,370
God has come down to Earth for a visit' -

607
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:17,400
and the Sheepherders couldn't believe their ears. God? The one who made

608
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,420
the Universe and everything in it? Down here?!?

609
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,480
And The Great Angel said, 'Yes. And unbelievable as it seems

610
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,560
tonight, God is baby. And He's lying

611
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,580
in a trough in a Place Where the Animals Stay.'

612
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,620
'And He's come here to give everyone in the world a gift. And after tonight,

613
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,640
the world will never be the same again.' And when The Great Angel

614
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,690
said that, the sky was suddenly filled with Great Angels - too many for the

615
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,730
Sheepherders to count. And the lights were so bright,

616
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,780
it looked like the moon had exploded. And the Great Angels were all

617
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,800
singing, like a giant rock concert in the sky.

618
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,830
And The Great Angels sang, with the volume turned all the way up,

619
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,860
'It's time to celebrate! Because God has come to Earth for a

620
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,880
visit - because God can do anything! And

621
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,910
after tonight, the world will never be the same again!'

622
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,920
Back in the Carpenter's hometown, the Baby

623
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,960
that was God Come to Earth for a Visit, lay

624
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,000
fast asleep in The Beautiful Young Girl's arms.

625
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,030
And the cows He created watched Him sleep.

626
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,070
And up in the rafters, the doves He had covered with feathers watched Him sleep.

627
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,130
And the donkey He made watched Him sleep.

628
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:42,190
And sitting close by, The Devoted Carpenter watched Him sleep

629
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:46,250
as he wiped the beads of sweat from The Beautiful Young Girl's cheek.

630
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,320
And The Carpenter though to himself

631
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,420
how the world would never be the same again

632
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,430

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,860

00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,920
don't you? How so? Well, it just stinks

642
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,980
that everybody's trying to take out the main reason why the holiday is celebrated in the first

644
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,050
to get presents, and go to parties, get a day off work, and a month off school -

645

and all the store owners just want to sell alot of stuff.

646
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,100
Yeah. You're right. I mean, it's kind of

647
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,150
hypocritical when you think about it. It's like, if the whole

648
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,220
world threw you a birthday party, and you were the main one they made sure didn't get

649
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:19,240
invited. That's a good way to put it.

650
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,260
Do you know a girl at my school got in trouble for wearing a scarf that said,

651
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,280
'The Reason for the Season'? Well, hey, it's just as bad at work - last

652
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,310
month we were meeting to come up with another name for 'Christmas party' and someone said we couldn't even

653
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:35,340
call it 'Holiday Party' because not everybody celebrates it as a holiday.

654
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,350
So what are you calling it? 'Winter Gala'

655
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,390
That sounds totally made up. I know. I hate it.

656
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,420
So why don't you change it? Huh?

657
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,440
You're in charge of it, aren't you? Well, yeah...

658
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,460
And you're the boss of everybody, right? Well, yes. In a manner of

659

speaking, but- But what?

660
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,580
Sweetie, you just can't change the way people - If you really

661
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,600
believe it yourself, you should be able to convince other people.

662
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,610
That's what I'd do if I believed in something.

update on the festivities for The Winter Gala.

669
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,890
Well, Stacy, what have you got cooked up for us? I saw the memo on the cash

670
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,930
bar. Well, the, uh,

671
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,970
the cash bar was one of the things I wanted to revisit. You

672
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,990
mean let everyone order the good stuff? I don't see how we can - No...

673
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,010
not exactly. I...I wanted to propose no bar at all.

674
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,020
Because of the expense. No...no it's not that. It's

675
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,050
just, um...well, I though with no alcohol we could make it more of a family thing and

00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:12,120
invite our kids and grandkids. No alcohol?

677
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,140
Go on. I, uh...well I

678
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,170
also thought that instead of spending thousands of dollars on sit down dinner we could just

679
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,200
do hors d'oeuvres, and, um... And?

680
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,250
And invite some of the homeless people from one of the shelters and have gift baskets

681
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:32,270
that our children could hand out. I thought, maybe even you, Mr. Braden,

682
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,300
you might want to play Santa Claus for the needy kids.

683
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,350
[shivering sound]

684
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:44,360
Or maybe not. I'm sure we could find another-

685
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,400
I guess I'm a little perplexed. What does giving presents to poor kids

686
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,440
have to do with an office party. Well, um, I've uh...

687
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,490
I've given it some thought, and um, cash bars

688
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,540
and ice sculptures are something we can do at any party any time of the year. But giving...

689
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,570
that's the one thing that defines celebrating Christmas.

690
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,590
You mean Winter Gala. No,

691
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,610
I mean Christmas. And while we're on the subject, let's

692
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,640
all be honest here. We're not celebrating winter or some generic

693
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,670
season with no name. It's Christmas. You know it, I

694
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,690
know it, everybody in the mall knows it, and everybody at that party, or gala, or

695
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,760
whatever is going to know it. Before you go any further, are you prepared

696
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,850
for the avalanche of the complaints you'll be getting? I checked with HR -

697
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,900
in the last five years, there's only been one complaint with calling it a

698
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,970
Christmas Party. And that was from a temp who was just working here for the holidays.

699
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,990
Really? I mean, come on.

700
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,040
Is that really how we make policy around here?

701
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,050
So if we're celebrating winter, then let's all

702
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:57,090
show up with our parkas and snow tires. But if we're spending

703
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:01,090
all this money to celebrate Christmas, then let's have the intelligence

704
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:05,150
to stand up and act like we know what we're doing and call it a Christmas Party!

705
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,340
I like it. Let's do it.

706
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,370
Whew!

707
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:37,380
Good job. Good job, Stacy!

708
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,400
Nice work. Good job.

709
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,440
Whew.

710
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,470
How's that look?

711
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,510
Missed a spot right there. Okay.

712
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,580
Hello!

713
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,620
Hi Mom.

714
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,710
And you must be the Jes I've heard so much about. Stacy Westray.

715
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,770
Hi Stacy. I saw the Nativity

716
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,810
Scene on the way in. It looks great. Max, Honey,

717
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,830
we need to get going. Dentist appointment.

718
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:29,870
Oh. Have fun. Yeah. Thanks.

719
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:33,950
Sweetie, can you wait in the car? I'll be out in just a second. Bye, Jes.

720
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,980
See ya, kiddo.

721
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:46,070
Listen, I know I haven't been around much

722
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:50,120
- I wanted to say thanks for being so nice to Max. Believe me, it hasn't been a

723
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,140
problem. You've given her so much help with her essay, and, well, she's been

724
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,160
so unhappy with her new school, and she doesn't have very many friends. Yeah,

725
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,200
that's what I've heard. But the thought of her wanting to come here every day to work on a

726
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,250
Nativity Scene, it's just...well, it's just

727
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:10,270
we've never been much into religion. Neither have I.

728
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,330
It's good to see her take an interest in something. Anyway,

729
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,360
thanks again.

730
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,390
My pleasure.

731
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,470
[knock]

732
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:38,520
Come in. Hi.

733
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,560
Hi. Hope we're not interrupting anything. No...no...

734
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,610
come right in.

735
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:50,690
Have a seat.

736
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,800
What can I do for you? I'm Blaine Pollett. This is Mr. Warren.

737
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,850
We've noticed you have a nice little Nativity Scene going up out front.

738
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,850
Yeah, well, we're pretty happy with it.

739
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,870
Are you

740
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:10,920
here just to tell me that? No.

741
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,930
We came to tell you you have to take it down. How's that?

742
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,990
You're probably not aware of the city ordinance enacted last year

743
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:23,040
that prohibits religious signage in business districts... I know all about that ordinance and I

744
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,150
also know that A) we're five blocks from the business district, and B)

745
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,210
we're a church, for crying out loud! Well, technically,

746
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:35,240
yes, but. last summer there was a

747
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,260
realignment of Sector 14 of the Northeast Access Route which

748
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,280
redesignated the property in front of your road right here as an extension of the Zone 3

749
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,300
Business Thoroughfare. Which all means what?

750
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,340
It means, congratulations - you're part of the Zone 3 Business

751
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,380
District. But we're a church. With a religious display

752
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,420
in plain sight of a business thoroughfare. It's all explained right here.

753
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,490
If you'd like to take a look. We filed

754
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,510
a formal complaint with the City Attorney's Office and the Zoning Commission.

755
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,560
The structure needs to come down immediately. Or what?

756
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,580
Or you're looking straight down the barrel

757
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,630
of a five thousand dollar fine.

758
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,710
Listen, we're pretty short handed around here. It took

759
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:27,780
several days to put up. It's going to take several days to take it down.

760
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,800
We've already thought of that. Our office has volunteers who'll be happy to come by and

761
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,830
give you a hand. Thanks. Just trying

762
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,860
to be helpful.

763
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,960
Happy Holidays, now. Thanks.

764
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:56,080
Thanks, alot.

765
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,290
You call Reverend Black? And get chewed out for not knowing about

766
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:12,340
the ordinance? Not a chance.

767
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,410
[phone dial]

768
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:20,420
All done, Mr. Pollett. Will do.

769
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,460
Have a good day.

770
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,550
I'll go get the truck.

And here locally, in the ongoing battle of Culture vs.

841
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,890
Christmas, some community leaders, as well as church personnel and people from a

842
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,920
local neighborhood have requested a special hearing of the District Four

843
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,950
City Council to discuss the removal of a Nativity Scene

844
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,980
from church property. Our field reporter, Pat Sullivan, caught up with

845
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,990
Blaine Pollett, local director of the National Civil Freedom Coalition

846
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,040
whose group is responsible for spearheading the removal of the display.

847
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,060
Hey, they can have all the hearings they want. The fact remains

848
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,150
they're still in violation of a city ordinance. And even if they get the ordinance

849
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:00,190
amended, it couldn't go into effect until January or February of next

850
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,280
year, so, either way, the display comes down.

851
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,330
[city sounds]

852
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:20,470
Are we still taking the kids ice skating tonight? Mike's on the City Council - they have that

853
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,490
special meeting tonight. You going? Could be some fireworks.

854
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:28,530
Nah, not exactly my thing. Okay. Bye.

855
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,550
Now let's see, Sweetie, have we forgotten anyone?

856
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,750
[crowd chatter]

857
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:00,850
Allright, let's quiet down! [gavel sound]

858
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,870
Let's come to order!

859
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:08,890
Now, we're all aware of the matter at hand - which is why we

860
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,920
granted this special meeting. In the interest of expediency, I'll turn

861
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,990
the floor over to Mr. Pollett of the NCFC. Mr. Pollett.

862
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:25,130
Look, I don't want to waste a bunch of time here. I know we'd all rather be home right now.

863
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:29,150
So the fact of the matter is simple. The guilty

864
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,170
party purposely chose to defy a city ordinance which was presented

865
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:37,200
to them in a civil and professional manner. And for that defiance,

866
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,260
they deserve to pay penalties. Do the

867
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,280
representatives of the church property have anything to add?

868
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,280
As Senior Pastor, in my defense I'd like to state for the record that the

869
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,290
subordinate left in charge during my absence, which is when this offense occurred,

870
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:57,320
was in no way authorized by me to do this, and acted on his own accord.

871
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,330
Or someone put him up to it.

872
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:05,360
Excuse me, what is that supposed to mean?

873
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,390
A drifter came into our midst a few days ago.

874
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:13,440
I believe that he is responsible, at least in part, for inciting a certain element of

875
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,460
disobedience amongst my people. But it's a Nativity Scene at a church!

876
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,480
And it's Christmas! You see, this is exactly why the

877
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:25,510
NCFC exists. To educate people from this kind of

878
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:29,530
backward thinking. I mean, this whole thing is nothing more than a

879
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:33,550
wintertime ritual that a minority of the population has decided to claim

880
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:37,570
according to its own set of beliefs. I mean,

881
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:41,600
is every fir tree with lights on it necessarily

882
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,620
a Christmas tree? Don't people

883
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,650
give gifts this time of year because it's a really nice thing to do? And it helps

884
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:53,680
the economy? What makes a star any different

885
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,730
this time of year than when it's painted on the side of

886
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,780
a football helmet in Dallas? Can anybody give me

887
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,800
one valid reason why this holiday

888
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,870
has to be anchored to the concept of someone named Jesus Christ?

889
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:17,930
Umm...

890
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:22,000
because it's His birthday?

891
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,020
Thank you, uh

892
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:30,040
Max. Well, thank you, Max, and you can take your seat now.

893
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,130
Are you sure? Because I have a lot more. I wrote a whole five page

894
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:38,180
essay. Well, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure that we- Mr. Chairman? Yes?

895
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,230
It should be noted that this young lady, who

896
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:46,280
obviously thinks it's allright to lecture her elders,

897
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,360
has also been influenced by the aforementioned vagrant

898
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,440
who drifted into town and instigated this whole affair. You know I've heard just

899
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,450
about enough on this character. Can anyone tell me where this man is right now?

900
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,560
See?

901
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,580
Typical. He's probably packed up

902
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,620
and hit the open road already. No...he's here.

903
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,690
Jes?

904
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,920
Good evening. Hi. And your full name is?

905
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:38,960
Jes is fine.

906
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,010
Jes is fine. Oh, it is. Well, uh,

907
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:47,030
Jes, evidently some people in this room think that you might have some

908
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:51,050
thing to add to these proceedings. Do you? Well, maybe just this:

909
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:55,100
A Nativity Scene is nothing more than a symbol.

910
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,110
And a symbol, or an image,

911
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:03,130
or a tradition really serves no purpose if it doesn't stir someone

912
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:07,170
to remember the thing that it represents. Look, what does of this have

913
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:11,230
to do with- And I do appreciate the questions you pose, Mr. Pollett.

914
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:15,250
And it may surprise you to know that I agree with you more than you think. Your

915
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:19,260
organization has a long history of trying to protect people's freedoms, and to make sure

916
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,300
that no one has anything unjustly forced upon them. And mainly,

917
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:27,330
mainly you try to protect the week

918
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:31,360
and to be a voice for the people who don't have a voice. And it's those

919
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,380
very principles that represent the heart of God and the truest meaning of

920
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,440
Christmas. You see, God never wanted to force His son

921
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,490
on anyone either. Look at it this way: He's

922
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:47,540
God. With His power, He could've compelled everyone in the world

923
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:51,590
to bow down and worship His son. But He didn't.

924
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:55,600
He could've filled the world with thunder and lightning and blazing

925
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,630
chariots to announce the new king's arrival, but He didn't.

926
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:03,670
He could've assembled the richest, most powerful people on

927
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:07,690
Earth to be witnesses for the new king's coronation -

928
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,700
but He didn't. Like I said, God never wanted to force His

929
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,720
son on anyone. It's just not the way He does things.

930
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,750
And that's why that first Christmas was the way it was. He chose a poor

931
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,790
girl from the village to give birth to the new king. In her culture,

932
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:27,810
she had no rights, no voice. And He chose a

933
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,830
stable instead of a palace for the new king's birth. And shepherds,

934
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:35,850
common laborers, they were chosen as the first witnesses.

935
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:39,860
When God came to Earth, He came to the least,

936
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,880
and the last, and the lowest, and the lost -

937
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,960
the very people that Mr. Pollett claims to represent.

938
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,020
And these people witnessed the birth of a king

939
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,070
who never owned a home, never held political office,

940
01:12:56,070 --> 01:13:00,130
never made a grab for power. But this simple man

941
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,150
from a poor mother and small town is still considered a person of interest

942
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:08,200
right here today, over 2000 years later, in this hall.

943
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,220
Now why is that? Not because

944
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,250
He forced people to choose Him. It's because

945
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:20,280
for centuries, men and women have been seeking God

946
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,300
and they found Him in this man. And what's remarkable

947
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,330
is that while they were seeking God, they found that He'd been looking for them

948
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:32,380
their whole lives. So that's what happened on

949
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,390
that first Christmas 2000 years ago - God came to Earth

950
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:40,450
looking for you. And He came in the form of a man

951
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,490
who showed the whole world what God's love was like.

952
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:48,530
So on that first Christmas, God's perfect gift

953
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:52,570
was love. Now,

954
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:56,630
if you take the love out of Christmas, where will you put it?

955
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:00,660
What will you do with it? What will you do with Him

956
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:04,670
if you remove Him from this season?

957
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:08,700
The thing that fills people's hearts usually starts to show up everywhere around them.

958
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,720
And that's why this time of year, you see evergreens, and lights,

959
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,740
and stars, and Nativity Scenes.

960
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:20,760
Because they remind people of the love that came looking for them

961
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,780
so long ago.

962
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:57,140
Well, that was all very sweet,

963
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:01,180
but the fact still remains of why we're here. A violation of the law

964
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,230
has occurred, and that violation carries a five thousand dollar fine.

965
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:09,280
Now, my office believes in what we stand for.

966
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,350
And I'd say there's probably about five thousand reasons why your

967
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,430
beliefs aren't as strong. Am I right?

968
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:42,100
Whatever it's short,

969
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:46,150
I'll make up the difference.

970
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:30,420
Newscast VO: And here in the city, in a strange turn of events, the controversy surrounding

971
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,460
a neighborhood church Nativity Scene and the National Civil Freedom Coalition

972
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:38,510
has seemingly ended, as the civil liberty organization withdrew its complaint

973
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:42,570
against the church. Money donated by local citizens to cover the original fine

974
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:46,630
was handed over to a nearby homeless shelter at the citizens' request.

975
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:50,690
[Newscast fades] [phone rings]

976
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,760
Stacy: Hello? Hey Mom! How are the

977
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,820
islands? Yeah, we can't wait.

978
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,830
Oh and the Christmas party at work went great! Maybe too great.

979
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:06,850
They've already put me in charge for next year. You should've seen our CEO playing

980
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:10,870
Santa in his Armani Santa suit. Right now?

981
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:14,900
I'm baking cookies. We're having a get together at a little place

982
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,950
called Breskey's. No, just some new friends -

983
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:23,000
people from the neighborhood, some people from church...yeah just [VO fades]

984
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,050
[Christmas music and party chatter]

985
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:03,390
How about you? Yeah, um, I'll be going down to Florida.

986
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:07,400
to see some family...

987
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:15,480
Could you excuse me for just a moment?

988
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,530
Yeah, of course.

989
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:23,570
Hey. Hey. I noticed all your

990
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:27,600
stuff was gone from the workshop. You moving on?

991
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,660
Seemed like a good time. Well, you deserve to be the first

992
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:35,750
to hear the news. What's that? I'm resigning my

993
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:39,770
position and starting a community church downtown.

994
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:43,840
That's great news. Yeah. Not too many impossible rules.

995
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,910
Just big open doors, and

996
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,980
a lot of truth. How could you go wrong?

997
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:55,990
Thanks for everything. Do you

998
01:19:55,990 --> 01:20:00,050
think you'll ever get back this way again? I guarantee it.

999
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:04,060
Good. Well...

1000
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,090
Take care.

1001
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:12,120
You too.

1002
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:28,190
Jes?

1003
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,220
Were you just going to leave,

1004
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,250
without saying a word? Well... Oh, you hate

1005
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:40,320
goodbyes, don't you? Yeah,

1006
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,350
I sure do. Well, I thought you'd hang around and

1007
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:48,380
come to our house on Christmas Day. Why don't you ask Tony?

1008
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:52,400
I know for a fact he doesn't have any place to go on Christmas. I'll tell my mom.

1009
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,430
Oh, this is for you.

1010
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,440
But you can't open it until Christmas.

1011
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,480
Will do. I guess this is goodbye.

1012
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:20,610
Take care of your mom, now. I will.

1013
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:24,630
See you around, Max. Bye, Jes.

1014
