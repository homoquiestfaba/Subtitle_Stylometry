1
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,216
No I think youre here.

2
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,827
That was good.
I think that looks cool.

3
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:45,914
All right.

4
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:48,718
Yeah.
Great, great, great, great.

5
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,138
See this stray here.
All right.

6
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,530
Um, Garry's got the story board.

7
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,185
There's a never ending
battle between good and evil

8
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,404
as to which side I'm on.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,408
I'm not on either side.

10
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,370
You should never leave home
without your time bomb

11
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:05,673
remember that.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
I make my own decisions.

13
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:08,632
I never do.

14
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,264
I don't take orders from
anybody...

15
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,288
Anybody.

16
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:13,812
Oh no.

17
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,336
I do what I want

18
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:16,989
I do it when I want to.

19
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:21,255
Yes, this is a time bomb,
and we may use it.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,779
My name is Jonah.

21
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,663
I heard about him
quite a while before I met him.

22
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,453
The West Coast is raving

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,237
who's the phenomenon
called Jonah.

24
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,895
Man, he's just an animal

25
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,622
on the stage and off.
Always gives a 100%.

26
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,203
A bad man.

27
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,296
I wish I could use
the nunchucks like Jonah.

28
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,480
When I found out
he had an alter ego

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,439
of some sort of superhero,
holy shit.

30
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,200
Kathy Washnis:
There's something

31
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,344
definitely demonic going on.

32
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,329
He was wearing
a Wolverine outfit.

33
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,682
You couldn't tell he
was a human.

34
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,048
You want to it turn physical

35
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,222
you're going to really, really
regret it.

36
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:32,021
Uh... He was a
strange cat, right off the bat.

37
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,333
Those are real
Uzis and real AK 47s

38
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,769
and real, real weapons.

39
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,733
I knew right away Jonah
was something special.

40
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,387
He is an original guy.

41
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:35,922
There's, there's nobody
like Jonah.

42
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,739
He is Jonah.
Nobody like Jonah.

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,480
Dont know anybody like Jonah.

44
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,038
When you meet
Jonah for the first time...

45
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,852
You wonder what you're
getting yourself into.

46
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,226
He doesn't sit around

47
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,753
and let life happen to him,
you know.

48
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,323
He tries to take it by the
horns and

49
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:50,839
bend it to his will.

50
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:53,362
Hes quite different.

51
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,310
That's a good way to put it.

52
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,067
He'd be good on
uh, with Chuck Norris

53
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,065
as his sidekick.

54
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,720
As Jonah's sidekick.
Yeah.

55
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,678
Jonah versus the predator

56
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,550
predator be careful.

57
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,921
I mean I haven't
seen a guy that looks like that

58
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,096
since Schwarzenegger in Predator

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,121
or Rambo.

60
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,907
I'm not sure
Chuck Norris is real

61
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,040
where Jonah is.

62
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,564
He said he, uh...

63
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,531
it was the early 70s when he,
uh, was in Vietnam

64
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,612
which was a very dangerous time.
Yep.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,441
He, uh, had a top secret
clearance also

66
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,921
and, uh, he was involved with
some things

67
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,401
that were classified.

68
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,993
They would just
drop him alone in the jungle

69
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,969
and he would go carry
out some mission.

70
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,255
When you look
in the eyes of someone

71
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,584
that has the 1000 yard stare

72
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,761
you can see that
one, he doesn't care

73
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,765
two, he'll do anything he has to

74
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,071
to protect himself.

75
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,378
I kind of said

76
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,467
You used to work for
the President of United States

77
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,817
in security, and he brought
me a card.

78
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,166
He showed it to me and it said

79
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,560
"If you're holding me for
any reason"

80
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,910
let me go or youre going
to be in a lot of trouble.

81
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,801
I don't think
I could last five minutes

82
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,435
in the jungle of Vietnam alone.

83
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,176
So my hat's off to him big time.

84
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:11,832
Nicest guy in the world

85
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,768
and hed give you the shirt
off his back.

86
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,793
Once you get to know him

87
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,033
there's so much inside of him
that just like explodes out.

88
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:24,193
It's like Dorothy
opening the door into Oz.

89
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,022
Sup.
You're here for Jonah, huh?

90
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,114
Guys come on in.

91
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,032
Here step up.

92
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,520
Hey!
Hey!

93
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,217
Lights.

94
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,219
Who's who?

95
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,223
Okay, well, uh, my name
is Jonah.

96
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,668
Uh, I'm kind of like got at a
first name basis with everybody

97
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,586
like Madonna, you know.
Nobody says "Jonah who?"

98
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,753
They just go,
"You know, Jonah."

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,000
Nobody says "Jonah who."
Its like saying "Madonna who."

100
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,757
Yeah.
You know.

101
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,561
I was born in Brooklyn, New York
August 18th 1953

102
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,979
at 7:25pm on a Tuesday night.

103
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,146
What I try to do is give
everybody the extraordinary.

104
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,462
Yeah, I can do ordinary things,
who can't?

105
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,681
I can sit here and
breathe oxygen,

106
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,204
who gives a fuck?

107
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,250
Well, let's see... the bathroom

108
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,319
You might want to know
where that is, right?

109
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,648
And the kitchen and the
dining room.

110
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,606
This is my roommate Mike.

111
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:32,653
I am Michael
Galton. I am Jonah's roommate.

112
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,569
Hey Mike.
Hows it going?

113
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:40,182
And this is the
workout/computer room.

114
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,494
Modest.

115
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,106
Every day.

116
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,852
My dad had told me
when I was really little

117
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,332
that if you do 10 push-ups
and then 10 sit-ups every day

118
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,683
you'll always be in good shape
and you won't be fat.

119
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,661
And there was that little gear
inside my head

120
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,687
thinking what if I do 100
or a 1000, you know.

121
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,645
So Ive kind of always
been like that.

122
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,995
Jonah was always one for, uh

123
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,693
running the laps around
the fence

124
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,521
around the, the school and...

125
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,871
He had metal,
weightlifting shoes that he wore

126
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,220
and hed carry a sledgehammer.

127
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,091
He was a well-conditioned
athlete.

128
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,273
When I get to his age

129
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,798
I want to be as good a
shape as he is.

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,974
I-I don't do heavy weights.

131
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,237
I don't deal with more
than my own body weight.

132
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,326
I don't need to bench press
500 pounds.

133
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:41,243
I weigh 167. If I can move
167 pounds quickly

134
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,637
that's all I care about,
you know.

135
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,353
If I'm at the top of a
burning building

136
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,737
and I need to jump to a
tree branch

137
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,729
to get off the burning building,
I can do it.

138
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,079
He's very,
hes very level headed.

139
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,037
It's not that he's a
crazy person.

140
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,124
But I do know

141
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,983
that if I saw somebody trying
to hurt one of my friends

142
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,608
or an animal or something,
even if I didn't know it

143
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,482
if I saw somebody trying
to rape some chick

144
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,416
or something like that,
I'll beat the fuck out of him.

145
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,983
A combat situation where
you're fighting hand to hand

146
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,009
is really just a chess game
with stamina

147
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,476
because you're trying
to out think the guy

148
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,144
at the same time you're
expending energy.

149
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,102
It takes more energy to
throw a punch and miss

150
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,189
than it does to hit.

151
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,404
Kathy Hayes: I've seen him

152
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,976
kick ass in four, five guys
by himself.

153
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,761
When he was in the service

154
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,502
he came out of a gym one night

155
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,809
and three guys attacked him
they were gonna rob him.

156
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,855
I guess he
was walking a friend out or...

157
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,597
a girl was getting jumped
by three guys.

158
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,163
He said, Dont, don't.

159
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,165
I suggest you guys
don't do this.

160
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,125
Three big guys, little Jonah.

161
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,429
These guys were armed

162
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,180
there's three against one,
you know.

163
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:42,869
They ran off and, um...

164
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,485
I don't know if they were
robbing her

165
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,222
or what they wanted to
do with her.

166
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,749
I snap kicked
this guy in the larynx.

167
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,312
So what happened then was...

168
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,140
One guy just barely lived

169
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,857
and the other two were
in the hospital

170
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,404
for a really long time.

171
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,319
I grabbed
this fucking guy by his balls

172
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,670
and put my hand in his mouth and
I fucking jerked, jerked him up.

173
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,280
I ran him right into a tree

174
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,778
three or four times
and broke all of his ribs.

175
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,810
Now, that's the way
Jonah is. But he warned them.

176
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:11,638
It was at that point

177
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,684
that I realized how dangerous
I was, and, um...

178
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:20,429
I was very hesitant to go out
to bars and things like that

179
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,127
because you know, I just was

180
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,827
you-you gain a self-awareness
when stuff like that happens.

181
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:31,875
There's no, there's no, no glory
to hurting someone, you know.

182
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,549
If, it, it's good to know
how to do it

183
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,613
but does it make it right.

184
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,924
Killing or anything like that.

185
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,928
There have been
situations where one of the...

186
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,932
one of the group had, had
problems with wannabe gangsters.

187
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,286
A few of us had to go calm
a neighborhood down.

188
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,073
Uh, like everything else, uh...

189
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,163
Jonah was uh, efficient
and methodical.

190
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,387
We didn't get in-in trouble
much as individuals.

191
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,825
There were times where,
you know, somebody younger

192
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:13,482
and, uh... a little bit,
uh, bigger than us

193
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,440
would try to, you know,
say something stupid.

194
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,312
Wed just look at him and go,
you know,

195
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,184
You don't realize, you know,
who you're screwing with.

196
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,708
The Inhumans.

197
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,361
That was a moniker

198
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:24,808
that was hung on us
on Avis Street.

199
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,627
I used to call
the, the group of...

200
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,804
you know it was four maybe
five, five guys "The Inhumans."

201
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,477
Chips had come up
with the Inhumans thing.

202
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,111
And if you're a Fantastic Four
fan

203
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,113
you know who the Blackbolt
and Karnak

204
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,028
and Gorgon and all that.
Medusa.

205
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,944
And...

206
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,993
That's about all I can tell you.

207
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,996
We don't want to get
either one of us

208
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,867
you know, talking to lawyers.

209
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,043
So we'll just leave it at that.

210
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,219
All right,
maybe you want to be able

211
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,308
to strike back at the
establishment, but you can't.

212
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,769
Maybe you're one of those
peasants in a Robin Hood movie

213
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,028
and you can't strike back
at the Sheriff of Nottingham

214
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,358
or Prince John.

215
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,005
But Robin Hood's got the
balls to do it.

216
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,070
So what do you do?
Give him some food, hide him

217
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,341
you do stuff like that.
And I think what happens

218
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:11,765
is I think people are
rooting for me

219
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,213
because I'm really not
a bad person.

220
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,477
I just do all this crazy stuff.

221
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,913
But I think people
want to see me succeed.

222
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,547
So when I got on Myspace

223
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,289
I pretty much dumped like
30 years worth of shit

224
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:24,031
on the whole world in
about a week.

225
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,121
And everybody's like...
"Who's this guy," right?

226
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,819
And, and everything
just kind of happened.

227
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,040
I heard about him
quite a while before I met him.

228
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,129
Particularly with the
Christmas cards

229
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:36,870
he was kind of legendary
about those.

230
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,959
Hi, I am Skip Evon.

231
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:42,876
I've been a friend to Jonah's
for close to 10 years.

232
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,660
My dad does
like everything for him.

233
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,314
He's got stuff in the
basement set up

234
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,576
to help edit his videos

235
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,885
and hes got the posters
and all his music.

236
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,930
Jonah is, um...

237
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,085
After Id known him a while
had this idea about a calendar

238
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:01,895
and thats, uh, when I got this
and started videotaping.

239
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:07,117
Calendar is a kind of
fantasy warrior theme.

240
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,078
The name he came up with
for it was Warriad

241
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:19,086
about a princes quest to find
a crystal to save his princess.

242
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,574
I usually the one
making the video clips for him

243
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,099
or helping him with the JPEGs.

244
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,971
Okay, uh, Danielle, get
a little angry.

245
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,975
I try to help him manage
his business and, you know

246
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:43,153
look out for him as
far as you know

247
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,635
trying to help him succeed
basically, that's all.

248
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,116
Wow,
we got Jonah's phone number?

249
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,118
No, no area code or
nothing no bruh?

250
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,381
You don't need it.
Its 5, uh, 505...

251
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,556
Hes a Dansville cat, right?

252
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,992
Yes.

253
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,129
Good morning.
Jonah!

254
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,433
How are you doing?

255
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,662
You wacky son of a bitch.
Yes, I am.

256
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,242
I-I consider myself a real
life adventurer

257
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,906
and a warrior and a musician
because I am.

258
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,401
Adventures don't come
knocking at your door.

259
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,185
You've got to make'em happen.

260
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,014
Jonah, are you taking an armor

261
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,781
in case they don't
serve our burgers right?

262
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,072
The stuff that you
think is normal

263
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,595
is not normal to the rest of us.

264
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,903
What you do is stuff
that we see in the movies.

265
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,316
There's other musicians, there's
other people they've CDs,

266
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,645
there's other martial artists,

267
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,343
but how many of them
do you know?

268
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,604
Okay.

269
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,158
Marisa, you can get in closer.

270
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,536
Marisa Cameron,
Im here in Rochester, New York.

271
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,178
Um, let's see...

272
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,441
I met Jonah

273
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,312
through an ex-boyfriend

274
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,532
in the early 90s.

275
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,728
Marisa Cameron,
she's like my best friend.

276
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,450
I, you know, she's
such a sweet lady.

277
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,626
I mean, her boyfriend Brett
is a very, very lucky guy

278
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,324
to have somebody that nice,
you know.

279
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,545
I met Marisa when
I had gotten out of the service

280
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,113
and was working as a janitor
in my old high school

281
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,636
and I think at the time

282
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,323
she was either a freshman
or a sophomore.

283
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,517
I know I got about
six years on her.

284
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,556
I didn't
know about Jonah's cards

285
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,644
before I met him.

286
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,971
You know, I, he'd show me
his cards from last year

287
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,345
or he'd show me the whole series
that he's gone through.

288
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,305
Cheese Cake, cheese cake.

289
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,262
I'll have a slice.

290
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,416
And maybe
if you get smacked in the face

291
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,354
with it right away
with the weapons

292
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,573
and the this, and the that.

293
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,114
Get a couple of those
assault rifles somebody.

294
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,235
Maybe that-that would kind of
push people away.

295
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,325
But if you know him first
and then you just understand

296
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,328
that this is just part
of his whole personality

297
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,636
and, you know, its, it's
not anything to be scared of.

298
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:02,118
He's a great guy. He's honest,
hes funny, we laugh.

299
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:05,469
What?

300
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,522
I just cant believe
were doing this.

301
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,432
Whatever Jonah wants to do,
he pretty much does.

302
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,672
And, uh, when he tells you that
something's going to happen

303
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:17,133
it pretty much does happen
just that way.

304
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,268
Thats right folks.

305
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,849
This is proof positive that
I'm in the Ukraine.

306
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,085
Nikolai, to my arch enemies
at the INS, I mean friends.

307
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,322
I don't really
get a chance to interact

308
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,629
with Jonah and the
rest of his clan

309
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:39,286
unless we're doing something,
you know, like, uh, I'm videoing

310
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,680
and they, you know,
they're doing uh, calendar

311
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,814
or modeling, photos
or something like that.

312
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,818
Stagger yourselves so I can
get both of you in the picture.

313
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,951
You know I bought the
video camera

314
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:55,215
more for doing stuff for Jonah
than for doing stuff for me.

315
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,744
The viewfinder image is
black and white

316
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,398
but when I open both eyes

317
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,748
the viewfinder image
is in color.

318
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:09,706
Quite amazing.

319
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,623
He documents everything he does.

320
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,192
When I met him,
I understood this right away.

321
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:17,933
If he's gonna to do something

322
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,580
I'm usually there with
the video camera.

323
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,591
Nice job.

324
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,423
Pre-recording session.

325
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,728
Pre-recording, pre-burn.

326
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,556
And uh...

327
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:33,904
Pre-Russia.

328
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,480
Its good to be king.

329
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,832
This is the beginning
of my rock stardom.

330
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,102
I'm Jackie Kasperson

331
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,668
and this is Dave Kasperson.

332
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,344
And he's really the fellow
who met Jonah to begin with,

333
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,544
so you should talk
about how you met Jonah.

334
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,763
Well, what are we saying?

335
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,461
Like 27 years ago I think
was when Jonah

336
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,246
first came into our studio
with a group called...

337
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,380
Cruise Control.
Cruise Control.

338
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:14,685
Tim, Tim Coon.

339
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,136
I play the bass.
They call me the big ugly man.

340
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,822
A better part of 30 years
anyway - 25, 30 years

341
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:24,739
I was going through a bunch of
bands in this building downtown

342
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:27,655
and Jonah was in one of them
and I was in another one

343
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,796
and, you know, guys switch
and swap around bands

344
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,834
and finally ended up in the same
group and the rest is history.

345
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,314
A lot of people come in studios

346
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,880
and they, they freeze up

347
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:38,579
and they are like afraid
of being at the studio.

348
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,537
But not Jonah.
He was a natural.

349
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:41,799
A lot of times

350
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,716
bands will ask him up to
play with him

351
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,848
and they wind up not liking him

352
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,502
because he just steals the show.

353
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,568
And, and he's not trying
to do it on purpose or anything.

354
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,463
It's just the way he is and...

355
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,337
He's got some attraction...

356
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,513
of some kind thats
all I can say.

357
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,823
Listen, I'm a mercenary.

358
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,433
I'm not signed by anybody.

359
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,294
I tell everybody
Im a mercenary musician.

360
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,481
You know, I'm not signed
by Atlantic Records,

361
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,656
Capitol Records, anybody.

362
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,614
I'm, Im an unsigned artist

363
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,529
and I can play as well
as anybody.

364
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,840
He gets going
so hard on a harmonica

365
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:06,928
that he'll blow it out.

366
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,236
Hell wreck the reeds
on a harmonica.

367
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,368
And he's blown a couple out here

368
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,370
and as a matter of fact,
he's given them to me.

369
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,067
Ive seen him one night

370
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,939
ripped a hole on the side
of his lip open

371
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,186
with the front of his harp...
Kept playing. That's punk.

372
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,986
He's proving and showing people

373
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,250
that that you can get
notoriety with music

374
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,252
and at a, uh, you know,

375
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,243
in your 50s basically,
you know, which is not typical.

376
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,866
I'm very excited about tonight.

377
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,956
Jonah is going
to be performing shortly.

378
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,265
We're at the Stumblin Inn

379
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,049
in beautiful downtown
Elba, New York.

380
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,850
Believe me when Jonah
starts playing

381
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,844
this place is gonna take note.

382
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,041
I started playing the harmonica

383
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,546
when I was in the service, um...

384
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,984
and I just took to it.

385
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,334
In 2002, I recorded my CD.

386
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,902
I've been playing harmonica
for about 33 years

387
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,557
and a good friend of mine
told me about Myspace

388
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,602
and I said, Okay, fine,
I'll go on there.

389
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,562
It's actually, even though I
had a website up on the internet

390
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,825
Myspace being as popular
as it was

391
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,654
afforded me a vehicle to people.

392
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,133
Amen!
Amen!

393
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,570
I have three different pages.

394
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,311
I have my main Punisher page

395
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,791
and then I have my music page

396
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,576
and then I have a page
for my dog.

397
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:30,837
He's got his own page.

398
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,275
He's a dog and he's dead

399
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,059
and he's got more hits
than most people..

400
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,463
What do you think
of Jonahs Myspace?

401
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,763
Its great..
All right.

402
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,633
I really think it's great!

403
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,069
So cool!

404
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,156
What's your favorite part?

405
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:48,924
I love the pictures!
All right.

406
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,257
Did you check any of
the videos out?

407
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:53,793
No, I didn't know
there were videos there.

408
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,137
Oh yeah.
Check the videos out too.

409
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:57,908
All right.

410
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,783
I take these quizzes on Facebook

411
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,915
and if I like...

412
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,144
if I like them I'll put them
on my MySpace page.

413
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,529
What soldier type are you?
Special forces.

414
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,531
What badass are you?
Chuck Norris.

415
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,533
What Marvel character are you?
Wolverine.

416
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,143
How tough are you?
Wow, you're hard,

417
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,642
youre the type of person
the army sends in first

418
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,320
to sort out a war.

419
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,080
You're so tough that
if 50 skinheads are fighting you

420
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,864
and you shouted Stop,
they'd run away crying.

421
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:23,905
Your middle name is
danger, right?

422
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,130
What animal represents
your spirit? The tiger.

423
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,374
Yeah, what animal are you?
A fucking bear.

424
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,985
What rockstar are you?
Angus Young from ACDC.

425
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,901
What dead rockstar are you?
Jim Morrison of The Doors.

426
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,469
I mean, I mean, its like,
ya know, isn't that funny

427
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,166
just by answering
these questions

428
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,853
I turned out to be like
all of my heroes.

429
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,910
You know, I'm so much
like these guys.

430
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,781
Its why I really don't belong
in civilized society.

431
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,965
Are you ready to rock?

432
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,185
Yes!

433
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:06,977
Believe it folks.

434
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,023
You people are weak!

435
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,677
You people are weak!

436
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,766
You people are weak!

437
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,901
Now, we went to
your, uh, MySpace.

438
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,468
Yes, sir.
And, uh...

439
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,165
According to your friend
who called us

440
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:24,038
you're getting all kinds
of MTV and radio stations.

441
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,432
Now we went to this place
and we understand

442
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,434
once we looked at
why people would call you.

443
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,697
Thank you.
That's the scary part.

444
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,960
Because you don't know if
they're making fun of you

445
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,919
but in all honesty,
if you end up on a reality show

446
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,126
obviously you don't care
if they're making fun of you.

447
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:40,533
So there's a lot of shit.

448
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,164
That's why I said, told Steve,
I said tell these girls I said

449
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,948
this is a big deal
if you get on this poster,

450
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,056
because its a really big,
big deal. It really could.

451
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,716
Youre going to be somebody.

452
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,239
Brother Wiese
just interviewed me.

453
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:52,966
I did an interview for Mob
Scene Magazine.

454
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,710
Yeah. The Doug Lando show
I'm gonna be on in Montreal.

455
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,820
Remind me to get
your autograph before you leave

456
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,073
because if I ever see you again,
I want to have it.

457
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,773
You'd think that
somebody'd want to sign me up

458
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,900
before somebody else does.

459
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:06,776
You know, if you're MTV

460
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,232
you want to get me before
the Sci-fi channel.

461
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,518
If youre the Sci-fi channel

462
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:10,925
you want to get me
before HBO does

463
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,826
because somebody
that's not stupid

464
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,654
that sees that potential
is going to say

465
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,917
Listen, we can make some
money with this motherfucker.

466
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,265
He's got people who are
already wanting to see him.

467
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,835
Numbers equate into dollars.

468
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:23,706
I mean, I remember one day

469
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,621
I think I got a whole
High School in Colorado.

470
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,228
I had like 224 friend requests.
I couldn't even keep up with it.

471
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:37,677
Tuesday alone,
I hit 263 new friend requests.

472
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,374
Wow.

473
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,941
He was getting
thousands of hit a day.

474
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,814
You know, he was up over 100,000
within a few months.

475
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,034
But it's the same way
when FHM Interview

476
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,775
uh, magazine found
me on MySpace.

477
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,274
They interviewed me,
I'm writing a column

478
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,908
for a magazine in Australia.

479
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:53,780
Ask Jonah.

480
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,067
Recently I bought my first car.

481
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,000
The other night it was keyed

482
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,978
the side mirrors snapped off
and a window smashed.

483
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,402
I'm sure the culprits were a
gang of kids in my neighborhood.

484
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,680
Theyre very hostile, so I don't
know if I should confront them.

485
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,424
What do you think?
Brimbo Dromana, Victoria.

486
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,664
Well, let me share
a similar experience.

487
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,101
I used to have a red
78 Thunderbird.

488
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,277
I just moved into the hood

489
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,284
and noticed several cars
have been broken into...

490
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,979
Windows smashed, side mirrors
broken off.

491
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,548
I saw the local gang members
scoping out my vehicle

492
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:23,852
and I introduced myself.

493
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,224
I said, You see that red
Thunderbird over there?

494
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:28,684
Well, if anything happens to it

495
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,489
I'm going to hunt each
and every one of you down

496
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,036
and end your lives
as you now know it.

497
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,996
They figured I was crazy
enough to do it.

498
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:39,347
So, if they even saw
anybody near my ride

499
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,109
they got the fuck out of dodge.

500
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,110
So get some of your bros
to discuss matters

501
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,266
with the street urchins.

502
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:46,702
They only respect toughness.

503
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,878
Be tough, or move.

504
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,292
I don't know if you want to call
it the starving artist thing

505
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,842
but I do all the things I do,
because I have a passion for it.

506
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,234
But I'm, Im still...

507
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,214
I can still succumb to the same
things as the rest of us can.

508
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,066
I mean, in, within the last...

509
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,262
I mean some bad things happened
to me in the last year.

510
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:06,829
You know, my mom passed
away, my dog died.

511
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:07,854
My wife left me.

512
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,635
You know, I wound up having
my house foreclosed upon

513
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,401
and they repossessed my car.
That little piece of shit car

514
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,225
out there is what I'm driving
around right now

515
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,417
because its, I, I got to eat
just like the rest of us.

516
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,843
And maybe that's the connection
that I have with everybody else

517
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,173
because a lot of times
I feel very out of place

518
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:24,479
in the normal world.

519
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,839
This is not the kind of car

520
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,566
you want to take chicks
on a date in, man.

521
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,690
Unless you want to hope
they pass out from the fumes

522
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,343
and have sex with them
or something, I don't know.

523
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,979
Like built-in ecstasy.

524
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,112
No, I mean you know this...

525
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,519
Is just, like I said, I'm, I'm,
Im fortunate I have wheels.

526
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,377
Skip and another friend
of mine got this

527
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,815
or I wouldn't have a way
to get back and forth to work.

528
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,818
I mean its beat, man.
Skips always laughing.

529
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,907
That things still running?
You know?

530
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,432
I spent the money when I had
it and I don't regret doing it.

531
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,279
Its just like the stuff
we do in the magazines

532
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,783
and stuff I do on the internet.

533
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,364
You never know who's
gonna hear it

534
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,917
and what's going to
come from it.

535
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,701
You know, maybe that one person

536
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,790
happens to be a record
industry guy

537
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,923
or a movie producer
or a TV director

538
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,925
or a magazine editor.

539
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,362
So I just put myself out there.

540
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,888
That's why I said,
I don't hide anything about me.

541
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,410
If anything, I'm flaunting
everything I got, you know.

542
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:27,847
I show everybody everything

543
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,240
in hopes that somebody
will pick me up.

544
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,243
Pick me up and get me the fuck
out of reality here, you know.

545
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,857
Uh, my father used to work
for the post office

546
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:41,469
and he, um,
he wound up moving to Buffalo.

547
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,289
I think he got transferred.

548
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,567
I had a brother that
was born there.

549
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,835
And then they wind up again
moving to Rochester

550
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,019
uh, where I had two sisters,
Karen and Kathy.

551
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,163
Uh, so I'm the oldest child.

552
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,370
Karen Lagraff:
I'm Karen Lagraff

553
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:56,136
and I'm Jonah's younger sister.

554
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,443
We grew up in a house in
Rochester in Greece, New York.

555
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,795
It was a pretty small house
by today's standards.

556
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,754
We each kind of found a spot
to call our own

557
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,401
because we didn't have
our own bedrooms.

558
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:09,192
My younger sister Kathy

559
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,542
my brother, Jimmy,
who's seven years older than me

560
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,981
and, uh, and I each kind
of took a part of the attic.

561
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,592
So we kind of made it
our own little cool rooms

562
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,855
if you will put the, you
know, black light posters up

563
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:20,942
and stuff like that.

564
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,860
And Jonah had, he had a spot
down in the basement.

565
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,123
Near the coal cellar.

566
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,909
It was just a dark closet with
a big heavy wooden door on it.

567
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,538
Karen Lagraff: But that was
like his little room

568
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,042
at the bottom of the stairs

569
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:35,828
where he hung out and
hung up his stuff.

570
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:39,135
And that was his
Fortress of Solitude.

571
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:40,789
The Fortress of Solitude.

572
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,158
All right, well, this is
my room.

573
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,183
This is where I live.

574
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,989
I mean, this is the Fortress
of Solitude or the Batcave.

575
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,730
I mean, I was fortunate that
there were shelves over here

576
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,035
that I was able to put some
of my knickknacks on and again

577
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,020
I always stress the point
that I had a whole house

578
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,506
that looked like this and the
Adams Family has nothing on me.

579
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,546
So this is basically
a whole house full of shit

580
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,983
that I can't fit where
I live right now.

581
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,814
Someone from MTV, I'm
not sure of the gentleman's name

582
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,469
contacted him and said
they were interested

583
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,385
in possibly doing like
a cribs episode.

584
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:14,301
I mean, it really would have
been a great opportunity for MTV

585
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,477
because his house
in Danville was...

586
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,219
I mean, it was like a museum.

587
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,328
This here is my house
at 6th Clay Street in Dansville.

588
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:23,353
When I got in here

589
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,768
I didn't really care what
the carpeting looked like

590
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,272
the wallpaper, the paint
on the walls.

591
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:29,751
Nobody was going to
pay attention to it.

592
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:30,883
The rooms were so busy

593
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,495
with action figures and
weapons and paintings

594
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,367
you didn't really even think
about what was behind them.

595
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,109
I knew how I was going
to flood the house with stuff.

596
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,851
Now, I've been here a couple
of years before I got married.

597
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,810
So you know, it was just
one of those things.

598
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:46,768
Well, the reason that I
bought this house

599
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,528
is because of this gigantic bed
that I had made

600
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,293
at a Renaissance Fair.

601
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,165
And if you
could have seen his bed...

602
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,384
Unbelievable.

603
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,125
I think, I think most women

604
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,040
would be afraid to
sleep in that bed.

605
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:59,999
The headboard
is seven foot three

606
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,696
and it's almost two parking
spaces wide.

607
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,480
So it's a king sized
bed and a half.

608
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,700
Uh, he commissioned
the guy to make it.

609
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,268
He actually drew it.
Jonah is very good at art.

610
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:13,142
Very... awesome...
sleeping quarters.

611
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,883
Its beautiful.

612
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,103
Did you get your bed?

613
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,844
I got my bed but Ive got...

614
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,715
Life is good
if you got your bed.

615
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,682
Yeah, well I've got
the mattress and box springs

616
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,285
because where I'm living the,
the actual bed will not fit.

617
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:28,114
So I've got a lot of my stuff
in a u-haul storage bed.

618
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,290
The bed, the bed is one
of the things.

619
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,294
Well, its in there, man.

620
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,426
I mean this,
you're not going to be able to...

621
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:38,353
I mean you might be able to see
sections of it.

622
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:39,995
The headboard is really buried.

623
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,562
Parts of it are, well...

624
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,753
I'm sorry that it's
all so buried.

625
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,513
There's nothing I'd like better
than to have it out

626
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,670
and actually be, be using
the whole bed, you know.

627
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,586
I mean this is part of
the situation I'm forced into.

628
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,457
I've just got everything
in boxes.

629
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,982
I had to duct tape everything up

630
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,189
and just get it sealed up
so I could get the hell out.

631
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,637
I got as many of my
favorite things

632
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,901
which are all to me
symbolic things

633
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,598
uh, in this little room here.

634
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,339
Over here I've got uh...

635
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,535
the poster from the
Warrior on the Edge of Time

636
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,170
which is the tattoo
on my right arm

637
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,949
you know the headboard of my bed
and the URL from my MySpace site.

638
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,879
There's Tonru my dog up in the
Chimney Bluffs on Sodus point.

639
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,720
Jonah got a dog
but it wasn't just uh, a dog.

640
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,224
It was a Tibetan Mastiff.

641
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,204
I mean, I saw a monster
movie called 'Man's Best Friend'

642
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,684
and it was a movie that was
kind of like a canine Terminator

643
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,189
you know, your Grade B
monster movie.

644
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,031
One of those ones
I like to watch.

645
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:47,715
Lance Henriksen's
this mad scientist

646
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,301
and he spices the DNA
of all these animals

647
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,718
into this Tibetan Mastiff.

648
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,132
And I didn't even know
what the breed was at the time.

649
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,596
And Ally Sheedy is
like this reporter

650
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,094
doing an animal rights thing
and they let this dog loose

651
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,486
and they don't know the dogs
like this Frankenstein monster.

652
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,121
I want that dog back.

653
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,008
We're not talking about
some street mutt here.

654
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,386
We're talking about a million
dollar research animal.

655
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,649
He regresses
and becomes more predatory.

656
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:11,391
And of course he can do things
other dogs cannot do.

657
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,472
So I really became in love
with the dog in the movie.

658
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,006
And uh,
I guess he had to go to...

659
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,704
Minnesota or somewhere
to pick him up.

660
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,317
And he did that and
came back with him.

661
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,710
He was just a tiny
bundle of fur.

662
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,451
He was just a little fluff-ball.

663
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:31,063
He was this big.
He was adorable.

664
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,413
You know, we just
went everywhere together.

665
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,714
I took him to work with me

666
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,828
you know, we went,
we walked all over the place

667
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,245
and you know, he was my pal.

668
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,164
Big 22 by 36 poster of me
as 'The Punisher'

669
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,687
from my '94 Christmas card shoot

670
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,471
and 'The Avengers'
Captain America.

671
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,083
When Jonah and I
were first, just met

672
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,999
this was one of the comics
we were trying to find.

673
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,262
And it was one of the ones

674
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,177
that he and I both
really liked a lot.

675
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,787
We liked the group
'The Avengers'.

676
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,354
He gave that to me and...

677
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,705
I hope
you get a chance to see Gary

678
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,117
because Gary is the one that
took a lot of these pictures

679
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,141
that you're looking at.

680
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:09,753
My name is Gary Bader

681
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,104
and I was born and raised
here in Rochester.

682
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,280
I worked for Kodak for 30 years.

683
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,457
Uh, okay I, I have 'X-Men'

684
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,026
one through 10 in here that
I've had for a long time.

685
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:26,031
Here they are here.
There's 'X-Men number one'

686
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,165
from 1963 and number two

687
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,125
'Nothing Can Stop the Vanisher'

688
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,302
and 'Beware of the Blob'
number three

689
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:39,827
X-Men number four
'The Evil Mutants'

690
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:44,484
and then 'The Angel is
Trapped' number five.

691
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:49,576
'Special Guest Star the
Submariner' number six.

692
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,579
'Return of the Blob'
number seven.

693
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,844
'Eunice the Untouchable'
number eight.

694
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,631
Um, this is where they tangle
with 'The Avengers'

695
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,459
number nine.

696
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,623
And 'Ka-Zar Lord of the Jungle'
number 10.

697
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,030
They're all original

698
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,837
although that one got
drawn on a little bit.

699
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,418
I was 9 years old when
'Amazing Fantasy 15' came out.

700
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,691
You know, so Spider Man and
all that stuff was brand new.

701
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
It was a real...

702
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,406
real left side of the brain
creative time to be growing up.

703
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,068
I first met Jonah through
a friend of mine George Kaidas.

704
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,615
And it was through
trading comics

705
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:29,853
and they showed up
at my house unannounced

706
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:31,357
one Saturday afternoon

707
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,359
carrying a box of comics
under their one arm.

708
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,536
And they said,
"George sent us."

709
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,191
I said to my mother,
"Who are these guys?"

710
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,438
And she goes, "I don't know."

711
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,171
So I let them in and
we traded comics

712
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:44,718
and they took, took me
for a ride.

713
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:46,348
They took every good
comic that I had and gave

714
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,808
me a bunch of lousy ones.

715
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,638
Hey!
Whats going on man?

716
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,398
Believe me
if you met my buddy Gary

717
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:54,423
he's nothing like me.

718
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,303
But he likes the same
kind of stuff.

719
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,665
It's just that, again I do stuff
other people read about it.

720
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:01,387
Other people think about it.
I do it.

721
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,738
What's going on here?
A wedding?

722
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,136
Oh yeah.
Somebodys decorated our lot.

723
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,268
That cool, man?

724
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,140
All right.

725
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,753
All right.
What year was that, John?

726
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,711
Um, 1997

727
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,907
and this is where we did the...
Oh, here they come

728
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:26,281
'Robin Hood'
Christmas card shoot.

729
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,240
The first time he said

730
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,478
he was going to do
a Christmas card of Robin Hood

731
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:31,721
I had no idea what the man did.

732
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,290
He wanted the most impressive
looking bow.

733
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,205
Marcia: Which was
Which was

734
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,295
an Oneida Eagle Bow with
Michigan Autumn Camo on it.

735
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:41,861
And uh...

736
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,171
he had his side painted up
special paint extra for that.

737
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,651
Well, it's like, I'm
almost to where the dragon is.

738
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,349
You'll be able to see
some of that.

739
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,828
This is the over length arrow

740
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,439
that I used for the Robin Hood
shoot

741
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,267
purposely so you could
see the end of it

742
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,246
hanging off the uh, from the
front of the bow for the picture

743
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,836
but normally you wouldn't.

744
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,803
The arrow would be closer
to where your hand is.

745
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,841
But for effect, I had this made
so it's kind of a special arrow.

746
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,673
Howard Hill tip too, of course.

747
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,722
Oh!
Somebody gave me that because

748
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,637
because it looks a
lot like Chips.

749
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,465
It looks, see Mr. Chips.

750
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:20,901
It looks just like the guy

751
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,468
that made all the
weird taxidermy.

752
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:27,473
I was bored
to the point of tears one day

753
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:32,478
and I decided to make Jonah
something that wasn't normal.

754
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,436
So I made him what would
turn out to be

755
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,308
we called it the
Chernobyl Woodchuck.

756
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,536
And the guy was weird.
I mean, like he'd make...

757
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,225
he had a thing about
killing animals.

758
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,965
From deer to skunks.

759
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,491
You know, if it had
fur or feathers, I did it.

760
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,362
He made a clock

761
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:48,818
and that and the 12, the 3,
the 6 and the 9

762
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,235
were squirrel's heads.

763
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:51,975
I don't see him.
I don't see him

764
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:54,239
or know him or call him
or anything.

765
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,415
So that's fine with me.
He's just goofy.

766
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:58,939
So he's a trip that guy...

767
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,246
Mr. Chips...

768
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:04,510
Insane. He's just insane,
you know?

769
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:15,521
You know, just another thing
for Jonah's menagerie.

770
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,872
So that's Chips.

771
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,490
All right. Well...

772
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:36,063
He had a Robin Hood sword
that he ordered in Spain,

773
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,588
and Jonah is so short
and the sword was so long

774
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,460
when he drew it out
of the scabbard

775
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,418
he couldn't get it all
the way out.

776
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,595
That picture out in
the other room

777
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,641
we have hundreds of
people every year

778
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,425
that ask us "Who is that?"

779
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,170
And we tell them,
"Oh, that's Jonah."

780
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,560
And explain a little bit
about him.

781
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,866
And, and he does
a Christmas card every year.

782
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,521
And one year, he wanted to be
the Robin Hood character

783
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:00,826
and uh...

784
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,742
they look at it just like

785
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,961
"Wow, you know, crazy guy."

786
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,920
Well, not crazy

787
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,488
just somebody's that got
an idea and a dream

788
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:10,880
and just makes it happen.

789
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,374
Like probably a lot of people
would like to do.

790
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,758
Well, I started doing
the Christmas cards in 1976.

791
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah, I mean, it got to be
a real cult phenomenon.

792
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:25,504
I guess that, you know, we're,
were at that juncture now

793
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,114
where, you know,
it's gotten so big.

794
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:30,030
And really, in 2006,
when I got on MySpace

795
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,685
all I really did was dump
30 years' worth of shit

796
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:33,772
on everybody at once.

797
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,231
And then everybody was like,
"Who the fuck is this guy?"

798
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,895
You know? And that's
basically what it was

799
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,364
because there were
all Christmas card pictures

800
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:41,388
and to go back again

801
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,108
the Christmas card really was
just something that I thought of

802
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:48,048
because they used to have
an ad on TV for Polaroid

803
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,137
and it was mom and dad
and the kids

804
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:51,921
and they said,
"Make your own card."

805
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,434
And then a little idea light
bulb goes over on my head

806
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,120
and I'm thinking I'll make
my own card

807
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,224
but it wont look like this.

808
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,559
And I decided to do the action
adventure thing, you know.

809
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:02,932
Thank you very much
for the horn!

810
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,805
So um, you know...

811
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,678
Playing on that theme

812
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:11,787
would do my take on different
characters out of the movies

813
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,029
or comic books or whatever.

814
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,959
And um, it turned
out really well.

815
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,184
I also had to accumulate
things I needed prop wise.

816
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,428
And again, out of
pocket expense.

817
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,256
And not being independently
wealthy

818
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,998
it would take me time to
save up vacation

819
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,741
pay or money out of
my paycheck to order swords

820
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:32,788
or have somebody custom make
leather capes or sheaths

821
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,964
or a mask for my dog
kind of a thing.

822
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,837
Dave: I've known
Jonah over the years.

823
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:40,666
It's, it's he comes, he used to
come in here every Christmas

824
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:44,104
with a new set of Christmas
cards all handmade special

825
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,846
with all special photographs,
all these beautiful women

826
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,587
and always some kind of theme.

827
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,274
Kathy Hayes: I was
in the very first one.

828
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,743
The very first one, if you
go to the website "Have Harp, Will Travel'."

829
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,508
It's me when I was like 27
or something.

830
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,858
The very first one
was just like a Polaroid.

831
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,599
And then they get
really elaborate

832
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,470
and you know, models and horses

833
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,081
and he's an amazing kind
of character.

834
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:06,822
Just amazing.

835
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,454
I delivered them by hand
because I always loved to see

836
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,238
the people's reactions
when they open the card.

837
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,675
Because let's face it,
you've got an ordinary card

838
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:15,241
and you open it up and
it's like, you know.

839
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,634
Everybody always like,
wait for a second.

840
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:18,573
After a while, just to see...

841
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,203
Because they know it's going
to be something wild, you know?

842
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,576
You could be a swashbuckler

843
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:23,143
or you could have been
a barbarian.

844
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,928
I was fortunate enough
to be in a few of them.

845
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,540
Yes, even the very first one.

846
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,411
Last name is Ferguson

847
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,215
and everybody just called me
Ferg from then on.

848
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,239
Ferg.

849
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,069
And I've known Jonah since 1963

850
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,550
just after the assassination
of President Kennedy.

851
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,597
His brother was my best friend

852
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:46,079
and pointed him out to me in the
hallway as we were passing by

853
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:49,038
and that was the first time
I really saw him... Yeah.

854
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:53,739
Uh. Just if he belonged
there or somewhere,

855
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,089
incarceration or something.

856
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,960
From, from my observation

857
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,659
okay, I think you know,
my brother Jimmy

858
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,052
and he'll tell Im sure
hell tell you more about this

859
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:06,229
than, than I will but,
he was always very athletic.

860
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:10,582
You know, he, he kind of
almost looked like, you know

861
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:13,193
had like the Joe Nemeth kind of
thing going on back in the day.

862
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,934
He was quarterback of
the football team

863
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,762
he had a lot of girlfriends.

864
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:19,547
Uh, he was very popular.

865
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:24,291
Um, Jonah was more, um,
reclusive, I would say.

866
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,210
What happened
was my mother remarried

867
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,821
and I end up moving
just on the same street

868
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,780
but five houses away from them.

869
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,783
So from '66 to whenever
he went into service

870
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,785
I was practically living
at his house.

871
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,700
I actually started seeing
his brother Jimmy

872
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,832
because we were into football

873
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,200
and we'd play catch in the
front yard and stuff like that.

874
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:47,575
But the more I hung around

875
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,621
I realized Jonah was
into 'Spies'

876
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,710
and 'Man from U.N.C.L.E'
and comic books

877
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,713
and all those things and
I kind of liked that as well.

878
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,191
So I would, you know

879
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,239
go over and start hanging
around with him

880
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:01,486
and eventually that's all
I did is hang around with him

881
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:03,981
and Jimmy went on his way
to do football and stuff.

882
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,640
I played varsity
when I was a sophomore.

883
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,164
First play, I came in,
I called for a bootleg pass

884
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,819
it was against Eastridge.
I came in, I took the snap,

885
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,777
and as I turned like this

886
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,364
the pulling lineman
tripped my feet

887
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,042
and I lost about four yards.

888
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,209
Now, I got second and 14
so I call for a screen pass.

889
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,743
So, I drop back to pass
and as I'm in the pocket

890
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,851
and I'm sitting there, this big
lineman is coming right at me.

891
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,182
He's about to cream me
and my running back

892
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,749
is over here in the flat

893
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,291
and there's a linebacker
waiting right behind him

894
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:33,315
to intercept the ball.

895
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,840
So I had to think fast.

896
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,781
So I pump fake like this
and got this guy up in the air.

897
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,865
That guy moved over to
intercept but I never threw it

898
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,848
and I turned around
and ran this way

899
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,152
he missed me.

900
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,243
And as I was running
to the right

901
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,047
I saw the tight end going down
straight down the sideline

902
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:50,440
I just rifled him a 40 yard ball
right on his fingertips.

903
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:51,824
He ran all the way
for a touchdown.

904
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,340
The crowd went nuts
on a broken play.

905
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
It was a broken play.

906
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,644
My name is Jim Washnis.

907
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,690
I'm Jonah's brother by blood.

908
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,737
I was given a lot of God
gifted abilities in sports.

909
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,348
My brother harbored
a lot of jealousy

910
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,699
toward me because of it.

911
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:09,755
We lived right next
to a schoolyard

912
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,481
you could jump the fence
and you're in a playground.

913
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,094
And we're throwing
the football around.

914
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,176
My brother was standing
on top of a slide

915
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,549
they had a pretty big slide
at this playground.

916
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,775
And I threw him a pass,
about a 30 yard pass.

917
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:23,923
It was a nice tight spiral
right between the numbers.

918
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,065
But my brother didn't
have the athletic, uh...

919
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,371
prowess that I had.

920
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,938
And when he went
to catch the ball

921
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,625
his fingers were all
stiff and it kind...

922
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:34,073
hit his fingers and stubbed him.

923
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:35,857
So he reached in his pocket

924
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,380
and pulled out something shiny

925
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:40,577
and threw it at me,
and I didn't know what it was.

926
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,168
I'm waiting, no I'm down
on the ground

927
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,015
I see the shiny thing.
I move, it was a knife

928
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,173
that stuck right in the ground,
right where I was.

929
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,237
And that's not the first time
that he did something like that.

930
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,621
He tried killing me
a lot of times.

931
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:51,264
A lot of times!

932
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,051
There's a lot of history
between my brothers.

933
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,228
Sibling rivalry, Cain and Abel

934
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:00,475
whatever you want to call it.

935
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:02,991
I remember
when I was a little girl

936
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,930
and I was upstairs in our attic.

937
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,803
And I was looking down
at the bottom of the steps

938
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:12,894
and Johnny, Jonah was
at the bottom of the steps

939
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,548
and he kind of motioned

940
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,355
he kind of went like this,
like to be quiet.

941
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:18,683
I remember him taking
a bow and arrow

942
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:20,380
and shooting at up the steps

943
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,558
and Jimmy, who was
in the back part of the attic

944
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:25,777
was sitting there.

945
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:27,735
And I remember him

946
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,192
you know coming out like,
What are you doing?

947
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:32,107
Like you could, you know,
you're going to kill me.

948
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:33,262
And he just started laughing

949
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:34,699
and I'm glad I kept quiet

950
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:37,615
because who knows if he would
have gotten up from that chair

951
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:38,702
what could have happened?

952
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:41,749
This man, isn't a man,
he's a monster.

953
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,141
He's not a brother.

954
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,171
He's not a brother
to anybody in my family.

955
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:47,905
He hasn't been a good son
to his mom or dad.

956
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,714
His friends are more
important to him.

957
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:53,108
His friends as a community,
on the internet and everything

958
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:55,502
the image that he
portrays as Jonah.

959
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,939
There's John and there's Jonah.

960
00:43:58,244 --> 00:43:59,332
John is a good person.

961
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:02,050
My brother John, as I knew
him as a kid

962
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,354
before he became
into this Jonah.

963
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,770
John was a very honest
and good person.

964
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:08,384
Jonah is a conceited

965
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:13,172
deceitful, narcissistic rat

966
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,175
that I wouldn't trust
as far as I could throw him.

967
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:19,178
I call him Johnny
because I like John, you know.

968
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,746
Johnny's my brother that,
you know...

969
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,096
And Jonah is somebody
that I feel like

970
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,446
he's more or less he
named himself.

971
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,883
Yeah. I know
his real name, but he's Jonah.

972
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,538
Everybody that knows him
and jams with him, he's Jonah.

973
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,280
Uh, yeah, that was kind of a...

974
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,326
a weird transformation,
actually to me.

975
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,200
And the next thing I know
he's going, "call me Jonah."

976
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:43,471
I can't explain that.
That just happened to him.

977
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,899
They started calling him that

978
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,814
one weekend down
at the playground.

979
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,229
And uh, it just stuck with him.

980
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,211
Ever since then,
he was just Jonah.

981
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:54,138
He had totally you know,
gone away from Johnny.

982
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:56,345
Unique name for a
unique character. Yeah.

983
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:58,565
Um, well, if I go back
to elementary school

984
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:01,916
I mean
I don't think I was ever normal.

985
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:06,442
I don't know it was a normal
growing up period or not.

986
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,144
I've always kind of done
my own thing

987
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,576
and heard a different drummer

988
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:11,796
and probably more situations,
you know

989
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:14,886
even in high school where
people just didn't accept me.

990
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:17,497
Fraternities, drama club

991
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:19,934
sports, uh... whatever.

992
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,588
The honor roll society.

993
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,795
I just don't give a
shit about this stuff.

994
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:26,438
He and his best friend
were Romulus and Remus.

995
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:27,462
And they were Gothic.

996
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:31,250
I mean, back then, back in
the '60s it was unheard of.

997
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:33,339
They always wore black, you know

998
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:36,255
they just were more
into being the outsiders.

999
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,866
They wore the black
t-shirts, black jeans

1000
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:41,564
black shoes, every day, all day.

1001
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,524
All the time
with holes in the shirts.

1002
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,526
That's all they wore.
No showers.

1003
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:49,181
People, you know,
gave them a wide margin

1004
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:50,419
and they didn't understand them.

1005
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:51,879
But they were great people.

1006
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,162
Prayed to the devil.
Good athletes.

1007
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,226
Just stayed to themselves.

1008
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:57,363
He used to call out

1009
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,557
demons names and stuff
when we were kids.

1010
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,105
I remember he did that one night

1011
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,822
and the door slam shut
during a rainstorm.

1012
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,246
It scared the living
shit out of me.

1013
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:05,739
It scared the shit out of me.
I'm telling you the

1014
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,025
God's honest truth.

1015
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,417
I mean, Jimmy was...

1016
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:10,985
you know, very good at
you know, football

1017
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:12,746
you know, he was
attractive and had no problem

1018
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,859
you know, getting the dates
and such.

1019
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,427
And Johnny, I think
was a bit jealous of that.

1020
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:22,170
And I don't think that ever
really kind of got resolved.

1021
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:26,653
I think it just escalated
into a lifetime of bad blood.

1022
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:29,874
He, he treated me
differently than everybody else.

1023
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:31,963
He didn't treat me
like a brother.

1024
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,530
He treated me like "You're
the person I've got to beat."

1025
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:36,663
I never really
got along with my brother.

1026
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,883
Um... I don't know why he...

1027
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:42,103
he's, you know,
he's mean spirited about me.

1028
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,844
I don't know if he's jealous

1029
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:46,325
or he feels that I'm
downplaying him or whatever.

1030
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:48,196
I often think to myself,
you know

1031
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,677
if I had somebody like me
for an older brother,

1032
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,810
would it be the coolest
thing in the world

1033
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:55,005
or would I have somebody that
Id have to try to live up to

1034
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,031
and I could never do.
I don't know.

1035
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,642
When he found out that he
wasnt getting any attention

1036
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,168
he changed.

1037
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,605
You know,
three days after Jonah turned 18

1038
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:06,692
he enlisted in the army.

1039
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:11,176
So I think he was doing what
he wanted to do just to get out.

1040
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:15,702
It was August 21st, 1971.

1041
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:19,706
And I remember it very well,
I was about 12.

1042
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,015
So it was...
it was very traumatic

1043
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,452
especially for my mother.

1044
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:28,256
I remember my mother
crying herself to sleep

1045
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,411
that night when he left.

1046
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:31,849
Happy Memorial Day, everybody.

1047
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:32,936
Happy Memorial Day.

1048
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,132
So, could you tell us
what you're wearing.

1049
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:36,716
Oh, I just thought
I'll wear some, um...

1050
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,117
quasi green military
kind of stuff

1051
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:41,554
to honor all of our veterans

1052
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:44,122
who have passed away
making the ultimate sacrifice.

1053
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:48,213
And uh... I thought that
since I'm a warrior myself

1054
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:50,128
that it would just be
very apropos

1055
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:52,130
to sit in front of
my castle here

1056
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:54,784
and have a nice drink
out of my skull mug

1057
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,395
of whatever I'm drinking.

1058
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,614
I'll let you figure that out.

1059
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,014
You want fast action?

1060
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,493
Outdoor action?

1061
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:11,627
Real man-sized action?

1062
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,369
Well, here's action that
tops them all

1063
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:17,068
in the combat branches
of today's army.

1064
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:19,070
Well, Jonah spoke to me

1065
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:21,550
about his years
in the service in Vietnam.

1066
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:25,380
Not a lot. He doesn't
go into a lot of detail.

1067
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,556
Well he was in Special Forces.

1068
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:28,751
You know, from what I understand

1069
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,646
he was in special operations

1070
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:34,563
and basically they would just
drop him alone in the jungle

1071
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,131
and he would go carry out
some mission.

1072
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:39,438
I did stuff that was
classified, and you know

1073
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:41,565
I just don't need any of that
come back to haunt me.

1074
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:46,122
But I don't like to think about some
of the stuff that happened then.

1075
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:48,162
I had a war movie on,
I think 'Saving Private Ryan'.

1076
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:49,728
He's like, "Yeah, I was hearing
all the gunfire and stuff"

1077
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:51,556
and they were kind of
giving him flashbacks there

1078
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,367
"from listening to all the
bullets and stuff flying by."

1079
00:48:56,368 --> 00:48:59,327
I got out of the service
August 21st, 1974

1080
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,329
three days after my
21st birthday.

1081
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,030
I don't know that I
really had a plan

1082
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:04,637
when I got out of the service.

1083
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,335
My plan was just to, you know

1084
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,294
let my hair grow and...

1085
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,036
definitely not being
told what to do.

1086
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,605
To this day, I don't like
taking orders.

1087
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:22,133
I don't care if it's a wife,
a boss, I don't take orders.

1088
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:23,786
You can give me a suggestion

1089
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,311
you can ask me nice
to do you a favor

1090
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:27,616
but Im not your dog.

1091
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,618
And I will not be anybodys dog.

1092
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,056
The establishment or
anybody else.

1093
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:35,581
You know youre in
for a fight, for sure.

1094
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:38,497
I mind my own business

1095
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,673
and I respect other
people's property

1096
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,632
and their pets, and their kids
and everything else like that.

1097
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,999
I'd probably be the first one
to step right up

1098
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:52,327
if I saw somebody trying to rape a girl
or kidnap a kid or something like that.

1099
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,426
Shooter ready?
Yep.

1100
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:55,644
Standby!

1101
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:58,517
It's all lies.

1102
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:09,832
Whoa! Easy does it.

1103
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:15,403
Rack it. Just rack it.
Rack the slide. Rack the slide.

1104
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:22,410
Whoa, tripped on a log.

1105
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,195
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

1106
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:28,199
Im stuck in the wood
or something.

1107
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:32,422
Thats what happens
when you miss the whole target.

1108
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:34,378
Stuck behind here.

1109
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,075
Oh, man!

1110
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:40,298
He was never in Vietnam.

1111
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:42,691
He was in Germany selling hash
and doing acid.

1112
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,347
In Ansbach, Germany.

1113
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,306
He was never in Vietnam.

1114
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:50,632
He was not in ning bang dang
or whatever all that crap was

1115
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:53,311
and I've got all the paperwork
right down here to prove it.

1116
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:54,703
It was off an internet site.

1117
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,227
I really don't know.

1118
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,665
I don't have information about
when, you know

1119
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:02,472
the specifics of when he was in the
army, other than when he was um...

1120
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,583
You know, in Europe.

1121
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:09,032
I know he was in Germany and I
know he went through Fort Dix.

1122
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,958
But other than that, I really
don't have that information.

1123
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:14,798
If you are going, if you're
doing any covert operations

1124
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,453
if you were like in a train,
you'd be in a sealed car.

1125
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:20,270
They didn't want you to see
where you were going

1126
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,374
they didn't want anybody else
to know you were there.

1127
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:24,361
You did whatever you had to do
and you came back.

1128
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,474
I, I've never known Jonah

1129
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,782
to exaggerate anything that he
says he has done or can do... ever.

1130
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:35,179
He tells you he can do it or has done it,
I think you can pretty much believe it.

1131
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,834
They would intercept your mail that
you got and read it before you read it.

1132
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,517
We used to send cassettes
back and forth to each other.

1133
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:44,449
We at that time, we had a
relationship where we could talk.

1134
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,949
And we actually kind of missed
each other at that point in time

1135
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:49,628
because that's probably
the first time in our lives

1136
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,456
that we were ever
really separated.

1137
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:55,175
So a lot of times, I might
have been in one location

1138
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,915
and they may have actually
forged a letter from me

1139
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:58,463
to say I was someplace else.

1140
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:02,254
He wants to be somebody
that nobody else is like.

1141
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,643
You know, he wants to, that's
more important to him than family.

1142
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,623
It's more important than going
and visiting your dying mother

1143
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,344
or helping your father
up the stairs.

1144
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:12,303
The family has turned
their back on him

1145
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,566
because he's turned his back
on the family.

1146
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:17,656
He had 10 years to go up
and see my mother.

1147
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:19,875
He showed up there
for her funeral

1148
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,050
10 years later.

1149
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:23,705
Where the hell were you?

1150
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,318
Where were you?
Your mother's dying.

1151
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,146
Where are you? Nowhere.

1152
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,300
I was there all the time
when I had the job for Suburban.

1153
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:36,216
I was in the vehicle during the
day, I'd stop and visit her.

1154
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,893
I even took the dog there.
My dog Tonru.

1155
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,480
We went into the elevator and
freaked everybody out, you know.

1156
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,201
I got permission, I had to
sign a thing

1157
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:43,248
the dog could come
to the freaking home, you know.

1158
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,959
But my mom had Alzheimer's.
She didn't recognize me anyway.

1159
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,838
You go there to visit somebody that
can't feed themselves and all this.

1160
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,942
Its very sad to watch somebody
deteriorate like that.

1161
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,669
It's harder on the family than it is
on the person that's got the disease.

1162
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:55,781
That's not a hero to me.

1163
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,176
It's like
if you're in the woods and...

1164
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,783
And you, you got your arm pinned
under a tree, you got to decide

1165
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:05,356
do I stay here and freeze to death,
or I cut my own arm off to get away?

1166
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,000
Because nobody's going
to come rescue me.

1167
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:11,405
So you either die
or you amputate yourself.

1168
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:14,756
And it's one of those things
where I've got to take care of me

1169
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:17,759
so that I can take care of
people in the future, you know?

1170
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,979
He's filled to the
brim with hate

1171
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:24,505
and jealousy, and
sibling rivalry

1172
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,638
and it showed up at the wake.

1173
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:28,581
When he went to shake my hand

1174
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,096
that was for a show in
front of everybody

1175
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,200
almost to make me look bad.

1176
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,601
I just looked right through him.
Never said a word.

1177
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,030
Some people thought that
was wrong of me.

1178
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:42,236
To me, it was one of the most
wonderful points in my life.

1179
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,879
You know, there were other
challenges growing up that...

1180
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,708
You know, I, I probably wouldn't
get into but let's just say

1181
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:56,668
we, you know, we had some
challenges growing up as a family.

1182
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,323
Mrs. Washnis?
Mrs. Washnis: Yes?

1183
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,021
Mom kept her family together.
She took no shit from my father.

1184
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:04,451
She might have been a
small little woman

1185
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:06,591
but she took no shit from dad.

1186
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:09,768
I'll tell you what, mom was,
mom would stand her ground.

1187
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,903
Dad would drink a half a gallon of
whiskey and four cases of beer a week.

1188
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,777
It was very difficult growing up in the
house with an alcoholic for a father.

1189
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:21,649
And my father was a big man
he's 6"3 and 230

1190
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:25,610
so that was a little imposing and
intimidating to you know, young kids.

1191
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:28,700
We made a point of not, not
hanging around a lot of times

1192
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:32,834
if he was, if he was there
and running around, you know.

1193
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:36,098
Because he had a, every once while
he'd tip, tip the bottle a little bit

1194
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:40,146
so, I don't know if I should
really say that but he did and

1195
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:45,499
And, and because my brother Jonah
was the oldest he probably, you know,

1196
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,546
he had to deal with it
more than any of us.

1197
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,375
There's something
inside Jonah driving him

1198
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,507
Umm...

1199
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:56,815
because he felt inadequacies
growing up.

1200
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,644
I mean, I mean you
got to remember like...

1201
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:01,345
You know, if you're growing
up in a...

1202
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,169
In a, in a pseudo dysfunctional
household

1203
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:05,998
and you're having, you know,
you're looking for role models

1204
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:09,088
I can't think of any better
role models than superheroes

1205
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:12,091
Zorro, Superman, Robin Hood.

1206
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,659
I mean, you're looking at people
who have abilities

1207
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,878
and they're helping
other people.

1208
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,185
They're not asking
for anything in return.

1209
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:22,667
You've got a faction that
is suppressing

1210
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:28,412
I don't care if they're the
peasants, or serfs, or regular people

1211
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:31,850
or they're criminals going after
victims or the rapists or whatever

1212
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:35,897
you've got somebody willing
to stand up against them

1213
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:39,423
and not expecting
any remuneration in return.

1214
00:55:40,162 --> 00:55:41,686
I don't even care if I
get a thank you.

1215
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:45,211
It's not about that.
It's just about me being me.

1216
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,126
If I can help somebody
out, fine.

1217
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,453
I think of myself
as the quintessential warrior.

1218
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,277
I mean, I got this tattoo
on my 38th birthday.

1219
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,509
And I got it in my right arm
because it's my sword arm.

1220
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,851
Which is from an album cover of
the 'Warrior on The Edge of Time'

1221
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,704
a psychedelic group from Britain
called Hawkwind which I really like.

1222
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:06,798
I think we get a lot of
our creativity from my father.

1223
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:10,062
I went to school to be
a video artist.

1224
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:12,891
My sister actually

1225
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:15,807
has a pretty incredible singing voice
that a lot of people don't know.

1226
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:18,026
And now Jimmy's
learning keyboard.

1227
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,163
My father actually even
wrote a book.

1228
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:24,468
It's called 'The Ballbreaker'.

1229
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:29,081
So anyhow, my wife is at
the hospital giving birth to Kathy

1230
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,475
and I got this shot at
babysitting again.

1231
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:33,868
And I had to change
Karen's diaper

1232
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,610
but I was afraid of doing it
after that experience with Jim.

1233
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,526
So I didn't change her diaper
for three days

1234
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,659
so she got back from
the hospital.

1235
00:56:41,746 --> 00:56:45,227
When she was coming home, Karen
was getting a little raunchy.

1236
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:47,839
So I gave her this putty knife,
I said

1237
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:50,581
"Go in the toilet scrape yourself
up before your mother gets home."

1238
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:54,802
And I don't know whether the putty knife
disintegrated or what happened to it

1239
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,675
but I never saw it again
and I want it back.

1240
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,787
I remember he made a...
it is a big deal

1241
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:25,659
I mean, he made a big deal that
he had written a book and...

1242
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,532
That I had to go buy it.

1243
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,621
And I believe Ive probably
got it here someplace.

1244
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,624
But whether I actually read the
whole thing I don't think I did.

1245
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:39,325
That's the exploits of his
father growing up in Pennsylvania

1246
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:41,327
in a coal mining town.

1247
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:46,308
Different situations, and then he's
going into the military from there.

1248
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,203
His father's got like a
whole chapter

1249
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,163
on having anal sex with
this lady that he picked up.

1250
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:55,994
I served with the seventh
Infantry Division in the Pacific

1251
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,867
back in 1945 and 1946.

1252
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:05,003
And that I believe is what
inspired me to write this story.

1253
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,876
But this is not a war story,
not at all.

1254
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:11,531
I mention my military service

1255
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:16,718
only to lend credence to some of the
events that take place in this story.

1256
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:21,367
My dad sent him $50 for his birthday,
he sent it back, return to sender.

1257
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,023
My sister Kathy calls him
he doesn't return any calls.

1258
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,678
My sister Karen calls him
he doesn't return any calls.

1259
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:30,156
And I certainly don't want
anything to do with him.

1260
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,856
I don't want to be
a burden to anybody

1261
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:34,748
I don't want to be around
people that don't like me.

1262
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:35,812
It doesn't make any sense.

1263
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,166
I don't want to go to a party

1264
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:39,883
where everybody's going to
say bad things about me.

1265
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:40,952
I know the way he thinks.

1266
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,128
And I know the way he thinks

1267
00:58:43,215 --> 00:58:45,575
probably better than anybody
does because I grew up with him.

1268
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,804
I grew up in that same house with
him, with that alcoholic father

1269
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,588
and my mother
who kept their family together.

1270
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:51,745
You know, I grew up in
that house.

1271
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,879
It's, I, I know it sounds weird

1272
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,248
and I probably, people are going to look
at this and say, "This guy's crazy,"

1273
00:58:57,272 --> 00:58:59,710
but I miss the dog
more than I miss my mom.

1274
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,799
I didn't see my mom every day.

1275
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:04,062
When I was a kid I saw my mom
every day.

1276
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:05,933
But the dog is my kid.

1277
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:10,721
I got my dog Tonru, I got him
from a breeder out in Nevada.

1278
00:59:10,808 --> 00:59:12,592
That's right, Nevada

1279
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,352
The name that I got for
the dog which is Tonru

1280
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:16,378
I got it from an old
Star Trek episode.

1281
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:21,993
It goes...
I am Tonru. I am the other.

1282
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,343
I thought, well,
I'm one and Tonru is the other.

1283
00:59:24,778 --> 00:59:26,127
I named him Tonru.

1284
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:30,064
Who do you think uh,
would be a better Captain Kirk?

1285
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,088
Oh, I'd be Captain Kirk.

1286
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:34,938
Well, I'm sure my brother
would want to be Captain Kirk.

1287
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,636
The kids in high school
called me Captain Kirk.

1288
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,100
They signed my yearbook
Captain Kirk.

1289
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:41,104
He did tend to be a
leader being the quarterback.

1290
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:43,054
So I guess if you looked
at it that way

1291
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,691
you would say he'd make
a good Captain Kirk.

1292
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:49,237
I mean, Jim had a, an excellent
Captain Kirk imitation.

1293
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:53,938
Jonah'd be a Klingon.

1294
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,157
Jonah would be a Klingon.

1295
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:58,551
I'd probably
be like a Klingon, you know.

1296
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:01,075
Definitely rebellious.
Definitely evil

1297
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:03,576
There is something cool about
being the bad guy, you know.

1298
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,276
And definitely wanting people to
believe in his theories... Oh, yeah.

1299
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,781
Where as Jonah
would be good as far as...

1300
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:14,698
If he was in command of a, a group of
people like when we did the photographs.

1301
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:18,005
And there he is,
the man himself.

1302
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:22,967
But I can see Jonah
in that position.

1303
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:27,101
Yes, uh, pursuing some hostiles
through space.

1304
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,235
That's a toss up.
That's a toss up.

1305
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,718
Its the cali... genetic caliber of
the, of those, from that family.

1306
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,393
His father's a great man and...

1307
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:41,463
His mother was just a,
just a wonderful person.

1308
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:42,943
And, uh...

1309
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:47,222
The genetic stock of the
Lithuanian-Italian, they're just...

1310
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,342
Invincible, invincible.

1311
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:54,868
I remember as a younger teenager,
he wasn't into physical fitness.

1312
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:59,220
He was a real thin,
uh just regular kid.

1313
01:00:59,568 --> 01:01:00,568
And then I...

1314
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:03,418
I started working out
and I started developing

1315
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,792
I had these big forearms
and he liked that.

1316
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,359
And then he went
into the service.

1317
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:09,274
He went into Germany

1318
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,645
he had talked with his parents
about what his future would be

1319
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,019
and they figured that'd be
a good, a good move for him.

1320
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:18,955
We didn't know anybody that was
going in the military at that time.

1321
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,851
In our age group,
nobody volunteered.

1322
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:24,506
There was a draft that was
going on, but he volunteered.

1323
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:26,944
So, if you're
for fast action,

1324
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:28,554
if you're an action kind of guy

1325
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:31,252
take a long strong look at
today's army.

1326
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:35,169
What's the next step? Into
your army recruiter's office.

1327
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,650
But while he was in the service

1328
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:40,087
he was big time into
weightlifting and working out

1329
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:41,915
and he'd walk all over Europe.

1330
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,178
So when he came back,
he was a transformed...

1331
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:48,008
You know, from a little
kid to this big muscle-bound

1332
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,010
you know, what you're
seeing now basically.

1333
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,633
When he came back from the army,
he was definitely different.

1334
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:58,540
He was much more outgoing than the
person I remember when he left.

1335
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:00,847
Jonah... Jonah...
Jonah... Jonah...

1336
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:05,069
Used to do a lot of uh chemical
enhancement back in the day too.

1337
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:09,813
Enhanced his performance
with mind-altering stuff.

1338
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:14,426
I got into the drug stuff
when I was in the military.

1339
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,343
And when I got out I stayed with
it probably for about 10 years.

1340
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:21,999
I was doing stuff. And then again, you
know, I'm like Mr. Abuse, you know.

1341
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:24,436
You know, let's see how
much you can do.

1342
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:28,527
I didn't, uh, ever do anything like
that with him to be honest with you.

1343
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:31,269
So that apparently was with,
with Mr. Chips.

1344
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,968
Oh, that's Mr. Chips.

1345
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:37,057
This guy with the beard.

1346
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:38,144
Yeah.
That's-thats Chips.

1347
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,932
That's Chips, that's my
buddy Dan, that's Ferg.

1348
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,456
Dan was the best man at my
brother's first wedding.

1349
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:46,390
Ferg was the best man
at my brother's second wedding.

1350
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,590
He accused both of them
of sleeping with his wives.

1351
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,289
And that's my brother
with crutches on him.

1352
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:56,120
We were all, uh, unmarried, and,
uh, just, uh, a very lively place.

1353
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,383
Just the music and
the laughs and...

1354
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:03,257
A good core group of people. It
was like a haven of adolescence.

1355
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:05,477
Just stop by Avis St.
To see whats going on.

1356
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:08,001
And it was always somebody
making something to eat

1357
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:11,657
or making a strange piece of art
or playing music or something.

1358
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,661
The whole sense of the whole
group was trust each one

1359
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:17,532
could totally rely on the other.

1360
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,969
And Jonah was the core.

1361
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:23,872
He was the, he was the heart, the
heartbeat of the Avis Street, yes.

1362
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:28,543
We partied a lot
together, you know...

1363
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:31,834
He always had to do more
than anybody else.

1364
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:37,422
My brother would roll big fat
joints, he called them Jonah joints.

1365
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,382
And we were smoking,
uh, Jonah joints

1366
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:46,997
which were
small telephone poles, you know.

1367
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:52,567
From what I understand they were
quite thick like a-like a tornado

1368
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,569
if you can picture that.

1369
01:03:55,701 --> 01:03:57,703
Whirlwinds of sensations, yes.

1370
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:02,490
You put this much pot
in a joint and you take a hit,

1371
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:06,059
and you're, youre burning it all
into the air and just wasting it.

1372
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:09,193
But he did it because it was
bigger than anybody else's

1373
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:11,195
like his dog was bigger
than anybody else's

1374
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,284
like his gun was bigger
than anybody else's.

1375
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:15,503
That's what he's all about.

1376
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,787
Making sure it's bigger
than anybody else's.

1377
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:20,813
Jonah did extensive drugs.

1378
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,598
He did Angel Dust, he did heroin,
he didn't do much cocaine.

1379
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:26,229
I never really liked doing
cocaine or anything like that.

1380
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:28,013
I mean anything that
would drain down my nose

1381
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,278
and make me, make it harder for me to
breathe when I was playing the harmonica.

1382
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:32,342
I just didn't care for it.

1383
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,306
It was an expensive drug and it,
didn't, didn't last very long.

1384
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,938
Meanwhile, you know I could
spend like a little bit of money

1385
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,722
on a pill about this big and
be high for 18 hours, you know.

1386
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:43,357
I didn't feel full,
I just had a great time.

1387
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,446
We did a lot of
partying back then.

1388
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:47,971
We smoked a lot of weed

1389
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,905
but I think more than anything
Jonah did a lot of acid.

1390
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:52,366
I'd do, five hits of acid.

1391
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:56,762
Not one, he would eat five;
five hits of blotter at once.

1392
01:04:57,632 --> 01:04:59,243
And Id see what I could
do, you know

1393
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,549
kickbox or go see the ACDC
or something like that.

1394
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,336
But there wasn't anything I did.

1395
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:08,992
So I-I-I don't know when they did
it, how they did it or anything.

1396
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:11,559
I had nothing to do with that.

1397
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,670
Kathy Hayes: To me, for someone to do
six hits of acid and you can't even tell

1398
01:05:15,694 --> 01:05:17,087
I was amazed.

1399
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:18,455
I remember
I was in a band with Tim.

1400
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:20,220
Called Cruise Control.

1401
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,067
Back in 1982,
and we were on our way to a gig

1402
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,007
at a bar called the
Orange Monkey.

1403
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:25,704
And it was snowing outside.

1404
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,960
And I didn't know how to
get to the bar.

1405
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,697
And I always figured, "let's
see if I drop the acid now

1406
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:34,191
and in about a half an hour
it'll hit me

1407
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:36,478
and Ill have just enough time
to get to the bar", right?

1408
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:39,370
It hit me before I got to the
bar and there was a blizzard.

1409
01:05:39,457 --> 01:05:41,826
And I got this wild costume on and
my face is all flushed, and you know

1410
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,418
I'm watching the snowflakes melt
on the windshield and I go,

1411
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:47,528
"Oh man, it's getting really hard to see
between the lines on the road", you know.

1412
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:48,921
And then I stopped to ask
directions, you know.

1413
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,729
And Im this wild eyed crazy guy

1414
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,976
dressed up like a freaking
renegade Indian, you know...

1415
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,623
I had a feather and I wore like
a black headband to keep that

1416
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:57,344
because that was before
contact lenses.

1417
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,303
I wore my glasses
and everything.

1418
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,045
My hair was longer and I had
like a Ted Nugent belt I made.

1419
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:05,222
You know, I had like fox tails,
raccoon tails and bear claws.

1420
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:08,442
I had buck skin boots on and I just
came in and played the harmonica

1421
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,705
like Jimi Hendrix would,
would do with the guitar.

1422
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,317
He's a terrific harmonica
player. Bar none.

1423
01:06:13,404 --> 01:06:15,324
Probably hes maybe the best
I've ever even heard.

1424
01:06:15,623 --> 01:06:17,904
But he puts a little bit too
much into a bridge instrument.

1425
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:21,542
Hed be, you know,
literally laying on his back

1426
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:24,458
and flipping around on stage
while he was playing harmonica

1427
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:27,418
and he just had, you know,
endless energy.

1428
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,898
He started his act in a cage.

1429
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,640
He was wearing a Wolverine outfit,
you couldn't tell he was a human.

1430
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:35,556
And came out of the cage
playing harmonica

1431
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:37,689
and it terrified people in
the audience.

1432
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:42,694
It was, it was just a great act.

1433
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,262
We don't well,
know him well enough to know

1434
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:48,613
that all his highs might
be natural highs or...

1435
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,007
You know... Assisted highs.

1436
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,810
You know something, I don't,
I don't, I really don't believe

1437
01:06:52,834 --> 01:06:54,514
- Jonah would do drugs.
- Jackie Kasperson:

1438
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,882
I don't think
so. He's, he's too natural.

1439
01:06:57,578 --> 01:06:59,711
Maybe I'm-maybe I'm wrong

1440
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,198
but he's got that natural energy.
I don't know if he needs it.

1441
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:05,171
And I realized that I was
burning the candle on both ends.

1442
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:06,737
I just said, Look,
I gotta make a choice.

1443
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:07,956
Do I want to go this route
or this route?

1444
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,416
And I just dropped the
other thing.

1445
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,943
And I did, completely
just like that.

1446
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,353
People that saw me party couldn't
believe I just didn't want to.

1447
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:14,777
Theyd go-theyd go to
hand me a joint

1448
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:17,835
and Id say, No, I don't do that anymore.
I just don't want to do it, you know.

1449
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:19,019
It was just that easy for me.

1450
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:21,077
Jonah hasn't done
drugs in a long time.

1451
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,562
He's probably extremely
physically healthy person.

1452
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:26,844
I mean, health wise, he's probably
extremely physically healthy

1453
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:28,455
except for mentally.
Mentally, he's delusionary.

1454
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:29,610
But I have a strong mind.

1455
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:33,478
You have to have a strong mind
to be able to say no.

1456
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:38,576
Im going to get my,
a refill here.

1457
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:42,188
Having my cranberry
juice and rum.

1458
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,148
That's my normal Saturday
if I don't have any place to go.

1459
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:48,038
That's what I do. I just like
to make some cheeseburgers...

1460
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:52,546
A little sliced red onion,
little...

1461
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:55,897
Little uh, based in
Worcestershire sauce

1462
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:58,465
with a little, just a
hint of fresh garlic.

1463
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:03,340
They're good.

1464
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:17,310
It doesn't take long
if you preheat the bun.

1465
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:28,843
Messy part of the video.

1466
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:56,610
It was a great honor to film
Jonah and Annas wedding.

1467
01:08:57,089 --> 01:09:01,398
Well, the first part of the video
was, was a montage that I created.

1468
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:06,403
I took little bits of video of
Anna's preparation for the wedding

1469
01:09:07,665 --> 01:09:09,536
and the audio was terrible.

1470
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:12,278
It was all people talking and,
you know, it was in a hair salon

1471
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,759
there was all kinds
of distracting stuff going on.

1472
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:19,677
And I-I couldn't think of a good way
to present this as part of the video

1473
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:22,245
and not have it be terrible
to listen to.

1474
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:28,642
So I deleted the audio track and just
put in Jonah's music in the background

1475
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:32,342
and then I, once I started
doing that and blending scenes

1476
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:35,954
I actually figured, while she's
probably thinking a lot about Jonah

1477
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:39,958
while she's preparing for a wedding so why
not put a few things of Jonah in there too

1478
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:43,527
just to kind of show the
flow of thinking

1479
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:45,703
and, and you know, try to
get the mood.

1480
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,271
And I thought it came out great.

1481
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,408
I gave your bag to, to him.
Okay.

1482
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:56,714
Stay right there, now.

1483
01:09:58,716 --> 01:10:01,414
Oh...

1484
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:04,809
They are all watching...

1485
01:10:06,854 --> 01:10:08,856
I can't now speak.

1486
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:29,007
He had met, uh,
a young lady in the Soviet Union

1487
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:32,750
and, uh, carried on a relationship
with her long distance at first.

1488
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,448
He met Anna online.

1489
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:38,582
It was, I believe, russianbrides.com
or something like that on the internet.

1490
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:39,887
Jonah...

1491
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:43,326
Found Anna on the internet.

1492
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:46,373
They corresponded for a long time on
the internet before anything happened...

1493
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,853
And so then, then he told me
he was saving up his money.

1494
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,857
He was actually going to go to Russia
and get her and bring her here.

1495
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:56,817
He started writing her and she was writing
him and of course, they had never met.

1496
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:59,516
So I thought that was a little,
little odd

1497
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,866
but being a friend, I supported
him with it, you know.

1498
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:03,757
I'm not going to tell him,
"don't do it", you know

1499
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:05,454
"It's not going to ever work"
or anything like that.

1500
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:06,610
I never thought that way.

1501
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,591
So and he went over there and...

1502
01:11:10,614 --> 01:11:13,443
met his, met her family and,
and spent quite a bit of money.

1503
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,793
You have to pay their
government, our government

1504
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,143
this, that, the other thing,
all these forms...

1505
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,799
Uh, was she going to be a citizen?
This, that, the other thing

1506
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:24,062
and he had to pay
a ton of money to do this.

1507
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,586
He bought her
a beautiful Emerald ring.

1508
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:31,461
And, uh, and she...

1509
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,986
It all came... to fruition.

1510
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:38,903
I mean, he brought her
home and married her.

1511
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:41,993
I was, I was maid of honor.

1512
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:54,266
And they lived together for,
you know, down in Dansville

1513
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:57,530
they did wind up moving to Dansville
and which I was sorry he did that

1514
01:11:57,617 --> 01:12:00,011
because I-I didn't get
to see him as often.

1515
01:12:00,577 --> 01:12:04,494
And I, and I think a lot of his friends,
we didn't really get to see him as often.

1516
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:05,798
And, um...

1517
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:10,432
And that, and that was it. I-I would
see him, you know, off and on and...

1518
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:13,633
You know, as it got later and later
I-I wouldn't see him quite as much.

1519
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,810
No, no,
I was-I was ecstatic for him.

1520
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,770
He was, he was happy
and I was happy for him.

1521
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:21,641
I just missed him.

1522
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:25,226
This whole hallway
was like the night gallery.

1523
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:27,971
I had 22 by 30 posters of a lot of
the pictures you've seen on MySpace

1524
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:29,780
which were my Christmas
card pictures.

1525
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,697
And they adorned both of
these walls all the way down.

1526
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,700
This was the room
that my wife used to use.

1527
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,137
I had an old, I still
have, its in storage.

1528
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:42,140
An old organ, you know, they
used to play church music on it.

1529
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:44,969
And I was trying to learn how to
play "In A Gadda Da Vida", you know.

1530
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,382
So you could see where all
the water damage had happened.

1531
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:49,756
Pieces of plaster would
be falling.

1532
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:52,803
And I started feeling really bad about
all that, you know, because it was...

1533
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:56,154
It was just uh, you know,
one of those things.

1534
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:58,722
Things were happening faster
than I could deal with them.

1535
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,115
Uh, I'd been working
and then I got laid off.

1536
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:05,182
And then, you know, you start dipping
into your 401k and your bank account

1537
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:06,966
pretty soon there's
nothing left to dip into.

1538
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:09,210
And not really living
beyond my means either.

1539
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:11,822
Just trying to eat and
keep the heat on...

1540
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:14,825
And, you know, there was a week
we, it was like 10 degrees outside

1541
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:15,912
and we had no heat.

1542
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:18,979
We had these little space heaters.
We moved from room to room

1543
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:20,083
and I know, I - I finally...

1544
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:23,616
Because I was going through
some hard times and stuff

1545
01:13:23,703 --> 01:13:26,924
I never thought I'd go through the heat
thing for, um, gas electric benefits

1546
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,883
and food stamps, you know,
you know, all that stuff

1547
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:32,079
you know, getting free
baked goods from the church.

1548
01:13:32,103 --> 01:13:33,844
I mean everything I
could to keep us going.

1549
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:39,502
I would also like to
just say that Id like to...

1550
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:42,679
Promise to Annas mother
and her sister

1551
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:45,725
that I would do my best
to try to take care of her

1552
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:48,902
and be a good husband
and maybe a father someday.

1553
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:52,645
And do my best to just be the best
person I can for her in her life.

1554
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:19,280
Sword cane.

1555
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:24,261
I remember when I was in rehab for my
knee, the guy at the rehab place loved me.

1556
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:26,394
He goes, You know, this guy's done.
He's coming here to work out every day.

1557
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:28,440
You know, he's, you know,
he's gotten his leg good again

1558
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,137
and he's using all the weights
and everything.

1559
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:31,441
So they finally stopped
doing it.

1560
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,664
But I-they loved me because I had
sword canes and stuff, you know.

1561
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:37,168
You could fence, right?
Yeah.

1562
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:39,475
Could you show us a couple
moves with that?

1563
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,148
Well, I mean, look, you know,
I mean we-we did fencing stuff.

1564
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,212
I did stuff like that,
but, you know, a lot of it...

1565
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,945
It's hard without somebody else
actually fencing with you, you know.

1566
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:49,025
You get a lot of parries
and thrusts and stuff like that.

1567
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:50,374
But, you know, it's not a lot
of the hack and slash stuff

1568
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:52,183
you see in the Conan movies,
you know.

1569
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:54,011
A lot of it is real, just,
you know

1570
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:58,163
tipping somebody that way
so you can jab at him, you know.

1571
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:00,994
They were made for stabbing,
they weren't made for slashing.

1572
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,218
They werent made for slashing.

1573
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:05,825
This is what my buddy Tim
Baxter was holding under his arm

1574
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:08,329
when he was, uh, Little John for
the Robin Hood thing, you know.

1575
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:11,961
Actually found this too when I
was working on the garbage truck.

1576
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:14,137
Somebody was throwing it out. I just
thought it was cool and brought it home.

1577
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:17,164
Leave it in the room...
But it's for real.

1578
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:21,362
I would get on the writing step
and grab one of the handles.

1579
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:23,277
And I used to do pull ups
when we're going down the road

1580
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,998
at 60 miles an hour, you know.

1581
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:26,889
And I'd stick my foot
in the mouth of the barrel

1582
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:29,176
because the barrel to
the passenger side

1583
01:15:29,263 --> 01:15:31,178
if you hit a bump
and it rolled off the curb

1584
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,050
it's going to roll up
in somebody's lawn.

1585
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,552
The one on the driver's side would roll
in the path of an oncoming vehicle.

1586
01:15:37,576 --> 01:15:39,230
So by me riding on
the drivers side

1587
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:41,157
and standing in it,
it's not going to take off.

1588
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:43,034
The last thing that
I did for him

1589
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,995
I helped move him down to his house
to Dansville and I bought him tickets

1590
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:47,368
to a Blue Oyster Cult concert.

1591
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:51,261
Before he bought the house in Dansville,
he was in a really bad accident.

1592
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,373
We were parked.

1593
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:54,767
Dark blue truck,
bright sunny day.

1594
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:56,900
And they were facing due east.

1595
01:15:57,161 --> 01:15:59,380
So as the sun got to the
top of that hill

1596
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,881
you were totally blind because the
sun was right on the horizon there.

1597
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:03,883
This girl had her visor
down and was doing her makeup

1598
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,126
and she was 19 years old

1599
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:08,322
on her way to the deli department
of the supermarket where she worked.

1600
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:10,324
She's flying down the road
and nobody knew it, you know.

1601
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:11,915
And we just, well
we just stopped

1602
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:13,917
I just threw some trash
in the back of the truck

1603
01:16:14,004 --> 01:16:16,364
and hung my cart on the little
hooks that we had on the back

1604
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:19,096
put my foot in the mouth of the
barrel and my other foot right here

1605
01:16:19,183 --> 01:16:21,074
I just pulled myself up, my partner
was getting ready to move the truck

1606
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:22,684
and all of a sudden
it was like a shark attack.

1607
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,251
And all of a sudden it
was like a shark attack.

1608
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:25,555
She hit the bottom
of the barrel.

1609
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:28,061
She hit the bottom
of that barrel.

1610
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:30,997
Mouth of the barrel hit me in the ass, and
drove my knee into the cast iron tread.

1611
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,370
I spun as high as
the winch cable

1612
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:34,415
came down on the
hood and windshield

1613
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:36,679
and trampolined to the
opposite shoulder of the road.

1614
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:38,561
And I was conscious
the whole time.

1615
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,615
He bumped off the hood of
the car and woke up unconscious.

1616
01:16:43,076 --> 01:16:45,436
When he woke up he was inside
the hospital with a fake knee.

1617
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:46,750
Meanwhile, I'm still
in the road.

1618
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:50,281
So now my partner hears
everything, looks in the rearview

1619
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:52,623
I'm gone and there's a car
where I used to be.

1620
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,934
So now traffic stops and I'm
in the middle of the road.

1621
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,878
My partner thinks I'm dead.
He comes running out.

1622
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:59,765
The girls already out of her car on
the other side of the road crying.

1623
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,109
I'm so sorry.
She's crying, right?

1624
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:04,073
My partner, Mark, comes out of the
car and he goes, Are you alright?

1625
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:05,466
No, I'm not okay. Call
an ambulance, you know.

1626
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,090
I'm thinking,
"I got to get my sandwich."

1627
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:09,494
How am I going to get
to eat my lunch

1628
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:11,254
because if they're gonna operate on
me, they won't let me eat any food.

1629
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:12,865
You know, so I'm trying
to get to my sandwich

1630
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,518
and then goes, He's in shock.
No, I'm not in shock.

1631
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:16,422
I'm in pain, you know,
There's a big difference.

1632
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,392
He doesn't even remember
it because he was unconscious.

1633
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:19,816
And I never got
my fucking sandwich.

1634
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:22,135
He's got a, a knee
that's completely rebuilt

1635
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,248
because the car shattered
his kneecap.

1636
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:26,293
I'm not one to
go running to the doctor.

1637
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,078
Pretty much go to work
with a gunshot wound

1638
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:30,085
unless they make me go to the
hospital, you know.

1639
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,147
So, I have injuries that people
don't know about that I deal with.

1640
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:37,435
Hey Vasca... What?
Youre scared?

1641
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:41,526
Whats the matter?
Whats the matter, huh?

1642
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,897
You want to play with the
happy face man?

1643
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:46,966
You want to play up here?
Come on.

1644
01:17:51,014 --> 01:17:54,365
One of the most relaxing things that
I do is just playing with my cat.

1645
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:57,934
You know, I just need a little
bit of time where I smile.

1646
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:02,155
It's-its just nice to know that
somebody or something cares.

1647
01:18:02,503 --> 01:18:04,070
You know, for whatever reason,
you know.

1648
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,789
The cats really all I've got
left from the house in Dansville

1649
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,704
after the house got foreclosed
and the bank took it.

1650
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:11,968
You know my wife, we went our
separate ways too, you know.

1651
01:18:12,035 --> 01:18:15,038
Financial duress, sometimes
people bail out instead of...

1652
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:17,780
You know, sticking with
the ship, you know.

1653
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:25,439
Well, I had gotten, uh, a lot of, uh,
cards from customers on the garbage route

1654
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:29,028
saying how much they missed me. They
used to call me the designer garbage man.

1655
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:30,618
So this guy just runs
the whole time.

1656
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,317
He's out there and they say
that, after you left

1657
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:35,469
they got a pickup truck and
three other guys to replace you

1658
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:37,060
because nobody could
keep up with you.

1659
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:40,822
And then, you know, I was wearing
a leg brace a donjoy brace

1660
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:42,432
for about 10 years
and I still have a big scar

1661
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,096
where they cut all the
way up my leg here.

1662
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:46,112
My whole right knee
got destroyed.

1663
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:51,335
He sued and got some money from
it and bought an Eagle Talon car.

1664
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:54,904
I ordered it.
I paid cash for it.

1665
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:56,862
I ordered from the dealership.

1666
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:00,083
So I had the, I had great
custom leather bucket seats

1667
01:19:00,344 --> 01:19:03,260
it was a black car,
I had the Jonah1 license plates.

1668
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:05,218
That's the first car
those came on.

1669
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:13,357
You know it had cruise, and air, and
a killer stereo, and turbo charger.

1670
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:17,274
You know. Excuse me.

1671
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:20,277
It was really nice.

1672
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:28,198
He had uh

1673
01:19:28,633 --> 01:19:30,069
An extravagant...

1674
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:33,638
Flair and...

1675
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:36,119
A great imagination.

1676
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:42,038
State. And I, I ended up, uh, being
able to borrow one of the saddles

1677
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,300
Oh excellent.

1678
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:46,607
Yes, we do have
horse trainers in this cart.

1679
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,131
We have everything.

1680
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:51,656
Videos, TV. I hope.

1681
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,485
When I did something

1682
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,530
permitting a lot of
artistic license

1683
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:58,639
that's why the cards turned out
as well as they did.

1684
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:01,057
If I, like I really
went all out.

1685
01:20:01,144 --> 01:20:05,104
When I did the Sinbad one, it, I had
written Sinbad Jedi Knight /Time Traveler.

1686
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,367
That accounts
for the dinosaurs and Sinbad

1687
01:20:07,454 --> 01:20:09,979
having a light saber as well
as a sword.

1688
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,981
And it was a great
combination of things.

1689
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:14,070
I had one girl dressed
up like a pirate

1690
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:16,159
Marisa was dressed
kind of like Xena

1691
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,031
we were traveling through time
battling monsters

1692
01:20:19,118 --> 01:20:21,077
time, space dimensions,
whatever, you know.

1693
01:20:21,338 --> 01:20:23,751
I don't know where he got all
the people to be honest with you.

1694
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:27,039
Some, some he must have just met
at, you know, the corner store

1695
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:30,173
"and said, Do you want to be in my
picture this weekend?" Or something.

1696
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:33,524
Its gonna be a porno film.
I can tell, man. Oh boy.

1697
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,442
It's like, "Oh,
did you get Jonah's new card?"

1698
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:39,965
"Oh, did you get
Jonah's new card?"

1699
01:20:41,706 --> 01:20:43,586
And I used to look at them
and I think to myself

1700
01:20:44,317 --> 01:20:47,190
there's nothing more ridiculous
than a fool busy in a project.

1701
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,148
Occasionally, somebody would say

1702
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:51,195
"this doesn't have anything
to do with Christmas."

1703
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:52,499
And of course, my...

1704
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,349
You know, my response is always, It
has everything to do with Christmas.

1705
01:20:56,373 --> 01:20:57,548
It has to do with giving.

1706
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,946
It has to do with giving without
expectation of reciprocation.

1707
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:03,510
You don't have to say thank you.

1708
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,596
I'm giving it to you
because I want to.

1709
01:21:07,384 --> 01:21:09,212
He just
wants to do things for people

1710
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:11,407
and he wants it to be meaningful
and wants them to appreciate it.

1711
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:14,043
I really, I really wasn't
trying to tread on any toes.

1712
01:21:14,347 --> 01:21:16,393
I was trying to have a
good time and share my...

1713
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,179
feelings and things I liked
with the people I cared about.

1714
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:24,725
Its amazing how the people that know
about these Christmas cards are.

1715
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,403
He, he does like 250 of them.

1716
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,493
They go to Japan, everywhere.

1717
01:21:30,233 --> 01:21:31,930
You make that many cards

1718
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:33,977
not everybody's going to be
home when you stop by.

1719
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:36,108
So Id stick them in the doorway.

1720
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,580
A week or two after Christmas,
I don't hear anything.

1721
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,765
I call, Did you get the card?
Oh, yeah.

1722
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:42,731
Did you like it?
Yeah, it was great.

1723
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:45,509
Then why didn't you
say thank you?

1724
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:46,747
Why didn't you at least
acknowledge that you received

1725
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:47,971
it even if you didn't like it?

1726
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,883
And I started feeling like people
were taking the card for granted.

1727
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,427
You know, it's like going
to the faucet

1728
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,278
and turning the sink and
expecting the water to come out.

1729
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:58,262
And he just pulled the plug
on the whole operation.

1730
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:00,326
I'm trying to think when
Anna came into the picture.

1731
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,350
That might have been...

1732
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:05,268
that might have been
when the cards stopped.

1733
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:10,621
Hey! Welcome
to the Ukraine.

1734
01:22:14,842 --> 01:22:16,583
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1735
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:18,324
Enjoying a late meal

1736
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,285
after watching some
hearty videos

1737
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:26,419
of me and Christmas
card pictures

1738
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:29,596
and CDs.

1739
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,731
And now, for the rest
of the evening

1740
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:41,826
were trying to do our first installment
of a video of us live and in color.

1741
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:45,830
And Annas favorite color is

1742
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,181
lts green.

1743
01:22:50,748 --> 01:22:52,228
Look at the camera and tell them

1744
01:22:54,447 --> 01:22:55,447
Say.

1745
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:01,846
Are you nervous?

1746
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:10,550
I would not like to think
that she went through all that

1747
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:12,659
just to get into the United
States and get citizenship

1748
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:15,512
and, you know, but it
appears that way.

1749
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,360
I don't know
whether or not there was a scam.

1750
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:20,821
I-I don't think well ever know.

1751
01:23:22,693 --> 01:23:24,192
Kathy Hayes: So I heard that
he was, when he was moving

1752
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:26,262
he, he quit his job and
got a job with...

1753
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:29,439
He was working for
a paper service or something.

1754
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,658
He wanted to do more
with his life.

1755
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,792
He quit the job and spent money
going back and forth to Russia

1756
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:37,403
with her and that's where all
the cash went and lost his house.

1757
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:39,188
And he was moving.

1758
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:45,803
And he was like, No, nothing.
So now I hate her.

1759
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,544
"If I ever see her, shes
going to pay."

1760
01:23:54,377 --> 01:23:57,510
He married that girl,
Anna from Russia.

1761
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:00,252
She had to learn the
English language.

1762
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:02,145
When she learned it good enough

1763
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:07,474
and she probably learned that every
sentence didn't begin with the letter 'I'

1764
01:24:07,738 --> 01:24:10,298
that's probably when she realized
that this was not going to work.

1765
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:14,179
I mean, at the same time Jonah
was going from Johnny to Jonah

1766
01:24:14,266 --> 01:24:16,703
I think Jimmy was going
from Jimmy to whoever

1767
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:20,751
because he's just
not the same person that he was.

1768
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:22,840
I mean, not at all.

1769
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:25,843
It seems like they have
rev-reverse personalities.

1770
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:29,803
Jonahs becoming more extroverted
and Jim's becoming more introverted.

1771
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:32,975
When they were growing up,
it was just the opposite.

1772
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:37,657
Remember that, remember the
song'Glory Years by Bruce Springsteen?

1773
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:39,681
All right, after high school
football, that was it.

1774
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,489
That was my brother's big thing. He was
a quarterback in high school. That's it.

1775
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,906
That was the passion of my life, football.
I still love it.

1776
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:48,822
I still think it's
the best game.

1777
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,521
I mean, I wasn't satisfied
with just stopping there.

1778
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:54,263
I keep doing things. I'm
doing things to this very day.

1779
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:55,960
I love sports.
I love music.

1780
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,679
I just recently picked up the
keyboards about five years ago.

1781
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:00,703
Um...

1782
01:25:02,358 --> 01:25:03,770
And now I'm really getting
to figure out things

1783
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:05,076
so I'm ready to play
in a band now.

1784
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,276
Im gonna jam. Here we go.

1785
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:38,698
You want to talk about
Jonah, how egotistical he is?

1786
01:25:39,743 --> 01:25:42,354
That Christmas card
is to put the attention

1787
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:44,487
he, this guy actually
wants to put himself

1788
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:46,837
more important than
the real meaning of Christmas.

1789
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:49,970
The real meaning of Christmas
is about Christ.

1790
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,538
It's not about Santa Claus,
an anagram of Satan

1791
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:54,975
who comes down a
fire chimney in red

1792
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:56,934
and robs his glory from Christ.

1793
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,392
It's not about that.
It's not about anything else

1794
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:02,374
but the birth of our Savior
who came to save us.

1795
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,029
It's not about Jonah.
He wants to be it.

1796
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:07,901
Worship Me, I'm Jonah,
the second anti-Christ.

1797
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,816
He is in the
spirit of antichrist.

1798
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,232
I'll tell you something very interesting
that you can keep right on this footage.

1799
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:15,363
The number 666 adds up to 18.

1800
01:26:15,387 --> 01:26:16,780
Jonah was born on the 18th.

1801
01:26:17,737 --> 01:26:19,957
Jonah was born in 1953,
which adds to 18.

1802
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,265
Jonah graduated in 1971,
which adds to 18.

1803
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:25,789
Jonah worshipped the devil.

1804
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:29,706
Jonah is an apostate of Satan.

1805
01:26:32,404 --> 01:26:33,536
I believe that.

1806
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:36,582
I don't think he realizes...

1807
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:41,152
How, how evil or bad things are.

1808
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:45,330
I, so, yeah, there's something
definitely demonic going on for sure.

1809
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:49,900
I-I think there's a battle
going on. Definitely.

1810
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,469
And so I don't know where he's
gonna end up in the afterlife.

1811
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:56,130
I'm praying for him because right
now he's on his way to hell.

1812
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:59,866
He's magnifying himself in an
antichrist type of fashion.

1813
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:03,305
He is in the spirit of
antichrist Jonah.

1814
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,655
He wants people to worship him.

1815
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:10,645
Were not, he's not the one to worship.
Christ is the one to worship.

1816
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:33,335
Wow.

1817
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:39,558
This is the sword that I got
for my 40th birthday.

1818
01:27:48,132 --> 01:27:51,788
Man: Yes! Huzzah!
The will of steel!

1819
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:54,747
I actually had my buddy Don use
it for his sword in the calendar.

1820
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:57,754
Don: What do you guys want? What do
you guys want? What do you want, Jonah?

1821
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,537
Whatever dude. There you go. Two handed.
There you go. Two handed.

1822
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:02,973
Don: Two handed?
Yeah.

1823
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:04,409
Thats good!

1824
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:11,503
Hurry up.
I cant hold the stuff forever..

1825
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:13,418
We did, we had done stuff

1826
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:15,705
on a, like a big lazy "Susan"
in front of a blue screen.

1827
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:18,399
And we're, you know, we, you know
we take several pictures of us

1828
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:21,731
as they, as they kept turning the,
the carousel we were standing on.

1829
01:28:21,818 --> 01:28:25,169
So that if you put it on the internet, you
move the mouse, you could spin us around

1830
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:27,713
and see what the costume looks
like from all different angles.

1831
01:28:27,737 --> 01:28:29,652
Im-Im like, my mind is like,
you know

1832
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:33,090
way, left side of my brains
working real hard, right?

1833
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,745
That's a calendar, right Jonah?

1834
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:38,661
- Jonah.
What?

1835
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:40,708
That's a calendar, right?
Thats a calendar I hope.

1836
01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:44,730
But, eh I think the guy that
was going to do the printing

1837
01:28:44,754 --> 01:28:45,994
one of the guys, the characters

1838
01:28:48,061 --> 01:28:50,261
actually worked at the print
shop and lost his job, so...

1839
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,890
I guess he was doing it
behind the scenes, you know

1840
01:28:54,677 --> 01:28:56,132
not really with the, the total
permission of the company

1841
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:57,941
and he got fired for it.

1842
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:00,509
Now look at Don.
Is that Errol Flynn or what?

1843
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,337
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right.

1844
01:29:02,424 --> 01:29:04,164
We were waiting
for that to come out

1845
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:06,291
for where we could see if
we could sell some of them

1846
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:09,139
and that kind of fell through.
It was a big disappointment.

1847
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:10,954
Seen some better years.

1848
01:29:12,695 --> 01:29:14,697
Things are getting
a little rusty out here.

1849
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:18,396
But I've got all the
stuff in the can.

1850
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,461
Well get it eventually. Yeah,
eventually we'll get it done.

1851
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,661
But it was a great,
I had said just like this...

1852
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:27,120
These guys are thinking about like doing
a cartoon of my skull ranger character.

1853
01:29:27,144 --> 01:29:29,625
Wouldnt that be great?
Or a video game?

1854
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:30,713
Sure.

1855
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:35,848
You know, without really
knocking a lot of things over

1856
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:39,025
if I pull these blankets aside, you
can probably see the lion and the wolf.

1857
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:42,986
And again, the, the bed that
I'm sitting on is the...

1858
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:46,859
the mattress and boxspring, because the
actual bed wouldn't fit in this room.

1859
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,166
It's too tall and too wide.

1860
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:53,886
And you know, maybe someday again,
I hope someday again before I die

1861
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,738
I'll be able to set the
whole thing up.

1862
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:58,480
And it's, it's an edifice to
look at much less sleep in.

1863
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:01,526
And that's, uh, pretty much
my room.

1864
01:30:02,919 --> 01:30:03,963
Pretty much.

1865
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:06,879
- Stay.
He wont even know.

1866
01:30:06,966 --> 01:30:08,640
Well do it so smooth he
won't even know he's turning.

1867
01:30:08,664 --> 01:30:10,274
Yeah?
Stay there.

1868
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:11,057
- Good boy. I hope.
- Female:

1869
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:12,145
Stay.

1870
01:30:14,713 --> 01:30:18,282
Despite Jonah's best efforts to, to
help him Tonru developed some cancer.

1871
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:23,026
It was it was truly one of the
greatest losses I've ever experienced.

1872
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:25,898
I carried him when he died
on his own terms.

1873
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:31,445
And I called Skip and took a day off
from work the next day and we buried him.

1874
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:34,254
And he really hurt,
hurt a lot when he died.

1875
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:37,127
It was a real sad thing.

1876
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:41,566
I had a large dog myself, Scout

1877
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:44,090
that actually passed away...

1878
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:47,964
a year or so before Tonu,
Tonru did.

1879
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:52,664
They're buried side by side and got crosses
on their graves out in our hunting camp.

1880
01:30:53,317 --> 01:30:55,972
Yeah it's funny how animals can
be so much a part of your life.

1881
01:30:56,363 --> 01:30:59,802
But you know, you don't see
people all the time

1882
01:31:00,367 --> 01:31:01,978
but you see the animal
every day.

1883
01:31:04,241 --> 01:31:05,721
And uh, like I said, again

1884
01:31:05,808 --> 01:31:07,592
he was a lot more...

1885
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:11,640
a lot more important to me
than most people.

1886
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:18,342
You know, I, you know, I don't know
how many real friends you guys have.

1887
01:31:18,777 --> 01:31:20,649
I don't even know how
many real friends I have.

1888
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:24,653
But I know one thing,
this guy was really my friend.

1889
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,222
And I could count on him.

1890
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,617
Oh, they're sorely missed.
That's for sure.

1891
01:31:32,704 --> 01:31:35,620
Yeah. Good friends.
No doubt about it.

1892
01:31:36,839 --> 01:31:38,318
Man's best friend.

1893
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,756
Amen.

1894
01:31:47,414 --> 01:31:49,262
Well, you know, I had a
lot of bad things happen.

1895
01:31:49,286 --> 01:31:51,810
I mean, I mean,
you know any one of these things

1896
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:54,944
could have pushed, you know,
I don't want to say a normal person

1897
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:57,033
making me superhuman or abnormal

1898
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,340
but, you know, boom boom,
but it's like being in a fight.

1899
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:02,647
Every time you get up,
somebody knocks you down

1900
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:05,302
again, but you keep getting up.
You keep getting up.

1901
01:32:05,563 --> 01:32:07,957
Jonah really showed the
strength of his character.

1902
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:12,309
I mean all within the space
of less than a year and a half

1903
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:14,398
you know his dog died

1904
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:17,401
he lost his house

1905
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,752
had to declare bankruptcy
and lost his wife.

1906
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:24,626
He still kept smiling.

1907
01:32:25,235 --> 01:32:26,889
You know, I mean, I...

1908
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,110
I'm not saying he ever got sad
or depressed or anything

1909
01:32:31,197 --> 01:32:33,373
but I mean, they were momentary.

1910
01:32:34,244 --> 01:32:35,680
I mean he just...

1911
01:32:38,814 --> 01:32:43,166
Hes too much into life to let
anything get him down for too long.

1912
01:32:43,906 --> 01:32:46,996
You know hes really
a indomitable spirit

1913
01:32:48,301 --> 01:32:50,086
like nobody I've ever known.

1914
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:05,144
I know that the only value that I have
in this life is one of entertainment.

1915
01:33:05,492 --> 01:33:08,104
It's taken me a long time
to accept that conclusion.

1916
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:10,672
Nobody really gives a shit
about me as a person

1917
01:33:10,933 --> 01:33:12,848
just what I say or wear or
what I can do.

1918
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:15,938
I've created me and I
have to go on being me.

1919
01:33:16,373 --> 01:33:17,461
There's no turning back.

1920
01:33:19,071 --> 01:33:20,871
With great power
comes a great responsibility.

1921
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,611
Words of wisdom
for me to live by.

1922
01:33:24,511 --> 01:33:26,751
I've spent more time alone
than I do around other people.

1923
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:30,169
And maybe that's why I've been
able to delve within myself

1924
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:33,235
to harness those powers that most of us
have but never tap into full capacity.

1925
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:35,958
Pedal to the metal and volume
at ten is all that I know.

1926
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:38,787
I'll continue to be over
the top until I drop.

1927
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:42,878
Maybe I spend too much time alone,
but you know how we punishers are.

1928
01:33:43,313 --> 01:33:45,944
I've already run the different question
and answer scenarios in my head

1929
01:33:45,968 --> 01:33:48,797
if I wind up in Conan O'Brien,
Leno, Letterman or Stern

1930
01:33:49,145 --> 01:33:52,148
although I am not camera shy and
have no mic fright whatsoever

1931
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:54,063
and Im wildly spontaneous.

1932
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:56,152
Chance favors the prepared mind.

1933
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,981
God how I love that phrase.

1934
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:02,854
As The Doors Jim Morrison once said
in The Celebration of the Lizard

1935
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:08,294
Now night arrives with a purple Legion;
retire now to your tent and to your dreams.

1936
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:13,865
Tomorrow, we enter the town of my birth;
I want to be ready. And I will be ready.

1937
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:16,433
Okay action, Jonah.

1938
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:37,323
This is what
I should be doing, you know.

1939
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:39,848
I shouldn't
be working a real job.

1940
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,851
I mean I really shouldn't.
I don't belong here.

1941
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,374
You know, I mean...

1942
01:34:46,463 --> 01:34:48,789
You know, there's a place for
that, there's a place for people,

1943
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:53,035
but I just have, I just have too many
other skills to be stuck doing that.

1944
01:34:53,122 --> 01:34:56,560
And I, even if I made the same pay,
it'd be better doing something I like.

1945
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:59,563
My hobbies are what gets
everybody's attention.

1946
01:34:59,955 --> 01:35:01,086
That's what I tell everybody

1947
01:35:03,393 --> 01:35:05,066
Even though people want to know what
makes me tick for the documentary,

1948
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:07,130
they don't want Sylvester
Stallone, they want Rambo.

1949
01:35:08,528 --> 01:35:11,688
They want Rocky; they want the character,
so I give them the character, you know.

1950
01:35:12,315 --> 01:35:13,229
So I'm gonna have fun tonight, I'm
really like looking forward to it.

1951
01:35:13,316 --> 01:35:14,970
Where's the gig?

1952
01:35:15,057 --> 01:35:16,556
It's some shitty ass
little town called Elba.

1953
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,538
It's between Albion and Batavia.

1954
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,038
Oh, Okay. And it's a
ro, ts a roadhouse.

1955
01:35:20,062 --> 01:35:22,368
Its called, um,
The Stumblin Inn.

1956
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:34,250
I think, I think its time.

1957
01:36:16,553 --> 01:36:18,381
Whats your name?
Jonah.

1958
01:36:18,642 --> 01:36:19,904
Jonah.
Jonah. We have to...

1959
01:36:19,991 --> 01:36:21,601
Are you serious?

1960
01:36:21,688 --> 01:36:23,212
Crazy about you
over your documentary.

1961
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:28,465
Oh yeah, Ive had the TV crew...
You're really not Jonah.

1962
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:31,176
Yeah, thats my name.
Youre really it...

1963
01:36:31,263 --> 01:36:33,423
because I thought you were
somebody else like imposing.

1964
01:36:33,962 --> 01:36:35,548
Youre the shit and
youre carrying your own stuff?

1965
01:36:35,572 --> 01:36:36,652
Well, yeah.
Let me help you.

1966
01:36:38,444 --> 01:36:40,553
Can we help you carry your stuff?
Oh, yes, if you want.

1967
01:36:40,577 --> 01:36:42,405
Come on, Jonah. All right.
All right girls.

1968
01:36:42,492 --> 01:36:43,730
Should I carry your tuba?
Uh, no, thats okay.

1969
01:36:43,754 --> 01:36:45,060
Female:

1970
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:47,758
Where am I going with this?

1971
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,281
Uh, around the corner.
I guess.

1972
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:52,957
Do you not color your hair?
Because Im a hairdresser.

1973
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:54,501
Uh, I don't color
my hair but I might...

1974
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:56,482
Because, you know what?
Its a fucking wig, Jonah.

1975
01:36:56,506 --> 01:36:57,246
Yeah. I can tell.

1976
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:58,333
You think?

1977
01:37:00,162 --> 01:37:01,792
What do you got underneath that shit?
Take it off.

1978
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,184
And why are you still
making me carry this?

1979
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:04,208
I don't know.
You offered.

1980
01:37:07,038 --> 01:37:08,474
Some of the stuff I saw

1981
01:37:10,346 --> 01:37:11,889
some of the people I met,
some of the places I traveled to

1982
01:37:11,913 --> 01:37:13,697
you know, it's priceless.

1983
01:37:13,784 --> 01:37:15,327
It's it's there, and some of it
because of me being me

1984
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:17,179
having the mindset to
document things

1985
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:19,703
throw that camera,
run that video.

1986
01:37:21,183 --> 01:37:24,186
Yeah, it is a legacy. I mean, let's
face it, my whole life has been...

1987
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:26,928
You know, documentation
of incredible events.

1988
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:33,064
You know, things that I, that I do or
how I look or how I sound or how I think.

1989
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,151
I mean whats that phrase

1990
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,305
"Destiny go confidently in
the direction of your dreams"?

1991
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:38,374
Henry David Thoreau.

1992
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:40,593
That that's what I do, you know.

1993
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,118
My destiny is just being
confident and following my dreams

1994
01:37:43,553 --> 01:37:45,381
and trying to just enjoy life

1995
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,168
instead of, you know, being shuttled
into a particular direction.

1996
01:37:51,517 --> 01:37:54,042
Yeah he's uh, has a chance to...

1997
01:37:55,565 --> 01:37:57,741
To enjoy some,
a little bit of fame.

1998
01:37:58,568 --> 01:38:02,354
He's led a life of anonymity and
then now it's time for him to...

1999
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:04,487
blossom and...

2000
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:07,229
And become something that
he's always wanted to

2001
01:38:08,273 --> 01:38:09,993
maybe be, to share his
talent with everybody

2002
01:38:12,103 --> 01:38:14,864
and then just break out of that mold
of being by yourself all the time.

2003
01:38:15,324 --> 01:38:17,674
It's almost like he knows
he has the potential

2004
01:38:18,414 --> 01:38:21,417
to be out there because
people appreciate him

2005
01:38:21,678 --> 01:38:23,680
people want to see him,
people want to talk to him.

2006
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,552
And he just wants to
get that step

2007
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,121
just make that step
for those 15 minutes of fame.

2008
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:32,341
He's hes worked for
his whole life.

2009
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:35,605
Nothing's going to stop Jonah.
Nothing will stop him.

2010
01:38:36,823 --> 01:38:37,999
So...

2011
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:46,703
Douchebag!

2012
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:50,770
Youre putting your shit in the back
of a fucking station wagon. Really?

2013
01:38:50,794 --> 01:38:52,230
Yes.
Its not a station wagon.

2014
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:53,971
Yes it is.
Its a Subaru.

2015
01:38:54,058 --> 01:38:54,711
Its a goddamn outback.
Thats thats

2016
01:38:54,798 --> 01:38:56,365
Jones.

2017
01:38:56,452 --> 01:38:58,628
Thanks, sweetie.
I love you.

2018
01:38:58,715 --> 01:39:00,258
I love you too. I'm glad
I got to see you tonight.

2019
01:39:00,282 --> 01:39:02,284
Thank you.
Have a wonderful night.

2020
01:39:02,371 --> 01:39:04,044
You too. Thanks for helping.
Dont grab my ass.

2021
01:39:04,068 --> 01:39:05,306
Oh, I didn't. Can I?
Grab my ass.

2022
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:06,984
You want me to?
Grab it.

2023
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:08,594
All right.
Thank you. I love you.

2024
01:39:08,681 --> 01:39:10,553
I love you too.
You take it easy, Erica.

2025
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:13,382
You take it easy.
All right guys.

2026
01:39:13,469 --> 01:39:16,515
That was, uh the,
the the crescendo at that point.

2027
01:39:16,602 --> 01:39:19,823
I had the beautiful girls roadying
my stuff back to Skips car.

2028
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,479
Ah well, it's been a,
it's been a long day.

2029
01:39:23,827 --> 01:39:25,133
Now I'm losing my voice.

2030
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:28,460
I got the Ted Nugent scream
at the end of cat scratch fever

2031
01:39:28,484 --> 01:39:29,678
and I think that finally
killed me.

2032
01:39:29,702 --> 01:39:30,702
Ted always screams.

2033
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:36,622
Cat scratch fever baby!

2034
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:51,115
Thank you very much!

2035
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,860
Wild thing, I think I love you.
Yeah.

2036
01:39:57,121 --> 01:39:59,689
How did the show go? Are we on?
Oh, the show was great.

2037
01:39:59,776 --> 01:40:01,604
- It was phenomenal.
Erica was awesome.

2038
01:40:01,691 --> 01:40:03,649
Yeah, Erica was awesome.

2039
01:40:03,736 --> 01:40:06,609
Uh, the girls were, yeah,
definitely in the palm of my hand.

2040
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:08,393
I had a great time.

2041
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,266
I lost uh, lost myself
in the monitor a little bit

2042
01:40:11,353 --> 01:40:13,137
when I do the switch
to the wireless mic.

2043
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:14,941
I went on stage, I couldn't
hear myself over the guitar

2044
01:40:14,965 --> 01:40:16,619
but I went with just instinct.

2045
01:40:18,925 --> 01:40:20,381
Jumped out on the dance floor and
just started rocking with the girls.

2046
01:40:20,405 --> 01:40:21,885
A la Angus Young of ACDC.

2047
01:40:24,105 --> 01:40:26,257
So I started running around and
playing and they were loving it

2048
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:28,215
and I was loving it and everybody
wanted their pictures taken

2049
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,870
and I was getting kisses and uh, you
know, it's a total rock star thing.

2050
01:40:30,894 --> 01:40:34,289
What can I tell you? Phenomenal day
right from the beginning to the end.

2051
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:36,769
You guys are great.
I'm great. It's good, man.

2052
01:40:37,857 --> 01:40:39,555
What are you gonna do now?
Be greater.

2053
01:40:39,642 --> 01:40:40,773
Uh, die.

2054
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:43,926
Yeah, no, we're gonna go uh
go back put my stuff back

2055
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:45,517
and I'm gonna try to
get some sleep.

2056
01:40:45,604 --> 01:40:47,693
I'm, Im whooped, man.
It's been a long day.

2057
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,565
Really has.

2058
01:40:52,002 --> 01:40:53,806
I'll tell you the first thing
I'm going to do though

2059
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,527
is eat those three pieces
of that tuna club

2060
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:57,747
that we had at the restaurant
because Im starved.

2061
01:40:58,313 --> 01:41:00,421
Can you turn around and
walk that way towards the car?

2062
01:41:00,445 --> 01:41:02,839
Yep. Good night gents.

2063
01:41:04,928 --> 01:41:07,626
Party on!

2064
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,412
Rock and Roll will never die!

2065
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,461
Okay, now I'm fried, dude.

2066
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,594
I am fucking fried.

2067
01:41:20,422 --> 01:41:21,814
Are we heading out?

2068
01:41:21,901 --> 01:41:23,773
Yeah, let's go.
I'm freezing.

2069
01:41:24,339 --> 01:41:25,751
I'm soaking wet
from being on the dance floor

2070
01:41:25,775 --> 01:41:27,429
and I got a nylon tank top on.

2071
01:41:27,516 --> 01:41:28,836
It's probably 40 degrees
out here.

2072
01:43:59,668 --> 01:44:02,323
You people are weak!
