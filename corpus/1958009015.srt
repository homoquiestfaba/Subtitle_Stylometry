1
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,721
It's okay.

2
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,890
Relax.

3
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,433
I'm not gonna hurt you.

4
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,145
I'm just gonna learn about you
for a little while.

5
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,564
Is that okay?

6
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,365
I'm gonna name you Kerolien
after my friend at school.

7
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,534
She's really nice.

8
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,037
But she farts in class sometimes
and pretends like she didn't.

9
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,749
So, please don't do that,
'cause you're sharing this jar now,

10
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,252
and the others won't like you
if you smell. Okay?

11
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,791
Hi there.

12
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,922
I'm not from around here,
but I was hoping to make some new friends.

13
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,262
Can I talk to you for a little bit?

14
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,561
I-I don't talk to strangers.

15
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,481
Of course you don't.

16
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,733
You shouldn't. You're smart.

17
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,320
But I'm here to be your friend,

18
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,823
so, hopefully,
we won't be strangers for too long.

19
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
What's your name?

20
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,786
Wenling.

21
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,123
- But everyone calls me Wen.
- Well, it's nice to meet you, Wen.

22
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,417
My name's Leonard.

23
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,718
I see you're catching grasshoppers.

24
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,388
Can I help you?

25
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,267
Um, I guess so.

26
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,186
I loved catching grasshoppers
when I was your age.

27
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,322
- Oh, you're really good.
- Thanks, Wen.

28
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,283
Can you pass me the jar there,
please?

29
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,203
Wait.

30
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,539
Let the ones inside calm down a bit.

31
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,541
We don't want them to panic.

32
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,588
There you go.

33
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,673
Are you just a natural,

34
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,341
or did someone teach you
how to catch grasshoppers?

35
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,926
Daddy Eric taught me.

36
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,179
I'm studying them.

37
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,639
I'm gonna take care of animals
when I grow up.

38
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,976
You call your dad by his first name?

39
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,271
It's so they know who I'm talking to.

40
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,690
There's Daddy Eric and Daddy Andrew.

41
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,028
All the other kids at school
only have one dad.

42
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,114
All the Disney Channel shows
only have one dad, too.

43
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,492
Well, does that bother you?

44
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,869
No.

45
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,580
Except when my guidance counselor
keeps saying

46
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,540
how it's so great that I have two dads.

47
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,127
For some reason, it makes me feel like
she's saying the opposite.

48
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,971
What's wrong?

49
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,392
Nothing.

50
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,644
Nothing at all.

51
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,604
How old are you, Wen?

52
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,731
I'll be eight in six days.

53
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, happy almost-birthday.

54
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,405
In fact, it just so happens
that I have something for you.

55
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,408
I saw it, and I thought it was pretty,
so I decided to keep it.

56
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,953
So, consider it
an early birthday present.

57
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,165
And if you don't like it,
we can play a game with it instead.

58
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
What kind of game?

59
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,254
We'll take turns pulling petals off
and asking questions,

60
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,090
and by the time we're done,
we'll know each other better.

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,383
Be better friends.

62
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,717
M'kay.

63
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,887
What's your favorite movie?

64
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,347
<i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i>.

65
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,433
I haven't seen that.

66
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,685
I'll check it out.

67
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,854
Okay, your turn.

68
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,150
Why are you here?

69
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,614
Leonard?

70
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,994
Why am I here?

71
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,583
Well, I suppose I'm here
to make friends with you and your dads.

72
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,669
Maybe catch some more grasshoppers.

73
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,007
How'd you get
that tiny little scar on your lip?

74
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,219
I'm so sorry, Wen.

75
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,722
I shouldn't have asked that.

76
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,809
It's too personal, even for this game.

77
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,060
It's okay.

78
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,770
My lip was broken when I was born.

79
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,191
My dads said it took a lot of doctors
to fix it.

80
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,320
Well, I don't have a scar like you,
but if you could look inside,

81
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,323
you'd see that my heart is broken.

82
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,824
Why is it broken?

83
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,410
Because of what I have to do today.

84
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,787
What do you have to do?

85
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,754
Are they your friends?

86
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,715
You're my friend, Wen.

87
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,344
No matter what happens,
I want you to remember that.

88
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,057
The others who are coming
are more like people I work with.

89
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,729
You see, the four of us
have a very important job to do.

90
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:45,192
In fact, it might be
the most important job

91
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,860
in the history of the world.

92
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,079
This isn't about you, Wen.

93
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,330
Or your dads.

94
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,665
Okay?

95
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,418
You haven't done anything wrong,
but I'm afraid the three of you

96
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,379
are gonna have to make
some tough decisions.

97
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,089
Terrible decisions.

98
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,550
And I wish with all my broken heart
that you didn't have to.

99
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,635
Wen!

100
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,098
Your dads won't want to let us in.

101
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,433
You have to tell them they must.

102
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,770
Otherwise, we're gonna have to find
our own way in. Do you understand?

103
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,649
Wen, tell me you understand!

104
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,202
♪ <i>Oh, love is always…</i> ♪

105
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,416
- This isn't bad.
- The cheese is good.

106
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,627
See? Factual proof. There she is.
You didn't need to check on her.

107
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,962
You have to come inside right now.

108
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,255
There's strangers
and they want to come in,

109
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,424
- and they're scary!
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

110
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,593
- Hurry, now!
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

111
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,887
- We're coming inside.
- God, okay.

112
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,513
- Come on!
- Honey, what's happening?

113
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,307
- Tell me what's so…
- Relax, relax. Okay. It's okay.

114
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,184
- It's okay.
- Wen, what's up?

115
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,854
Wen, Wen, it's okay.
Listen, sweetie. What happened?

116
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,022
What scared you?

117
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,732
There... there were four of them.

118
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,984
The big one, his name's Leonard.

119
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,737
He... he says we have to help them.

120
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,032
He says they have the most important job
in the history of the world.

121
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,453
Jehovah's Witnesses?

122
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
Great.

123
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,748
They have these weapons.

124
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,097
Hello in there.

125
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,976
My name is Leonard,
and I'm here with some associates of mine.

126
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,187
Can you open the door, please?

127
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,611
This guy is frigging huge.

128
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,655
What do we do?

129
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,366
I don't know, um…

130
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,118
Tell them to go away nicely?

131
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,498
Hi. Uh, hello, Leonard. We...

132
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,500
Is that Daddy Andrew or Daddy Eric?

133
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,502
I met
your delightful daughter Wen already.

134
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,630
She's so thoughtful and kind.
You two should be very proud.

135
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,384
This is Eric.

136
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,761
Is there something
we can help you with?

137
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,681
There is.
Why don't you open the door?

138
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,766
It'll be easier if we speak face-to-face.

139
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,269
Tell them to go away.
Please make them go away.

140
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,854
Wen, please.

141
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,939
Uh, we weren't expecting visitors.

142
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,650
I don't want to sound rude,
but we'd like to be left alone.

143
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,235
I understand.

144
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,195
And I'm sorry to intrude
on your vacation,

145
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,990
especially in such
a beautiful place as this.

146
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,283
Make them go away!

147
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,367
Wen.

148
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,495
You should know
that this isn't easy for us, either.

149
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,455
None of us
have been to this lake before.

150
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,751
And the four of us, we never thought
we'd be here talking to you nice people.

151
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,258
Who else is out there with you?

152
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,719
I'm here with Sabrina,
Adriane and Redmond.

153
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,847
And the four of us are here
because we're trying to save

154
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,016
a whole bunch of people.

155
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,977
- Eric, come here. Come here.
- But we need your help to do that.

156
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,355
We can't do anything without you,
and speaking through a door

157
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,483
is making a difficult conversation
near impossible.

158
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,860
What?

159
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,327
There's a woman carrying something
that looks like a pick with a chain

160
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,078
and a mallet head at the end.

161
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,126
I'm calling the police now.

162
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,261
This can't be right.
There's no dial tone.

163
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,387
What?

164
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,682
I checked it when we got here.
Is the battery dead?

165
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,935
The battery's not dead.
It's not dialing.

166
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,979
Like I said, we need to talk.

167
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,440
We don't have a choice.

168
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,612
Yeah, well, we don't have a choice,
either! We're calling the cops!

169
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,823
Hey, um, we know you can't do that.

170
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,952
None of our phones
get service out here, either.

171
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,663
And sorry, we had to cut the phone line.

172
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,505
Wen. Wen. Wen.
Wen, give me the phone.

173
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,218
We don't mean to rush you,
but we're a little pressed for time.

174
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,471
Please open the door
so we can have a real conversation.

175
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,224
- If you want to talk, then why do you…
- Wen, Wen.

176
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,476
- …have those scary weapons with you?
- Wen. Wen.

177
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,894
They're not weapons, Wen.

178
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,437
They're tools.

179
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,565
Just open the goddamn door!

180
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,693
- We're coming in either way.
- The hell you are! I have a gun!

181
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,320
You brought it here?

182
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,031
Yes and no. It's in
the safe in the back of the truck.

183
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,157
He's lying.

184
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,785
Show us what you're packing,
Daddy Andrew!

185
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,203
We all like show-and-tell.

186
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,873
You'll see it when I'm pointing it
at your head, you piece of crap!

187
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,624
What's wrong with you?
You're not helping.

188
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,959
- You're upsetting him.
- What?

189
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,419
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,882
Redmond is as anxious
and passionate as we all are.

191
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,554
I'm giving you one last chance
to open the door.

192
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,568
They're breaking in!

193
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,209
Andrew, couch!

194
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,711
Good job, Wen. Keep going.

195
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,632
Push it.

196
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,177
Okay.

197
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,900
Daddy Andrew!

198
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,910
I got you, baby.

199
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,138
They're in the basement.

200
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,267
One is in the back,
one is downstairs.

201
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,269
Let's make a run for it to the car.

202
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,145
I've got the keys.

203
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,988
It doesn't have to be like this.

204
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,115
Get Wen out of here.

205
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,041
Eric!

206
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,294
Let me help him.

207
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,753
- Wait…
- Don't touch him!

208
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,505
I'm a nurse! He's hurt!

209
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,719
Stop! Stop.

210
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,975
Eric.

211
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,269
Daddy Eric.

212
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,271
Please get up.
We have to go, Daddy.

213
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,402
Eric, wake up.

214
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,778
Wake up, Eric!

215
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,605
Shh. Shh, you'll be okay.

216
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,358
Andrew, that's enough.

What do you expect?

231
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,427
That's my mom asking how it's going.

232
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,054
Well, you can tell her you were wrong.

233
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,184
Andrew.

234
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,234
Always together.

235
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,828
Hi.

236
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,958
<i>Thanks, Custard.</i>

237
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,628
<i>This is a very important cupcake order.</i>

238
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,548
Let me see if this helps.

239
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,675
Is that better?

240
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,765
Try not to move.

241
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,518
Almost done.

242
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,021
<i>I have to finish
this special order before tomorrow.</i>

243
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,024
<i>It needs to be purr-fect.</i>

244
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,778
Can you turn that down?

245
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,157
We did when you asked before,
but I'll do it again.

246
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,455
Is Eric cleaned up?

247
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,000
He's cleaned up, yeah,
but severely concussed.

248
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,172
Hey, Eric.

249
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,633
You feeling any better?

250
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,887
I'm… I'm so sorry.

251
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,643
I've never watched this show
before, but... but I like it.

252
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,604
The characters, they...
They seem curious and good.

253
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,275
I get the sense that it
explores or teaches empathy

254
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,527
and tolerance,
and that's just lovely.

255
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,321
Empathy and tolerance?

256
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,784
Is that what you're here to talk about
now that you have the queers tied up?

257
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,746
Andrew, I assure you
that we're not here

258
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,541
with hate or prejudice
in our hearts. Not at all.

259
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,252
We don't have one homophobic bone
in our bodies.

260
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,628
I don't hate anybody.

261
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,798
I do have conflicted feelings
about this door.

262
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,135
You have to believe that.

263
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,762
But we had no idea
you were a single-sex couple

264
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,014
until we got here.

265
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,641
That one was a surprise.

266
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,645
Well, I guess if you promise,
then I have to believe you.

267
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,232
I mean, we're normal people
just like you.

268
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,110
- We have no choice.
- There's always a choice!

269
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,238
He's right about that.

270
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,533
Our choices make our destiny.

271
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,912
I almost got that tattooed.

272
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,626
Okay, you're right, Andrew.

273
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,461
There's always a choice.

274
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,796
So we choose to be here.

275
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,050
Can everyone
come in here, please?

276
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,219
It's almost time.

277
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,595
Time for what?

278
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,223
You don't need us tied up.

279
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,935
You said you were here to talk,
so we'll talk.

280
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,990
Hi, Eric, Wen…

281
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,743
…and Andrew.

282
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,746
My name is Sabrina.

283
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,041
I live in Southern California.

284
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,461
I live in a town
you've probably never heard of.

285
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:40,467
I have been a post-op nurse
for almost five years.

286
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,555
I used most of my savings

287
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,307
to come out to Pennsylvania,

288
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,727
to come here to talk with you guys.

289
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,027
I have a little half sister back home,

290
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,282
and, Wen, you kind of remind me of her.

291
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,628
Well, I think you... you guys
already know my name is Leonard.

292
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,675
And I'm good at catching grasshoppers,
right, Wen?

293
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,682
I'm from Chicago.

294
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,102
I'm a second grade teacher,
and I run the after-school program.

295
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,272
I'm also a bartender. I…

296
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,773
Okay. Me?

297
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,650
Am I next?

298
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,402
Hi there.

299
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,071
I'm Redmond,
and I like long walks on the beach

300
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,615
- and I like beer.
- Hey.

301
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,116
We already discussed this.

302
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,160
They deserve to know who we are.

303
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:52,748
We wasted time
for this guy to wake up.

304
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,585
You know, this get-to-know-you stuff
doesn't matter at all.

305
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,672
Doesn't change what we have to do
or what they have to do.

306
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:05,761
When you say stuff like that,
you sound how you sound, okay?

307
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,095
You just scare them.

308
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,766
You make it less likely
that they'll believe us or cooperate.

309
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,644
Okay. Okay, my turn it is.

310
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,105
I live in Medford, Massachusetts.

311
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,066
I work for the gas company,

312
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,110
making sure houses
and apartments don't blow up.

313
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,073
I'm single, if you can believe that.

314
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:31,078
I've done some time,
as they say.

315
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,997
Did a lot of, uh…

316
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,878
questionable stuff
when I was young and stupid.

317
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,382
But I'm much better now.

318
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,266
And my father used to beat the shit
out of me, like Andrew just did.

319
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:58,564
Wish I could go back in time,
give the kid-me this thing.

320
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,399
May I speak now?

321
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,277
I hope I don't sound confusing.

322
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,153
Hold on. Hold on a second.

323
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,114
Wh…

324
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,533
We get that you guys
are a part of some group,

325
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:13,203
and it sounds like...
It sounds like you want to…

326
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,874
fix things. To help.

327
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,917
Eric, you don't have to try to talk...

328
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,003
No, no, I'm okay.
I want to say this.

329
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,547
If you're try...
Trying to recruit us,

330
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,552
I mean, why else bother
introducing yourselves to us, right?

331
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,184
If you're trying to change us
or make us different,

332
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,269
all of this…

333
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,273
this isn't the way.

334
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,694
Can someone put the curtain
on the backdoor?

335
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:46,945
What's wrong with Eric?

336
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,573
When you have a concussion,
you're extremely sensitive to light.

337
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,200
There's nothing we can do
about that now.

338
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,160
He's only gonna get better
if he rests in a darkened room

339
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,578
or if we make it dark in here.

340
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,079
We shouldn't move him
until we make our proposal.

341
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,748
He might need to be
in a darkened room for days,

342
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,583
- not just a few hours.
- You're not separating me

343
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,876
from Andrew and Wen.

344
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,170
I'll see what I can do
with the curtains.

345
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,047
So, whatever.

346
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,466
I'm, um, I'm Adriane.

347
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,053
Yeah, I-I've been a lot of things,
but... but right now,

348
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:15,224
or, um, before I got up here,
I-I was a line cook

349
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:18,769
at a Mexican restaurant
in... in Dupont Circle, DC.

350
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,855
I love to feed people.

351
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,149
It feels like it's more than food to me.

352
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,318
Um…

353
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,986
God, what else? Uh…

354
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,782
Oh! I have, um, I have two cats.

355
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,450
And you'd love them, Wen.

356
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,119
Their names are Riff and Raff.

357
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,997
Do you like cats, Wen?

358
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,999
You don't have to answer her, sweetie.

359
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,335
Sorry, Wen.

360
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:45,170
Maybe I'll put it back on later, okay?

361
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,505
Forget the curtains.

362
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,382
It's time.

363
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,652
The four of us are here
to prevent the apocalypse.

364
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,240
We... and when I say "we,"
I mean everyone in this cabin...

365
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,702
Can stop it from happening,
but only with your help.

366
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,082
Ultimately,
whether the world ends or not

367
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,335
is completely up to you three.

368
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,049
You are having a psychological break
of some kind.

369
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:45,022
Your family must choose to willingly
sacrifice one of the three of you

370
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,191
in order to prevent the apocalypse.

371
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,822
After you make what I know
is an impossible decision,

372
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,201
you must then kill the one you choose.

373
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,456
If you fail to choose,

374
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,043
or if you fail to follow through
with the sacrifice,

375
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,087
the world will end.

376
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,673
You three will live…

377
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,469
but the rest of humanity,

378
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,555
seven billion plus…

379
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,476
will perish.

380
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,189
They're lunatics.

381
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,401
And you will all live long enough
to witness the horror

382
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,695
of the end of everything.

383
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:39,576
And you will be left to wander
the devastated planet alone.

384
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:45,541
Permanently and cosmically… alone.

385
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:48,877
Leonard.

386
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,923
We haven't done anything wrong.

387
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,592
I agree with you. You haven't.

388
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:59,471
You haven't done anything wrong
to deserve this burden.

389
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,478
You're just the family chosen
to decide for us in this time.

390
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,825
Look, we're not here to hurt you.

391
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,244
If we wanted to hurt you,
we would've used duct tape

392
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,329
- instead of ropes.
- You stop.

393
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:30,127
You have to understand that we cannot
and will not choose

394
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,254
who has to be sacrificed for you.

395
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,715
And just as importantly,
we cannot act for you.

396
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,384
And you cannot kill yourselves.

397
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,721
We're not choosing anyone.

398
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,806
We're not sacrificing anyone.

399
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,516
Not now, not ever.

400
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,477
Even if it means the death
of everyone else in the world?

401
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,562
Yes.

402
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,357
Even if I believe the world was at stake,
which I don't, that's what it means.

403
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,235
I would watch the world die
a hundred times over

404
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,070
- before having to...
- Christ.

405
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,280
Waste of time.

406
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,074
They're never gonna
choose to do this.

407
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,660
And I don't blame them.

408
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,580
- Who would ever choose...
- Shut up, Redmond.

409
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,665
You just vomit
everything you think.

410
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,710
Oh, God, we are so screwed.

411
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,212
Okay,

412
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,464
you need to listen to this part too.

413
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,177
I've been shown exactly what will happen
if you choose not to make a sacrifice.

414
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,720
We've all been shown.

415
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,349
We couldn't stop drawing
the visions we saw.

416
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:29,061
I actually thought
something was wrong with me,

417
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,688
but the visions were so strong,

418
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:35,359
so specific and so, so real.

419
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,362
Sabrina, Adriane and Redmond,
they had the visions too.

420
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,949
So, that led us to each other and…

421
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,620
and that led us here to this exact cabin.

422
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,331
We have no idea why we were picked.

423
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,552
First, the cities will drown.

424
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:06,098
The oceans will swell
and rise up into a great fist

425
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,142
and pound all the buildings
and people into the sand,

426
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,644
and drag everything out to sea.

427
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,646
There is
something wrong with you,

428
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,148
with all of you, if you believe this.

429
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:18,360
Then a terrible plague will descend

430
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,405
and people will writhe with fever
and mucus will fill their lungs.

431
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,241
This is psychotic!
It's delusional.

432
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,203
Did you try to get help?
Let us go and we'll get you help.

433
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:31,415
The skies will fall and crash to the earth
like pieces of glass.

434
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,709
And God's fingers will scorch the earth,

435
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,920
and an everlasting darkness
will descend over humanity.

436
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,338
You need help!

437
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,511
This is going to happen.

438
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,474
And we've been shown
that only your sacrifice can stop it.

439
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:50,851
Shown by who?

440
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,227
By what?

441
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,729
Are you gonna answer that?

442
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:57,482
You sound like every fake doomsdayer
on every corner of every city.

443
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,490
Come on, talk to us.

444
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,163
Dreams can have
many different meanings.

445
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,042
Our part in your visions
is kind of vague.

446
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,338
Almost like you didn't know
who would be here.

447
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,797
Like it was random.

448
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,176
It doesn't make sense.

449
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,262
For every "no" you give us,

450
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,433
we will unleash a plague
for the sins of humanity.

451
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,773
Will you make a choice?

452
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,471
Wait, stop.

453
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,975
- You don't need to do this.
- You don't need those things.

454
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,518
You said you couldn't hurt us.

455
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,772
What are you doing?

456
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:30,033
What are you doing? Don't touch her.
Don't touch her! Get off her! Get off her!

457
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,202
Get off of her!

458
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:35,747
Wen, Wen.

459
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,334
Run, Wen. Wen.

460
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:40,419
I can't.

461
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:42,337
Run.

462
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,515
Please, God, just let us go.

463
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,239
Fuck.

464
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,450
I'm scared.

465
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,287
Keep looking at me, okay?

466
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,501
Don't you fucking look away from me.

467
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:03,585
A part of humanity has been judged.

468
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,132
Whatever it is
you're convinced of, it isn't real.

469
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,635
- You don't have to do this.
- This isn't real.

470
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,094
It's not gonna... No!

471
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,475
You can pray if you want.
I won't make comment.

472
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,112
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks?

473
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,114
Yes. My wife couldn't be here today.

474
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,574
This is her brother.

475
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,645
Now tell me this isn't a miracle.

476
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,067
Hi. Hi, Daddy.

477
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,152
Hi, Wen.

478
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:53,987
Hey.

479
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,156
Oh!

480
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,436
Adriane, can you help me out here?

481
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,981
- Adriane.
- Hey, yeah.

482
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,024
What?

483
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,860
Help me take Redmond outside.

484
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,030
We'll cover him with a blanket.

485
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,796
Wen, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to
change the channel for a little bit, okay?

486
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,340
Go fuck yourself, Mister Rogers.

487
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,800
<i>I want you to try a piece of this.</i>

488
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:41,261
<i>I want to see whether the air fryer oven</i>

489
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:44,515
- <i>makes it just as crispy…
</i>- Please watch the TV.

490
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:45,974
- It should be on soon.
<i>- I'm not even gonna kid you.</i>

491
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:47,601
<i>I really just want this.</i>

492
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,145
<i>Do you hear that gorgeous crispy crunch?</i>

493
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,523
Doesn't get much better than that.

494
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,857
<i>Mmm!</i>

495
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,150
<i>And it tastes amazing.</i>

496
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,986
<i>Amazing fried chicken
and a lot less guilt.</i>

497
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:04,034
<i>We continue with our coverage
of the earthquake</i>

498
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:08,121
<i>centered in the Aleutian Islands,
which struck more than four hours ago.</i>

499
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:10,165
<i>The US National Tsunami Warning Center</i>

500
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:13,919
<i>has issued a cautionary advisory
to British Columbia, Canada,</i>

501
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:17,965
<i>and more than a thousand miles of coast
along the American Pacific Northwest,</i>

502
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,717
<i>including the cities
of Seattle and Portland.</i>

503
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,344
<i>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</i>

504
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:25,389
<i>issued its strongest warning
to the islands of Hawaii.</i>

505
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,266
Is this what we're supposed to see?

506
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,809
<i>…high schools, malls
and colleges's campuses…</i>

507
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,603
I explained to you what would happen
as a result of you not choosing.

508
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,897
A plague will be released
by Redmond's death.

509
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,275
You have to listen to me. I remember,
but this doesn't mean anything.

510
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,986
- It doesn't mean...
- No! Just watch!

511
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:42,781
I know I shouldn't yell.

512
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,409
I know you're afraid of me, of us.

513
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,619
Just… please watch.

514
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,706
<i>…points to a sizable wave
of 15 to 20 feet in height</i>

515
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>headed south
towards the Hawaiian Islands.</i>

516
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,587
{\an8}<i>We do have information
that the tsunami has made landfall.</i>

517
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,714
{\an8}<i>Now, as you can tell from our live feed,</i>

518
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:02,134
{\an8}<i>this resort on Kauai
has already been evacuated.</i>

519
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:13,562
<i>Our early warning detection systems
gave plenty of time to evacuate the coasts</i>

520
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,398
<i>and low-laying areas
at the affected Hawaiian Islands.</i>

521
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,192
<i>No injuries or fatalities
have been reported.</i>

522
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:21,653
Please let Eric and Wen go at least.
Eric has a concussion.

523
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,031
<i>…sending aid to a few reportedly capsized…</i>

524
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,240
I'll stay.

525
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,952
And we can talk about doomsday
or the apocalypse

526
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,246
or mass traumatic events
of the 21st century all you want.

527
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,209
- I don't understand, this isn't the...
- Sabrina, just keep watching.

528
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,920
Until we see what was shown to us.

529
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:47,304
<i>A second massive earthquake
has struck in the Pacific,</i>

530
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,765
<i>registering 8.6 on the Richter scale.</i>

531
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,519
<i>The epicenter is only 70 miles
off the coast of Oregon</i>

532
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:56,146
<i>in what's called
the Cascadia Subduction Zone.</i>

533
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,567
{\an8}<i>That's an area scientists have long feared
would produce a catastrophic earthquake.</i>

534
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,153
Unbelievable.

535
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,364
There it is.

536
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,407
We did this.

537
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,410
It's really fucking happening.

538
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:13,622
- <i>…triggered this second quake now…
</i>- Oh, Jesus, God.

539
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,959
<i>…five minutes,
and given the proximity of the epicenter,</i>

540
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:21,296
<i>people on the coast are gonna
have mere minutes to try to find shelter.</i>

541
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,008
<i>A tsunami triggered by a quake
of this magnitude</i>

542
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,595
<i>and proximity to the shoreline
will be massive.</i>

543
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,100
<i>I-I mean, 50-foot-high bluffs
along the coast are not gonna be safe.</i>

544
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,434
{\an8}<i>And we've just gotten word</i>

545
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,062
{\an8}<i>the tsunami has indeed
hit the Oregon shoreline,</i>

546
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:40,858
<i>and we have footage
shot minutes ago from Cannon Beach.</i>

547
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,696
Holy crap, this is what I saw.

548
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,657
The same jutting rocks.

549
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,950
Me too.

550
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,577
Wen,

551
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,622
go to your room
till I tell you to come out.

552
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,722
She didn't need to see this.

553
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:57,100
Tomorrow morning,
you can make the difficult,

554
00:41:57,643 --> 00:42:00,479
selfless choice of sacrifice
and save the world…

555
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,149
or you can choose once again

556
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:08,278
to let the clock move another minute
closer to permanent midnight.

557
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:16,787
For the rest of today and tonight,
we'll tend to your needs within reason.

558
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,416
But otherwise,
we'll leave you be to reflect

559
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,002
and talk it over.

560
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,714
- We told you.
- You have to believe us.

561
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:31,593
It doesn't matter if we believe your
craziness. The answer is still the same.

562
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,472
Everyone in the world can die,
as far as we're concerned.

563
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,974
Am I right, Eric?

564
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:40,978
Eric?

565
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,273
You okay?

566
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:46,567
I'm okay.

567
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,864
I just need a moment.

568
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,743
I have a little surprise

569
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,328
- queued up for you.
- Ooh, a surprise!

570
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,163
- What's that gonna be?
- Are you ready?

571
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,834
- Yeah!
- Oh!

572
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,004
- Are we gonna sing along?
- Yes, of course.

573
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,172

Except for the... the main road
being further away than we thought,

589
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,518
I'm officially impressed.

590
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:04,520
Okay.

591
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,272
- Hey, Wen, come get your bag.
- Wen?

592
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,024
Wen, come on.

593
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:12,861
Wen, come check out the view.
It's better than the website.

594
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:18,116
How many grasshoppers did you catch?

595
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,493
Just one so far.

596
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:20,702
Her name's Liv.

597
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,079
Ooh, you see any bears yet?

598
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,497
Andrew, don't start.

599
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,124
If we joke about it,
she won't take it seriously.

600
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,585
We won't leave the garbage out,
we'll be fine.

601
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:33,423
Wen, show Daddy Eric
your scary bear face.

602
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,470
Wen, run from... Run!

603
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:41,390
Hey, Wenling, sweetie, not too close.
That dock might have rusty nails.

604
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,393
Eric, come on with your rusty nails.
We got so lucky with this place.

605
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,019
Whoo!

606
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,104
Get in!

607
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,314
Come on, Wen!

608
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,693
- Come on!
- Oh!

609
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:54,403
Whoo!

610
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:55,779
Whoa!

611
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,616
- Here I come!
- Eric, come!

612
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,368
He's coming in!

613
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,578
Oh, come on.

614
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,121
Hold on, one second, one second.

615
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:07,040
Coming right at you.

616
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,417
- Here I come.
- Yes, yes, yes!

617
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,967
- Oh, it's a cold spot!
- Look at you swimming!

618
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,931
Just applying a little pressure.

619
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,851
Told you I'm a nurse.

620
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,730
You may not be on board
with all the "end of the world" stuff yet,

621
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,607
but at least trust me on that.

622
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,276
None of us wanted it to go this way.

623
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,529
We need you
in a clear state of mind.

624
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,449
You've got a big decision to make.

625
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:46,121
You think I'm some kind of
religious freak, right?

626
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,707
I would too.

627
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,835
Truth is, I haven't even been to church

628
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,421
since my grandma forced me to go
when I was little.

629
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:58,717
I always thought religious stuff
was so tired and boring,

630
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,137
from another time,
when people were scared of shadows.

631
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,101
Then the visions started.

632
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,900
I didn't believe it
at first, either.

633
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,862
But you will.

634
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,954
When I was a kid,
my dad used to say to me,

635
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:30,791
"Trust in something
more than you."

636
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:36,880
It's sort of become my mantra
these past few days.

637
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,759
I said it when I saw the visions.

638
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,096
I said it when I built my weapon

639
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,265
exactly the way it was shown to me.

640
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:47,975
I said it over and over

641
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,936
as I passed every freeway exit
on my way here.

642
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,651
I said it when I walked out
onto the boardwalk and I saw the others.

643
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:01,530
We were all wearing the same colors
we saw in our visions.

644
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,658
That's when I knew I wasn't alone.

645
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,122
And all of this…

646
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,709
…is real.

647
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:21,633
And I'm saying it to you now, Eric,
you need to trust something more than you.

648
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:25,262
You may not want to believe it,
but we're all on the same side.

649
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,058
I'm on my family's side.

650
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:07,638
Eric?

651
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,474
You really okay?

652
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:15,312
My head's still ringing,
but my vision is clearer.

653
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,908
You know that first earthquake happened
a whole four hours ago, right?

654
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,493
Before they showed up here.

655
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,037
Leonard's checked his watch
a thousand times.

656
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,206
They've been timing all of this.

657
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,208
I know.

658
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:43,715
I just don't want you to…

659
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,012
I don't want you to be spooked
or anything.

660
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,306
- You think I believe them?
- No.

661
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,018
No, it's just…

662
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:59,147
With your head and all, I want
to make sure you're thinking straight.

663
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,483
Without them trying to manipulate us.

664
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:04,820
They take you alone in there
and try and talk to you.

665
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,488
I don't believe them.

666
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:14,663
I'm trying to keep it together.

667
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:17,374
This isn't gonna work.
They're never gonna believe us, man.

668
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,711
We have to believe in
what we're doing, what our goal is here.

669
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:23,797
Did you see
Redmond's fucking face?

670
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,382
It was just crazy.

671
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,593
Say whatever it is
you have to say to them.

672
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,094
Convince them.

673
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,537
Wen!

674
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,168
Wen!

675
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,634
Wen!

676
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,224
Wen!

677
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,000
No!

678
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,806
I'm afraid the rule is
that no one's allowed to leave.

679
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,892
Were you trying to escape, Wen?

680
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:02,020
Leave her alone.
I told her to do it.

681
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,023
You're just scared, Wen.

682
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,901
We all are.

683
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,028
You'll ask us to choose again.

684
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,906
Don't listen to them, Wen.

685
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:16,201
We were targeted.

686
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:20,247
We've always been targeted. We...

687
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:22,666
Andrew!

688
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,590
I knew I recognized him.

689
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:38,348
Redmond…

690
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,934
is the guy from the bar.

691
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,144
What?

692
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,271
Are you sure?

693
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,898
What guy from the bar?

694
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,610
Andrew was attacked by a man
at a bar in Boston many years ago.

695
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,113
The man went to jail for a short while.
But his name was O'Bannon.

696
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,531
It's him.

697
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,367
He's gained weight
and his beard's different, but it's him.

698
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,369
His name was Redmond.

699
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,164
We don't know dick about him,
Leonard.

700
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,833
We all met him for the first time
on that boardwalk.

701
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,084
Stop the bullshit!

702
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,129
This is all some kind of sick scam
to get us to hurt each other.

703
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,214
That's not true.

704
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:12,090
We don't know why each of us is here.

705
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,134
It's a coincidence
the man who attacked me

706
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:16,678
and had me in years of therapy
is one of your group?

707
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,222
Go get his wallet.

708
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:20,182
I'll show you his name isn't Redmond.

709
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,434
No, we're not doing that.

710
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:23,519
Why?

711
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,273
Because it doesn't matter
what his name is.

712
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:30,234
Okay? We all had the visions.

713
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,735
This has to be exact.

714
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,904
Everything has to be right.

715
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,574
Didn't he tell us about this cabin
on the message board first?

716
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,786
- And then we all had visions of the cabin?
- I don't know. It...

717
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,579
No, we had the visions first.

718
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:43,830
Message board?

719
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:50,128
Look, we're not doubting
why we're here.

720
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,550
Go to sleep.

721
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:59,054
The sun will rise,
maybe for the last time for all of us.

722
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:02,099
The premise of your scam is flawed.

723
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,727
I'm a human rights attorney,
Leonard.

724
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,437
How about I show you photos of kids

725
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:10,941
who have been tortured and killed,
lying in piles?

726
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,944
You want to make a case
for humanity to go on, you're gonna lose.

727
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,747
This is a picture
of some of the kids I coach.

728
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,751
This year,
the boys had a record of 3-8.

729
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,462
The girls, 5-6.

730
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,090
So, we're not very good.

731
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:39,553
If you could hear them laugh,
you'd understand why I'm here.

732
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,141
Maybe you'd sleep better
if you could see each other easier.

- Okay.

749
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:27,160
You guys met on some kind
of message board, right?

750
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:28,912
You're having a shared delusion.

751
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,039
That's a uniquely
21st-century health crisis.

752
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,374
It is real.

753
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,252
You're in an echo chamber.
You know that, right?

754
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:38,755
You got online,
and you found random people

755
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,383
who had random visions
and you took that as evidence.

756
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:45,179
Remember the guy who shot up three people
in an Army base in Louisiana?

757
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,972
He was part of an online group like yours.

758
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,391
They posted videos
about how the shadow government

759
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:52,144
was stalking them
and using mind control weapons

760
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,104
in an attempt to destroy their lives.

761
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,692
We found each other online
because we said we had the same visions.

762
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:00,527
Remember what
you did at Thanksgiving?

763
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:03,113
And then we decided
to meet on the boardwalk.

764
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,824
You're gonna do that if I nod.

765
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,285
Okay, let's continue.

766
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,884
You have the opportunity to choose.

767
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:29,139
I don't mean to rush you,

768
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,975
but we're gonna ask
for your decisions very fast now.

769
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,105
I'm gonna be straight up.

770
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,610
I'm the next one to go.

771
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,489
I'm counting on you, man.

772
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,242
You're, like, my last hope here.

773
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:51,787
Adriane,
you can walk out of here right now.

774
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:55,415
Just walk out and see,
nothing will happen.

775
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,793
None of this can stop
until you make a choice.

776
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,503
Don't you get that already?

777
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,548
You think I want to be here?

778
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:05,217
I'm just some fucking cook.

779
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:10,430
I didn't tell you at first,
but I have a son.

780
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:13,016
I didn't want to speak his name,

781
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,478
but here I am,
begging you to do what has to be done

782
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,481
because if you don't, my son is gonna die.

783
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,985
Over the last few days,
I've had to watch him die

784
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,070
over and over and over again.

785
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:28,657
I've watched my little boy burned alive
as I held him in my arms.

786
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,243
Everything was burning.

787
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,955
I can't get the sound of his screams
out of my head,

788
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:36,915
even right now, so…

789
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:42,296
…as a mother, believe me when
I tell you that this is really happening.

790
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:45,799
And it's up to you.

791
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:47,676
What exactly did you guys see?

792
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:49,094
Stop talking to him.

793
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,014
He doesn't believe you.

794
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:54,099
None of us believe you.

795
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:56,935
Let your time run out.

796
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:59,855
We're not gonna do
what you want us to do.

797
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,198
His name is Charlie.

798
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,953
He likes pancakes.

799
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:38,852
Very well.

800
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,899
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

801
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:49,112
You don't have to do this.

802
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,489
You guys are delusional.

803
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:52,991
You are part of a suicide cult.
Can't you see that?

804
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,711
Stop! Please stop this!

805
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:44,585
A part of humanity has been judged.

806
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,945
I'll move her into the other room
so they don't have to see her.

807
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,509
Hundreds of thousands of people
are going to die now.

808
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,887
We've unleashed a second plague.

809
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:40,933
Bullshit.

810
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:46,021
Sabrina, put on the TV, please.

811
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:58,450
<i>There have also been new
developments with the novel X-Nine virus,</i>

812
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:01,119
<i>which is proving particularly fatal
to children.</i>

813
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:06,875
<i>The X-Nine virus is highly transmittable
amongst children age ten and under.</i>

814
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:11,129
<i>These outbreaks seem to be originating
in three distinct pockets of the world:</i>

815
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:15,717
{\an8}<i>Cape Town, Suffolk, England,
and outside Nashville in Tennessee.</i>

816
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,096
{\an8}<i>Lockdowns in these areas
have already begun</i>

817
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:23,016
<i>as numbers rise along with fear
for the safety of those infected.</i>

818
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,894
<i>Numerous public schools
have been suspended</i>

819
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:29,857
<i>with some being converted
into makeshift quarantine facilities.</i>

820
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,609
<i>While there is hope
that the virus will be contained</i>

821
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:35,654
- <i>to the geographical pockets in question…
</i>- I think I saw something, Andrew.

822
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:37,698
<i>…these communities
are trapped in lockdown.</i>

823
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,241
What?

824
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:40,534
What are you saying?

825
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:42,411
I think I saw a person.

826
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,413
Or a figure.

827
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,582
Turn the TV off.

828
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,669
Where'd you see a figure?

829
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,839
In the light behind you.

830
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,049
In the reflection in the mirror.

831
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,844
When you were standing
behind Redmond.

832
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,513
Right before you struck him.

833
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:05,350
Eric, look at me.

834
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:09,229
You have a severe concussion.

835
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:12,149
She even told you
you would be extremely sensitive to light.

836
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:14,651
We're under extreme stress here.

837
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:18,030
I need you to listen
to the words I'm saying.

838
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:19,865
Breathe in for a second, okay?

839
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,417
I've been reading about these X-Nine cases
for months already. You know that.

840
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,085
It isn't a fucking plague.

841
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:34,129
It's a news report.

842
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:37,090
They all knew about it
before they showed up here

843
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:39,635
and knowingly made it
a part of their narrative.

844
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:44,848
And this guy has been checking his watch
all morning, just like yesterday.

845
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,642
- Come on, Andrew.
- All four of you have watches.

846
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,393
What, you just showed up here
like that? No.

847
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:50,395
You knew you were coming out
to this particular cabin

848
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:52,231
where cell reception wouldn't exist.

849
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:54,650
Did you see the banner
at the bottom of the screen?

850
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,528
It isn't live. It's preprogramming.
It's a TV show.

851
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:01,698
Leonard, Sabrina, all of them knew
this X-Nine show would be on

852
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,242
- and at what time.
- Andrew, this virus

853
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,618
- is gonna spread everywhere.
- If you...

854
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,662
It's a fucking preprogrammed show!

855
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:09,665
They knew this virus show
would be on at this time,

856
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:12,626
just like they knew the Alaskan earthquake
and the tsunami warning

857
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,128
had already happened
before they showed up here.

858
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,221
I'm clearheaded now.

859
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,476
Always together.

860
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:36,984
You don't talk to him from now on.
You talk to me.

861
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:48,370
I want to watch <i>Paddington and Chloe</i> now!
I want to watch <i>Paddington and Chloe</i>!

862
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,539
Wen.

863
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:53,500
I want to watch a cartoon now!

864
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:56,044
Wen, okay, we're gonna count down
from five together, and we're not

865
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,838
- gonna yell anymore, okay?
- I want to watch it now!

866
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,047
Wen. Five…

867
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,924
- I want to watch <i>Paddington and Chloe</i> now!
- …four…

868
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,801
- Okay, let's try this again.
- I want to watch a cartoon!

869
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:04,761
Wen, take a deep breath.

870
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,388
And five…

871
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,307
- four…
- I want to watch <i>Paddington and Chloe</i> now!

872
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,100
Wen. Three…

873
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:13,103
- Get away from my family, fucking losers!
- Eric! Eric!

874
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,230
Eric! Eric! Please stop. Please.

875
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,357
- Stop! That's my dad.
- Everyone needs you.

876
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:19,568
No! No, I don't believe you!

877
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,945
- Eric, please. Please stop…
- No. No, no. Back away from me.

878
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,071
Don't you look at me.

879
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:24,531
Don't you look at me.
Don't you look at my daughter!

880
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:26,200
You don't understand what you're doing!

881
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:27,284
- I don't fucking believe you! No!
- Please!

882
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:31,413
No! No, I don't believe a word you say!
Fuck you!

883
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,586
Andrew.

884
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,765
I hit you in the knee
just so you wouldn't run away.

885
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:52,809
This is triage,
like in an emergency room.

886
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:55,020
We have to make the decision
to save the most lives.

887
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,648
We have to help each other.
We have to help each other.

888
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:14,498
Open up! Andrew, listen to me!

889
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,416
Andrew.

890
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:23,423
Come on.

891
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,552
Please! Come out!

892
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:29,054
Come on.

893
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,305
Stay away from me.

894
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,850
Stay away from me! I will kill you!

895
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,935
Stay away from me!

896
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:42,442
Please stop!

897
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:53,328
Leave whatever you're going for,
get out of the car and come inside!

898
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't want to have to hurt you!

899
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,668
Come back inside!

900
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:01,545
Now!

901
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,672
We don't have time for this! Please!

902
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,048
Andrew, trust me!

903
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:15,684
Now, you listen to me,
you crazy fucking bitch.

904
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:18,562
You drop that thing
and back the fuck up.

905
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,314
Okay. Okay.

906
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,859
- Back the fuck up!
- Okay!

907
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,361
Keep going!

908
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:27,696
Okay, okay.

909
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:28,780
Move!

910
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:30,365
Breathe.

911
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:36,955
Stop. Stop!

912
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,801
Fuck. Fuck.

913
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:06,735
Stay back!

914
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:10,447
I believe you were chosen because your
family's love for each other is so pure.

915
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:14,201
I know you've been through a lot,
and people haven't been fair to you.

916
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,124
Drop the weapon
and move away from Eric,

917
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,919
or I'll show you I was chosen
to put a bullet in your head.

918
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:26,296
Drop it now, Leonard,
or I'll kill you!

919
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:28,632
You're dooming us all, Andrew.

920
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,969
You're dooming your husband.
You're dooming your daughter...

921
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,345
I'm done with you!

922
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,806
I'm not listening
to another goddamn word you say!

923
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:39,810
It's time for the next sacrifice.

924
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,729
Are you willing to make a choice?

925
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,398
You're crazy.

926
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:49,903
I'm taking my family
and I'm leaving.

927
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:54,449
Andrew!

928
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:09,590
You have a temper.

929
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,968
Not in a scary way, just…

930
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:15,637
It's there.

931
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:18,223
You're uptight.

932
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:23,770
You can…
suck the life out of any situation.

933
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,314
Hey, we said you have to qualify things.

934
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:27,858
I'm sorry. You...

935
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,068
You suck the life out of some situations.

936
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:32,988
I'll accept that.

937
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:34,948
It's not a bad list.

938
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,453
I think most parents
would have a worse list than that.

939
01:08:40,828 --> 01:08:42,663
I can't believe
we're actually gonna do this.

940
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:44,666
I have never,

941
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,544
for one second of my life,

942
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:50,339
ever doubted loving you.

943
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:54,176
The kid'll be washed in that every day.

944
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:58,514
How is it you can say stuff like that
out of nowhere?

945
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:00,724
You guys keep it down?

946
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,478
Were we being loud?

947
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,898
I'm trying to have a drink
with my friends.

948
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,443
Oh, we were being too loud?

949
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,363
Is that what it is?

950
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:18,742
Get your drunk ass back to your seat.

951
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:21,703
Fuck you.

952
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:24,831
♪ <i>And the Southern Central Freight</i> ♪

953
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:26,582
♪ <i>Got to keep on pushin', mama</i> ♪

954
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,042
You shouldn't provoke them.

955
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,211
I wasn't provoking...

956
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,421
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

957
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,549
What the fuck?
Andrew, are you okay?

958
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,260
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

959
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,513
Somebody call an ambulance!

960
01:09:39,595 --> 01:09:41,515
Andrew! Andrew, look at me.

961
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,433
Andrew, look at me. Are you okay?

962
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:44,977
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

963
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,310
Can you hear me?

964
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,395
Andrew!

965
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,795
All right,
so what you got here is an HK P30.

966
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:15,299
German engineered, very light,
very easy to handle.

967
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,678
Um, pretty much good for any scenario.

968
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,054
Carry, home protection.

969
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,598
Screw 'em, right?

970
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:28,854
I'll take it.

971
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,370
No, Leonard.

972
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,335
Are you willing to make a sacrifice?

973
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:54,338
No more, you bastard.

974
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,594
A part of humanity has been judged.

975
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:18,362
The four of us
can't make this decision.

976
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,989
It's got to be your choice.

977
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:22,407
Shut your mouth.

978
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,329
Keep an eye on Leonard.

979
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,624
Yell if he does anything.

980
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,452
It's O'Bannon.

981
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,256
They were here to torture us.

982
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,049
We don't know why we were chosen.

983
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:23,302
Don't say another word
of your horseshit!

984
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:26,096
None of this is real,
and you were targeting us!

985
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:28,432
I always look for motive, Leonard.

986
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,936
How about a crazy bigot
meets a bartender from a bar somewhere,

987
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,191
and they find a woman from a small town
who has extreme religious beliefs.

988
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,192
That's not true.

989
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:41,403
Then they come across a young woman
who can be persuaded of anything.

990
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:44,489
I didn't believe for a second
that Adriane had a kid, Leonard!

991
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:50,621
Now, I'm not a murderer like you guys,
so I'm gonna lock you in that bathroom.

992
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:54,625
They slashed our tires,

993
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,837
but they must've come
in a truck or a vehicle.

994
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,216
We need to get to that vehicle.

995
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,594
You're wrong about all of us.

996
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,055
Now get in that bathroom, Leonard.

997
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:11,767
And make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you if I have to.

998
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,194
We need
something to tie the doorknob to.

999
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:23,445
The lamp.

1000
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:26,532
Here.

1001
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,454
Okay. Come on. Come on.

1002
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,252
He broke the window.

1003
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,545
He got out.

1004
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,382
He's gonna come get us!

1005
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,764
He's gonna get to the car before us.

1006
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:54,852
He could be outside and hurt us.
We have to make sure he's in the bathroom.

1007
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:57,688
Leonard?

1008
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:04,069
If I open this door and I see you,
I will shoot you.

1009
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:08,490
Leonard!

1010
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:07,382
Get off me!

1011
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:20,687
Fuck.

1012
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:22,940
Fuck.

1013
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,157
- I thought you wouldn't kill us.
- I won't.

1014
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:36,578
But I will shoot you in the leg
to keep you from leaving this cabin.

1015
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:39,122
Turn on the TV
if you want to be convinced.

1016
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:42,918
You'll see that everything I said
was gonna happen has happened.

1017
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,379
- No one's gonna do what you say...
<i>- More terrifying images</i>

1018
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:47,965

- <i>…plummet to the ground.

1020
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:57,307
- Why did you turn it on?
- <i>Local and international governments</i>

1021
01:15:57,391 --> 01:16:00,644

any correlation between the crashes.</i>

01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:06,358
<i>We have yet to receive death tolls or
receive any statements from the airlines.</i>

1023
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,791
You said it wasn't real.

1024
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:53,238
"The skies will fall and crash
to the earth like pieces of glass."

1025
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:55,532
"And God's fingers will scorch the earth,

1026
01:16:57,075 --> 01:17:00,245

1027

01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,233
- Excuse me.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

1037
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:32,319
It is hard to describe
the images that we are seeing.

1038
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:36,323
They fill us with disquietude and horror.

1039
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:38,742
We are witnessing a collective tragedy

1040
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:41,203
unfathomable only moments before.

1041
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:46,083
We are getting word of more airline...

1042
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,670
How the fuck did you know
what she was gonna say?

1043
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:53,257
Is this some closed-circuit TV?
Did you guys pump this in?

1044
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,550
Maybe the truth is…

1045
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,471
…that the end was happening
long before we got to this cabin.

1046
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:03,308
And what we're seeing now
isn't the fireworks.

1047
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:06,603
It's just the final flickering sparks.

1048
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,065
I don't know what's going on here,

1049
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:12,860
but where are the keys
to the truck you guys came in?

1050
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:13,944
Andrew.

1051
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:17,072
I'm taking my family,
and we're leaving.

1052
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,244
Do you really think that
everything that happened today…

1053
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,039
everything we've seen…

1054
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:31,211
Do you really think it's all
just a coincidence?

1055
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:33,297
Yes.

1056
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:35,674
I think it's all a coincidence.

1057
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:39,052
Some horrible, unexplainable coincidence.

1058
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,263
Or it has to be a trick.

1059
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:42,764
I have to believe that!

1060
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,851
You already don't believe that.

1061
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,189
I know when someone's lying.

1062
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,691
Eric…

1063
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,277
let's go.

1064
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:00,741
Let's get out of here and never come back.

1065
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,745
Don't listen to Leonard anymore.

1066
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,096
Can everyone come out
onto the back deck now?

1067
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,893
I'd like to do this last part outside.

1068
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,401
What are you doing with that,
Leonard?

1069
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:41,865
When I'm gone, you'll only
have minutes to stop everything.

1070
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,284
After that, it'll be too late.

1071
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:47,829
Will all the children die?

1072
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:51,124
Wen, I want you to take your music
and your headphones

1073
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,252
and go to that tree house
that we climbed in.

1074
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,129
Put your music on
until one of us comes to get you.

1075
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:57,923
Do what Daddy says, okay?

1076
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,011
I love you, chicken.

1077
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,263
I love you too.

1078
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:07,140
Go. Go.

1079
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:11,228
Nothing can happen
to the three of us.

1080
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:13,063
You'll be okay.

1081
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,403
The worst thing about the visions
was the screaming.

1082
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:22,906
I could hear everyone screaming.

1083
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:29,663
And I knew when the visions ended,
the screaming was just gonna go on and on.

1084
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:38,172
You know what I loved most
about teaching kids?

1085
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:42,217
They believe everything you say.

1086
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:45,137
So you have to be careful.

1087
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:50,100
Say only what you know,
what you know to be true.

1088
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,562
It's a big responsibility.

1089
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,903
Maybe one of the kids I taught
will do something great for the world.

1090
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,572
What do you think?

1091
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,161
Please…

1092
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:15,876
my new friends, Eric, Andrew…

1093
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:23,634
will you make a choice and save the world?

1094
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:37,689
All of humanity has been judged.

1095
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,339
We still have a few minutes, he said.

1096
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:48,552
Eric.

1097
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:51,638
There was something in the light.

1098
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:52,890
A figure.

1099
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:00,689
And I feel it now.

1100
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,615
I believe you.

1101
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:13,827
Let's the three of us leave.

1102
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,002
Maybe this is the way it's always been.

1103
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:26,965
Maybe families have been deciding this
all through time.

1104
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:31,803
Let's just walk the earth, then.

1105
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,097
The three of us.

1106
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,184
What kind of life is that for Wen?

1107
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:42,147
Andrew, this wasn't a home invasion.

1108
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:45,734
They didn't target us.

1109
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,070
They came here to spend time with us…

1110
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,157
for us to get to know them.

1111
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:55,577
They remind us of all aspects of humanity.

1112
01:23:57,246 --> 01:23:58,497
Redmond, malice.

1113
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,208
<i>Adriane, nurturing.</i>

1114
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,502
<i>Sabrina, healing.</i>

1115
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:06,463
<i>Leonard, guidance.</i>

1116
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,176
They're the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

1117
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,012
I believe we had to see them die.
We had to feel their loss.

1118
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,306
Why us?

1119
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:20,018
We're nothing special.

1120
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:23,230
Because I know what I felt
when we saw Wen in that orphanage

1121
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,190
and we were together for the first time.

1122
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:27,609
It's our decision.

1123
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:32,739
It's our fucking decision?

1124
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,120
We're supposed to give up our love
for them?

1125
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:39,413
It's a sacrifice, Andrew.

1126
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:43,125
That we would be willing to give up
something so beautiful to us

1127
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,210
- for everyone else.
- They're not worth it!

1128
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,462
They hate us, Eric.

1129
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:49,006
They hate that we exist.

1130
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:51,758
They're just scared. Like all of us.

1131
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,468
They're monsters.

1132
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:55,095
They destroy everything.

1133
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:56,513
They hurt each other.

1134
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:58,807
You're not just a prosecutor.
You know there's something to defend.

1135
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,185
That's where your anger comes from,
Andrew.

1136
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:02,686
Kill me.

1137
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:03,979
No, sweetheart.

1138
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:07,482
We're running out of time.

1139
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:10,235
Maybe I saw a figure,
maybe I just made it up,

1140
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:12,905
but it's giving me peace.
My mind is set in its truth.

1141
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:15,490
I won't be scared.

1142
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:18,994
You gotta do it now.
We're out of time. All of us.

1143
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,621
I don't believe in them, Eric.

1144
01:25:20,704 --> 01:25:21,830
I do.

1145
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:26,001
Do it while I'm thinking
the most beautiful thought

1146
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:27,753
so that I can have that feeling
in my heart

1147
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,255
to take me right to wherever it is
I'm going.

1148
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,967
It's almost time. I can feel it.

1149
01:25:34,051 --> 01:25:35,469
Kill me, Eric, please.

1150
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:39,431
Please. Please.

1151
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:41,934
I'm thinking about our daughter
in the future.

1152
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:49,274
When she's living her life
exactly as she wanted to.

1153
01:25:51,777 --> 01:25:53,320
She's got her own practice.

1154
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:55,697
<i>You're there with her.</i>

1155
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:59,993
<i>You guys are locking up her office
because you guys are going to dinner.</i>

1156
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:04,790
<i>She is everything we always hoped for.</i>

1157
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:11,338
<i>She's still got her crazy laugh.</i>

1158
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:14,842
<i>She still asks everybody questions
about everything.</i>

1159
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:22,391
She found someone who loves her
and who she loves just as much.

1160
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:26,562
Just like her dads.

1161
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:41,034
Eric.

1162
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:45,998
Eric.

1163
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:12,774
Did Daddy Eric save everyone?

1164
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,088
Did we stop it in time?

1165
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:03,427
There's a diner over there.

1166
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:20,903
<i>The only thing we could
do was climb out of the upstairs window</i>

1167
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:22,738
onto the roof…

1168
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:26,116
<i>…but water kept climbing higher
and higher.</i>

1169
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:28,452
<i>No one could hear us.</i>

1170
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,580
<i>Standing on the roof
with my daughters, my girls,</i>

1171
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:33,665
<i>I thought it was the end.</i>

1172
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:36,793
<i>And two of my girls, they can't...
They can't swim.</i>

1173
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:40,756
<i>And the water just stopped rising.</i>

1174
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:42,299
Switch to the other one.

1175
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:45,219
<i>The last of the planes in Australia
and Russia have landed safely.</i>

1176
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:48,430
<i>Families are rushing to airports,
searching for their loved ones.</i>

1177
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:50,432
{\an8}<i>Amidst this chaos are emotional scenes…</i>

1178
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:54,019
{\an8}<i>We were rolling the bodies out into
the parking lot because there wasn't room.</i>

1179
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:56,813
{\an8}<i>This past hour is the first time
in many, many hours</i>

1180
01:29:56,897 --> 01:29:58,857
<i>that we haven't had a death in the ICU.</i>

1181
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:01,652
{\an8}<i>Actually, we're coming up
on our second hour here of no deaths.</i>

1182
01:30:01,735 --> 01:30:02,736
I know.

1183
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:06,073
I love you so much.

1184
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:09,409
Everything's gonna be okay.

1185
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:19,336
{\an8}<i>The sudden lightning strikes that set fire
to many areas have not returned.</i>

1186
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:21,755
<i>Though several fires have yet
to be extinguished</i>

1187
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:25,217
<i>and the damage to regions
both rural and urban across Great Britain</i>

1188
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,845
