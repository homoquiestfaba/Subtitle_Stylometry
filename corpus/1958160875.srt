1
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,915
<i>And now, let's</i>
<i>meet our first contestant.</i>

2
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,084
<i>Will you come in and sign in,</i>
<i>please?</i>

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,022
<i>All right.</i>

4
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,058
<i>Now with that, let's begin</i>
<i>the general questioning</i>

5
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,592
<i>with Arlene Francis.</i>

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,962
<i>Are you associated</i>
<i>with any of the arts?</i>

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,329
<i>Yes.</i>

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,999
<i>Would you ever</i>
<i>have been seen on television?</i>

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,533
<i>Yes.</i>

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>Are you a performer?</i>

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,104
<i>Yes.</i>

12
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,606
<i>Would you be</i>
<i>considered a leading man?</i>

13
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,109
<i>Yes.</i>

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,045
<i>I think the last answer</i>

15
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>is misleading, and we could not</i>
<i>accurately describe our guest</i>

16
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,217
<i>- as a leading man.</i>
<i>- He's a misleading man.</i>

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,419
<i>Do you have anything</i>
<i>to do with...</i>

18
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,523
<i>sports or any form</i>
<i>of athletic endeavor?</i>

19
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,895
<i>Yes.</i>

20
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,997
<i>No, I think</i>
<i>it would be too misleading</i>

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>to suggest that our guest had a</i>
<i>basic affiliation with sports.</i>

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,138
<i>Do you use</i>
<i>anything in your hands</i>

23
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,772
<i>for your job?</i>

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,077
<i>Like a pencil or a typewriter</i>
<i>or anything like that?</i>

25
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,879
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- Oh,</i>

26
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>would you be considered</i>
<i>a writer?</i>

27
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,249
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i><i>- Yes.</i>

28
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,784
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>this man doesn't do.</i>

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,519
<i>Have you had...</i>
<i>I'm terribly lost.</i>

30
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,991
<i>- Does he write humorously?</i>
<i>- Do you write humorously?</i>

31
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,526
<i>Yes and no.</i>

32
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,196
<i>Oh.</i>

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,764
<i>Um...</i>

34
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,335
<i>Does he ever do</i>
<i>any drawing like comic strips?</i>

35
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,402
<i>Yes.</i>

36
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,940
<i>Yes?</i>

37
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,775
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>quite unusual about our guest?</i>

38
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,579
<i>Because everything that</i>
<i>he does,</i>

39
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,148
<i>the audience laughs about.</i>

40
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,649
<i>You are a human being?</i>

41
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,418
<i>Very much so, Bennett.</i>

42
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,719
- <i>Very much so.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,156
<i>He's still maintaining</i>
<i>that he's a performer?</i>

44
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,026
<i>Well, yes, in the degree</i>
<i>that he was asked</i>

45
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,061
<i>if he had anything</i>
<i>to do with the arts</i>

46
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,896
<i>and then was asked</i>
<i>if he was a performer.</i>

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,498
<i>Oh! Ask if he could use</i>
<i>his mustache to paint.</i>

48
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,433
<i>Oh!</i>

49
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,939
<i>Uh, have you a, uh, a mustache</i>
<i>that is rather well known?</i>

50
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,841
<i>In fact, could you be almost</i>
<i>caricatured just by that?</i>

51
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,044
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Oh, well thank you, Arlene.</i>

52
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,711
<i>Are you Salvador Dalí?</i>

53
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,446
<i><i>Salvador Dalí is right!</i>

54
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,317
<i>Salvador Dalí</i>
<i>on the 1950s game show,</i>

55
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,750
What's My Line?

56
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,353
<i>The world's most famous</i>
<i>living artist</i>

57
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,822
<i>has been gravely injured</i>
<i>in a fire at his home.</i>

58
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,723
<i>Dalí is now</i>
<i>in critical condition</i>

59
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,926
<i>in hospital in Figueres, Spain.</i>

60
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,646
<i>And Catalonia.</i>

61
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,793
Yes, Gala. Yes, I understand.

62
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,196
You need the money now, but...

63
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,233
No, no, that was not
what we agreed in the contract.

64
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,037
But I can't come
with it now myself. I have...

65
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,106
<i>Bring it now,</i>
<i>you understand?</i>

66
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,207
Yes, Gala.

67
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,942
- Yes.
<i>- You owe money.</i>

68
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,477
<i>Dalí's money. Bring it!</i>

69
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,278
<i>You bring money!</i>

70
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,886
This is your first time,

71
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,422
so this is very, very important.

72
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,891
You are going
to the St. Regis Hotel.

73
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,826
Salvador Dalí and his wife

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,560
spend every winter there.

75
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,596
<i>He is a man of rituals.</i>

76
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,832
<i>Always the same suite, 1610.</i>

77
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,869
<i>For 20 years, that has been</i>
<i>his home in New York.</i>

78
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,788
Thank you.

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,168
Are you here for Gala?

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,072
How did you know?

81
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,773
They weren't supposed
to send anybody until tomorrow.

82
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,177
- I'm sorry?
- You're going to have to...

83
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,511
zhuzh yourself up a bit.

84
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,614
I work at Dufresne,
I have a package for Gala Dalí.

85
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,051
Oh, you're from Dufresne.
Forgive me.

86
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,619
I'm Captain Peter Moore.
I'm Dalí's secretary.

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,754
James.

88
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,123
- Hi.
- James Linton.

89
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,625
I can take this if you want.

90
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,962
Christoffe said
I had to give it to Gala, so...

91
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,864
Very well.

92
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,568
How long have you been
at Dufresne?

93
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,136
Just a few months.

94
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,736
What's your experience?

95
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,906
None, really.
I was at art school.

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,075
- I... I dropped out.
- Oh, why?

97
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,846
I realized I'm not an artist.
I just love art.

98
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,315
Well, someone has to.

99
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,217
Well, James,

100
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,618
welcome to Dalí land.

101
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,777
Wait here.

102
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,917
Well, Dalí,
we all know you're a genius.

103
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,385
Are you comparing yourself
to God?

104
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,722
No, no.
I do not compare myself to God.

105
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,424
Dalí is almost God.

106
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,526
Almost?

107
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,659
Not quite.

108
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,396
If Dalí was God,
there would be no Dalí.

109
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,631
That would be a tragedy.

110
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,266
At least when you die,

111
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,134
you get to see
if God looks like you.

112
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,371
Death.

113
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,707
It frightens me most,

114
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,709
and this is the basis
of my inspiration,

115
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,978
of my creativity.

116
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,248
Every moment,
death watches to catch me.

117
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,716
And every five minutes
death no catch me,

118
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,020
I enjoy it tremendous.

119
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,687
I take some Vichy water,

120
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,157
you bring me some tea,
a little bread or something,

121
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,060
everything becoming
one tremendous pleasure

122
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:36,096
because... death surround me.

123
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,866
And because death is so close,

124
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:44,138
it's possible make erotic
every single piece of my life.

125
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,475
You see? Hmm. I see. Do you see?

126
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,610
Who are you?

127
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,712
I'm James Linton from Dufresne.

128
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,155
Christoffe is coming
to dinner tomorrow.

129
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,424
He will bring you.

130
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,627
He will?

131
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,229
You tell him.

132
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,267
It's important
you can tell the difference

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,902
between an offset print
and a lithograph.

134
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,870
Marks from a hand lithograph

135
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,439
will show a random dot pattern

136
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,575
created by the tooth
of the surface it's drawn on.

137
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,444
The detail, every stroke.

138
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,912
Amazing.

139
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,714
But prints made
from an offset press

140
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,716
have a mechanical dot pattern.

141
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,185
All the dots in the drawing,
see?

142
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,187
A sure sign
it's not an original.

143
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,623
- So, this is a fake?
- No, no.

144
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,024
It's fine,

145
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,360
unless someone tries
to sell it as a lithograph.

146
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,527
And that's fraud.

147
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,895
Exactly.

148
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,166
You know, you really don't need
to be at this dinner tonight.

149
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,035
I don't know
why Gala invited me.

150
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,470
You are a beautiful boy.

151
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,972
And she has the libido
of an electric eel.

152
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,507
Really?

153
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,742
Yeah.

154
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,443
Back in the '30s, in Paris,

155
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,412
she was quite the sex siren.

156
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,581
The surrealist femme fatale.

157
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,216
The great muse.

158
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,918
Take this home.

159
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,521
But really, all you need to know
is Gala is the power.

160
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,789
She does the deals
and handles the money.

161
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:10,991
Always cash.

162
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,862
If she makes a pass at you,
turn her down nicely.

163
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,931
Whatever you do,
you must not insult her.

164
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,167
- No, I won't.
- I know.

165
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,569
Because if you do, you are out.

166
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,514
No, no,
Dalí does not want spinach.

167
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,282
Dalí abhors spinach.

168
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:39,286
Dalí can only eat food
with well-defined shapes

169
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,956
that the mind can clearly grasp,
like oysters.

170
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,760
Dalí needs money.

171
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,263
Then Dalí
better start painting more.

172
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,098
There isn't enough
to fill the gallery,

173
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,533
and we open in three weeks.

174
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,967
Dalí paint every day.

175
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,804
You give us money,
we give you paintings.

176
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,705
Christ.

177
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,579
You enjoy this?

178
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,481
Yeah.

179
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,518
Christoffe is an idiot,
but always, I work with fools.

180
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,821
But you...

181
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,588
you have a mind.

182
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,523
I see.

183
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,992
Oh, um, thank you.

184
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,427
You just begin work

185
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,062
for Dalí's gallery?

186
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,498
- Just a... a few months.
- Good.

187
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,901
We won't let Christoffe
ruin you.

188
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,142
- Tanqueray martini.
- Amanda.

189
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,379
Amanda,

190
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,180
<i>mon ange.</i>

191
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,983
Mwah, mwah.

192
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,152
Come, sit. Sit.

193
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,589
That's Amanda Lear,

194
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,057
his new muse.

195
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,259
The rumor is
when he first met her,

196
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,795
she was performing
at a drag club in Paris.

197
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,865
And she was a he.

198
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,799
- But not for long.
- Dalí,

199
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,401
what are you working on now?

200
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,770
At last, someone asks.
I will tell you.

201
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,338
The world's largest penis.

202
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,039
- Really?
- Yes.

203
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,175
There is a universal fixation
on penis length.

204
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,812
No mortal penis can hope
to live up to this expectation.

205
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,480
Therefore, I, Dalí,
will build the ultimate penis

206
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,482
to relieve the world
of its anxiety.

207
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,819
And how will Dalí
make his penis?

208
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,088
Dalí's penis will be constructed
of pink nylon mesh.

209
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,391
It will have a diameter
of approximately two meters.

210
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,961
You will be encouraged
to stand inside it.

211
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,797
And how long
will Dalí's penis be?

212
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,198
It will circle the planet.

213
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,834
And how will
your penis cross the ocean?

214
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,870
Like telephone cables
on the floor of the ocean.

215
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,305
And when the penis,
it is finished,

216
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,074
it will ejaculate
over the United Nations.

217
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,976
My contribution to world peace.

218
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,056
<i>Mais qu'est-ce que tu...</i>

219
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,524
No, no, no.

220
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,930
He's autographing it.

221
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,964
They never cash the check.

222
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,947
Are you here for Gala?

223
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,448
Why does everyone
seem to think that?

224
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,750
This face maybe?

225
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,955
I... I work at Dalí's gallery,
actually.

226
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,156
But that's not why you're here.

227
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,226
If you're not here for Gala,
then you must be here for Dalí.

228
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:34,228
There's always a reason.

229
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,898
What's your reason then?

230
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,765
Oh, I'm like Dalí's jewelry.

231
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,634
Something pretty.

232
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,436
Nice to wear at parties.

233
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,171
There she is.

234
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,841
Come on, darling.
The ship is leaving.

235
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:48,175
Okay, sure.

236
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,310
Goodnight.

237
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,781
I'm coming.

238
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,385
- Did you see this?
- He did that now?

239
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,821
Yeah, right in front of me.

240
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,122
- Just before he signed.
- Wow.

241
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,462
Is this some
little conceptual art piece?

242
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,033
Maybe you should
be working downtown.

243
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,700
So, the whole idea
of a signature

244
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,270
is that it should identify
an artist definitively. Right?

245
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,406
- Uh, yeah.
- But Dalí...

246
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,341
has a few dozen signatures.

247
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,144
Why?
What does that say about him?

248
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,212
My dear boy, Dalí adores,

249
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,849
as he calls it,
"to cretinize the world."

250
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,784
- Cretinize?
- Yeah.

251
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,252
He wants to confuse,

252
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,720
to obfuscate,
to fuck with people.

253
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:11,191
Or... to show people
that nothing is what it seems.

254
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,726
Including himself.

255
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,430
Well, we're off to lunch...

256
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,098
...but first, Gala wants to see

257
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,133
how you plan
to hang the new works.

258
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,635
Right.

259
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:23,537
But we can expect more prints
and paintings this week?

260
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,505
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Show me the room.

261
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,374
How do you plan
to hang the show?

262
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,209
Here, follow me.

263
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,222
"It's our pleasure
to serve you."

264
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,527
This is a beautiful blue.

265
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,432
Blue is the color of oxygen.

266
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,371
- Excuse me, Señor Dalí.
- Hmm.

267
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,140
- This is for you.
- Hmm.

268
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:06,279
What is this?

269
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,483
All these, "Dalí, Dalí, Dalí"?

270
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,184
I made it for you.

271
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,122
I'm so sorry, Dalí. Dalí.
My new assistant,

272
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,189
he's a fan.
Don't let him bother you.

273
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,892
I saw
that they were all different...

274
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,395
as if each one
was a new version of you,

275
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,866
as if you became a new person
each time you painted.

276
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,836
You have a face of an angel.

277
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,438
I do?

278
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,740
Not boy, not girl.

279
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,243
Are you Raphael?

280
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,645
No!

281
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,580
You are <i>San Sebastian,</i>

282
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,449
by Gustave Moreau.

283
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,520
Dalí can keep this,
San Sebastian?

284
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,654
Yeah.

285
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,092
I need a new assistant.

286
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,428
I will borrow this boy
until the show,

287
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:56,430
then you have him back.

288
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:04,671
<i>Please let me do this,</i>
<i>Christoffe.</i>

289
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,473
One of the great artists
of the twentieth century

290
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,809
wants me to work with him.

291
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,310
Oh, look at you.
No one works with Dalí.

292
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,880
- They work for him.
- Christoffe.

293
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,982
Come on, just think about this,
okay?

294
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:18,853
I mean, I will... I will do
overtime later, all right?

295
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,489
Look, I'll work free for a week.
Two weeks, whatever.

296
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,826
I will make it up
to you somehow, I promise.

297
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,529
All right.

298
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,333
Gala has committed him
to too many contracts

299
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,902
that have nothing
to do with the show

300
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:36,204
and now he's exhausted.

301
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,905
But we open in three weeks,

302
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:40,108
and I still have a whole wall
to fill with paintings.

303
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,708
So, here's the deal.

304
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:44,377
You are going
to keep an eye on him,

305
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,114
and tell me everything,

306
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,482
and make sure he paints.

307
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,086
He gets so sidetracked
by his holograms...

308
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,156
- his parties and orgies.
- Orgies?

309
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,824
Not part of the job.

310
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,907
Come.

311
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:48,575
Bring it here.

312
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,713
The Queen of Cups...

313
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,983
- I'll just leave this here.
- Wait, wait.

314
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,822
Page of Cups.

315
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,459
Open it.

316
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,710
Sit down.

317
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,115
I'm sorry,
I don't... I don't think I'm...

318
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,550
I just... I just...
I don't, um...

319
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:34,989
I have a lot of errands
and things, so, um...

320
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,190
Idiot!

321
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,657
Go.

322
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,228
Go work for Dalí.

323
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,574
Stop, stop, stop! Too much!

324
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,278
Gala!

325
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,980
I could find her if you'd like.

326
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,680
Galushka!

327
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,652
Gala!

328
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,387
Help.

329
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,858
Idiot. You don't learn?

330
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,761
One part linseed, one varnish,
three paint.

331
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,599
What do you see?

332
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,872
There's more energy on the left
than on the right.

333
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:25,907
Hmm.

334
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,509
- Hmm.
- Your medicine.

335
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,814
- Take it.
- Yes, yes, Galina.

336
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,258
Will you join us for lunch,
my olivetta?

337
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,559
No. I go to the theater,

338
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,329
but keep working.

339
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,964
Keep painting.

340
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:00,875
I need her

341
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:02,944
to push me.

342
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:06,646
Without my Gala,
I would end up in an asylum

343
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,748
or be a tramp under a bridge.

344
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,986
Bring me Naples Yellow.

345
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:18,859
It's my favorite color.
Yellow is the color of proteins.

346
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,494
To find me the Naples Yellow,

347
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,131
Gala would walk all over Paris.

348
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,599
- Is that where you met?
- No.

349
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,513
We met in Cadaques,

350
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,617
the most beautiful place
on Earth.

351
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,588
The first thing I saw of Gala

352
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,657
<i>was her wonderful back.</i>

353
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,319
I was so beautiful.

354
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:57,091
See? Luis Buñuel was visiting.

355
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,660
And René Magritte
and his boring wife.

356
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:02,695
And Gala!

357
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,869
My friend, the poet,

358
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,670
Paul Éluard.

359
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,940
Gala's husband.

360
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:24,285
I had many terrors
and strange fits of laughter

361
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,519
when I was young.

362
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,957
People whispered I was mad.

363
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,780
Water.

364
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,963
That happens sometimes
when I am tired.

365
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,432
Don't worry, San Sebastian.

366
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,968
Dalí only need a little air.

367
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,104
This will give me strength.

368
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,405
Are you sure?

369
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:53,941
Won't Gala be upset
if you leave?

370
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,544
She is with Jesus.

371
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,812
She'll be gone for hours.

372
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,082
- Jesus?
- You will meet him.

373
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,118
Tomorrow.

374
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:08,522
San Sebastian, you will join us
at the Prince and Pauper's tea.

375
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:10,090
- Prince and Pauper's?
- Yeah.

376
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,259
You, of course, are a pauper.
You are young.

377
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,262
The old are there
strictly for business,

378
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,165
otherwise, I cannot
bear to look at them.

379
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,709
Where have you been?

380
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,011
It was my day at the gallery.

381
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,680
Dalí's done nothing today.

382
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,215
He's over there
talking to Alice Cooper

383
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,917
about another hologram.
How do you sell a hologram?

384
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,121
Yes, it is true.

385
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:45,092
Holographics
is the ultimate art form.

386
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:49,230
What about painting, Dalí,
and sculptures?

387
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,763
Yes, yes, Alice.

388
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:53,901
But Dalí create,
at one and the same time,

389
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,904
the external
and internal reality

390
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:58,405
through different methods.

391
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,841
Double images, stereoscopy,

392
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:05,446
holograms for seeking
the fourth dimension,

393
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,947
penetrating more and more

394
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,550
into the compressed nature
of the universe.

395
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:10,684
Compress-ed?

396
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,386
Compressed, compressed.

397
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,921
Did he say compressed?

398
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:15,755
Come, San Sebastian.

399
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,994
Meet my Ginesta.
She's very Dalínian.

400
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:21,428
Ginesta.

401
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,966
You take care of San Sebastian.

402
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,902
- He is a new boy.
- We've already met, Dalí.

403
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:36,610
So, are you a prince
or are you a pauper?

404
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,612
Pauper, for sure.

405
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:40,114
I thought so.

406
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:41,815
Where are you from, James?

407
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,318
- Uh, Idaho.
- Oh, my.

408
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,919
What was that like?

409
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:49,323
All I knew about art was
from books and magazines,

410
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:52,259
so being here is kind of
like a dream, I guess.

411
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,162
Do your parents know
what you're up to in New York?

412
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,631
My mother says
seven-layer cake is sinful,

413
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,500
so you can guess
what she would say

414
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,835
about Dalí and... and all this.

415
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,972
My father thinks
Dalí is a pornographer,

416
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,041
which I love.

417
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,348
Jeff!

418
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:15,249
Who's that?

419
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,318
Oh, that's Jesus Christ.

420
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:21,288
<i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>
He plays him on Broadway.

421
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:23,824
- Dalí doesn't mind.
- I'm so glad you made it!

422
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:28,996
A new lover will distract Gala,
give Dalí more time to play.

423
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,531
Like I told you,

424
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:33,033
everyone is here for a reason.

425
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,537
You just don't know
what yours is yet.

426
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,139
Well, I had a show.

427
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:41,942
I'm going to get a whiskey.
You want a vodka?

428
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,410
Yeah, no.

429
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:44,545
Beautiful.

430
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,982
Sometimes I get very bored
at these things.

431
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,453
But you're not boring.

432
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,290
Do you want to get outta here?

433
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:03,590
You can't keep doing this, Gala,

434
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,526
this is an impossible situation!

435
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,763
Americans are all porks.
Greedy, Grade A U.S. porks.

436
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:12,867
You fix this, you call Desmond.

437
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,170
People are waiting
for me downstairs. Dammit!

438
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,473
James, come in here, I need you.

439
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,210
Take this briefcase.
You're gonna need it.

440
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,679
- What for?
- Twenty thousand dollars.

441
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,217
Hmm, I shouldn't have said that,
but it's all for Jesus Christ.

442
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,685
You'd think
he'd have enough money

443
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,053
from that stupid show.

444
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,621
I'm sorry.
Can you explain a little bit?

445
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,290
Gala has given her boyfriend,
Jeff Fenholt,

446
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,591
the money meant to pay

447
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:38,959
for Dalí's hotel bill
this month.

448
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,361
It costs 20,000 a month
to live here?

449
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,263
Well,
with room service and parties

450
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:46,033
with caviar
and champagne flowing.

451
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,838
Plus, what Gala loses
gambling in Chinatown.

452
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:54,641
So, take the briefcase
to Desmond Carter, this address.

453
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:58,979
Get the money
and bring it straight back.

454
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,554
These are all personally signed
by the artist himself.

455
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,722
A few years ago,

456
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,091
I sold a Dalí print
for 750 dollars.

457
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:12,459
Do you know
what it's worth today?

458
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:14,628
- Ten times that.
- Excuse me?

459
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,931
Captain Moore sent me.

460
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:19,166
Yes. He called.
Uh, I'll be a minute.

461
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:23,103
Well,
the price is really more than...

462
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:26,340
Did you know
Picasso died last year?

463
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,208
Since then,

464
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:29,811
the value of his work
has soared.

465
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:32,914
Salvador Dalí is 70,
and he can't live forever.

466
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:35,449
That's awful,
making money from someone dying.

467
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:38,118
It's the physics of art,
Mrs. Thomas.

468
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,654
An artist dies
and the prices go up.

469
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:43,390
It's how it is.

470
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,193
Excuse me, I'll be a minute.

471
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:50,330
Carter Gallery.

472
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,537
Okay, no, we're...
we're not open then.

473
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:01,408
Hmm. Uh-huh. Sure. Sure.

474
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,578
You... like it?

475
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:07,748
I find it upsetting.

476
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,184
I mean, I can't figure
how it's pulling me in,

477
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,787
but somehow it takes me
inside of his dreams.

478
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,558
Just paint on paper, but...

479
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:20,694
it's so powerful.

480
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,763
It's kind of like magic.

481
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:26,099
I don't think I want to live

482
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,669
with someone else's weird dream
on my wall.

483
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,272
But that weirdness,
that's what makes it original.

484
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,508
It got to you.

485
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,146
That's why
you'll never get tired of it.

486
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,614
And you'll never forget it.

487
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,518
That's Dalí.

488
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:49,623
You were fantastic in there.

489
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:52,292
Turns out her aunt
left her 15,000 dollars.

490
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,494
Now she's going
to spend it all on prints.

491
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,197
That's great.

492
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,585
Would you like some more light,
Dalí?

493
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,686
No.

494
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,228
When I compare myself,
San Sebastian,

495
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:32,799
to present day painters,
I am way up,

496
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:35,502
up on the pinnacle.

497
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,839
But when I compare myself to...

498
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,876
Vermeer or Velázquez,
my work is a catastrophe.

499
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,948
Modern painting
has left behind Vermeer

500
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,249
and now goes about making
things that are like posters.

501
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,751
Once you start...

502
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,719
...talking
about squirting the paint

503
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:54,788
straight from the tube
onto the wall,

504
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:57,925
the whole spiritualization
process of art is lost.

505
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:00,160
It becomes an absurdity.

506
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:02,997
The paint,

507
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:04,765
it doesn't count

508
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,633
until it disappears,

509
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,503
and becomes
an illusion of reality.

510
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:17,444
Abstract painting will one day
be seen as a total disaster.

511
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,948
Now, San Sebastian,

512
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:25,752
Dalí needs
a few hundred live ants,

513
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,621
some dead grasshoppers,

514
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,092
four dwarfs,
and a suit of armor.

515
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,994
Spanish armor.

516
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:35,529
- For a painting?
- No, a party.

517
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,431
A party?

518
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,699
I could kill him.

519
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,002
I wish he didn't make us
so much money.

520
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,203
Is he getting any work done?

521
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,771
Yeah, he works every day.

522
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,673
Really.

523
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,371
<i>Salut.</i>

524
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:13,386
The Dalí... is... here!

525
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,879
Where is Gala?

526
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,914
Uh, Gala was a bit tired.

527
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,149
I think she's in her room,
resting.

528
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:11,778
Jeff's songs
will change the world.

529
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:16,884
Focus! I pay you to work.

530
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:18,913
Bravo, bravo.

531
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,035
Hey, help me.

532
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,736
I can't do this myself.

533
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,179
This is like armor.

534
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:29,183
Well, a woman
does need her protection, James.

535
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:31,618
You know my name?

536
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,821
I know everyone's name.

537
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,090
Come on.

538
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:42,430
How is it working for Dalí?

539
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,132
It's like I landed
on another planet.

540
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,068
But I belong.

541
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,770
Me too.

542
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:14,248
Do you have to work today?

543
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:16,183
Every day until the show.

544
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:19,520
- I can see you tonight, though.
- I can't.

545
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,121
My parents are in town.

546
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:22,523
They're taking me to 21.

547
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:23,591
Fancy.

548
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,392
It's suffocating.

549
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,963
But I have to make a showing
every now and then

550
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,730
or they won't pay my rent.

551
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:35,002
Hey, so, um, last night, um...

552
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:40,441
was Dalí, like, you know,
watching us?

553
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,344
He likes to watch.

554
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,145
Don't you find that weird?

555
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:48,282
He is the man that painted
<i>The Great Masturbator.</i>

556
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:53,854
So, is he gay?

557
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,623
I don't think
they've invented a word

558
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:57,057
for what Dalí is.

559
00:40:57,558 --> 00:40:59,293
What about him
and Amanda? Do they ever...

560
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,996
The whole point about Dalí
is that he doesn't have sex.

561
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,698
All of his paintings
are about sex.

562
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,533
Well, maybe that's why.

563
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:10,904
He and Gala...

564
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,142
I think they had sex
like a million years ago.

565
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,013
And I think she's the only one
that he could ever do it with.

566
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:22,816
It must be so lonely.

567
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,086
Still...

568
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,089
his parties are fucking great.

569
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:34,862
Ooh! James, James.
You need to...

570
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,364
Listen, boy. You will work.

571
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,534
You will not shave,
no going home.

572
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,971
Stay with Dalí every hour
until the show is finished.

573
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,939
- I lock you in, both.
- Gala, I...

574
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,241
Shut up!

575
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:49,076
Shut your ugly mouth.

576
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,245
Do you want us
thrown out of the hotel?

577
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:52,846
Into the streets?

578
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:55,649
Eat bones in the alley
like dogs?

579
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:57,651
I will not eat from tin spoons.

580
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:02,022
I will never again live
in a house that stinks of onion

581
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,692
or eat pig blood for breakfast.

582
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,294
I will not be poor!

583
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:09,863
- Olivina, please.
- No, "please."

584
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:11,632
We need money!

585
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:13,434
Money, money!

586
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:17,438
We need paintings and drawings
for this fucking show!

587
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:18,706
And you will paint,

588
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,941
and paint, and paint

589
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:25,346
for the next three days,
nothing but painting!

590
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:26,580
No more parties!

591
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:29,616
No more play, no stupid friends!

592
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,552
The show is in three days.

593
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:32,586
Go!

594
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,054
Paint!

595
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:49,937
Um... Dalí?

596
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,141
Can I get you anything?

597
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:01,949
Is she magnificent, my Gala?
Did you hear her yell?

598
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:04,118
She slapped The Captain,
then she kicked me.

599
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,919
Such rage, like a fire.

600
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:07,822
I thought you would be upset.

601
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:09,223
Inspired!

602
00:43:09,656 --> 00:43:11,024
I am inspired.

603
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,994
You young people
think all you need

604
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:16,163
is peace, and love, and harmony.

605
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:19,299
No! It is anger makes us strong.

606
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:23,203
All fresh ideas
burst from the shell of hatred.

607
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,539
Now, call my Ginesta.

608
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,540
Ginesta? Why?

609
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:27,876
For the angel's wings.

610
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:29,476
Dalí's angel's wings
hang in the Vatican.

611
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,345
These wings I create
with the perfect ass of a model,

612
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,848
so call Ginesta and some models.
And Amanda,

613
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:34,948
tell her to come too.

614
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:36,984
I need many beautiful asses!

615
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,761
In here.

616
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,364
If it's here, add some.

617
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:53,934
So, quick down
and then quick up.

618
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:57,438
Up.

619
00:43:58,505 --> 00:43:59,573
No, no, no.

620
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:00,909
On the paper, Olivia.

621
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,409
Down. Up!

622
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:03,210
Perfect!

623
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,611
Good, good, good.

624
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,447
Up! Up! Perfect!

625
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:09,550
Every detail.

626
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,719
Now the paint will disappear,
we have angel's wings.

627
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:06,173
James, James, it is not a party.

628
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,750
It is beautiful.

629
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:58,893
Maestro, what do you love more?

630
00:45:59,192 --> 00:46:00,460
Painting or money?

631
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,430
Liking money the way I like it

632
00:46:03,564 --> 00:46:06,500
is nothing less than mysticism.

633
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:08,468
Money is a glory.

634
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:10,571
Señor Dalí,

635
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:12,941
are you happy tonight
to be showing in New York?

636
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,576
I'm always happy.

637
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:19,546
Sometimes I positively drool
with happiness.

638
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:20,915
Aw.

639
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,716
And I have here my queen.

640
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,351
Gala!

641
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:34,761
She's my oxygen.

642
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,266
It is with her blood
that I create my art.

643
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:42,603
I dedicate this exhibition

644
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:45,572
to Gala.

645
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:07,160
So, that's Alice Cooper's brain.

646
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:10,064
What's Dalí trying
to say with this?

647
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,431
Don't ask me, man.

648
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,600
I haven't understood
a single word he said

649
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:14,668
since I met him.

650
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,603
Everything's going really well,
huh?

651
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:18,772
You are so self-involved.

652
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:21,009
Nothing is going well
until I sell all these.

653
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,143
Go and look after Fenholt.

654
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:25,545
I need to keep him
away from Dalí.

655
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,752
What I'm really
missing in here is,

656
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:33,754
like, a Pietà, you know?

657
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:35,155
These are beautiful.

658
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:36,223
You know,
I do a little painting myself.

659
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,257
Thank you.

660
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:38,525
And I'm making an album too.

661
00:47:39,027 --> 00:47:42,162
All my own material.
Not just pop songs, but...

662
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:45,900
poetic, meaningful things.

663
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:50,203
I'm building a home studio
for the demos.

664
00:47:50,872 --> 00:47:51,839
Cool.

665
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,978
I'm in <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

666
00:47:57,912 --> 00:47:59,981
I was on the cover of <i>Time</i>
last month.

667
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:02,249
Oh. Right, right.

668
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:03,885
You're Jesus, right?

669
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:06,888
Yeah, so you're going to...

670
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:08,923
perform miracles?

671
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,324
Jeff makes music
that people will listen to

672
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,827
for hundreds of years.

673
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:16,563
Your music is ugly and dull.
I don't know why people buy it.

674
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:21,201
His act is just a gimmick.

675
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:22,669
Anyone could put on
freaky makeup

676
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:24,005
and spray blood
all over the stage.

677
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:25,238
That's not music.

678
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,541
No one will remember him,
no one.

679
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:32,479
Gala, this has been wild,
but, um...

680
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:34,648
but I really gotta go.

681
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:36,249
- Oh...
- Okay?

682
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,285
There's another party,
and some of the cast is...

683
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:39,352
I come with you!

684
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:40,420
No, no, no.

685
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,789
Gala, it's Dalí's night.

686
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,558
Right?

687
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,426
It's cool.

688
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:50,330
Come down
to the studio tomorrow.

689
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:52,299
Okay?

690
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,954
Hey, I thought you were
going to be here hours ago.

691
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:14,856
Uh, this is Renaldo.

692
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:18,558
Renaldo,
this is my friend James.

693
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,394
- He works here at the gallery.
- Oh. Nice to meet you, James.

694
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:23,797
Great opening, don't you think,
Lucy?

695
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:25,166
Lucy?

696
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,201
Oh, Ginesta is just a name

697
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,302
Dalí uses
for all the blonde girls.

698
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,573
You never told me
your real name.

699
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:36,878
Renaldo, I've barely seen
any of the new work.

700
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:39,080
Let's look around.

701
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,592
Oh, here, drown your sorrow.

702
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:58,365
Where have you been?
They won't come out.

703
00:49:58,498 --> 00:49:59,834
We have to do something.

704
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:10,410
It's about Fenholt.

705
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,919
Get them out of there.

706
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,232
Oh! Oh, <i>pardon!</i>

707
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:49,616
<i>Pardon. Chérie, pardon.</i>

708
00:50:51,853 --> 00:50:53,520
Another great Dalí performance!

709
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:57,124
But all good things
must come to an end. Señor.

710
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,694
Perfect.

711
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:05,765
Huh? Perfect.
<i>Chérie, pardon, Chérie.</i>

712
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:08,568
Tremendous.

713
00:51:09,036 --> 00:51:10,037
Perfect.

714
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:12,907
Beautiful. Perfect.

715
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,616
Sometimes, San Sebastian,

716
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,385
it is so hard being Dalí.

717
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:49,709
Christoffe, I'm sorry.

718
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,880
Trains were delayed.
It was raining.

719
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,952
The reviews?

720
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:02,156
- They're not good?
- Worse.

721
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,594
"Who could imagine
a day would come

722
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:10,231
when a Salvador Dalí
exhibit comes to New York

723
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:13,334
and is almost ignored
by the critical press?"

724
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:17,238
"The cause for such resistance
can be attributed perhaps

725
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:18,638
to the... to a dismay

726
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:20,674
with the artist's perennial
high jinks,

727
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:23,411
and that is a real shame,
because the new show at Dufresne

728
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:25,578
has some remarkable pieces
by an artist

729
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:28,349
who is in a category
and class by himself."

730
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,119
But they're saying it was great.

731
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:34,654
She's saying none
of the big critics reviewed it.

732
00:52:34,788 --> 00:52:36,857
Not <i>The New York Times,</i>
not <i>Artforum.</i>

733
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:40,227
The critics don't take him
seriously anymore.

734
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,529
We sold almost nothing.

735
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:45,166
That's not your desk anymore,
James.

736
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,034
It now belongs to her.

737
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,075
You're firing me?

738
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:57,211
For doing
what you told me to do?

739
00:52:57,577 --> 00:52:59,646
I told you to keep him painting,

740
00:52:59,947 --> 00:53:02,183
not to become
his adoring little acolyte.

741
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,158
You know, Christoffe,
I learned more about art

742
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:12,525
from Dalí in three weeks

743
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:14,095
than I would have learned
from you in three years.

744
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,595
I doubt that.

745
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:19,733
You have an eye, you know.

746
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:22,736
If you decide you're
serious about gallery work,

747
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,305
come back and we'll talk.

748
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:25,772
Go fuck yourself.

749
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,370
The critics, San Sebastian,
the bureaucrats,

750
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,072
they've never liked me.

751
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:00,707
I'm sorry, Dalí.

752
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:02,675
The critics attack

753
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,346
any tremendous original idea.

754
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,183
My problem,
never with the people.

755
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:11,318
No.

756
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:14,255
They always know
where to find true poetry.

757
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:18,192
Pack all the things,

758
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:20,027
paint, pencils, charcoal,
brushes.

759
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,628
You're not painting today?

760
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:23,330
I go home to Portlligat.

761
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:25,900
I kiss the soil when I arrive.

762
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:28,802
This is where
my painting is best.

763
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,105
Gala and I
are always better there.

764
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,821
I hope you'll take this too.

765
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:55,329
You are sad Dalí is leaving?

766
00:54:56,629 --> 00:54:57,832
Yeah.

767
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:01,368
Also, Christoffe just fired me.

768
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,071
I'm sorry.

769
00:55:41,342 --> 00:55:43,043
James, James, James, James!

770
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:46,514
I've just heard from Christoffe.

771
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:48,115
What a wanker!

772
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:50,050
Now...

773
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:53,521
you've always worked
hard for Dalí and me, I know.

774
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:55,322
And I owe you, so...

775
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:58,325
Do you have a passport?

776
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,229
There are a couple of things
to deal with in Europe,

777
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:04,431
and I need somebody
that I can trust.

778
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:07,301
So, I think that you
could be of use in Paris

779
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,636
and Spain.

780
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,703
If you want
to continue the ride.

781
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:26,520
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to have to collect some...</i>

782
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:27,888
<i>special paper.</i>

783
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:29,323
<i>A lot of special paper,</i>

784
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:30,757
<i>from a man in Paris.</i>

785
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:33,260
<i>His name is Gilbert Hamon.</i>

786
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:36,964
- Bonjour.
- Hi.

787
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:45,873
There is a lot to carry.

788
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:47,041
You have a car, yes?

789
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:48,809
Yeah, I'm parked out front.

790
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:57,184
I thought these were all
supposed to be blanks?

791
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,322
On this side, blank.

792
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:02,923
On this, lithograph.

793
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,696
Well, they kind of
look like prints, not lithos.

794
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,730
Oh, you... you think so?

795
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,633
Yeah, I worked in a gallery
for a while.

796
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:15,369
Ah! So you're an expert?

797
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,038
Well, no.

798
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:20,174
My friend,

799
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:22,843
I'm the only print agent
for Salvador Dalí in Europe.

800
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,212
I think I know
what I have to sell, huh?

801
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:26,614
Right.

802
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,283
He is smart, huh?

803
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,584
The Captain.

804
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:32,586
Your face is so fresh.

805
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,222
No one will bother
the young American tourist.

806
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,591
What's that supposed to mean?

807
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:40,394
Nothing. It's just smart.

808
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,863
Now, come on.
Help me with those.

809
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,227
James, how are you?

810
00:58:13,494 --> 00:58:14,628
Oh, I've been better.

811
00:58:16,297 --> 00:58:18,332
- Was the drive good?
- Yeah, it was all right.

812
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:21,302
Here we go.

813
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:24,305
All right.

814
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:32,446
You want me to bring the rest?

815
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:33,981
No, no, no.
Bring the rest in the morning

816
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:35,683
when you come to the house.

817
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,185
You look exhausted.
Get some sleep.

818
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:40,220
The, uh,
the room's in your name.

819
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,656
It's not The Ritz,
but it's... comfortable.

820
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:06,914
No!

821
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,882
It's already infected.

822
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,952
It's already infected.

823
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:13,454
Look!

824
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,389
It's beginning to swell.

825
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:16,590
Tetanus.

826
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,992
There was something disgusting
on that glass.

827
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:21,362
Some dirt has infected me. Look.

828
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:23,263
My finger is rotting.

829
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:27,301
I can feel the putrefaction
like worms writhing inside.

830
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:32,005
The entire hand of the painter,
Salvador Dalí...

831
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:35,242
will have to be cut off!

832
00:59:38,645 --> 00:59:40,948
What will they do
with my cut-off hand?

833
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:42,649
Will they bury it?

834
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,152
Where will they put it?

835
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,121
In a little box?

836
00:59:48,222 --> 00:59:50,190
Do they make coffins for hands?

837
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:51,759
You'll have to go and get Gala.

838
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:53,862
She's the only one that can
calm him when he's like this.

839
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:56,029
- Why? It's just a little cut.
- To him, it's life threatening.

840
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:58,232
Total hypochondriac.
You have no idea.

841
00:59:58,365 --> 01:00:00,000
- Where's Gala?
- In Púbol.

842
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:02,703
No, no, no!

843
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,738
<i>Dalí bought her a castle</i>

844
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:06,306
<i>for her private time.</i>

845
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:10,577

All right.

851
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,678
I'm doing some heavy songs
right now.

852
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:48,515
So, Dalí's bad shape, huh?

853
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,785
Yeah. Uh, it's quite the setup
you got here.

854
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,854
It is.

855
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,123

Amazing fucking acoustics, huh?

01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,475
We're recording the album
right here.

859
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,009
Album?

860
01:01:16,276 --> 01:01:19,046
Well,
I do the road tour of <i>Superstar,</i>

861
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:21,748
then I come back
and make some magic.

862
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,385
All thanks to this amazing lady.

863
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,456
This is shit!

864
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:31,325
This is my time.

865
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,327
Go there. Wait!

866
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:40,334
I'm fine, Gala.
It's fine. Go, really.

867
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:43,170
No, it's unfair.
He makes me leave you.

868
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,138
Spend a couple days,
then come back.

869
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:48,008
- I'll be here all week.
- Worry you get depressed.

870
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,978
Stupid record companies,

871
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,513
the people don't see
your amazing talent.

872
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,416
But do not... do not take drugs.

873
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:58,685
They only make it worse.

874
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,220
I promise.

875
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:01,890
I believe in you.

876
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:03,757
And soon, the world too.

877
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:18,639
<i>Dalí does not remember</i>

878
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:20,808
<i>how I walked</i>
<i>the streets of Paris</i>

879
01:02:20,942 --> 01:02:22,709
until my shoes filled with blood

880
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:25,245
to sell his paintings
that no one wanted.

881
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:27,381
Knocking up on doors of...

882
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,284
fat, rich dealers.

883
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:31,685
I tell them...

884
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:36,757
"Salvador Dalí is a genius."

885
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,693
No one cared. Not in Paris.

886
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:44,298
They say, "Surrealism is over."

887
01:02:46,034 --> 01:02:47,167
Idiots.

888
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,970
But that all changed
when you came to America, right?

889
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,906
Yes, they loved Dalí.

890
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:55,275
We were in Hollywood,
cameras go flash, flash.

891
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,211
They make Dalí like movie star.
But me?

892
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,181
They look through me.

893
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:04,018
Like I am not there.

894
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,186
They say to each other,

895
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:09,857
"Why does Dalí have old wife?

896
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:13,861
- And Dalí?
- Ah.

897
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:17,832
Dalí love Hollywood.
Like a child, of course.

898
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:19,666
This man, um...

899
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,768
...uh, with stupid
cartoon mouse...

900
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:23,270
Uh, Walt Disney?

901
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:26,406
Disney. He wants Dalí
to make a film for him.

902
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:32,112
He does no painting there.
Nothing.

903
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:37,250
Nothing for me to do
but squeeze his orange juice.

904
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:12,053
Hmm.

905
01:04:38,745 --> 01:04:40,614
<i>Gracias.</i>

906
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,418
Dalí!

907
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:46,486
San Sebastian.

908
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:48,956
Welcome.

909
01:04:51,258 --> 01:04:52,827
You bring my Gala to me.

910
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,463
I am forever grateful.

911
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:01,903
Behold, La Emporda!

912
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:03,938
This sacred land that feeds me.

913
01:05:04,806 --> 01:05:05,973
Nothing changes.

914
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,810
They fix their nets
as they did forty years ago.

915
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,211
I feel like
I'm in one of your paintings.

916
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,246
This place
is of tremendous importance

917
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,648
to me and Gala.

918
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,384
Here is where we fused together

919
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:18,986
and became one.

920
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:21,823
Gala was a married woman
and a Russian.

921
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:23,925
My father threw me out.
We came here.

922
01:05:24,624 --> 01:05:26,961
We lived
in a fisherman's cottage.

923
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:31,465
We work, we ate, we slept,
all in one room.

924
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,459
One night,
we were invited to the cinema,

925
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:00,895
but I was tired,

926
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:03,530
so I stayed home to paint.

927
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:10,537
I knew this landscape

928
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:14,307
would be the setting
for some spectacular idea.

929
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:08,795
Sit, please.

930
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:06,847
Everything's ready.

931
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:28,936
- We do this now?
<i>- Oui, oui.</i>

932
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,528
I don't know. Something
about signing that way

933
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:30,097
feels a little unusual.

934
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:33,267
What in the world of Dalí
and Gala is not unusual?

935
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:34,969
Yes, but...

936
01:10:35,102 --> 01:10:36,803
It isn't practical
to sign after the prints

937
01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:38,105
are made far away in France.

938
01:10:38,605 --> 01:10:42,043
So, it's okay to sign the paper
before the prints are made?

939
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:43,177
As you see.

940
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,544
How do you know

941
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:46,080
they're printing
what they're supposed to?

942
01:10:46,247 --> 01:10:48,115
Why would anyone print
anything other than a Dalí?

943
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:51,185
He's the most famous
living artist in the world.

944
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,928
- James.
- Hey!

945
01:11:03,164 --> 01:11:04,965
- Good trip?
- Not too bad.

946
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:10,171
<i>So, Jeff is at Púbol?</i>

947
01:11:10,304 --> 01:11:12,206
- Yeah.
- That's why Gala was pleading

948
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:13,706
to get me here.

949
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:16,210
Keep Dalí company,
so she can be with Fenholt.

950
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:19,146
You know, sometimes
I think Gala and Dalí don't like

951
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,648
to be around each other
because it reminds them

952
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,018
that they're old.

953
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:26,087
It's so difficult.

954
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:30,124
<i>But tonight,</i>
<i>I think we'll have fun.</i>

955
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:34,627
<i>Dalí promised</i>
<i>to take us somewhere special.</i>

956
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:47,875
Behold, San Sebastian...

957
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,642
The Cap de Creus!

958
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,092
Look there.

959
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,196
- This rock is in my painting.
- Uh-huh. Oh!

960
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:44,431
<i>The Great Masturbator.</i>

961
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:47,368
Oh, yes. I see it.

962
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,142
The Tramontana,
San Sebastian.

963
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:58,379
The wind is coming from Africa
down the mountains,

964
01:12:58,512 --> 01:12:59,712
but we must be careful.

965
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:01,714
It can blow for days.

966
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:02,983
Make you mad.

967
01:13:18,798 --> 01:13:20,067
What are you doing?

968
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:22,469
When I was a child,
and the Tramontana blew,

969
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:23,703
I'd go up on the roof,

970
01:13:23,837 --> 01:13:26,173
and like this,
I conduct the wind!

971
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:34,781
Ah! Woah!

972
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,150
Dalí!

973
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:41,455
Oh, my God.

974
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:42,556
Am I bleeding?

975
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:45,292
No, no. Just a bruise, maybe.

976
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:47,228
We go to the doctor then,
to see.

977
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:50,864
No, Dalí. You are fine.
Just get your breath.

978
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,401
I wish Gala were here.

979
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:59,273
This is where she asked me
to kill her, you know?

980
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,243
I was very tempted
that day to throw her off.

981
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:12,446
Do you really think
Gala wanted you to kill her?

982
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:15,049
Even Dalí does not know
everything about Gala.

983
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,318
She's the secret
within my secret.

984
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:19,753
But that day,

985
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,622
I saw, in her heart,

986
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:23,924
the same madness as in mine.

987
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,994
I found my other half.

988
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,144
Hey, Captain?

989
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:46,213
Oh.

990
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:47,581
Sorry.

991
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:50,184
This is Sabater,
the new secretary.

992
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:52,219
Where's The Captain?

993
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:54,488
He's gone. He steals.

994
01:15:55,356 --> 01:15:57,424
Sabater is also younger
and more intelligent.

995
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,526
What do you mean,
The Captain steals?

996
01:16:00,027 --> 01:16:02,062
He's gone. This is all.

997
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:10,437
With the prints, it's a mess.

998
01:16:10,604 --> 01:16:12,106
No proper controls.

999
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:16,043
Too many dealers,
unlimited limited editions.

1000
01:16:16,543 --> 01:16:18,746
Do you remember the...
the Carter Gallery in New York?

1001
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:20,414
The place I went
to collect cash?

1002
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:22,649
Well,
I suspect that most of his stock

1003
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:24,518
is unauthorized reprints.

1004
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:29,390
Photocopies of lithos
sold as originals.

1005
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:31,826
When I was
at the Carter Gallery,

1006
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:35,062
I convinced a woman
to buy some Dalí lithographs.

1007
01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:37,866
She spent 15,000 dollars.

1008
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:39,466
You didn't know.

1009
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:42,569
For that matter,
they may have been authentic.

1010
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:44,972
But you don't believe that,
do you?

1011
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:53,580
That was her inheritance.

1012
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:56,216
God,
how did they let this happen?

1013
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:59,286
Gala never keeps track
of the signed blank sheets.

1014
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,088
Out of sight, out of mind.

1015
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:03,056
Hamon in Paris.

1016
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:06,293
He prints cheap copies too,
doesn't he?

1017
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:08,362
Passes them off as lithographs.

1018
01:17:08,595 --> 01:17:10,264
I mean,
I try to keep some order,

1019
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:13,500
but Gala's hunger
for cash is insatiable.

1020
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,102
And what does Dalí know?

1021
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:16,503
Dalí doesn't want to know.

1022
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:19,373
He wants Gala
to look after everything.

1023
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:22,176
He can't even pay
for a taxi on his own,

1024
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,578
- you know that.
- And you brought me into this?

1025
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:26,313
Well, you wanted the job.

1026
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:28,850
They wanted the money.

1027
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:32,286
It's a hungry market out there,
James.

1028
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,422
A painting's never
just a painting.

1029
01:17:35,956 --> 01:17:37,124
Not anymore.

1030
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:40,294
What did you think was going on?

1031
01:17:40,694 --> 01:17:42,529
Well, I suspected something,
but...

1032
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:44,097
But you stayed.

1033
01:17:45,566 --> 01:17:46,600
I stayed.

1034
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:49,169
Dalí's hemorrhaging money,

1035
01:17:49,303 --> 01:17:51,705
you know,
between their extravagances

1036
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,308
and the money
that Gala spends on Fenholt.

1037
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:58,545
Do you know that she gave him
one of Dalí's paintings,

1038
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,748
a portrait of Gala,
worth a fortune?

1039
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:05,986
And I hear that
he's just sold it at Sotheby's.

1040
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:07,654
He sold it?

1041
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:11,926
I gave Dalí 20 years of my life,

1042
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:16,230
and when I was with him,
he made millions.

1043
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:20,300
But now I fear that he's...

1044
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:22,669
he's going to die poor.

1045
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:28,041
Gala told me
you stole from Dalí.

1046
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:29,676
Is that true?

1047
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:32,012
Certainly not.

1048
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:45,325
Hello?

1049
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,462
<i>Hi, Christoffe.</i>
<i>It's James.</i>

1050
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:50,264
James.

1051
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:51,900
How are you?

1052
01:18:52,332 --> 01:18:53,868
I have to ask you a question.

1053
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:58,639
Rest your weight there.
Hmm. Yes. Yes.

1054
01:19:09,316 --> 01:19:10,584
San Sebastian.

1055
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,754
Dalí, I found something out
from Captain Moore.

1056
01:19:14,555 --> 01:19:16,456
Thought it was something
you should know.

1057
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:19,259
Please.

1058
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,064
He told me Gala gave a painting
of yours to Jeff Fenholt.

1059
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:27,768
What? What painting?

1060
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:29,837
A portrait you did of Gala.

1061
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:32,874
It isn't true.

1062
01:19:33,373 --> 01:19:35,175
Captain Moore told you
this to hurt Dalí.

1063
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:36,811
Gala would never give
Jesus Christ

1064
01:19:36,945 --> 01:19:38,278
one of my paintings.

1065
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:40,480
It's true.

1066
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,784
How do you know?

1067
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,153
I know
because I called Christoffe.

1068
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,091
You called New York?

1069
01:19:52,225 --> 01:19:53,360
Yes.

1070
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:57,297
On my telephone?

1071
01:19:57,899 --> 01:19:59,299
He confirmed it with Sotheby's.

1072
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:03,537
How dare you call long distance
on my bill?

1073
01:20:04,504 --> 01:20:06,841
I employ you
for weeks and months.

1074
01:20:06,975 --> 01:20:08,241
I allow you

1075
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:10,011
to be in the presence of Dalí,
of genius.

1076
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:11,578
I give you this opportunity,

1077
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:13,815
and you piss on me,
waste my money

1078
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:16,084
by calling long distance
without permission!

1079
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:18,185
How many of these calls
did you make?

1080
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:19,453
Just one.

1081
01:20:19,821 --> 01:20:21,355
I give you everything!

1082
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:24,157
I am the master!
I am the teacher!

1083
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:26,060
I give, and give, and give!

1084
01:20:26,693 --> 01:20:28,830
And you betray me
with your phone calls.

1085
01:20:30,098 --> 01:20:32,265
He was trying to protect you.

1086
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:34,501
Protect Dalí?

1087
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:35,937
Ridiculous!

1088
01:20:36,838 --> 01:20:38,973
And you, Amanda,
are you with him?

1089
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,844
I always knew
you'd be a traitor in the end.

1090
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:46,246
Dalí, there are bad things
going on around you.

1091
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,248
In the sale of your work,
the prints.

1092
01:20:48,382 --> 01:20:50,517
All lies. You must apologize.

1093
01:20:51,853 --> 01:20:52,653
No.

1094
01:20:52,786 --> 01:20:54,788
- Apologize.
- No.

1095
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,290
I'm just trying
to tell you the truth.

1096
01:21:02,295 --> 01:21:03,931
It was one painting.

1097
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:08,669
Jeff needs money
for his music and his demos.

1098
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:10,170
What is "demos"?

1099
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:11,638
I don't care, he's nothing.

1100
01:21:11,772 --> 01:21:14,341
You,
everyone's kissing your feet,

1101
01:21:14,474 --> 01:21:15,877
running to your parties.

1102
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,111
What do I do?

1103
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:20,714
I bring you coffee,
I cut your toenails.

1104
01:21:21,816 --> 01:21:23,851
Jeff needs me.

1105
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:27,521
I do need you, my Olivina.

1106
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:29,690
This is insanity.

1107
01:21:30,858 --> 01:21:32,860
I do need you. I do.

1108
01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:34,494
You say this...

1109
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:37,597
but Jeff is young.

1110
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,334
He has all his future.

1111
01:21:42,003 --> 01:21:44,404
I help him to be great.

1112
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,475
- And you have Amanda.
- Me?

1113
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:51,578
I spend nothing on Amanda!

1114
01:21:51,913 --> 01:21:55,482
And here, like a school girl,
you throw my paintings at him,

1115
01:21:55,615 --> 01:21:57,185
and he just takes money,
money, money!

1116
01:21:57,317 --> 01:21:58,986
You're a jealous old man!

1117
01:22:00,054 --> 01:22:01,521
You have no gift for music.

1118
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:03,757
You cannot play guitar
like Jeff.

1119
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,428
Stop!

1120
01:22:08,562 --> 01:22:10,098
- Stop it!
- But you know

1121
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,365
- how I love this painting.
- You've done others better.

1122
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:13,433
Much better.

1123
01:22:13,567 --> 01:22:14,969
I never liked that painting.

1124
01:22:25,113 --> 01:22:27,882
Rosa!

1125
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:23,037
Never again
will I see you in this life.

1126
01:24:57,697 --> 01:25:00,101
Ja... James?

1127
01:25:05,605 --> 01:25:07,407
They won't let me in to see him.

1128
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:10,978
- But he loves you.
- Just fucking vanity.

1129
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:14,681
He doesn't want anyone
to see him like this.

1130
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:16,117
With his burns?

1131
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:18,819
He thinks he's old and ugly.

1132
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:24,457
He doesn't paint.
He barely eats.

1133
01:25:24,859 --> 01:25:28,262
Ever since Gala died,
it's like he's lost himself.

1134
01:25:30,398 --> 01:25:33,935
<i>She died</i>
<i>three years ago in Portlligat.</i>

1135
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:37,671
<i>She always said</i>
<i>she wanted to be buried</i>

1136
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:39,439
<i>at her castle in Púbol.</i>

1137
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,376
<i>But the local authorities</i>
<i>would only allow that</i>

1138
01:25:42,509 --> 01:25:43,743
<i>if she died there.</i>

1139
01:25:43,878 --> 01:25:46,414
<i>So, they dressed up her body</i>

1140
01:25:46,814 --> 01:25:48,682
<i>and drove her</i>
<i>back to her castle</i>

1141
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,750
<i>as if she was still alive.</i>

1142
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,898
So, she was buried in Púbol.

1143
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,069
Sorry, I have a train to catch.
I have a...

1144
01:26:08,768 --> 01:26:10,237
show in Paris.

1145
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:11,973
That's right. I heard.

1146
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:13,874
You're a pop star now.

1147
01:26:16,944 --> 01:26:18,012
And you?

1148
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:20,680
I have my own gallery
in the East Village.

1149
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:22,850
It's small, but I love it.

1150
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:24,584
After all
that happened with Dalí,

1151
01:26:24,718 --> 01:26:26,786
you still want
to work with artists?

1152
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:28,688
Maybe I'm a masochist.

1153
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:31,192
I guess I found my perversion.

1154
01:26:31,558 --> 01:26:33,227
Dalí would be proud.

1155
01:26:47,507 --> 01:26:49,377
No, this is not possible.

1156
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,979
Please. I... I used to work
for Dalí. If you would give him

1157
01:26:52,113 --> 01:26:53,948
- my name...
- I'm sorry, no.

1158
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:56,549
You don't understand
how important this is to me.

1159
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:08,062
Dalí.

1160
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:12,565
It's James.

1161
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:14,969
James Linton.

1162
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:19,306
I wanted to give you something.

1163
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:23,978
San Sebastian.

1164
01:27:32,685 --> 01:27:33,954
I took this,

1165
01:27:34,788 --> 01:27:35,990
but it's yours.

1166
01:27:36,723 --> 01:27:37,925
It's your name.

1167
01:27:40,227 --> 01:27:41,529
You should have it back.

1168
01:27:48,903 --> 01:27:52,106
So, there. You're lucky,
you have seen Dalí.

1169
01:27:53,874 --> 01:27:55,142
He remembered me.

1170
01:27:55,742 --> 01:27:57,011
Oh.

1171
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,447
He said, "San Sebastian."

1172
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,681
That was his name for me.

1173
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,452
This was a name Dalí used

1174
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:06,487
for many young men
over the years.

1175
01:28:07,321 --> 01:28:09,457
I've known at least three
San Sebastians myself.

1176
01:28:10,024 --> 01:28:11,926
Perhaps he remembered you.

1177
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,084
<i>Gracias.</i>
