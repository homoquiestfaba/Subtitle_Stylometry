00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,310
              Yup.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
       Are you mad at me?

19
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:22,815
              No.

20
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,318
      You ready for this?

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,686
       Yeah. Let's do it.

22
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,321
    I just want to go home.

23
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,639
          That was it?

24
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,342
They make it look so much better
         in the movies.

25
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,510
     They make losing your
     virginity look better

26
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,678
      in the movies, too.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,146

00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,694
    <i> Today's forecast calls</i>
  <i> for highs in the upper 80s</i>

30
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,895
   <i> and lows in the mid-70s.</i>

31

    <i> A great day to get out</i>

32
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,865
   <i> and enjoy some sunshine.</i>

33
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,134
         - I love you.
       - I love you more.

34
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,635
        I love our love.

35
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,771
          Oh, my God!
I hate this field trip already.

36
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,307
         Why aren't you
     a hot chick, too, bro?

37
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,709
             Ouch!

38
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,744
         Shut up, Chad.

39
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,180
    And can you please stop
   making out with my sister

40
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,481
        in front of me?

41
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,150
I'm sorry that this bothers you

42
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,718
      and that she happens
       to be your sister.

43
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,222
            [woman]
      Eww, eww, eww, eww.

44
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,625
          It's 7 a.m.
     What's wrong with you?

45
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,261
       This entire school
     is riddled with STDs.

46
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,762
   OK. Listen up, everybody.

47
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,364
            Today is
    an important day for me.

48
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,266
  We are going on a field trip
             to see

49
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:51,503
       one of my favorite
 artists' work--Pablo Picasso.

50
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,372
       He is just simply
        one of the best,

51
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,408
   second only in my opinion
        to Anne Geddes.

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,210
      Love her photographs
        of little babies

53
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,878
      in pumpkin patches.

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,581
     So I don't want anyone
   breaking any of my rules,

55
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,417
    and if one person breaks
            a rule,

56
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,956
  then every single one of you

57
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,624
           will fail.

58
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,795
   Let's have an awesome day.

59
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,530
   We're missing two people.
        Where are they?

60
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,402
     OK. You got everything
           you need?

61
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,704
   Yes, sir. Packed a lunch,
        got my notebook,

62
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,773
        bottle of water,
      two trail mix bars,

63
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,474
  phone charged, ready to go.

64
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,577
     Heh heh. You are your
       father's daughter.

65
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,413
  OK. Serious. Please, please,
 please be careful down there.

66
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,349
  I know what happens at these
    spring break trips, OK?

67
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,985
    Dad, I already told you.
This isn't a spring break trip.

68
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,420
       It's a field trip
      for Miss Goldstein's

69
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,688
       art history class.

70
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,289
You get extra credit if you go.

71
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,924
      You are a straight-A
         student, Abby.

72
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,694
       OK. How about you,
       me, your brothers,

73
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,996
  we do a little deer hunting
       this weekend, huh?

74
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,965
    We play a little poker?

75
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,534
 Sounds fun, but I don't know.

76
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,402
        I actually like
     going to see museums.

77
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,638
Plus, I don't need extra credit,
      but Kate needs it to

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,939
       graduate in time.

79
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,507
     You're a good friend.

80
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,443
          OK. Please,
       please behave, OK?

81
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,911
       And let's face it.

82
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,946
       There's something
    about you and Kate, OK?

83
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,750
  Kate can get you in trouble.

84
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,485
     [woman] Why would you
        trust technology

85
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,420
     over someone who knows
      what they're doing?

86
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,356
[man] This thing's connected to
   a billion-dollar satellite

87
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,391
        that updates it
      every single second.

88
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,560
  - It knows what it's doing.
      - I don't think so.

89
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,328
        I'm sorry, Kate.

90
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,630
     [dad] Yeah, I'm sorry
    we've ruined your life.

91
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,265
           [mom] Ohh!

92
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,599
     Oh, look. We're here.

93
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,001
          Oh. Finally.

94
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,535
   Thanks for the ride, guys.

95
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,837
   - Have a great field trip.
            - Ah-ah.

96
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,405
        Y-you know what?

97
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,973
          Um, there is
    actually something that

98
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,642
    your father and I wanted
     to talk to you about.

99
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,809
   Can it wait until tonight?

100
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,278
          [dad] Sure.

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,013
  Uh, no. We should do it now.

102
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,714
[dad] Is this about the divorce?

103
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,516
      [mom] Uh, no, it's--

104
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,018
   [dad] Oh, the other--yeah.

105
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,453
    All right. This is--this
    will only take a second.

106
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,921
     [Abby] Morning, guys!

107
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,490
      Who's excited to see
       some art museums?

108
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,724
I'm excited to go back to sleep

109
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,459
    once that bus gets here.

110
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,061
     Museums are just man's
      pathetic attempt to

111
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,297
    document our meaningless
   existence on this planet.

112
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,299
         Dude, come on!

113
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,800
    Can you please not start
      with this nonsense?

114
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,703
       It's 7 a.m. Jesus!

115
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,371
         Our love isn't
       meaningless, baby.

116
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,873
         No, it's not.

117
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,374
     [Goldstein] Actually,
       it is meaningless.

118
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,909
   Your love is meaningless.

119
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,445
     Sweetheart, we know we
    said we would pay for it

120
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,913
      if you got into NYU,
       even if you didn't

121
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,548
   get the track scholarship
        you didn't get,

122
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,786
but turns out we didn't mean it.

123
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,421
          Is that bad?

124
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,588
     We don't have the--we
        can't afford it.

125
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,823
      We don't have the--

126
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,625
       we're not liquid.

127
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,395
   W-wait. What do you mean?

128
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,731
      Your father blew all
  of our money on another one

129
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,567
 of his stupid business ideas.

130
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,370
     Uh, a dating web site
   for pets is a great idea.

131
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,971
      Liz, you even said,
     "That's a great idea."

132
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,507
    No. Pets don't know how
       to use a keyboard.

133
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,076
  That is the dumbest idea I--

134
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,677
     Do you realize this is
     exactly what happened

135
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,346
    last time with the car?

136
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,580
       Bees were supposed
         to go extinct.

137
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,848
 That was gonna be a cash cow.

138
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,650
       Read the Internet.

139
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,919
      Look. You don't even
   know what you want to do.

140
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,555
    Why don't you just take
   a year or two off, travel,

141
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,024
  you know, go abroad? That's
 what I did after high school.

142
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,059
Loved it. Totally found myself.

143
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,662
    -That costs money, too.
      -Oh, not that much.

144
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,631
   I always found a place to
   crash for a night or two.

145
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,734
  [Kate] Got it. Thanks, guys.

146
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,103
           Hmm. Heh.

147
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,872
      She'll be OK, right?

148
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,040
         Probably not.

149
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,445
        Hey. Thank God.

150
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,013
      I was gonna kill you
     if you didn't show up.

151
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,982
   Let's get today over with.
       I hate it already.

152
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,450
         Oh, I'm sorry.

              Ugh.

303
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,532
        Miss Goldstein,
       I need a bathroom.

304
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:52,170
          - Ohh, God.
             - Ohh.

305
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,106
   Stop it, stop it, stop it,
   stop it, stop it, stop it.

306
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,108
         Stop it. Stay.

307
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,378
    Stay, stay, stay, stay.

308
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,514
  Guys, quick change of plans.

309
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,349
  We are gonna stay the night.

310
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,384
   Kate and Abby, go inside,
     see if they have some

311
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,053
       rooms to help us.

312
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,389
      Hurry up, hurry up!

313
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,825

  [woman on TV] <i> Yes, doctor.</i>

320
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,375
   Uh, do you have any rooms
     available for tonight?

321
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:36,514
      Hmm. Ahh. Let's see.

322
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,483
        Dude, check out
   the name on the envelope.

323
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,418
           [Kate] So?

324
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,253
       Don't you remember
 from biology class last year,

325
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,322
       -the butterflies?
              -No.

326
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,058
    They both look the same,
   but only one is dangerous,

327
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
     so since the predators
 can't tell which one is which,

328
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,130
  they just leave both alone.
 It's like a defense mechanism.

329
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:56,034
     Well, uh, doubt these
     are their real names.

330
00:13:56,036 --> 00:14:00,004
  A lot of, uh, working girls
 use this motel to turn tricks.

331
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,074
       Trust me, they're
        not butterflies.

332
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,076
      Uh, they're hookers.

333
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,377
              Oh.

334
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,179
           Oh, yeah.

335
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,083
      And it looks like we
   have four rooms available.

336
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,085
        Great. We'll go
       tell our teacher.

        you would show.

   Eh, it's been a long time.

     Close the place down?

383
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,340
  Yes. This thing bled me dry.

00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,216
  I tried everything, Wheels.

389
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,319
   I even put in fog machine
        for party times!

390
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,221
          Party times?

391
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:07,592
     Yeah, but I'm cutting
     my losses, moving on.

392
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,627
   I've got big score I find
   that's happening tonight,

393
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,697
       and I need driver

394
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,599
              Ehh.

395
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,567
        That's what you
      called me here for?

396
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,137
      Yes. What you think,
      I want to catch up?

397
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,639
        I'm not a driver
       anymore, remember?

398
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,541
    Besides, I don't want to
   watch my daughter grow up

399
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,109
       from a jail cell.

400
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,712
          I don't care
    about your stupid baby.

401

      I'm not your errand
       boy anymore, Ari.

402
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,315
   Good luck with your rink.

403
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,188
      I imagine not a lot
   of legit work for ex-con.

404
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,093
     Hundred large would go
   long way for little Sofia.

405
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,800
     [Goldstein] OK. I have
    the keys for our rooms.

406
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,334
           Stay back!

407
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,570
           Stay back,
    you animals, stay back!

408
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,405
    Everybody's gonna shit.

409
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,341
  Just wait. Nobody's leaving
      their room tonight,

410
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,444
  and there are no exceptions.
I don't care if there's a fire,

411
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,245
    I don't care if there's
         an earthquake,

412
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,181
  I don't care if aliens come
       down to invade us,

413
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,382
I don't care if there's a ghost
   in the hallway screaming,

414
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,750
      "Help me, help me,"

415
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,218
      and then he gets in
        and he kills you

416
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,753
    and you become a ghost.

417
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,723
    You as a ghost will not
     be leaving the rooms.

418
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,625
         Jessie, you're
       with your brother.

419
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,528
    -We're switching rooms.
   -Chad, you're with Jesse.

420
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,697
     You two are together,
   and, Bear, you're with me.

421
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,767
         Hey. We'll get
     through this together.

422
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,338
              No.

423
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,610
       Ahh. You ever here
       of, uh, Van Gogh?

424
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,246
   Yeah, of course. The, uh,
   Dutch post impressionist.

425
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,482
       I have line on one
   of his missing paintings.

426
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,118
   I think it's called <i> Boy,</i>
   uh, <i> Pissing on Sunflowers</i>

427
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,385
         or something.

428
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,787
   Pretty sure that's not it.

429
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,622
         I don't know.
      I'm not homosexual.

430
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:49,627
  Anyway, I know where it is,
        and I have buyer

431
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,664
   willing to pay two million
      for it cash tonight.

432
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,566
       It's just sitting
        in some old safe

433
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,903
 in some real estate company's
     liquidation facility,

434
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,738
     which is why I'm going
         to swap it out

435
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,909
     with replica tonight.

436
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:08,146
   OK. Are you sure these two
     are the stealthy team

437
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,882
     -you want on this job?
           -You nuts?

438
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,551
 I hire couple of pros on this,
      the same ones who do

439
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,888
        the museum heist
  in Amsterdam broad daylight,

440
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,190
 dressed as tourists, you know?

441
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,591
 Oh, I think I read about them.

442
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,528
    Anyway, Ari reaches out,
         they say yes.

443
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,497
   All you got to do is pick
   them up, make a few stops,

444
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,432
      wait for them while
        they do the job,

445
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,869
and make sure you get back here
   before my buyer gets here.

446
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,539
     You get hundred large,
    I get to start new life

447
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,175
           in Brazil!

448
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,743
          Why Brazil?

449
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,611
 Very loose banking regulations

450
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,781
      and fastest growing
    recreational activity--

451
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,550
        roller skating.

452
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,418
I'm going to take the money and
        build new rink,

453
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,687
    my dream rink, perfect.

454
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,558
       Not oval, circle.

455
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,826
           So you in?

456
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,433
           - I'm in.
             - Yes!

457
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,634
       Thank you, Wheels.

458
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,636
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

459
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,238
    Where are they staying?

460
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,340
         Down the road
      at the Crest Motel.

461
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,708
     They are under names,

462
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,610
  uh, Monarch and "Wis-a-roy,"
            I think.

463
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,445
           - Viceroy.
         - Wheels, go!

464
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,913
   They're expecting you. Go!

465
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,648
           All right,
    but this is my last job.

466
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,785
      After this, lose my
     number and my e-mail.

467
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,486
     Don't try to Tweet me.

468
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,288
I'm unfriending you on Facebook,

469
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,424
    and definitely don't try
   to follow me on Instagram.

470
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,826
           Snapchat?

471
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,629
          OK. Just go.
   Keep mouth shut and drive.

472
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,934
          Hey, bozos.

473
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,471
        What's up, boss?

474
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,441
   Make sure everything goes
    exactly as planned, OK?

475
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,675
             Yeah.

476
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,377
Anything goes wrong, kill them,

477
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:50,248
     and before you leave,
         polish these.

478
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,683
      Polish, not Polish.

479
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,285
         Polish these.

480
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,592
       This isn't so bad.

481
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,394
    At least we're not sick.

482

483

         the bathroom?

484

485

        Nope. I'm good.

486
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,537

       get ready for bed?

487
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,906
  What do you mean? What do I
have to do to get ready for bed?

488
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,441
          I'm in bed.

489
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,611
    OK. What's up with you?

490
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,681
       I don't think I'm
      gonna go to college.

491
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,484
        Are you serious?
            Why not?

492
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,985
       I mean, I've been
       thinking about it,

493
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,388
     and I don't even know
       what I want to do

494
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,990
  with my life yet, so why not
   just take a few years off

495
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,925
and travel abroad or something?

496
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,961
   Kate, everybody knows that
   take a couple years off to

497
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,397
   travel abroad really just
   means going and get drunk

498
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,299
    and hook up with a bunch
       of foreign dudes.

499
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,601
    You're better than that,
    and college is all about

500
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,970
 where you figure out what you
   want to do with your life.

501
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,306
You're just so lucky you already
   know what you want to do.

502
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,573
     You're gonna be, like,
   the first female president

503
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,075
     one day or something.

504
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,544
         Hopefully not.
   There are currently a lot

505
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,079
       of qualified women
      serving in Congress.

506
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,480
          I'm hungry.

507
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,649
Me, too. Want to order a pizza?

508
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,351
       No. I want to get
          out of here,

509
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,954
        and I want to go
     somewhere nice, and...

510
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,756
  it's gonna be on my parents.

511
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,092
           - Really?
           - Why not?

512
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,994
    I mean--OK, technically,
     it is for emergencies,

513
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,730
  but seriously, if this isn't
     an emergency, what is?

514
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,031
  How are we gonna get there?

515
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,400
   I'll just order us a ride.

516
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,869
  I'll even say our names are
      Viceroy and Monarch

517
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,404
     like the butterflies,
        not the hookers.

518
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,340
        Hold on. What if
         we get caught?

519
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,408
  We're not gonna get caught.
   I'm not gonna tell anyone,

520
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,644
      and you're not gonna
          tell anyone.

521
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,879
         My clothes are
       covered in vomit.

522
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,882
       I guess that means
          we should go

523
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,584
       to a thrift store.

524
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,553
      OK. That is actually
       such a good idea.

525
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,455
        We haven't done
        that in so long.

526
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,824
See? We'll just go really quick,
    we'll have a nice dinner

527
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,759
  and some new fresh clothes,
           come back,

528
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,561
      and no one will even
       know we were gone.

529
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,596
      Well, I did find one
       that's still open.

530
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,932
      And there's already
       a ride on its way.

531
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,633
        We have to be so
    careful leaving, though.

532
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,969
   If Miss Goldstein sees us,
         we're screwed.

533
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,904
   Oh, my God. I do not think
   we have anything to worry

    get out of the bathroom!

545
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,629
 - I downloaded the building--
         - Don't worry.

546
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,398
          We got this.

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
   Ari's gonna lead us right
       to The Collector.

548
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,868
    Now let's just hope that

Well, if he isn't, we shoot him.

00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,252
      I got breath strips,
  I got a really sick Spotify

602
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,921
    if you guys like music.

603
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,256
    Anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

604
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,191
    I'm here to please you--
      or please, you know?

605
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,161
       Thanks. No water.
   Just drive and don't talk.

606
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,963
     OK. Cool, cool, cool.

607
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,731
    So where you guys from?

608
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,267
        In town on, uh,
     business or pleasure?

609
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,037
      Or I guess pleasure
    is your business, right?

610
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,305
           Ha ha ha!

611
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,839
             What?

612
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,341
       Nothing. Nothing.
        I'm--I'm sorry.

613
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,643
       I should--I--what
      am I--listen to me.

614
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,012
    I'm asking--I ask a lot
     of questions sometimes

615
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,914
 when I get nervous, you know?

616
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,849
     Not that I'm nervous.
 I'm calm, you know, I'm cool.

617
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,952
  My friends are always like,
   "Oh, Brian, he's so cool.

618
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,687
    You got to meet Brian."

619
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,355
 So, like, don't even sweat it,
           you know?

620
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,190
     It's just I'm saying--
  I'm saying I'm open-minded.

621
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,225
   So anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

622
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,860
    Look. Just do your job.

623
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,596
     No one will get hurt.

624
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,297
          OK. Got it.

625
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,202
   I'm gonna text Ari and let
    him know we're in play.

626
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,171
       Yeah, and tell him
     the driver's annoying.

627
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:48,872
        Driver. Are you
       guys talking golf?

628
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,711
      [cell phone chiming]

629
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,617
              Heh.

630
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,385
        Yes. Here we go.

631
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,195
        That's the spot.

632
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,130
       I'll be right here
        when you get out

633
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,865
   unless you want me to wait
       in the back alley.

634
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,400
   No. It's OK. This is fine.

635
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,102
        [Kate] You sure
        want to do this?

636
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,170
      Once we go in there,
    there's no turning back.

637
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,905
          - I'm sure.
          - Oh, yeah?

638
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,240
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

639
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,942
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

640
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,777
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

641
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:27,945
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

642
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,680
           - Mm-hmm.
            - Yeah?

643
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,048
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

644
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,950
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

645
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,118
           I mean...

646
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,653
          [both] Yeah!

647
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,405
 [Abby] Now remember the rules.

648
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,840
      I'll whatever outfit
    you pick just as long as

649
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,442
 it's not too slutty or dirty.

650
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,910
    You can't tell everyone
        it's a joke like

651
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,111
       you did last time.

652
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,813
        That's cheating.

653
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,048
     OK. It's not cheating
       if it's the cops.

654
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,315
   First one to break loses.

655
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,684
            - Deal?
            - Deal.

00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,813
         What the hell
      are they doing here?

665
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,981
        It's so obvious.

666
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,883
   They're buying disguises.

667
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,719
        Check this out.

668
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,987
   Says right here they were
     dressed up last time.

669
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,456
   Right, man, but the point
     is we could have done

670
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,924
      this job ourselves.

671
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,759
         Uh-huh. Look.

672
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,329
       They were orphans
     trained by the Yakuza.

673
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,497
      Sounds about right.

674
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,898
             Yeah.

675
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,233
            - Right?
            - Yeah.

676
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,302
   Everything on the Internet
            is true.

677
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,317
          Is this it?
    I think that this is it.

678
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,986
    This is fine. Just wait
    for us here, all right?

679
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,789
 OK. Well, I mean, this doesn't
 look like a safe neighborhood.

680
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,324
     Are you sure you girls
        are gonna be OK?

681
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,359
     What did we say about
       asking questions?

682
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,928
         Oh. Uh, what--
       I don't remember.

683
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,231
         - What was it?
    - It's safe, I promise.

684
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,465
     Just stay in the car,
     don't talk to anybody.

685
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,100
We'll be back in a few minutes.

686
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,102
[Brian] Uh, sorry. Can I use my
             phone?

687
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,871
            - Sure.
             - No.

688
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:35,272
 [Brian] I just want to talk to
         some buddies.

689
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,174
    Tomorrow, me and a bunch
         of my friends,

690
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,109
     we're going skydiving,
 which I'm pretty jazzed about

691
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,344
        because I love,
      like, extreme stuff.

692
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,045
  I'm, like, live on the edge.

693
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,448
         I'm just like
   an extremist--sportswise,

694
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,883
        not politically.

695
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,351
      I--all right, girls.

696
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,561
           All right.
     Let me do the talking.

697
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,962
              OK.

698
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,203
              Da?

699
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:09,273
         We're here to
        see The Painter.

700
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,909
             Nyet.

701
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,243
           Good job.

702
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,221
         - Oh, come on.
          - Too slow.

703
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,074
 What in the good Lord's name?

704
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,009
        [Kate] You have
      never looked better.

705
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,278
    I would totally hire you
   to be my personal trainer.

706
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,180
     Mmm. I think I'm more
        of a life coach,

707
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,448
         but thank you.

708
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,116
   I would totally marry you.

709
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,918
      Let's see how dinner
       goes first, honey.

710
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,961
  Hey. Sorry it took so long.

711
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,996
          No worries.
       Get what you need?

712
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,364
       Yeah. We think so.

713
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,066
       What do you think?

714
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,400
         I don't know.

715
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,102
   Come on. You can tell us.

716
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,104
        We look awesome.

717
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,372
         Where to next?

718
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,144
          - I had it.
   - Yeah, I'm sure you did.

719
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,646
      You can't just break
         someone's nose

720
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,514
      every time something
      doesn't go your way.

721
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,983
 Somebody could have seen that
      and called the cops.

722
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,117
I told you, I'm more than happy

723
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,252
    to teach you some moves.

724
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,620
      It's not that hard.

725
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,054
      I know how to fight.
        I prefer not to.

726
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,556
            Boring.

727
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,094
       Master, somebody's
        here to see you.

728
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,430
          Is he dead?

729
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,300
        [man] No. The--
    The Painter is resting.

730
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:46,036
       The Painter smells
        like he's dead.

731
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,504
          "Kreh-tos"?

732
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,139
        "Krah-tos," sir.
     We've talked about it.

733
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,974
          - Kreh-tos--
          - Krah-tos.

734
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,143
          - Kreh-tos.
          - Krah-tos.

735
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,279
      Kray-ah-tos. Say it.
          You say it.

736
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,114
           -Krah-tos.
         -Kray-ah-tos.

737
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,949
      We said the exact--
  it sounds exactly the same.

738
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,484
            No. Ah.

739
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,052
       It doesn't matter,
     and didn't I tell you

740
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,553
not to wake me when I'm clearly
            working?

741
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,390
      [Kratos] Sorry, sir.
    They, uh--they insisted.

742
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,360
              Man.

743
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,496
        You hit Kratos.

744
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:15,265
         Who does that?
     He's a big teddy bear.

745
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,534
             - Sir.
         - Ari sent us.

746
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,003
       [The Painter] Oh.

747
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:25,342
       Well, well, well,
    well, well, well, well.

748
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,379
       Well, well, well,
       well, well, well.

749
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:33,216
          Well, well,
       well, well, well.

750
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:38,288
    Well, well, well, well.

751
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:44,328
       Well, if it isn't
   Viceroy and the other one.

752
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,129
        It's a delight.

753
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,341
              Hi.

754
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,110
      Yes. May I help you?

755
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,179
 [Abby] Table for two, please.

756
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,680
   Do you have a reservation?

757
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,285
         Right. I see.

758
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:13,991
      Well, I wish we had
    a table for you, but...

759
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,392
           I do not.

760
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,361
       [Kate] "I do not"?

761
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,529
 Did you just say, "I do not"?

762
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,331
      Oh, my--oh, my God.

763
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,766
      That's exactly what
   Jason said at my wedding!

764
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,401
     "I do not, I do not"!

765
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:27,671
              Aah!

766
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,272
         My meatballs.

767
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,175
           My dress!

768
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,411
           [whimpers]

769
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,313
         You know what?
    They can have our table.

770
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,614
        We'll come back
         another night.

771
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,452
      [The Painter grunts]

772
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,692
           Oh, yeah.

773
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,127
          [urinating]

774
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,429
   I tell you, I'm a big fan.

775
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,597
            [pbbttt]

776
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,066
             Whoa.

777
00:33:56,068 --> 00:34:01,304
 What you guys did in Amsterdam
      was just next level.

778
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,774
           Thank you.
      It was all my idea.

779
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,776
    Oh, yeah? I don't care.

780
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:07,778
           [Monarch]
     So what is this place?

781
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,281
 I mean, the money you charge,
   and this is how you live?

782
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,151
    No toilets, no windows.

783
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,353
        I got a window.

784
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,288
    Yeah, that's a painting.

785
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,657
   Heh. I think I would know
     the difference between

786
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,327
    a painting and a window.

787
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,364
        Anyway, this is
       not where I live.

788
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,733
       This is my office.

789
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,368
      You know, I have to
      live like an artist,

790
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,503
       I have to breathe
        like an artist,

791
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,805
         I have to eat
        like an artist,

792
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,239
        I have to smell
        like an artist,

793
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,507
     dance like an artist,

794
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,276
      talk like an artist,

795
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,745
do this gesture like an artist.

796
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,613
        I can't do that
          at my house.

797
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,215
     You know what I mean?

798
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,717
    - I'm a method painter.
           - A what?

799
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,753
  A method painter, you know,
      like a method actor,

800
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,455
        except I paint.

801
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,123
      It's pretty--I would
    get that the first time

802
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,291
        someone said it.

803
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,560
Jesus. Did you cut your ear off?

804
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,830
   "Got to feel pain in order
     to work with colors."

805
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,598
         Maya Angelou.

806
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,200
       Yeah. I think you
      should probably see

807
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,403
      a doctor about that.

808
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,438
     You're kind of pretty.

809
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,210
     I'd like to draw you,
 give you a nice pencil twirl.

810
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,378
         You interested
       in a nude drawing?

811
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,713
         You don't have
         to get naked.

812
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,148
    I'll just get naked and
           draw you.

813
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,687
           Yeah. No.

814
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,856
        Do you have what
          we came for?

815
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,191
             - Huh?
- Do you have what we came for?

816
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,459
             What?

817
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,500
  Of course. You think I don't
     have my shit together?

818
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,569
    You know, when Ari first
   told me that he found it,

819
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,338
   I was like, "Yeah, right."

820
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,874
     But when he hired you,
        he certainly hit

821
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,375
     a ground-rule double.

822
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,744
          <i> ♪ Oh, oh ♪</i>

823
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,648
        Can you see it?

824
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,718
   Can you see the painting?

825
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,253
 And the wood and metal's aged?

826
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,621
  It will pass carbon testing?

827
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:01,324
        Oh, yeah. Yeah,
    all that stuff you said.

828
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,226
   You know, I was rock hard
    for all 12 hours it took

829
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,395
         to paint this.

830
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,330
      Yeah. We got to go.

831
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,832
         Appreciate it.

832
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,768
    I'd get that ear looked
    at as soon as possible.

833
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,638
 Oh, and I'm sorry about that.

834
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,239
        This isn't over.

835
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,707
      Yeah, I think it is.

836
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,909
      Get some ice on it.

837
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,912
          Thanks, bro.

838
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,380
     You're a good person.

839
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,284
     Take a picture of me.

840
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,952
    I have a strong feeling
    this is exactly what I'm

841
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:31,321
        gonna look like
   on my actual wedding day.

842
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,223
       Pfft. As if you're
       gonna get married.

843
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,624
        Are you serious?

844
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,892
        Now I'm not even
    smiling in the picture.

845
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,195
             - OK.
      - All right. Got it.

846
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,863
      Just send it to me.

847
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,498
 I still haven't gotten it yet.

848
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,899
It still isn't in my phone yet.

849
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,634
          - Calm down.
    - Have you sent it yet?

850
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,336
    Do you realize there was
     a period of time where

851
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,470
    people didn't even have
      cell phones at all?

852
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,339
      I wasn't alive then.

853
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,640
         Neither was I.

854
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,908
      So how do you know?

855
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,510
         [man] Bonsoir!

856
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,378
         Good evening.

857
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,781
      My name is Theodore,
    and I'll be your server

858
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,516
       for this evening.

859
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,484
     Before we begin, I am
    going to have to remind

860
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,621
  you to remove your headwear.

861
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,691
 We do have a dress code policy
      at this restaurant.

862
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,226
   This doesn't mean I lose.

863
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,394
        It kind of does.

864
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,496
           Thank you
      for your compliance.

865
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,734
        We may now begin
     a culinary adventure,

866
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,338
     but first, I'll leave
  you with these, your guides

867
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,939
       for this evening,

868
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:26,243
       for you to peruse
        at your leisure.

869
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,777
And I will very quickly tell you

870
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,479
   about tonight's specials.

871
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:33,984
      Tonight, we feature
    an Alaskan salmon slowly

872
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:38,788
   marinated in a balsam-sick
     vinaigrette reduction

873
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,657
     and then flash cooked.

874
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,561
      It's very dangerous
      but very delicious.

875
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:45,762
              Mmm.

876
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,297
           [inhales]

877
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,999
             Damn.

878
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,867
      I'll be right back,
      but please remember

879
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,335
        our policy here.

880
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,644
       No GMOs, yes OMGs.

881
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,550
    Was that guy even real?

882
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,357
        Oh, there--there
         are my girls.

883
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,992
    I was just worried sick.
  I mean, not worried. I was--

884
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,927
    What were you thinking?
  It was not safe back there.

885
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,829
      Relax. Everyone got
       what they wanted.

886
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,065
    Relax? It was bad enough
   you had to do the bouncer.

887
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,933
  Who knows how many more guys
 he could have had back there?

888
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,635
      What would you have
    done then, do them all?

889
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,804
    Yeah. If I had to, yeah,
       I'll do them all.

890
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,906
      I can handle three,
 I can handle four, no problem.

891
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,408
         Good for you.

892
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,481
              Huh.

893
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,485
  Kate, are you sure it's OK?

894
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,554
       This restaurant's
       really expensive.

895
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,356
   I mean, I know you're mad
         at your folks,

896
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,358
   but their appetizers cost
      more than my house.

897
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,859
    I seriously don't care.

898
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,995

00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:49,812
        Did Ari tell you
         to rip us off?

1193
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:53,049
        Who--who is Ari?

1194
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,383
   You heard of The Painter?

1195
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,318
        I know painters.

1196
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,121
          Rembrandts,
    the Ninja Turtles, sure.

1197
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,656
     [Viceroy] Wait. If you
    don't know Ari, why were

1198
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,324
    you at the Crest Motel,
      and how did you get

1199
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:03,726
 the names Viceroy and Monarch?

1200
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,095
         Because I had
      a pickup there, OK?

1201
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,130
       Those--those were
 the names on the pickup form.

1202
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:09,632
        I'm sorry I was
       two minutes late.

1203
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,734
          Pickup form?
  What are you talking about?

1204
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,104
         I am a driver
    for a rideshare company,

1205
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,373
   or at least I was a driver
    for a rideshare company

1206
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,842
    because I'm surely gonna
    get fired now if I live.

1207
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,444
       Not to mention my
     dad's gonna freak out

1208
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:23,212
  because this is his car, OK?

1209
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,547
       I lied about that.

1210
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:25,714
  I lied about having friends.

1211
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,149
   I don't even have friends.

1212
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:28,317
          I'm a loser.

1213
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,152
  The five cats are my world.

1214
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,321
    Please, please, listen.

1215
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:35,191
  I thought that if maybe we--
     we were cool with each

1216
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:38,094
  other you guys would like me
       and be my friends,

1217
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,096
   and maybe that would turn
      into something where

1218
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,765
      you guys would maybe
       have sex with me.

1219
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,533
             What?

1220
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,769
     Because you're--you're
     prostitutes, you know,

1221
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,337
      women of the night!

1222
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:49,638
     We're not prostitutes,
           you moron.

1223
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,108
     We're undercover FBI.

1224
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,543
           Like--like
    Female Body Inspectors?

1225
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:55,845
     My dad has that shirt.

1226
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,546
    We got in the wrong car.

1227
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:58,814
We have to go back to the motel
        and look through

1228
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:00,716
       security footage.

1229
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,451
    We got in the wrong car.

1230
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,619
   Who got in the right one?

1231
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,159
           Yes. Wow.

1232
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,128
       I think I just got
    the hang of it on yours.

1233
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,363
    It's so good. Thank you!

1234
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:16,298
        You know, you're
     actually really cool.

1235
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,868
     Aw. I'm so sorry about
     all that stuff I said

1236
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,236
     when I first got here.

1237
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,570
     I don't get out much.

1238
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,205
   No. It's OK. You're young.

1239
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:24,573
        I get it because
        I'm young, too.

1240
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,375
It's like we're peers, you know?

1241
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,377
  No. I--I think I'm younger.

1242
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:30,246
          Eh, agree to
     disagree on that, OK?

1243
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,748
    OK. So I got to ask you,

1244
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,683
 what is up with these outfits?
        You look insane.

1245
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,552
   You look like you had your
  period and then splashed it

1246
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:37,853
       back on yourself.

1247
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,421
   No. I stopped doing that.

1248
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,623
      We're actually just
        on a field trip

1249
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,191
 for our AP art history class.

1250
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,225
   Everyone got really sick,

1251
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:44,393
    but we decided to go out

1252
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,661
  and actually have some fun.

1253
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,497
    Oh, OK. Field trip, huh?

1254
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,698
    Where are you guys from?

1255
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,933
      Ugh. Lake Arrowhead.

1256
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,601
     Really? Wait. No way.

1257
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:53,769
 What high school do you go to?

1258
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,671
            - Dixon.
           - Get out!

1259
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,273
         Get right out.

1260
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,642
            Get out!
     Wait! I went to Dixon!

1261
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,310
           - Really?
           - Really?

1262
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:04,446
           Ha! Yeah!
  Dixon High Cougars for life,

1263
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:05,748
          you bitches!

1264
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,350
          Oh, my God!
        That is so rad.

1265
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,386
  Why didn't you guys tell me
       you went to Dixon?

1266
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:13,289
         Seriously, why
      didn't you tell me?

1267
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,591
    Err! Why didn't you guys
    tell me you're Cougars?

1268
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,293
       I would have used
         a new needle.

1269
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,228
          Oh, my God!
This is, like, blowing my mind!

1270
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,863
           You guys.

1271
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,831
   Oh, my God! Is that creepy
    gym teacher still there,

1272
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,500
          the one with
the thick glasses and no teeth?

1273
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:26,635
         - Mr. Abrams.
         - Mr. Abrams.

1274
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,205
     Well, he made me call
      him Badger, which...

1275
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,441
       He's in jail now.

1276
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:33,776
    Oh, that's--that's good.

1277
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:35,477
  That's actually really good.

1278
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,413
      So what are you guys
      doing after school?

1279
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,348
I'm probably gonna go to college
   for poli sci in the fall.

1280
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,849
    - Because you're smart.
            - Yeah.

1281
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,751
    Yeah. I'm probably gonna
      take a few years off

1282
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,987
       and travel abroad,
      really find myself.

1283
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,689
    OK. I think we all know
     that means you're just

1284
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,691
        gonna get wasted
     and hook up with guys

1285
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,859
   - who don't speak English.
  - [Abby] That's what I said.

1286
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,461
            - Right?
            - Yeah.

1287
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:53,829
            We have
 something. Two little besties.

1288
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,564
      Yeah. She's a slut.

1289
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,299
    Ha ha ha! You know what?

1290
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,602
         You guys wait
    right here, old Cougars.

1291
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,270
        I got something
        to show you, OK?

1292
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,805
              OK.

1293
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,306
      Get the old gal up.

1294
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:05,474
             - Ooh.
           - Got it.

1295
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,443
        Ha ha ha! Whoo!

1296
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,912
Lightheaded. The doctor told me
        to stop working,

1297
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,481
      but I was like, "No!
  You stop working." Ha ha ha!

1298
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:13,716
           BRB, guys.

1299
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,357
    Heh. You two are a trip.

1300
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,360
     How did you know about
   that Lake Arrowhead stuff?

1301
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,961
       What do you mean?

1302
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,663
  I mean, did you make it up,
       did you Goggle it?

1303
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,765
     Like, how did you know
       she went to Dixon?

1304
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,834
      We didn't make it up
    because it's the truth.

1305
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:34,603
  Yeah, right. You're a couple
      of high school girls

1306
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,373
          down here on
   a art history field trip?

1307
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,807
        AP art history.

1308
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:42,544
           Ha ha ha!
      You messing with me.

1309
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,580
     She's good. Ha ha ha!

1310
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:45,981
            - What?
            - What?

1311
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,052
  So what are your real names?

1312
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,453
           I'm Kate.

1313
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,389
  I'm Abby. What's your name?

1314
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,623
             Andy.

1315
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,325
        Nice to formally
        meet you, Andy.

1316
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,960
       Nice to meet you.
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

1317
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,396
      So how did you know
   about Viceroy and Monarch?

1318
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,398
      Yeah. We just saw it
     on an envelope when we

1319
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,766
    checked into the motel.

1320
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,534
    I mean, it was my idea.

1321
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,436
     I was the one who put
    it into my phone, so...

1322
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,974
         We got to go.

1323
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,776
       We got to go now.
   Put your foot in the shoe.

1324
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:14,977
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

1325
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,445
           Let's go!

1326
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,715
       Man, I got to pee.

1327
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,517
      OK. Can you hold it?

1328
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,385
      Hold it? Man, I been
        holding it, man.

1329
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,987
      You're just hearing
         about it now.

1330
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,689
     A grown man telling me
        to hold my pee.

1331
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,057
           OK. Sorry.

1332
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:30,025
        Why don't you go
      outside, grown man?

1333
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,695
      Go outside? Come on.
        I can't do that.

1334
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:35,364
        So uncivilized.

1335
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,566
       I met you in jail,
    but that's uncivilized.

1336
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,803
 It's Ari, it's Ari, it's Ari.

1337
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,071
              OK.

1338
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:44,907
          - Ari, hey.
          - It's done?

1339
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,675
         Is what done?

1340
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,477
        <i> How many things</i>
   <i> are you doing right now?</i>

1341
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,845
       Oh, right, right.

1342
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,580
         Right--ha ha.
       He's doing a bit.

1343
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:52,948
       They haven't done
       anything yet, Ari.

1344
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,483
      We're still watching
        and surveilling.

1345
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,352
       What do you mean?

1346
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:57,986
       <i> Uh, they got some</i>
    <i> clothes, they went into</i>

1347
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,489
    an artisinal restaurant,
       and so now they're

1348
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:01,857
        getting tattoos.

1349
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,359
            Tattoos?

1350
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,626
   I know they hit the place.

1351
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,861
     I got text from them.

1352
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,663
   What the hell is going on?

1353
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,964
      Are they paying you
         to play dumb,

1354
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,766
 or are you doing it for free?

1355
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:13,068
      Mr. "Airy," we been
   sitting on them all night.

1356
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,536
       We'd have seen it.

1357
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,739
         It's "Ar-ee,"
        and no "mister."

1358
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:19,475
         Jesus Christ.
     Something's happening.

1359
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:20,943
  I bet Wheels is in on this.

1360
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:22,478
           I knew it!

1361
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,680
   Bring them all to me now!

1362
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,115
             - Who?
             - Err!

1363
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:27,583
    [Ari] Who do you think?

1364
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:29,385
     Wheels and the broads!

1365
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,853
         Are you high?

1366
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,588
           He's good.
  We're gonna take care of it.

1367
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,656
   We'll talk to you so soon,
        and I thank you.

1368
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,958
            Idiots!

1369
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,632
            Come on.
    Let's go. We got to go.

1370
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,805
     Guys? My little kids?

1371
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:53,041
             Hello?

1372
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,978
  Did I just imagine all that?

1373
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,413
         Did--did we do
        something wrong?

1374
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,947
       Are you mad at us?

1375
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,749
     [Wheels] Not you. Just
    time to call it a night.

1376
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,920
 Wheels, how's it going, buddy?

1377
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,555
 What are you guys doing here?

1378
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,924
     Oh, I think you know.

1379
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,626
   There's been a big mix-up.

1380
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:11,860
    I really think you guys
      should let this go.

1381
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:14,630
    Sorry. Not gonna happen.

1382
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:15,998
       Mr. Ari's orders.

1383
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,699
       I'm not gonna let
         you take them.

1384
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,569
        Oh, don't worry.
     You get to come, too.

1385
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:23,639
      - What's happening?
        - I don't know.

1386
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,174
        Get out of here!

1387
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:26,542
         [both scream]

1388
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,445
              Ohh!

1389
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,921
        Go get the car!

1390
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,489
       Hold on, hold on!

1391
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:41,924
        This dress is a
      nightmare to run in.

1392
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:44,693
            I can't.
     My legs won't let me.

1393
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,829
         You're wearing
        workout clothes!

1394
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:48,764
              Aah!

1395
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,732
      Come on. Are you OK?

1396
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,502
   Stay right there, sweetie.

1397
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:55,003
     What are we gonna do?
     What are we gonna do?

1398
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,505
        Where do we go?

1399
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,806
           This way!

1400
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,077
     [dance music playing]

1401
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,181
          - What the?
             - Go!

1402
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,692
         Did he see us?

1403
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:18,193
       I don't think so.

1404
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,095
  - What the hell is going on?
        - I don't know.

1405
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,930
    I just want to get back
   to the motel before anyone

1406
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,600
     finds out we're gone.
   We should have never left.

1407
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:25,968
    I can't believe you got
       me into all this!

1408
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,569
    I got you into all this?
        Are you serious?

1409
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,037
     I didn't plan for this
        to happen, Abby.

1410
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,672
       I know you didn't
    plan for this to happen

1411
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,140
because you don't plan anything.

1412
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,809
      You just do whatever
       the hell you want,

1413
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:34,977
      and let other people
       clean up the mess.

1414
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,678
    That's--that's not fair!

1415
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,514
    I'm not gonna apologize
    for wanting to have fun.

1416
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:39,882
     If it weren't for me,
   you'd never even have any!

1417
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,283
        How is this fun?

1418
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,218
        I have a tattoo,
    we almost got kidnapped,

1419
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,020
    and we're in the middle
           of a rave.

1420
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,255
      This is a bad night!

1421
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,764
             Yeah.

1422
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,038
     Dude, will you please
       put the gun down?

1423
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,907
 Did you not see <i> Pulp Fiction?</i>

1424
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,308
          Put it down!

1425
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:11,647
   I got to ask were you guys
        orphans trained

1426
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:14,182
     by the Yakuza ninjas?

1427
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,984
             What?

1428
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:18,554
         We're not who
       you think we are.

1429
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:19,788
   It's them, man, it's them!

1430
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,256
       Put the gun down!

1431
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,908
      [Ari] <i> Where is it?</i>

1432
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,044
         Where's what?

1433
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,612
       What do you think?

1434
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:45,247
    The painting I paid you
          lot of money

1435
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,015
        to steal for me.

1436
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,818
      I would hate to kill
     the legendary Viceroy

1437
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,255
          and Monarch,
   so please do not make me.

1438
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,756
    Those aren't our names.

1439
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,191
 We didn't steal any paintings.

1440
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,693
         We're just two
      high school students

1441
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,161
on an AP art history field trip.

1442
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,996
     Oh, what is this now?

1443
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,799
    You're only high school
  student on art history trip

1444
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,868
      dressed like Madonna
        and Jane Fonda?

1445
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,370
             - Who?
           - Shut up.

1446
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:11,773
    I swear. AP art history.

1447
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,342
            OK. Heh.

1448
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:16,712
This is how you want to play me.

1449
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:20,048
      You now have exactly
    three seconds to tell me

1450
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,284
     what I needs to know.

1451
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,219
            - One...
   - We don't know anything!

1452
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,857
            - Two...
         - Sir, please.

1453
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,192
      Kate, do something.

1454
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,297
             Three!

1455
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,899
   Fine. You win. You got us.

1456
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,134
             What?

1457
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,335
          Yeah, what?

1458
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,070
Yeah. We're Viceroy and Monarch,

1459
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,372
        and we have what
      you're looking for.

1460
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:44,740
 You can put the gun down now.

1461
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:46,908
  Ha ha! I knew it! I knew it!

1462
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,811
       I knew it! Brains.

1463
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,314
 Just let us go, and we'll come
    back with want you want.

1464
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,916
        OK, but no, no.

1465
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:56,785
           Question.

1466
01:00:56,787 --> 01:01:01,223
 And please be totally honest.

1467
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:04,226
       Do I look stupid?

1468
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:06,361
              Hmm?

1469
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,931
 You really think I let you go,
     both of you walk away?

1470
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,199
              No.

1471
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:22,077
You go, your friend stays here,

1472
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,378
   and if you don't come back

1473
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,747
   before my buyer gets here,

1474
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:27,449
    I will have to kill her.

1475
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:28,950
              OK.

1476
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,852
  OK? You can't leave me here.

1477
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,154
    I'll be back, I promise.

1478
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,321
          Don't leave.

1479
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:34,823
              Go.

1480
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,091
 Kate, you can't leave me here.

1481
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,359
           Trust me.

      can't leave me here!

         leave me here!

          Kate, Kate.

1489
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,240
  Hush, please. It's annoying.

1490
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,825
     [Ari] OK. Tie her up.

1491
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,194
     I must make pee-pees.

1492
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:45,127
      What a weird night.

1493
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,133
        Congratulations.

1494
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:54,803
  [clerk] Don't you guys need,
        like, a warrant

1495
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,471
     for this or something?

1496
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:58,974
   Not if we never saw this.

1497
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:04,279
     [Viceroy] Right there.
        There they are.

1498
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,847
 [Monarch] How did that happen?

1499
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,249
        You had to pee.
    That's how it happened.

1500
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,084
     Damn it. They could be
        anywhere by now.

1501
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:13,021
    Help! Help! I need help.
  My friend, she's in danger.

1502
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,956
   I need someone to call the
 police or something right now.

1503
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,892
           [panting]

1504
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,427
   It's the girl from the TV.

1505
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,830
             What?

1506
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:25,233
       [Ari] OK. 50 more.

1507
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,802
             Call.

1508
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:28,470
        I'll do 50, too.

1509
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:32,174
         Getting close.
 I hope your partner shows up.

1510
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,543
I'd hate to disappoint my buyer.

1511
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,145
      OK. What do you got?

1512
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,581
   Check this out. Pair aces.

1513
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,385
    Ah. Two pair. Got lucky.

1514
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,053
       Shit, damn, crap.

1515
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,956
     You know what happens
        when I see crap?

1516
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,291
  I straight flush it. Ha ha!

1517
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,993
 Damn it. Straight flush where?

1518
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,895
  - Look at that. Right there.
           - Damn it.

1519
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:56,932
      You should've raised
     before the last card.

1520
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:02,971
 That's when he made his flush
  and he hit his second pair.

1521
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:05,106
     They both had nothing
          before that.

1522
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,977
             What?

1523
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:12,113
  This one, he made his flush
       on the river card.

1524
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:14,950
          Am I right?

1525
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,852
             Maybe.

1526
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,254
          Definitely.

1527
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:22,123
 Impressive. You want to play?

1528
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,893
    Come on. Hey...shut up.

1529
01:04:24,895 --> 01:04:28,496
   This will be interesting.
  You can play for your life.

1530
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,603
   [Kate] I don't know, guys.

1531
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,605
   This honestly sounds like
        a terrible idea.

1532
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,374
 If anything goes wrong or you
  feel in danger at any point,

1533
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,143
   just say, "Safari," and we
   will come in and get you.

1534
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,946
            Safari.

1535
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,182
     I don't know anymore.
     Can I change my mind?

1536
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:50,552
I'm sorry. You girls interfered
 with a federal investigation,

1537
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,121
   so if you and your friend
   want to stay out of jail,

1538
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,923
  this is what you have to do.

1539
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:56,892
            Safari.

1540
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,294
 [Viceroy] That's the code word
   for us to come in--safari.

1541
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,562
          Personally,
 I think you're gonna be fine.

1542
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,131
           - Shut up.
          - You ready?

1543
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:06,935
        Safari. Safari.

1544
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:09,204
       - That's the word.
           - Safari.

1545
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,207
      That's what's gon--
        Yep. That's it.

1546
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,443
  No. I'm saying it right now.
            Safari.

1547
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,946
     [Abby] <i> Should I deal?</i>

1548
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,282
I'll deal. Your hands are tied.

1549
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:22,517
           [laughter]

1550
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,419
             Right.

1551
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,455
  [Ari] So, uh, where did you
      learn to play cards?

1552
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,124
    I play with my brothers,

1553
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,659
   even started a poker club
        in high school.

1554
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:33,094
  Enough with the high school
        stuff, already.

1555
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,697
        - I'm not idiot.
       - It's the truth.

1556
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,000
    So I suppose you want me
     to believe you're not

1557
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:42,704
this, uh, Viceroy and Monarch or
whatever the hell names you are.

1558
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:44,339
       No. My friend just
        used those names

1559
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,141
      because she thought
         it'd be funny.

1560
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,209
       I don't even know
  what she's up to right now,

1561
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:50,645
     but I can assure you,
she's not getting any painting.

1562
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,651
      [Ari] Ach, garbage.

1563
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:00,422
             Ah...

1564
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:03,091
    - I can prove it to you.
             - How?

1565
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,293
  Could I borrow your laptop?
   I'll show you my profile.

1566
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,596
       It has everything
     that I told you on it.

1567
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,367
          OK. Go get.

1568
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,976
        [clears throat]

1569
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,454
              See?

1570
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,758
          Oh, my God.

1571
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,761
        Lake Arrowhead?
     I love Lake Arrowhead.

1572
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:42,530
          - So pretty.
            - Yeah.

1573
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,133
  - I almost moved there once.
       - Why didn't you?

1574
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:47,602
  Went to prison instead. OK.

1575
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:52,507
     OK. Says it's private.
      You have to add me.

1576
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,477
     Sorry, but I only add
         people I know.

1577
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:58,246
         Ha! I respect
     your privacy settings,

1578
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:01,383
    but, uh, given the fact
  that this is life or death,

1579
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,718
 I suspect you make exception.

1580
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,320
          Good point.

1581
01:07:05,322 --> 01:07:08,356
      Let me just sign in
         really quick.

1582
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,191
         Smarty pants.

1583
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,227
       Totally understand
    the whole privacy thing.

1584
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,728
     You don't want a bunch
       of random weirdoes

1585
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,263
  routing through your photos.

1586
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:18,233
           [chuckles]

1587
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,701
      You have a Facebook?

1588
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,170
 Uh, I'm still over on MySpace.

1589
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:24,205
              My--
        You have a band?

1590
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:28,343
            - Yeah.
      - Your band is lame.

1591
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,378
          [Abby] See?

1592
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,348
       That's from today.

1593
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:37,819
     Holy crap. Holy crap.

1594
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:40,655
   2,000 friends? Impressive.

1595
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,457
      Yeah, pretty popular
      around the Internet.

1596
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:46,528
 Heh. Poker club. Is real. Ha!

1597
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:50,298
 So wait. You are named...Abby?

1598
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,067
             - Yep.
             - Hmm.

1599
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,702
    - You look like an Abby.
           - I know.

1600
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:57,472
    - Spanish club, pom-pom?
             - Ha!

1601
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,341
     You're pom-pom? Prom?

1602
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:02,077
           [laughter]

1603
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,747
         Look at this.
  Oh, my God, AP Art History.

1604
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:10,085
   Christ, this is hilarious.
           Ha ha ha!

1605
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,720
      She is not gangster.
         She is child.

1606
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,757
  That's what I've been trying
  to tell you this whole time.

1607
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:19,527
    We almost killed minor.
           Ha ha ha!

1608
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22,163
             [man]
   You almost died. Ha ha ha!

1609
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,165
       Look at your face.

1610
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,501
  I had the plastic laid down
   in my van and everything.

1611
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:30,271
    There's egg on my face.
           Ha ha ha!

1612
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,842
     Where is my painting?
      We need my painting!

1613
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:38,246
           Good luck.

1614
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,556
           [exhales]

1615
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:50,692
          I don't know
  if she's got what it takes.

1616
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:52,560
           - Shut up.
           - Shut up.

1617
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:55,597
     [Ari] Apologies, kid.
Hell of a mix-up. Cut her loose.

1618
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:57,332
          No worries.

1619
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,867
     Look. I'll have my men
    take you back to motel.

1620
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:01,169
 Go home. Don't come back, OK?

1621
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,537
            - Deal.
            - Right.

1622
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:04,272
    Hey, hello. This is Ari.

1623
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:06,307
  For-real Monarch or Viceroy,
          please call.

1624
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:10,645
    Emergency. Call me now.
     Damn it. Gosh darn it.

1625
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,551
             - Hey.
        - What the hell?

1626
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,887
            - Kate?
    - I got what you wanted.

1627
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:20,688
            - What?
             - Yep.

1628
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,391
            - What?
         - Here it is.

1629
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:25,393
      Now let my friend go
       like you promised.

1630
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:28,163
      - We're square here.
  - Kate, what are you doing?

1631
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:29,931
     I told him the truth.
   He was about to let me go.

1632
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:32,700
  Don't call me Kate, Viceroy.
     I'm saving your life.

1633
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:35,270
   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Viceroy?

1634
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:36,938
       I--I have no idea
   what she's talking about.

1635
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,174
   I'm not Viceroy. I'm Abby.

1636
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:42,343
    I'm so Abby. Look at me.
   You even said so yourself.

1637
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,880
   Ha ha ha! I can't believe
          I bought it.

1638
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:50,518
Oh, my God, you two are so good.
      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

1639
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,654
       [Kate] We get it.

1640
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:54,889
  I gave you what you wanted.
         Now can we go?

1641
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:58,459
 Ha! I suppose a deal's a deal.

1642
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:01,296
    - Who are you right now?
  - Drop the act. We're beat.

1643
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:04,332
    He's onto us. Can we go?

1644
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,602
  You can leave when my buyer
  authenticates this painting.

1645
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,237
            Please.

1646
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,474
    Little late, gentlemen.

1647
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:17,845
       Now let's see what
    all this noise is about.

1648
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,888
   [Abby] Is that a painting?
 Kate, where did you get that?

1649
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,490
    You know where I got it,
            Viceroy.

1650
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:32,760
     OK. Have seat. Relax.
         We have time.

1651
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:35,563
     You need soda, chips,
      Chex Mix, pretzels?

1652
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,365
       I have everything.

1653
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,270
      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

1654
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,907
           She's in.

1655
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:48,843
      - Can I have a gun?
             - No.

1656
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,445
         It feels like
      I should have a gun.

1657
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:52,981
Oh, we might just pull this off.

1658
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:54,349
          Who's that?

1659
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,652
        [tires screech]

1660
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:03,725
   [Ari] Anyone can play CD.
       "Look. I'm band."

1661
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,560
      You're basically DJ.

1662
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:08,263
     - Why'd you come back?
   - I came back to save you.

1663
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:10,999
           Great job.

1664
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,001
         [Wheels] Ari?

1665
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:18,039
  [Ari] Wheels, what the hell
      are you doing here?

1666
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:20,375
     I thought you would've
           gone AWOL.

1667
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,310
      I trusted you, guy.

1668
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:25,613
          Ari, listen.
   You've got to let them go.

1669
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,982
          They're not
    who you think they are.

1670
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:30,418
  They're in high school, man.
   I have their real clothes.

1671
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,720
    - Ugh, smells horrible.
           - I know.

1672
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,389
    There's something wrong
           with them,

1673
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:35,923
   but they're not your pros.

1674
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:39,460
    You got to listen to me.
       I made a mistake.

1675
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,696
          Mistake. Mm.

1676
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:45,633
        Perhaps you can
      explain this, then.

1677
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:49,070
              I--

1678
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:53,608
 Wheels, only mistake you make
      is coming back here.

1679
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,377
      You are liar, liar,
         pants on fire!

1680
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:59,080
    I don't understand, man.

1681
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:02,050
      When'd you do this?
I was with you the entire time?

1682
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:05,586
Don't ask me. I don't know what
 the hell is going on anymore.

1683
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,488
      [Viceroy] That's it.
    He's about to kill them.

1684
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,557
   I can't believe I let you
       talk me into this.

1685
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,025
       We have to get her
       out of there now.

1686
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,861
          - Just wait.
       - I'd love a gun.

1687
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,530
     [Wheels] I don't know
   what you told these guys,

1688
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:17,498
          but they're
     very dangerous people,

1689
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,634
   so whatever you told them,
    you need to untell them.

1690
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:28,109
        - Oh, ho ho ho!
            - Kate!

1691
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,746
         Wowee, wowee.
This is what I'm talking about.

1692
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:34,449
            - Kate?
 - Shut up. My name's Monarch.

1693
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,751
            Listen.

1694
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:39,087
  - Even, like, a little gun.
             - Shh.

1695
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,823
      This is who you sent
  to pick us up, Ari? Come on.

1696
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,791
      Listen. I don't know
  what you think you're doing,

1697
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:46,994
    - but you need to stop--
        - Oh, ho ho ho!

1698
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,764
You are the worst criminal I've
  ever worked with in my life.

1699
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,934
  Took you about five minutes
   to spill your guts, Andy.

1700
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:55,570
         What? "Andy"?

1701
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,372
           - "Andy"?
         - Hello, Andy.

1702
01:12:57,374 --> 01:13:00,108
          - Hi, Andy.
    - Hello, Andy. Ha ha ha!

1703
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,478
     Oh, it's Raggedy Andy.
           Ha ha ha!

1704
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,680
 I told you that in confidence.

1705
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:08,449
      I love these girls.
      Poker club? Please.

1706
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:13,087
          Uh, Wheels--
  excuse me--Andy, take seat.

1707
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:16,891
Ha ha ha! You got bitch-slapped.
          Now you sit.

1708
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:20,528
    Oh, Andy. Shit, I'd want
   to be called Wheels, too.

1709
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,430
           [laughter]

1710
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,799
           Good girl.

1711
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:26,868
        She's got balls.
        I give her that.

1712
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,770
      Is this fun for you?

1713
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:31,973
          Who is that?

1714
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:48,656
         [Vlad Holiday]

1719
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,746
  That is an awesome pantsuit.

1720
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,214
  [Kate] Why'd you come back?

1721
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,950
   - I came back to save you.
          - Great job.

1722
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,653
         You don't need
     to be slapping people.

1723
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:21,756
     Let's make this quick.

1724
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,224
       The jet's leaving
        within the hour.

1725
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:26,961
    - I'd like to be on it.
       - Yes, ma'am. Ari?

1726
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,996
         In here. Look.

1727
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,566
    I hope, for your sakes,
     this painting's real.

1728
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,835
      Keep an eye on them.
         Watch my back.

1729
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:36,771
 Welcome. Thank you for coming.

1730
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:40,541
          Hello, Ari.
   I'm the one you spoke to.

1731
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:44,645
  Ha ha! Wowee, wowee, wowee.
        So much better.

1732
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:45,847
         Who are they?

1733
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:47,515
Oh, this is Viceroy and Monarch.

1734
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:48,983
       They are the ones
    who steal the painting.

1735
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,018
   Yeah. I heard about them.

1736
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,954
       You guys are gonna
        be huge one day.

1737
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:54,622
    May I get you something
           to drink?

1738
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:56,123
      I have soda, chips,
        so much in back.

1739
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,092
    No. I don't need snacks.

1740
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:00,061
   I don't even want to know
 what you have in the back, OK?

1741
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:02,930
The only thing I'm interested in
  is a lost Van Gogh painting.

1742
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,199
    Right, right. It's, uh--

1743
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,007
              Oh.

1744
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,610
 I can't believe you found it.

1745
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:21,549
   <i> Boy Peeing On Sunflowers.</i>

1746
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:23,918
            - Cool.
          - It's real?

1747
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:27,121
  Now let's see if it's real.

1748
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:28,556
             [snap]

1749
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,627
        [clears throat]

1750
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:42,737
   [Ari] Of course it's real.

1751
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,238
           - Uh-huh.
          - Of course.

1752
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:54,949
   Crazy. There's no painting
          on the back.

1753
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,884
            Mm-hmm.

1754
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,156
       [Viceroy] Come on,
       come on, come on.

1755
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:03,758
      [Monarch] Why is she
        taking so long?

1756
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,926
      - I don't like this.
           - Shut up.

1757
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,561
          Mm-hmm. OK.

1758
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:08,329
     Crazy person painted.
         You can tell.

1759
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,136
           Good job.

1760
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:18,673
  I never thought that I would
  see this painting in person.

1761
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:20,308
            [sighs]

1762
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,310
   Do you know that Van Gogh
          once said--

1763
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:25,947
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
     Do you have my money?

1764
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,348
           Of course.

1765
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:36,190
          Gotcha! Yes.

1766
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,725
      I can't believe it.
      It actually worked.

1767
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:39,226
   Right. I'm going in there.

1768
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:40,962
      Hold on. We're gonna
    wait for them to leave.

1769
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:42,830
     But she's right there.

1770
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,765
  We're not gonna go in there
     and start a shootout.

1771
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,233
These girls are in high school.

1772
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,102
      Call it in and have
       a team on standby.

1773
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,904
     I'm actually with her
          on that one.

1774
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,906
  I think that's a good call.

1775
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:55,876
    I know. I know. Shut up.

1776
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:59,046
- You can count it if you like.
         - I trust you.

1777
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:01,916
    You are beautiful woman.

1778
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,822
   I, uh, heard this painting
       is worth millions.

1779
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:10,257
   You'll make a lot of money
       when you sell it.

1780
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,293
 I already have a lot of money,
     and I'm not gonna sell

1781
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,695
 this painting, but I wouldn't
 expect you to understand that.

1782
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:17,298
     You're right. I don't.

1783
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:21,969
     We're done here, Ari.

1784
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,971
          [door opens]

1785
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,974
           Hey, Ari!

1786
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,276
     Ari, I got your money!

1787
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:30,945
How many buyers did you line up?

1788
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:32,146
          None. None.

1789
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,415
     Ari, I got your money.

1790
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,384
     Would you like to see
         a magic trick?

1791
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:38,819
             - Aah!
      - Get down! Come on!

1792
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,122
     Come on out! Let's go!
          Go! Come on!

1793
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:42,690
         What the hell
     is going on in there?

1794
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,091
I told you we should've gone in.

1795
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:45,860
     - I'll come with you.
        - You stay here.

1796
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,328
         Oh, thank God.
 I don't know why I said that.

1797
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,030
      I did not mean that.

1798
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:50,398
     I'll cover the front.
       You take the back.

1799
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,933
           All right.
     Hey...watch yourself.

1800
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:55,269
           You, too.

1801
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:58,039
         I'm an idiot.

1802
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,842
           [gunfire]

1803
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,314
     - You girls all right?
            - Yeah.

1804
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:10,051
      OK. Out on the rink,
 I'm gonna cause a distraction.

1805
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:11,752
              Go!

1806
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:12,920
           [gunfire]

1807
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,088
             - Aah!
             - Aah!

1808
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,699
             Shit.

1809
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:27,902
    You could've been rich,
      you greedy bastard.

1810
01:18:27,904 --> 01:18:29,804
      I didn't set you up.

1811
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:32,440
           He's clown
     with gambling problem.

1812
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,011
            Safari!

1813
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:38,979
 Why are you yelling, "Safari"?

1814
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:40,815
  That's what the FBI told me
  to say if we're in trouble.

1815
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:42,216
            The FBI?

1816
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,856
     [disco music playing]

1817
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,497
    Ha ha! It's party time.

1818
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,368
    I ran back to the hotel
       to call the cops,

1819
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,070
 but the FBI was already there.

1820
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:04,305
They told me I had to come back
          and do this.

1821
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:08,142
        - What? Safari!
           - Safari!

1822
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:10,344
    You have what you want.
          Just leave.

1823
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:13,481
You better spend all that money
        on disappearing.

1824
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:15,850
    That's the whole point.

1825
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,752
         [click click]

1826
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,321
     I'm out! We got to go!
            Come on!

1827
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:23,190
          Stupid Red!

1828
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:28,429
    FBI. Drop your weapons.
      Down on the ground.

1829
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,131
         Can't shoot us
      if we're not armed.

1830
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,166
         [guns clatter]

1831
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,768
            Make us.

1832
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,771
      Oh...you know what?

1833
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,506
      That actually sounds
          really nice.

1834
01:19:39,509 --> 01:19:40,875
              Oh!

1835
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,309
        FBI. Don't move.

1836
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:46,180
     FBI? Shit, damn, crap.

1837
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,119
             - Oh!
             - Aah!

1838
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,222
        - You set me up!
            - Sorry!

1839
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:57,925
           [gunshot]

1840
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:04,265
             - Ooh!
             - Go!

1841
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:07,101
             - Uh!
             - Ooh!

1842
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,069
              Uh!

1843
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:16,977
 [Abby] Kate, Kate, are you OK?
       Did you get shot?

1844
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,145
             Yeah.

1845
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,214
           [panting]

1846
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:22,216
            - Oh...
 - Is that a bulletproof vest?

1847
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:24,084
   Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

1848
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,220
   - My God, you're an idiot.
           - I know.

1849
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:29,390
    Do you know what happens
    to bitches who snitches?

1850
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,091
           - Huh huh!
             - Ah!

1851
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:41,235
  Ari, Van Gogh fuck yourself.

1852
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:44,205
          - Hey, Ari.
           - Uh! Ooh!

1853
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:47,107
    That's it. I'm going in.

1854
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:49,577
 Yargh. I'll wait five minutes.

1855
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:51,312
    I'll wait five minutes.

1856
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:53,514
 Five minutes, then I'll go in.
          Ten minutes.

1857
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:54,949
          Yeah, right.

1858
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,283
           Ooh! Ah...

1859
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:59,086
             - Uh!
             - Ooh!

1860
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:01,155
           [gagging]

1861
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,327
              Hah!

1862
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:12,466
         - Whoa, nice.
    - Yeah. Well, you know--

1863
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:14,535
    - Where's The Collector?
        - She got away.

1864
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,338
   She can't have gotten far.
            Come on.

1865
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,108
      [Brian] 15 minutes,
         then I go in.

1866
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,410
          Oh, no way.

1867
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:27,181
    That's it. It's go time.

1868
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,055
         [Brian] Aaaah!

1869
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:43,497
             What?

1870
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:46,300
             What?

1871
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,669
              Yes!

1872
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:51,305
          U.S.A. Yes!

1873
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:53,507
           Oh, ho ho!

1874
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,309
    Well, well, well, hello.

1875
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:57,278
        Oh, no big deal,
  just took out The Collector.

1876
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,179
 I don't want to talk about it.

1877
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:01,382
      - All right, Brian.
     - Yeah. That's right.

1878
01:22:01,384 --> 01:22:04,285
 Now, you see, I saw her there,
     and I knew who she was

1879
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,320
   because of what we've been
       saying, and so I--

1880
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:07,955
     I automatically knew.

1881
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:09,390
        You know, I used
       the IPDE process--

1882
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,425
       identify, predict,
       decide, execute--

1883
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,527
   really hit her hard, too.

1884
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,262
   She didn't see it coming.

1885
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,398
      The look on her face
     I'll remember forever.

1886
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,301
    She's not dead, is she?

1887
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:23,504
        Uh! Damn it. Uh!

1888
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:26,173
              OK.

1889
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:27,608
           All right.

1890
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,979
         Hundred large.
    Thanks for the gig, Ari.

1891
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:35,382
      Good luck in Brazil.
      You girls all right?

1892
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:37,217
          We'll live.

1893
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:39,053
- Thanks for coming back for us.
      - Sorry about that.

1894
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:40,688
   I really didn't trust you
     until I got back home

1895
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,223
    and smelled your clothes
  in the back seat of my car.

1896
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:45,993
   Yeah. We're probably gonna
        need those back.

1897
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:49,697
        [Viceroy] Kate?
      Where are you? Kate!

1898
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:51,966
   Guys, chill. It's the FBI.

1899
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,535
     I'm over here. Safari.

1900
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:56,503
    The FBI? What the hell?

1901
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:58,505
           - Freeze.
    - Let me see your hands.

1902
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:01,141
       Hands in the air.

1903
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:03,610
    [Kate] Guys, it's cool.
           It's cool.

1904
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:05,412
  This is Abby. This is Andy.

1905
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,348
       He was our driver
   I was telling you about--

1906
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,416
       he literally just
       saved our lives--

1907
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,685
        and that's Ari.

1908
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:17,291
       Uh-huh. Hey, Ari,
  nice meeting you in person.

1909
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:18,659
       Who are you guys?

1910
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,494
        They're the real
      Viceroy and Monarch.

1911
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,296
[Wheels] The one I was supposed
    to pick up at the motel?

1912
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,031
             - Yep.
       - And you're cops?

1913
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:25,566
       Well, not exactly.

1914
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,234
 We work for an undercover unit
        that specializes

1915
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:29,203
       in recovering lost
      and stolen artwork.

1916
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,671
       It's complicated.

1917
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:32,373
   [Wheels] After everything
        that's happened,

1918
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:34,274
        this is probably
the only thing that makes sense.

1919
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,677
           - No way.
     - I tried to tell you.

1920
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,712
     We should leave before
    the local cops get here.

1921
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:40,647
    I don't want to fill out
      all that paperwork.

1922
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:42,516
 [Viceroy] Yeah. You're right.
     That sounds horrible.

1923
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,018
       Am I under arrest?

1924
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,786
             - No.
            - No...

1925
01:23:45,788 --> 01:23:48,455
      but the three of you
      are coming with us.

1926
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:51,358
     There's one more thing
    we got to take care of.

1927
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:01,668
         Get a move on.

1928
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,240
            Coming.

1929
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:08,475
            [sighs]

1930
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:10,644
       Crazy night, huh?

1931
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,414
              Yup.

1932
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,382
       Are you mad at me?

1933
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,185
              No.

1934
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:20,220
      You ready for this?

1935
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,656
       Yeah. Let's do it.
    I just want to go home.

1936
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:41,475
          That was it?

1937
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:43,844
  Make it look so much better
         in the movies.

1938
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:46,613
They make losing your virginity
look better in the movies, too.

1939
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:47,781
    Movies are full of sh--

1940
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,765
          You guys did
      a great job tonight.

1941
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,434
      So what happens now?
       Are we in trouble?

1942
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,337
     [Viceroy] No. As long
 as you guys don't tell anybody

1943
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:12,873
  about your involvement here,
   this car is the last link

1944
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,142
           between us
   and what happened tonight.

1945
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:16,743
  We won't tell if you won't.

1946
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,345
         We made a deal
 when I got back to the motel.

1947
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:19,713
      They said as long as
         I helped them,

1948
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:21,582
    they won't tell anyone.

1949
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,183
      You did that for me?

1950
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:25,119
      Someone had to clean
         this mess up.

1951
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,221
    [Viceroy] All we wanted
 out of this was The Collector.

1952
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,856
      With her in custody,
    we will recover millions

1953
01:25:28,858 --> 01:25:30,891
       in stolen artwork.

1954
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,659
    See you around, ladies.

1955
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:36,396
     [Brian] What about me?
     What about old Brian?

1956
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:38,198
          You guys put
   a loaded gun in my mouth,

1957
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,168
   made me hit a strange lady
       with my dad's car,

1958
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,537
    which you just blew up.

1959
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:46,340
        Well, you can't
      win them all, Brian.

1960
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:50,544
         Sucks for you.

1961
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:52,479
         Sucks for me?
   I didn't win any of them.

1962
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,915
         I won nothing.
     I didn't win anything.

1963
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:59,253
      Sun's about to rise.

1964
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:00,721
      If my dad finds out
    we went out last night,

1965
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,923
       then he finds out,
    doesn't matter anymore.

1966
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:05,492
 [Wheels] We can still make it.
           Let's go.

1967
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:11,298
        [tires screech]

1968
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:16,236
        [tires screech]

1969
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:17,905
   [Wheels] Sorry about that.
         You all right?

1970
01:26:17,907 --> 01:26:19,873
Uh, yeah. Don't worry about us.
          We're fine.

1971
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,709
  Yeah. We're fine. Go faster.

1972
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:25,212
 [Abby] I can't believe the FBI
   let you blow up that car.

1973
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:27,714
         I know, right?
 I've always wanted to do that.

1974
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,250
           - Me, too!
      - It was so badass.

1975
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:32,419
     Even if we get caught,
      it was so worth it.

1976
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,288
       [Kate] Yes. Whoa!

1977
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,390
    [Wheels] Hey, you're not
       gonna get caught.

1978
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:37,958
    You're going to college,
and Kate, she's going to Europe

1979
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,760
        to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

1980
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:41,628
      Oh, my God, I am not
      gonna go to Europe.

1981
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,530
  Staying here to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

1982
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,265
   I'm not gonna do anything
      with any dudes, OK?

1983
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:47,501
      My parents can't pay
          for college.

1984
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:49,970
     [Abby] Why didn't you
       just tell me that?

1985
01:26:49,972 --> 01:26:53,807
   I found out this morning,
    and I'm embarrassed, OK?

1986
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:55,542
   I know how excited you are
         about college.

1987
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,377
      I don't want to ruin
       your whole thing.

1988
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,947
  Kate, there's really nothing
    to be embarrassed about.

1989
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:01,648
       There are so many
       successful people

1990
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,483
     who don't even end up
       going to college,

1991
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:06,353
      and you could go to
community college or something.

1992
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:09,289
   Maybe I'd even stay and go
 to community college with you.

1993
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,491
       - What? You would?
          - Hell, no.

1994
01:27:11,493 --> 01:27:12,659
        [tires screech]

1995
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:14,494
             - Aah!
             - Aah!

1996
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:15,929
  Ladies, we're getting close.
      Put your clothes on.

1997
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:19,399
            - Gross!
  - Oh, these smell so gross.

1998
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,344
        [tires screech]

1999
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:34,948
         - Whoa, Andy!
            - Andy!

2000
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,883
          Ha ha! See?
    I told you we'd make it.

2001
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:38,685
   - Hey, we still got time.
        - Thanks, Andy.

2002
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,621
        Hey, no worries.

2003
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:43,557
      Uh, maybe we should
   take a second to thank me,

2004
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:45,726
   the one who saved the day.

2005
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:48,629
      What? You smacked me
       in the face twice.

2006
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,398
  Yeah, and I was held hostage
           with guns.

2007
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,767
     Don't be so dramatic.

2008
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,469
  [Wheels] Ha! You know what?

2009
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:57,437
     Actually, I should be
       thanking you guys.

2010
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,674
      If you didn't wander
  into my vehicle by mistake,

2011
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:04,845
 I'd be dead or in jail by now,
         so thank you,

2012
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:08,615
 and here's a little something
     for your college fund.

2013
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,651
      Oh, are you serious?

2014
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:12,753
         Better take it
    before I change my mind.

2015
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:14,855
    See? Everything's gonna
           work out.

2016
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:16,757
             [Kate]
 Oh, my God, we should go back,

2017
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:18,625
    sell an actual painting
      on the black market.

2018
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,394
             [Abby]
     No. We--we need to go.

2019
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:22,896
   - You never listen to me.
         - Bye, Wheels.

2020
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,531
           Bye, Andy.

01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,902
         Ha ha ha! Oh.
       Hey, boo-boo. Hey.

2023
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:31,505
I--I was just coming home. yeah.

2024
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:44,918
              Hi.

2025
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,454
   Thank you for being early,
         Kate and Abby.

2026
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:57,431
  Oh, wow, smells a lot worse
   than yesterday, you guys,

2027
01:28:57,433 --> 01:29:00,400
          a lot worse.

2028
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,741
        [engine starts]

2029
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:11,978
Yeah, and there's--there's still
    vomit in a couple spots,

2030
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,948
       so just be careful
         where you sit.

2031
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,783
    [Chad] Bro, I'm so sorry
    I ever made fun of you.

2032
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:19,720
   I was just self-conscious
     about my own identity,

2033
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:21,355
    so I took it out on you.

2034
01:29:21,357 --> 01:29:24,391
       No. I was a dick.
       You're a good guy.

2035
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,729
   [Goldstein] Jessie, what's
  going on? What's happening?

2036
01:29:28,731 --> 01:29:31,631
       Hey, how are you?

2037
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:37,037
        Fine, except for
   I fricking hate everyone.

2038
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,905
     What's happening here?
        What's going on?

2039
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:45,479
  How was your night, you two?

2040
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:47,814
          - Uh, uh...
         - Pretty good.

2041
01:29:47,816 --> 01:29:50,517
 I mean, you guys probably were
      having a lot of fun,

2042
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:51,885
  but we decided to sneak out

2043
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,553
   because it was getting all
            stinky,

2044
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,088
and so we got in the wrong car,

2045
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,857
    tried to sell a painting
      on the black market.

2046
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,792
       The FBI showed up,
   but they were super nice.

2047
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:00,527
        - It was weird.
        - She got shot.

2048
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:03,764
     No. Yeah. Yeah, but it
      was mostly marinara.

2049
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:07,534
        OK. Very funny,
       Paula Poundstone.

Just stay in your seats, please.

2051

      Saturday night, huh?

 No. We're not. No. We're not.
