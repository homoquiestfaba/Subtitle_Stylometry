Jim!

12
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,058
What did you party too hard?

What is that?

16
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:34,942
Make it stop. [whimpers]

appointment already.

No, no, no, no.
[Alyson chuckles]

23
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,537
Why the fuck you gotta
make it such a big thing?

24
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:09,739
[chuckles] Seriously.

25
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,909
I just, I just,
needles, I don't like 'em.

26
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:19,548
Okay so like tattoos,
piercings also out of the question?

00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:20,883
Hmm?, Square Boy?

28
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,150
Yeah. Not happening.

29
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,687
Why?

30
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:26,655
Are you a little
conformist? [chuckling]

31
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,191
Wow. Hey, Alyson.

32
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,126
My body is a temple.

33
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:33,929
Oh, are you saying
my body's not a temple?

34
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:34,897
And be.

It's not just the needles, okay?

37
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,169
I have a thing with blood,
especially my blood.

38
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:43,938
- Dude.
- Jim.

39
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:44,939
No big fucking deal.

40
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,775
You just look away.

41
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:48,143
- You don't gotta watch.
- Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,745
Nah.

43
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,080
I get all like
woozy and shit too

44
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:53,948
from all the blood loss.

45
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,816
- No dude.
- No, yeah.

46
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,185
That's why they give
you the cookies.

47
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,856
I saw that on episode
of "The Simpsons."

48
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,959
Jim, just some advice,

49
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:07,695
maybe don't use "The Simpsons"
as a rough guide to life.

50
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,965
[both chuckling]

51

Whatever, y'all.

53
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,173
There are other
ways to make money.

54
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,341
Oh my God.

55
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,043
Lots of, I'm thinking.

56
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,913
Yeah. Okay.

57
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,715
You go get that bag, player.

58
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,716
I'm gonna roll another joint.

59
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,019
Ooh, look at this.

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,620
House sitting.

61
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,255
House sitting?
[Alyson chuckles]

62
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:38,193
Yeah. Looks like
pretty nice place.

63
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,331
Looks like a job for
a 12 year old girl.

64
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:43,299
How much does it pay?

65
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:48,135
Um, wow. A hundred
bucks a night.

66
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,303
Ooh, wow.

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,673
Plasma donors get 80
bucks a donation, dude.

68
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,910
And it's like a couple hours.

69
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,245
It's some old lady's place.

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,115
It's pretty close to here.

71
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,286
Do you think I
should email them?

72
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,853
Where are my goddamn papers?

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,721
[Alyson chuckles]

74
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:07,990
Hmm.

75
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,358
What do you think?

76
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:13,028
It could be cool. Easy way
to make some cash, I guess.

77
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,630
So should I hit 'em up?

78
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:15,798
Sure, dude.

79
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,033
Maybe you could party
somewhere else for once.

80
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,670
Jesus-goddamn-
motherfucking-Christ.

81
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,173
I gotta have some in the car.

Hmm. [chuckling]

85
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:36,651
- What?
- Nothing.

86
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,322
It's just cute that
you're squeamish.

87
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,192
And just don't like the
idea of losing pints of blood.

88
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,129
[chuckles] Oh my
God. It's not pints.

You're so funny.

91
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,643
You better write that email
before someone else gets on it.

92
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,978
Yeah.

93
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,218
All right, baby.

94
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,754

- Dude, oh my God.
- What?

97
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:20,762
- It doesn't matter.
- You're dropping everything.

98
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,430
- Shut up.
- Stop.

99
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:23,699
- Shut up.
- What?

100
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,634
Chill.

00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,069
Probably need you
a couple of nights,

108
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,172
coming back Sunday,
maybe Monday, latest.

109
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,440
Just kind of depends
how she's doing.

110
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:40,375
Right, Ma?

111
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,978
Christ.

112
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,146
So yeah.

113
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,481
Just need you to stay here.

114
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:49,450
Ma's a little paranoid
about prowlers.

115
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,219
I've heard plenty.

116
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,156
You got any questions?

117
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,558
Um, yeah.

118
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,229
So basically you just
want me to stay here?

119
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,064
He doesn't have to stay here.

120
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:06,334
He doesn't want to.

121
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,470
Yes.

122
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,906
There's a guest room upstairs.
Used to be mom's room.

123
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,808
Have it set up by Friday.

124
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,176
[Jim] Cool.

125
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,479
That gonna work for ya?

126
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:20,282
He doesn't have to stay
here if he doesn't want to.

127
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:24,485
Ma, I am doing what I
can to ease your mind here.

128
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,088
You are not making it easy.

129
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:30,158
My own son yelling
at his mother.

130
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:32,927
You're good to your
mother, aren't you?

131
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,932
That's the whole point, Ma.

132
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,134
That he stay here.

133
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:45,240
I just wish the good
Lord would take me now.

134
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,146
Ma.

135
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,215
Ma, where are you going?

136
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,786
Can I even take a piss
without you hounding me?

137
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,558
Hmm.

138
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:08,462
Her health hasn't been good.

139
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,367
My sister was watching
her for a while, eh.

140
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:16,538
Well we think she
took off last week.

141
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,374
Oh, I'm sorry.

142
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,975
That sucks.

143
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,443
Yeah.

144
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,379
I can't say I blame her.

145
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:27,449
She's been going on about
people in the house,

146
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,683
coming up the stairs.

147
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,451
You know, I don't know
if her head's right.

148
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:32,955
- You know?
- Right.

149
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:36,591
So...

150
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:41,296
So, you know,
should be pretty easy.

151
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,098
Nothing, you know, you gotta do.

152
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:46,033
Just, you know, if you get bored

153
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,302
and you wanna have some
friends over keep you company,

154
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,272
- feel free.
- Okay.

155
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,307
- Cool.
- Just no smoking.

156
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,475
- All right?
- Oh, yeah, no.

157
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,677
- No drugs.
- No, of course.

158
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:57,545
- You a weed smoker?
- Me?

159
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,413
No, no, not at all.

160
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,850
Good. Shit makes you lazy.

161
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:04,987
- Yeah.
- And stupid.

162
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:09,189
You know I don't
like you smoking.

163
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,259
I know, Ma.

164
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:13,863
Oh, boy.

165
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:18,566
So what do you say, kid?

166
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,235
Are you gonna watch
this old bird's house

167
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,369
for the weekend or what?

168
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,639
Yeah, I mean, sure.

169
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,274
Great. Settled.

170
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,944
See it all worked out.

171
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,613
Mm, I think if that's it,

172
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,951
I'm just gonna call a ride or

173
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,218
- No, I can drop you
- something.

174
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,719
somewhere in town
on my way back.

175
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,256
Oh, you don't have to do that.

176
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:42,156
Yeah, no, I insist.

177
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,658
Just give me a sec.

178
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,495
[ominous music]

179
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:08,350
I'm not as senile as
he makes me out to be.

180
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:14,689
And I'm not afraid of someone
breaking into the house,

181
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,326
I'm afraid of what's
already in the house.

182
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,629
- Mrs. Marina.
- And if you stay here,

183
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,231
you'll hear it too.

Yo, y'all got anything
good to eat in here?

191
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:45,353
I'm starving.

192
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,225
Hey man, I didn't see you there.

193
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,693
Kinda quiet.

194
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,295
Yeah, sorry.

195
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,966
Lost in thought.

196
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:00,769
My grandnephew, Alex.

197
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,504
That's me. Your boy.

198
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,305
Say, I'll tell you what, man,

199
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:06,073
you must be that guy
they got watching,

200
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,474
watching the house for
the weekend there, huh?

201
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,577
Uh, yeah. I guess I am.

202
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:12,079
Yeah, they couldn't
get me to do it.

203
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:13,148
Why?

204
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,149
What's wrong with
this place, dude?

205
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,784
Dude, it's fine.
Nothing's wrong.

206
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,053
It's, I'm just going away
with the boys to Vegas

207
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,054
for the weekend, that's all.

208
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:20,990
- Chill.
- Oh.

209
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:23,757
Oh, right.

210
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,360
Oh, before I forget,
Hey Auntie Eunie.

211
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:30,131
You're good with that, that
thing we talked about, right?

212
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,402
Everything all
good with what thing?

213
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,306
Well?

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,543
What's this thing?

215
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,346
Mm, nothing really.

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,316
Shit, Uncle Tony,
it's been a minute.

217
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,451
You're looking pretty
smooth though, man.

218
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:52,121
You put on what like
50 pounds or something?

219
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,389
Why are you here, shit stain?

220
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:56,724
'Cause I wanted to
come by and say hey

221
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,725
to my favorite relatives.

222
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,860
That's fucking
why. Come on, man.

223
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,495
So you can raid our fridge

224
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,497
and be a general
freaking nuisance?

225
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:04,800
Is that why?

226
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,168
Well there's nothing like
some quality family time

227
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,370
but I gotta get going, so...

228
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:11,505
Yeah, you can say that again.

229
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,241
[Alex] Catch you later, guys.

230
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,744
Sorry about that.

231
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:17,679
You ready to go?

232
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,216
Yeah, no worries.

233
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,384

Man, that is some
spooky shit, bro.

237
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,796
- I know, right?
- I don't think I'd do it.

Mm, yeah, I already
told them I would, so.

240
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,272
Well take Grandma's advice,

243
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:53,581
Is it weird that I
kind of just wanna see

244
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,450
what she's talking about?

245
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,152
Yeah, it is.

246
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,322
Well like she's
gotta be senile, right?

247
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:02,223
I don't know, man.

248
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,560
Here.

249
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,496
Thank you.

250
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,832
Like what's the worst
that could happen?

out of "Deliverance."

00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,443
That's you.

255
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,213
A literal hell spawn
comes up out of the floor

256
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,783
and drags you to a
fiery pit of agony

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,285
for all eternity.

258
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,557
Or you know, you get shot
in the face by a prowler.

259
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,291
Mm.

260
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:39,827
I'm too high for shit shit.

I'm serious.

You should bail.

I can't.

When I say I'm gonna do
something, I'm gonna do it.

I mean, it's pretty big
place to have to myself.

275
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,697
You and Alyson oughta
come by one night.

276
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,234
Yeah, probably swing that.

277

Yup.

I thank the good Lord every
day that I was born handsome

and not rich.

00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,485
You think she'd be okay
with you showing me that?

286
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,020
She wouldn't care.

287
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,288
Really?

would call you an asshole.

Besides, I don't give two shits

291

what any dumb fuck
thinks about me, brother.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,869
Okay.

00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,638
What time is it?

00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,705

Yeah and your
future looks stoned.

That's the spirit.

Hey, thanks again
for doing this, huh.

00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,644
Yeah, no sweat.

Hey, Dad.

wanted to call and
see how you were doing

liking it up there?

It's okay, Jim

rehash this right now.

340

Yeah.

Well that sounds like something.

Yeah.

Hey, um.

349
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,935
I was wondering if
you'd be willing

350
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:52,205
to send me a little money?

351
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:55,009
Just until my next paycheck.

352
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,243
Okay.

353
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,745
When's your next paycheck?

00:19:58,645 --> 00:19:59,513
Um...

355
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,019
I guess I don't actually know.

356
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,220
But I'll pay you back.

357
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,989
You don't have to pay me back.

358
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,659
But you can do me a favor.

359
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:12,726
Okay.

360

00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:21,470
I will.

00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,805
I love you, son. We love you.

366
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,584
Okay, the money should
be in your account now.

367
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:38,419
Thanks.

368
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:41,156
I'll, I'll talk to you soon.

369
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:46,760
And say hi to Kim for me.

370
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:47,662
I will.

371
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,498
Okay.

372
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,567
Bye, son.

373
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:57,171
Bye.

377
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:14,355
[Man] Thank you for
calling Galactic Pizza.

378
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:17,791
Can I interest you in
some of our Saturn bread?

379
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,859
Um, no, thank you. Not today.

380

[body slithering]
[suspenseful music]

381
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:23,831
[Man] All right, what can
I get started for you, sir?

382
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:30,038
Can I get a medium
galactic meat lovers...

383
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:34,307
[Man] The intergalactic
meat lovers pizza?

384
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,676
Yeah, intergalactic
meat lovers pizza.

385
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:38,378
[Man] Okay, I've got one large

386
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,113
intergalactic meat lovers pizza.

387
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,182
Is that gonna be
everything for you?

388
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,083
Yep.

389
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,785
[suspenseful music]

390
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:48,055
[Man] So is that gonna
be cash, debit or credit?

391
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:49,624
[object banging]

392
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,092
Sir? Hello?

00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:28,096
Oh.

00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,330
Mom, do you want any
sour cream in your eggs?

412
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:20,167
[ominous music]

413
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,171
Mom?

414
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:25,840
- Mom?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,342
Hi.

416
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:30,511
Would you like some
sour cream in your eggs?

417
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,878
Oh, yeah

418
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,147
Yeah, sure, honey.

419
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:35,917
Are you doing okay?

420
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:39,420
Oh, I think I'm just tired.

421
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,023
I didn't sleep so
good last night.

422
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,392
You seem a little off.

423
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:47,461
Well I've been
having nightmares.

424
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,596
Nightmares, huh?

425
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:52,333
Yeah, it's the same
thing over and over.

426
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,401
[ominous music]

427
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,171
It's so strange.

428
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:01,107
I'm awoken every night
by someone walking

429
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:03,110
slowly up the stairs.

430
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:06,079
And the footsteps are so strong,

431
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:09,215
they vibrate the
walls of my room.

432
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,284
And I get out of bed

433
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,420
and I go over to the
banister and I look over,

434
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:18,493
and there's this thing
walking slowly up the stairs.

435
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:23,197
And I run back to my
room and shut the door.

436
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:24,298
[door closes]

437
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,300
And then I wake up.

438
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:30,504
Hmm. You wonder
what that's about.

439
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,605
What do you mean?

440
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,040
Well, dreams are
kind of like an insight

441
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,609
into your subconscious, right?

442
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:39,946
It could be something that
you're not dealing with.

443
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:43,517
Like stress, anxiety,
I mean, resentment.

444
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,220
- Resent what?
- Mom, I don't know.

445
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:47,288
They're your dreams.

446
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,656
I'm just saying that
sometimes dreams

447
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:53,394
can be like a
metaphor for things

448
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,627
you're not dealing with.

449
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,230
Oh, for God sake.

450
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:57,265
Does everything have to be

451
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,333
a psychological
disorder these days?

452
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,369
They're just fears.

453
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:04,872
I had them since I
was a little girl.

454
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:08,509
Mom, I don't know.

455
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,544
Maybe it's something
you're not dealing with.

456
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:15,316
[sighs] Donna, I'm
nearly a 70 year old woman.

457
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,584
I live alone.

458
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:20,487
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to me,

459
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,523
and I won't be able
to protect myself.

460
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:23,256
Oh, Mom.

461
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm right down the street.

462
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:30,030
You can call me at any time
and I'll be right over.

463
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,334
Oh.

464
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,202
Mom, I love you.

465
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,306
I love you too, sweet pea.

- She cries.
- Cries?

474
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:16,403
In the night.

475
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,604
Dead people don't cry.

Mm. Hey, hey.

You and Alyson wanna drop by
the old lady's house tonight?

[all laughing]

491
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:05,365
[Collin] And you know,
the Hunchback Nostradamus,

492
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,067
- he predicted it.
- No, it was

493
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:09,736
- just Nostradamus.
- That's what I said.

494
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:11,905
No, it was not a hunchback.

495
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:12,940
That guy's from Notre Dame.

496
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:13,941
I saw it on the
History Channel.

497
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:17,311
I know. We
watched it together.

498
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:18,311
He wasn't a hunchback?

499
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:19,045
No.

500
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:22,982
- Nostradamus.
- Yeah.

501
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:25,484
- Predicted 9/11.
- Yes.

502
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,721
It's a historical fact, bro.

503
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:28,755
Is it?

504
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,189
Is it a historical fact.

505
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:32,592
Yeah. He predicted all sorts
of things that came to pass,

506
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:37,097
like World War II, the rise
and fall of the Roman Empire,

507
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:39,066
the Kennedy assassination.

508
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,601
And he was the
one who figured out

509
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,803
that Count Dracula
was into dudes.

510
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:46,907
[soft rock music]

511
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:47,874
Dudes.

512
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:50,644
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

513
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,846
"I vant to suck your cock."

514
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:55,316
[laughing]

515
00:33:56,682 --> 00:34:00,787
Wasn't Nostradamus
just like some old dude

516
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:03,090
from Shakespeare times?

517
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:04,891
How could he have predicted

518
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,760
an assassination of a president

519
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:10,831
who wasn't a president yet

520
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,501
in a country that
wasn't a country yet.

521
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:18,038
That old dude was
an oracle genius, bro.

522
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:19,072
Look. All right.

523
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,375
This is what he
predicted about 9/11.

524
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:24,911
"Volcanic fire from
the center of the earth

525
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:28,481
will cause trembling
around the new city.

526
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:31,817
Two great rocks will
make war for a long time.

527
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:35,789
In the year 1999 in the
seventh month from the sky

528
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,091
will come the great
king of terror,

529
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:41,161
bringing back to life the
great king of the Mongols

530
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:45,333
before and after it
reigned by good fortune.

531
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:48,635
Okay.

532
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,773
9/11 was in 2001.

533
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:55,076
Oh my God.

534
00:34:58,878 --> 00:34:59,746
September.

535
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:02,416
It's the ninth month.

536
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:07,488
Not the seventh, you know, 9/11.

537
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:09,023
Fuck you, bro.

538
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,060
Bush wasn't a King.

539
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,563
You don't know.

540
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,465
And he damn sure
wasn't mongolian.

541
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,298
[Collin] Well, you know what?

542
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:21,134
I'm gonna tell you something.

543
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:25,771
Can you get me out of here
[indistinct mumbling].

544
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,844
[sighs] Why do you
gotta ruin everything?

545
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:36,182
People just, they get on
my nerves with this whole

546
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,985
- ignorant thing.
- Okay, damn.

547
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:40,921
What are you like
the no fun police?

548
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:45,458
Where's you sense
of imagination?

549
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:49,797
I don't have a problem
imagining just believing.

550
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,766
Isn't it more fun to believe?

551
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,569
I mean, I guess.

552
00:35:56,637 --> 00:36:00,539
But in my experience,

553
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:02,809
the logical answer's
usually correct

554
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:07,547
You wanna go outside
and smoke a joint?

555
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:09,416
Yeah.

556
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,953
Wait, I need another beer.

557
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:14,054
Really?

558
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,690
That doesn't drive
me to drink already?

559
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,659
I am an independent
woman, Jim.

560
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,693
I can drive myself.

561
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,894
Okay.

Whoa. That much?

568
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:45,184
Slow down, Cheech
and Chong. [chuckles]

569
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:46,586
What?

570
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:51,257
Roll a mountain bike, no a
road bike, you fucking waste.

571
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:54,159
You know, that mouth of yours

572
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:56,795
could give the wrong impression.

573
00:36:56,862 --> 00:36:59,065
Mama said that might happen.

574
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,534
[chuckles]

575
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:13,146
- You ever shotgun?
- No.

576
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,949
Do you know what that is?

577
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:18,684
Yeah, I saw it on
a documentary once

578
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:20,820
on some like Vietnam thing.

579
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,257
[coughs] A documentary?

580
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,827
Yeah, I mean one guy has
a shotgun and he blows smoke

581
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,097
through it to another guy.

582
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:32,566
Is that why they call it that?

583
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,034
- Hmm.
- I mean, I guess.

584
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,636
Well I've never
done that either.

585
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:38,505
Come here.

00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:43,577
[soft music]
[rain pattering]

587
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:55,523
Sorry.

588
00:37:58,992 --> 00:37:59,860
For what?

589
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:05,131
He's right there.

590
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:09,335
[chuckles] What,
guy code telling you

591
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,638
it's not okay to fuck
your friend's girl?

592
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:14,909
He's right there.

593
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:22,316
You're right. Sorry.

594
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,753
- Are you mad?
- No.

595
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,755
I just think it's about
time that I go wake up

596
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:30,390
my drunk-ass boyfriend
so I can take him home

597
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:31,824

Come on.

600
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,682
- Baby, I'm tired.
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:57,083
- Let's go.
- Mm.

602
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,587
Okay.

603
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:02,722
Ready?

604
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:04,523
Okay.

605
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,427
I guess we're heading out.

606
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:09,728
Catch you on the
flippity-flop, Jimbo.

607

But I didn't really sleep.

Jesus Christ, this
is dated from June.

651
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:17,130
Aren't you're supposed to
be taken care of the mail?

652
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:18,297
I bring in.

653
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:20,166
I don't go through it.

654
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:21,468
What do you care anyways?

655
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:23,369
Okay. God.

656
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:25,038
Sorry for trying to help.

657
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:27,374
Oh, is that what you're doing?

658
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,043
It really just seems like
you're busting my balls.

659
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,577
I'm just saying, Don.

660
00:45:31,643 --> 00:45:34,479
She needs a little
more help these days.

661
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:35,481
Oh really?

662
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:36,581
Last time I checked,

663
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,583
I'm the only one
that's here every day.

664
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,318
That is bullshit, Donna.

665
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:42,688
I work damn near 50 hours
a week and you know it.

666
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:45,490
Ma and I are doing just fine.

667
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:46,391
Aren't we, Ma?

[birds chirping]

669
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,199
She hasn't eaten a thing.

670
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:56,202
[sighs] I know.

671
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,806
I don't know if she
had another nightmare.

672
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:01,608
She just seems exhausted.

673
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:05,610
- Nightmare?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:06,746
Hmm.

[ominous music]

676
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:14,221
What's wrong, Ma?

677
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:17,190
You haven't touched your food.

678
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,659
I'm afraid I'm
just not very hungry.

679
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:24,129
You need to try and
eat a little something.

680
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:26,298
What's the matter?
Didn't you sleep good?

681
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:31,438
I had a nightmare, I think.

682
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:36,576
It was like there was
someone in the house.

683
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:38,711
In your dream?

684
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:41,048
I think so.

685
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:44,550
I don't know.

686
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,889
Is it the one that
you told me about?

687
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,824
The one that shakes the walls?

688
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:52,892
Yeah.

689
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,694
It's like there's
someone in the house

690
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:58,131
and they're coming
up the stairs.

691
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:02,601
I went to bed at 10:30,

692
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:05,806
but I didn't really sleep.

693
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,477
Better call Dr. Yang.

694
00:47:11,643 --> 00:47:13,445
Could be a side effect
to your medication.

695
00:47:13,512 --> 00:47:15,547
Tony, it's not the meds.

696
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:17,349
I'm not crazy.

697
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,818
Hey, hey, hey, no one
says you were crazy.

698
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:20,920
We're just trying to help.

699
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:21,788
Well, if you wanna help me,

700
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,657
get me a big guard dog or a gun.

701
00:47:25,724 --> 00:47:27,460
What, so you can take
pot shots through the walls

702
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:29,228
every time you hear a noise?

703
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:32,498
Ma, there's gotta be
something going on here.

704
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:34,567
It could be something
with your meds,

705
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:36,469
maybe something else.

706
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:37,737
Oh, for God sake, Tony.

707
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,405
I'm not fruit loops.

708
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,475
I know you're not, Ma.

709
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:46,312
That's why I wanna check
in with your doctor.

710
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:55,453
We'll talk it out
later, all right?

711
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:57,657
All right, bye.

712
00:47:58,824 --> 00:47:59,692
Hey, Tony.

713
00:48:03,396 --> 00:48:04,264
Hey, Tony.

714
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:07,699
I'm really sorry I
snapped at you earlier.

715
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:08,800
Don't sweat it.

[ominous music]

717
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:13,672
I'm really stressed out
about this whole thing.

718
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:15,740
I mean, she was fine one moment

719
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:17,443
and then it just
seems like she's not,

720
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,746
and I don't know if
it's depression or-

721
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:23,583
- Look, you're trying hard.

722
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,483
We all see it.

723
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,253
I'm sorry I gave you shit
about the mail, all right?

724
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,755
Tony, I don't give
a fuck about the mail.

725
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:30,690
I just...

726
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,695
Do you think she's
gonna be okay?

727
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:43,469
I wish I could say.

728
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:47,439
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

729
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,375
Yeah.

730
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:53,813
It may be time she
saw that specialist.

[door closes]

732
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:07,660
Fuck.

[ominous music]

734
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:18,871
I need protection.

735
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:21,873
What?

736
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,509
I said, I need protection.

737
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:24,878
I don't feel safe.

738
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:27,613
Mom, we'll do
whatever it takes.

739
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:29,882
Don't worry. We'll
get an alarm system.

740
00:49:29,949 --> 00:49:31,884
We'll bar up the windows.

741
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:33,686
- I've got you.
- I need to be able

742
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,621
to do something.

743
00:49:35,688 --> 00:49:36,956
You can do something.

744
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,824
You can call me at any time

745
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:39,724
and I'll be right over.

746
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,360
- You know that.
- I'm scared.

747
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:45,431
Oh, Mom, you don't have to be.

748
00:49:45,498 --> 00:49:47,300
I've got you.

749
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,668
Do you?

750
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,403
Yes, of course.

751
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,672
How about this?

752
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,608
I'll come over right before
bed and just you and I

753
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:57,376
can go through the
house and make sure

754
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:59,979
it's all nice and
tight, locked up.

755
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:02,982
No offense, Donna, but
I'd rather have a gun.

Can we meet?

Jim.

Jim!

778
00:53:48,873 --> 00:53:49,741
Hey.

Donna?

783
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,585
Is that the daughter
that took off?

784
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:34,919
Yep.

785
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:35,855
Hmm.

786
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:39,724
I guess she just got
sick of the crazy old broad

787
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,759
and just left.

788
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:44,229
Mm, God. Talk about loyalty.

789
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:45,297
Who does something like that?

790
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:48,934
I don't think it's
an easy decision.

791
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:50,869
I mean, I hope not.

792
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:53,038
I mean, she had people
depending on her.

793
00:54:53,105 --> 00:54:54,039
She had to know the anguish

794
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:55,942
she put her mom
through by leaving.

795
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,744
You'd think that'd be enough
to make some people stay.

796
00:54:59,811 --> 00:55:00,679
Yeah well,

797
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:06,985
trying to hold a family
together is not easy.

798
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:07,987
What do you mean?

799
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:13,659
My mom died two years ago.

800
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,895
Oh my God.

801
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:19,764
I'm so sorry.

802
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:24,268
It's okay. It
was angiosarcoma.

803
00:55:24,335 --> 00:55:28,340
Which is this like really
rare type of breast cancer.

804
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:31,110
She went to the dermatologist

805
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:33,713
because she had this
rash that popped up.

806
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,748
And then by the end of the day,

807
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:39,718
she was in the emergency
room getting tests done.

808
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:42,621
Jesus.

809
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:47,726
And I remember I was at
some frat party on campus

810
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:51,030
when my sister texts
me and she's like,

811
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:54,032
"Mom is in the emergency room

812
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:56,235
and she's getting all
these tests done."

813
00:55:57,335 --> 00:55:59,738
[sighs] And we both just knew

814
00:56:00,972 --> 00:56:03,442
they weren't gonna
come back negative.

815
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:06,077
[somber music]

816
00:56:06,144 --> 00:56:07,413
Jim.

817
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,083
It's sad, you know, because

818
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:17,422
she was always so
positive about everything.

819
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:19,157
She was like, "I'm
gonna beat it.

820
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:21,226
I'm going to beat it."

821
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:26,030
We knew she wasn't gonna beat it

822
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:28,634
but it's not like you
can tell her that.

823
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:36,074
Look Jim, I didn't
mean to pry, you know, I-

824
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:38,143
- No, it's okay.

825
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:40,913
I'm actually kind
of surprised Collin

826
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,148
hasn't told you already.

827
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,318
He's the only person I
told when I came here.

828
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,121
He kind of met me
at a rough time.

829
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:51,256
Yeah, you mentioned that part.

830
00:56:51,322 --> 00:56:53,192
[chuckles]

831
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:58,264
So yeah, Mom died
and Dad asked me

832
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:04,001
to take a year off of school
because he couldn't handle

833
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:05,337
taking care of my sister.

834
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:08,340
He was a mess.

835
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:13,512
All of us, the
entire family unit

836
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:18,217
just completely
emotionally fucked.

837
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:24,424
And they needed me.

838
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,259
They needed me to be there
to take care of them.

839
00:57:27,326 --> 00:57:29,461
But I just couldn't do it.

840
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,230
I didn't have the
stomach for it.

841
00:57:34,132 --> 00:57:37,069
So here I am,

842
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,106
house sitting.

843
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:42,107
It's okay.

844
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:46,878
Look, Jim, what I
said about Donna,

845
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:48,280
- you know, I didn't mean that-
- No, it's,

846
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,082
it's okay.

847
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:56,054
I just, I get the need to

848
00:57:56,121 --> 00:58:00,358
get out so you can just breathe.

849
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:06,631
You know what?

850
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,066
We could use some more wine.

851
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:09,868
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

852
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:20,212
[wine trickling]

853
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,016
We made short use of that.

854
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,884
[both chuckle]

855
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:26,985
Hey, can I ask you something?

856
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:30,289
And just like promise
you won't get mad.

857
00:58:31,556 --> 00:58:33,091
Well I guess that depends.

858
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:35,094
On what?

859
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:38,996
[chuckles]

860
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:42,335
Depending on what
you ask me, I guess.

861
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:47,306
Do you love him?

862
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,509
- [Alyson chuckles]
- I'm sorry.

863
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:54,313
I just, I need to know how bad

864
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,847
I'm fucking things up here.

865
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:59,517
You are very conceited.

866
00:58:59,585 --> 00:59:00,853
You know that?

867
00:59:01,954 --> 00:59:04,056
I like Collin, okay?

868
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,389
He's sweet.

869
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:07,058
[chuckles] And he's funny.

870
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:11,531
Yeah, I guess I love him.

871
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:14,532
- Then why-
- Why

872
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:15,933
am I sleeping with you?

873
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:16,668
Yeah.

874
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:19,438
'Cause I'm fucked up too.

875
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:22,540
Just like you're fucked up.

876
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:25,010
And Donna, apparently,
where ever she is,

877
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:27,246
she's probably doing
something fucked up.

878
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:31,884
I mean, I don't know, you
just don't have sole ownership

879
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:33,150
of drama, I guess.

880
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:34,485
[both chuckle]

881
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:35,520
Yeah, no shit.

882
00:59:37,722 --> 00:59:38,923
I don't know.

883
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:43,429
Maybe I just don't equate
sex with love anymore.

884
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:48,032
Maybe I like to engage
in self-sabotage.

885
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:50,534
You know like, I won't
let myself be happy

886
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:55,607
because I have no
idea how to be.

887
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:02,580
In any case, I guess
I sleep with you

888
01:00:02,648 --> 01:00:05,017
because you make me feel safe.

889
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,254
I know that you
won't fall for me

890
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,989
because Collin is your friend.

891
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,862
And I know you won't tell on me

892
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:18,431
because Collin is your friend.

893
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,204
Or maybe I can sense
a tragedy in you

894
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:29,607
just like me.

897
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,621
You really are fucked
up, you know that?

898
01:00:42,688 --> 01:00:43,890
Absolutely.

899
01:00:50,795 --> 01:00:53,364
Thank you for staying here.

900
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:57,268
I don't, I don't, I don't
like staying here alone.

901
01:00:57,335 --> 01:00:59,337
I don't like leaving
you here alone.

- How you doing, baby?
- Hey.

914
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:18,043
Good, how are
you, Auntie Euni?

915
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,678
Well, come on in.

916
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:27,552
So can I get you a
soda or something?

917
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:28,687
Oh, no. I'm all good.

918
01:03:28,753 --> 01:03:29,621
Thanks, though.

919
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:34,559
So how's your mother?

920
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:37,562
You know, she's
done pretty good.

921
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:40,632
She's seeing some
new guy, so I mean,

922
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:41,733
seems to like him.

923
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,301
I think he's gonna
stick around this time.

924
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,335
So that's a good thing.

925
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:47,139
And you know, she
was actually asking

926
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:48,507
about you the other day.

927
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,907
Oh, well, yeah.

928
01:03:49,974 --> 01:03:51,643
I've been meaning
to keep in touch

929
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,081
but things have been
kind of hard lately.

930
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,148
Yeah, that.

931
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,485
I gotta ask, if you don't mind.

932
01:04:00,552 --> 01:04:04,389
Are you okay? Like, why
do you need a piece?

933
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,291
Alex, I'm a 70 year old woman.

934
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:09,561
I live alone in a big
house on a dead end street.

935
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:13,331
I believe that I should
feel safe in my own home.

936
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:16,268
Absolutely, Auntie Euni. I
completely understand that.

937
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,369
- It's just-
- Well "it's just" that what?

938
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:22,173
It's just if something
were to happen to you

939
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,574
or God forbid to somebody else,

940
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:25,309
it kind of be my fault.

941
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:27,311
Nothing's gonna happen.

942
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:28,780
Auntie Euni, come on, look.

943
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:33,851
If Tony or Donna or my
mom were to find out.

944
01:04:33,918 --> 01:04:35,653
They won't.

945
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,222
Yeah, but if they did,
they'd fucking barbecue my ass.

946
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:40,558
- Language.
- Right, sorry.

947
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,360
Look, nothing's
going to happen.

948
01:04:42,427 --> 01:04:44,596
Listen, Alex, I'm desperate.

949
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,697
I haven't slept in nights.

950
01:04:46,764 --> 01:04:48,634
I hear things in the house.

951
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:50,402
Like what?

952
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:54,472
I just, I just think

953
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,608
that I should feel
safe in my own house.

954
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:59,778
I think that I
should be prepared

955
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:01,879
in case something should happen.

956
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:03,715

you can always

call me if you need anything.

959
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:09,587
Me, Donna, any of
us, you can call.

960
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,690
I know. Thank you.

961
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:15,527

Here.

963
01:05:19,463 --> 01:05:20,699
So here's the thing, okay?

964
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:22,534
The most important
thing is gonna be

965
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:23,936
that safety right there.

966
01:05:25,036 --> 01:05:26,971

Whatever made you call
me at this late hour?

982
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:34,940
What, I can't just call my mom

983
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:37,442
to check and see
how you're doing?

984
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:39,644
I just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

985
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:42,813
I'm fine. I'm doing much
better than last night.

986
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,648
Good, see, I knew that
you would feel better

987
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,984
once you had a little
time under your belt.

I are here for you.

Well that's good.
Well, fingers crossed.

that will be a problem.

in the morning then?
