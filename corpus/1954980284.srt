1
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,249
Being from California,

2
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,587
I'm well aware
of the skin cancer threat.

3
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,355
Librarians are not known
for their tans.

4
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,364
We're usually pasty white.

5
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,801
Besides, you wouldn't
catch me dead at the beach.

6
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,781
# What am I gonna do
about the sunshine #

7
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:26,513
# That warms my skin
whenever you're in the room #

8
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,782
# 'Cause my umbrella's
been up forever #

9
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,222
# My winter sweater
fits just fine #

10
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,056
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

11
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:49,070
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

12
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,601
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

13
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,751
# What am I gonna do
about the music #

14
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,120
# That flows in me when I know
I'm seein' you soon #

15
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,557
# Well, there was a time
my heart was quiet #

16
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,822
# Now I can't stop
listening to it #

17
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,162
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

18
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,069
# Tell me what, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

19
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:26,774
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

20
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,873
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,785
# What am I gonna do
about the fresh air #

22
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:42,090
# That I might feel when you
break my shield in two #

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,154
# Well, I once was proud
Look at me now #

24
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,756
# I'm just hanging out
on a limb, yeah #

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,793
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

26
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,865
# Tell me what, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

27
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:04,475
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

28
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,487
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

29
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,847
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,860
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

31
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,907
You worried about
the meeting tomorrow?

32
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,916
I guess that won't help.

33
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,147
No.

34
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,314
Well...

35
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,857
maybe we'll be surprised.

36
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,901
Writer Jorge Luis Borges
likens libraries to paradise.

37
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:03,436
For me, public libraries
would be a perfect place,

38
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,876
except for one thing.

39
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,449
The public.

40
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,953
Of all the questions
about all the books

41
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,683
on every shelf
in this library,

42
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,521
what do these people ask?

43
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,220
Excuse me.
- Yes?

44
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,728
Where is your bathroom?

45
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,228
Right over there,
behind the stacks.

46
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,806
John Milton wrote
that a good book

47
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,605
is the precious lifeblood
of a master spirit.

48
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:42,479
And Paul Auster
called reading his comfort...

49
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,779
and his escape.

50
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,757
It's as we feared.
With the budget cuts,

51
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,420
they just can't justify
the satellites.

52
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,691
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,265
The economy and the internet.

54
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,828
Kind of a double whammy
for librarians.

55
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,933
Jane, are you okay?

56
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,035
Yes, thank you.

57
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,620
Remind me to have you around
the next time I'm fired.

58
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,458
Cool-hand Jane.

59
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,328
You really that okay?

60
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,460
Sorry. I guess I was
just prepared.

61
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,740
You have any plans?

62
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,510
Oh, now, come on, Ms. Taylor.

63
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,343
You can finally reveal to me

64
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:53,546
one detail
of your private life.

65
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,053
Take a gamble.

66
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,920
I probably won't post it
on the internet.

67
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,355
I'm... I'm leaving
for Costa Rica on Monday.

68
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,990
Costa Rica?

69
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,058
You're serious?

70
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,104
Yeah.

71
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,835
Alone?

72
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,341
Yeah.

73
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,345
Jane the adventurer!

74
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,713
Turns desperation
into a tropical vacation.

75
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,719
Now that's the way
to live, girl!

76
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,983
If a person at death's door

77
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,084
does see her life
flashing before her...

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,655
meaningful images,
moments of great beauty...

79
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,098
what could possibly
fly before my eyes

80
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,136
in those final moments?

81
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,400
Where's the beauty
in a wasted life?

82
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,941
And so the point of this trip?

83
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,107
To create some beauty
to play at the end.

84
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,346
To make some pretty memories,

85
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,481
even if it's in a hopeless
11th hour of a pathetic life.

86
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,038
If it seems
a foolish final wish,

87
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,084
well, I haven't done
anything foolish in a while.

88
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,500
The white zone
is for immediate loading

89
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,696
and unloading
of passengers only.

90
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:17,191
Indeed, dying in beautiful
Costa Rica

91
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:22,065
may be the most wonderful thing
I've ever done.

92
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,582
Ooh hoo hoo!

93
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,260
That was so beautiful.
- You...

94
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,855
You are so beautiful.

95
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,865
You can stay.

96
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,697
No, no, no, no.

97
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,999
You should go home
to your life.

98
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,904
We will always have this.
Always.

99
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,708
Oops. I must go home.

100
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,962
Okay, that's it. You can see
the ocean from the balcony.

101
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,932
If you need anything,
just ask, okay?

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,263
Okay.

103
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,930
Pura vida.

104
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,965
Oh, "pura vida" is what we say
instead of "hello" or "goodbye."

105
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,136
It means "pure living,
pure life."

106
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,341
Oh, that way, please.

107
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,815
Pura vida.

108
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,272
Time for English, Papi.

109
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,834
Yes, please.

110
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,681
So what's your word for today?

111
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,313
Today is...

112
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,086
Uh, "capricious."

113
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,356
"Given to sudden changes
of mood or behavior."

114
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,623
Ca-prish-es.

115
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,130
Cap-ree-cious.

116
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,358
Ah. Cap-ree-cious.

117
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,661
Capricious.

118
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,827
Cap-ree-cious.

119
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,257
Morning.

120
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,494
Good morning.

121
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,164
Are you going
to the park today?

122
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,729
Yes.

123
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,504
It's best if you hire a guide.

124
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,437
Oh. Okay.

125
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:37,745
They should charge you
no more than $40 for the tour.

126
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,786
- $40?
- Yes.

127
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,877
Okay.

128
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,976
Okay.

129
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,377
I have accessed the creature.

130
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,539
Please.

131
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,313
Mmm.

132
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,613
Excuse me, ma'am,
do you need a guide?

133
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,175
I think so.
How long does it take?

134
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,051
Well, unlike the others
over there,

135
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,920
I like to be very detailed

136
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,583
and show you
every amazing thing.

137
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,357
I try not to be, uh,
cap-rish-us or capricious.

138
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,125
Okay, that's good.
- Okay.

139
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,393
I also feature
the Fujinon 80 telescope,

140
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,128
the very, very, very best.

141
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,636
I can get you a close-up of
a sloth 200 feet up in the tree.

142
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,969
You can see his nose hairs.
- Good.

143
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,908
Yeah, and you get this
and all my acute knowledge,

144
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,276
beneficial for you,
for only $75,

145
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,906
for more than three hours
of benevolent work.

146
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,644
75?

147
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,652
Yes. The others
only go two hours.

148
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,382
And it's for
my acute knowledge.

149
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,653
It's not, uh, capricious or...
- Okay, good.

150
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,216
Good.
- I'm hired?

151
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,161
Yes.
- Oh, thank you! I'm Juan.

152
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,663
Uh, Jane.

153
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:10,465
Oh, Jane, what a beautiful name.
It's very accessible.

154
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,663
Where are you from, Jane?

155
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,330
Uh, Los Angeles.

156
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,965
Los Angeles City.
When you're here,

157
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,409
there is one less angel
in the City of Angels.

158
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,174
Yes, yes, yes.

159
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,477
Okay, we will begin.

160
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,618
You're gonna get
inside the jungle,

161
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,093
and you're gonna see
monkeys, birds,

162
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,687
uh, a lot of kinds of animals.

163
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,700
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna love it.

164
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,049
So what kind of work do you do
in Los Angeles, Jane?

165
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,679
I'm a librarian.

166
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,725
You work in a library?

167
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,555
Uh, not anymore.

168
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,026
Oh, you quit.

169
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,029
It closed.

170
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,725
They closed a library
in America?

171
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,132
I can't believe it.
- The economy.

172
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,501
That's terrible. I love books.

173
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,733
I should read
more of them anyway.

174
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,571
But I love them.

175
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,578
This park is only
six kilometers, three miles,

176
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,046
one of the smallest
natural parks in the world.

177
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:33,575
But for our size, we have more
species of mammals here, 109,

178
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,019
and more kinds of birds, 184,

179
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,422
than any other park
in the world.

180
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,584
Look.

181
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,458
These are my favorite.
Good.

182
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,597
Okay.

183
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,160
I have accessed the creature.

184
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,603
Please.

185
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,776
See?
- Oh. Ohh!

186
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,336
We affectionately call them
"osos perezosos."

187
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,779
It means "lazy bears."

188
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,613
The sloths can sleep
for up to 18 hours a day.

189
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,778
They are the slowest mammals
on earth,

190
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,788
moving about
six feet per minute.

191
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,758
It would take him almost a month
to walk just one mile.

192
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,728
They are a true aberration
of nature.

193
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,629
They're so beautiful.

194
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,793
How often do they come down?

195
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,428
About once a week
to go to the bathroom.

196
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,439
The only explanation
is that they fear

197
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,634
that if they go to the bathroom
in the trees,

198
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,199
their predators
may hear them,

199
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,304
so they hold it in
and go on the ground,

200
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,246
bury it and cover it
with leaves.

201
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,753
It is interesting.
During the mating season,

202
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,811
the female will scream
to attract the male,

203
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,792
and it sounds just like
a woman screaming when...

204
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,625
when, you know,
when she's...

205
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,631
when she is loved, eh?

206
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,826
Oh, yes.

207
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,165
Uh, okay.

208
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,203
Bueno.

209
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,445
This is a special treat.
These are rare.

210
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,183
For their size,

211
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,420
they are considered the most
intelligent of all primates.

212
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,621
That's one of the reasons
of their small number.

213
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,459
Many people take them as pets

214
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,195
because they are so smart and
get along with people so well.

215
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,100
What a pity.

216
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,866
Let's go.

217
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,880
Are you enjoying the tour?
I try to make it actualizing.

218
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,425
Yes, it's very good.
Thank you.

219
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,498
I guess you become very quiet
working in a library.

220
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,301
Do you have any family?

221
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,465
No.

222
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,667
No kids?

223
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,902
No.

224
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,535
I guess no husband.

225
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,909
Ever been married?

226
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,413
No.

227
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,312
Hmm.

228
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,941
Should we, um...

229
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,382
Should we continue the tour?

230
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:28,519
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm almost finished.

231
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,564
More animals come out
as it gets later, you know?

232
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,934
Well...

233
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,197
I have a daughter, Anna.

234
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,707
Oh, she's very smart.
Very smart.

235
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,435
Her English is perfect.
She reads a lot.

236
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,737
That's good.

237
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,405
Yeah. I send her
to the American school.

238
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,778
Very expensive. Wow!

239
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,249
But she can become
something special.

240
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,842
Maybe a lawyer.

241
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,548
She wants to be a doctor.

242
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,988
Yes.

243
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,460
She's a lot smarter than I am,

244
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,462
but she doesn't rub it in
too much.

245
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,498
Just a little.

246
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,731
I guess Los Angeles
is a fun city, yes?

247
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,204
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

248
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,299
Did you ever meet
any of the Kardashians?

249
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,968
Who?

250
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,911
You know, Kim Karadashian
and her sisters,

251
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,743
mother, Bruce Jenner.

252
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,544
No. I don't know them.

253
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,312
Kim was the one
married for 72 days.

254
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,785
No.
- You didn't hear that?

255
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,980
No.

256
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,717
Oh. That's weird.

257
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,455
I think you're too smart
to know them, you know?

258
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,996
What do you like
to do for fun?

259
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,795
Uh, well, um...
- Yeah?

260
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,802
I read and I walk.

261
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,600
Oh, that's...

262
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,265
smart.

263
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,740
Yes.

264
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,776
Can I do anything different
in this last part?

265
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,015
Uh, no, okay, never mind,
it's fine.

266
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,642
It's fine.
- Come on, Jane, say it.

267
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,277
I can see in your eyes
you want to say something.

268
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,912
I always want to be better.

269
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,786
Well, it's just, I...

270
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm used to more space.
More...

271
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,028
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

272
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:14,032
I'll make sure we stay away
from others, hmm? Okay?

273
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,637
Oh. That's not what you meant.

274
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,832
What did you mean, Jane?
Please say.

275
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,343
Say it to me. Come on.

276
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,870
Well, it's just sometimes you
just get a little bit too close.

277
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,849
Oh, ah, I see.
- Okay?

278
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,285
Oh. I'm sorry.
You know...

279
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,289
It's just my love
for what I do.

280
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,052
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry.

281
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,526
And down here, you know,
we are used to getting close.

282
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,460
Yeah, okay.
- Being touchy.

283
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,622
Yes.
- You know?

284
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,892
Lovely.
- We're Latinos.

285
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,627
Okay. That's great.

286
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,362
Yes.

287
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,064
Okay, but I'm sorry.
I won't get so close, okay?

288
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,334
Okay.
- Look! Here!

289
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,466
Okay?
- Okay.

290
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,066
We can talk from here, okay?

291
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,079
Sure.
- And I can see you here.

292
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,382
No problem.
Come on, Jane.

293
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,712
See? That was easy.
- Okay.

294
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,083
No problem. Okay.
- I'm fulfilled.

295
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,122
Let's see some beauty!

296
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,729
His colors are amazing, yes?

297
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,107
Yes.

298
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,144
Okay? Okay.

299
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,576
Let's go. Thank you.

300
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,448
Be careful here, Jane.

301
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,114
Can I help you? Uh...

302
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,350
Grab it, grab it here.
Grab it.

303
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,588
Okay, okay, okay.
Perfect.

304
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,599
Oh.

305
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,636
Look.

306
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,406
This is the Guaria Morada,
the flower of Costa Rica.

307
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,141
Beautiful.

308
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:13,117
Its beauty represents
the beauty of Costa Rican women.

309
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,483
Smell it.

310
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,079
Do you notice that?

311
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,647
No perfume could
match that, huh?

312
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,923
We believe that
when you breathe it in,

313
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,590
it brings you
peace and good luck.

314
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,067
Yeah. Now I know
you will have it.

315
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,664
Did I do pretty good?
- Yeah, you did great.

316
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,468
No, when I wasn't too touchy.
- Yeah.

317
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,473
Yes?
- Great.

318
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,976
Okay, okay.

319
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,842
Let's go.

320
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,188
Oh. Yes.

321
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,123
Uh, yes.

322
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,129
70, 75.

323
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,464
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

324
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,200
Did you enjoy the tour?
It was... beneficial?

325
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,142
Yes, it was very nice.
You're a very good guide.

326
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,701
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.

327
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,872
I was thinking
you didn't bring a camera.

328
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,212
I could have gotten some nice
pictures of you to remember,

329
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,218
like you smelling
the Guaria Morada.

330
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,878
Ah, what a pity.

331
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,048
It's all up here.
- Yes.

332
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,854
I can drive you to your hotel.
Where are you staying?

333
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,828
Oh, no, really,
it's just down the beach.

334
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,831
It's the first hotel
on the beach.

335
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,560
It's a nice walk.
- I have a van.

336
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,159
Plenty of space for yourself.

337
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,828
No, no, really,
thank you.

338
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,703
Okay, okay, I'll let you go.
Let's go.

339
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,969
Start raining.come on.
- Okay.

340
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,511
Gracias. Pura vida.

341
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,069
I'm just wondering,
you're planning to see

342
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,741
other beautiful things
in Costa Rica,

343
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,875
maybe the whole eco tour, yes?

344
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,250
Yeah, I guess so.

345
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,846
I have a van,
and I do all places:

346
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,518
Arenal, volcano, waterfall,
the orchids.

347
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,493
I could make you good deal.

348
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,826
I'm not really sure
of my schedule right now.

349
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,694
Okay, okay, I understand.

350
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,860
Can I give you my number
just in case if you decide?

351
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:10,994
Okay, thank you.

352
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,162
Okay.

353
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,603
Pura vida.

354
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,315
What's the point?

355
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,149
The good moments never last.

356
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,125
I have no one to blame
for this separation but myself.

357
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,599
It's as if I received a shot
that forever numbed me.

358
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,667
Only I gave myself that shot.

359
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,341
Jane?

360
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,287
Jane, it's Juan,
the tour guide.

361
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,257
Please go away.

362
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,356
I'm very busy.

363
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,867
Uh, please,
I don't want to bother,

364
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,403
but I needed
to talk with you.

365
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:59,142
I... told you...

366
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,875
if I needed a guide,
I would call you.

367
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:08,409
Please, Jane, please.
It's gonna be just a minute.

368
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,433
Oh...

369
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:44,047
Jane, please.
We could sit just out here.

370
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,017
Yes?

371
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:58,464
I want to apologize
for being churlish on your tour.

372
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,107
You weren't churlish.

373
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,143
No, I think I was.

374
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,451
Churlish would mean
you were vulgar.

375
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,180
You weren't vulgar.

376
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:20,453
Well, but I was difficult
to work or deal with

377
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,460
in the moments when
I did not give you space,

378
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,259
so I was a little churlish.

379
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,301
Well, I didn't think so.

380
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,859
That's not why you're here.

381
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,768
Uh, no, no, no.

382
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,466
Ohh...

383
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,772
I didn't want to bother you,
but you do need a guide,

384
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,278
and my situation
is not too good.

385
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,781
I told you about my daughter
in the American school.

386
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,476
She's doing so great,
really great,

387
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,487
but the tourists have slowed
down here with your economy.

388
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,286
You know this problem?
- Yes.

389
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:57,454
I know money may not
be easy for you, but...

390
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,397
you came to see Costa Rica
planning to hire a guide,

391
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,263
am I right?

392
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,063
Yeah, I guess so.

393
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,299
And it would just help me a lot
with my daughter's school

394
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,467
if I could be
your personal guide.

395
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,909
Do you understand me?

396
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:18,746
Yes, but I've changed my mind.

397
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,754
I just... I wanna stay here
at the hotel and rest.

398
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,518
Oh, but...

399
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,320
But you can't do that here.

400
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,520
I saw how your face lights up

401
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,257
when you see
all the amazing things.

402
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,492
You just can't come
to Costa Rica and rest.

403
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,526
How much money do you need
for the school?

404
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,267
I'm sorry,
but it's not your worry.

405
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,868
Please, it's okay.

406
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,539
Just tell me how much.

407
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,844
About $500.

408
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,248
Okay, I'll give you the money.

409
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,489
You would just give me $500
for nothing?

410
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,924
It's for your daughter's school.

411
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,035
No, no, I can't take it.

412
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,407
Please.
I want you to have it.

413
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,207
No, please, Jane.
- It's okay.

414
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,148
No, no, no, I didn't come
for a charity gift.

415
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,412
No. Ehh...

416
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,081
Only if I give you
another tour.

417
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,420
That's the only way
that it's right.

418
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,424
Ehh?

419
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,825
Come on, Jane.

420
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:41,424
You came to Costa Rica
to see the beauty, yes?

421
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,469
Yeah, I guess so.

422
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,872
Are you okay?

423
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,940
Yeah.

424
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,606
What are the things
you wish to see?

425
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,240
Come on, tell me.
- Well...

426
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:02,617
I've heard the crocodiles...

427
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:08,354
in Rio Tarc... Tarcoles,
something,

428
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,361
are really worthwhile.

429
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,557
Yes! They are
incredibly worthwhile.

430
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,623
Absolutely. What else?

431
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,638
There's an orchid
that smells like chocolate.

432
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,038
Yes, the Sharri Baby Hybrid.

433
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,633
I know where you can find them.
It's near the crocodiles.

434
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,871
What else?

435
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,313
I've read about Puerto Viejo.

436
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,317
Oh, the Caribbean side.
Beautiful, beautiful.

437
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,616
We will find you your own beach
to get a perfect tan.

438
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,924
Oh, you don't want a tan?
- No.

439
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,451
Okay, no tan, eh?

440
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,962
You should say okay.

441
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,502
Please, Jane.

442
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,969
Please.

443
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,665
Okay.

444
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,608
Thank you, Jane.

445
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,440
Pura vida.

446
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,483
Are you okay? Yes?

447
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,019
See you tomorrow.

448
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,645
Bye. Bye.

449
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,715
I guess he's right.

450
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,048
I did come here to see more.

451
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,712
Doesn't exactly
make much sense

452
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,656
to take a shortcut
on a final shortcut.

453
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,439
Choos-pah?

454
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,037
Choos-pah.

455
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,548
Choos-pah?

456
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,686
Choos-pah.

457
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,823
Hey.

458
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,170
Please.

459
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,024
Puta carro.

460
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,395
I fix it in a minute, Jane.

461
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,457
Just gonna be a minute.

462
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,168
Okay. Let's see
what happened here.

463
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,403
Oh, we're gonna see now
some crocodiles at Rio Tarcoles.

464
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,467
And we'll get
so close to them, so...

465
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,843
we will show
lots of choos-pah.

466
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,848
I'm sorry, what?

467
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,144
What?

468
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,343
What did you say?

469
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,147
Uh, choos-pah.

470
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,687
Is that a Spanish word?

471
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,191
No. I believe it's Hebrew.
Choos-pah.

472
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,592
Chutzpah.
- Chutzpah, yeah, chutzpah.

473
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,789
I guess it sounds different
with my accent.

474
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,695
Oh!

475
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,893
Oh...

476
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,634
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
It's everything okay.

477
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,172
I'm sure you have read
so many books.

478
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,644
Did you count how many?

479
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,307
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

480
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,114
How many do you think?
- I don't know.

481
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,519
Are my questions bothering you?
I like words, you know.

482
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,614
No. They're fine.
- Okay. Okay.

483
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,889
How long does it usually
take you to read a book?

484
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,624
I don't know.
- More or less.

485
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,326
It depends on the book,
you know?

486
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,198
It could be a day,
it could be two days.

487
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,499
If it's a really, really rich...

488
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,666
you know, like a rich novel
with lots of rich language,

489
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,734
it could be, I don't know,
it could be a week.

490
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,508
And for how long
have you been doing that?

491
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,350
Well, I've been reading
at least, uh,

492
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,186
a book a week
for 40 years.

493
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,690
Oh.

494
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,591
40 years.

495
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,926
Even if I give you
two weeks off for vacation,

496
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,525
and you read 50 books a year,

497
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:20,333
that would be...
2.000 books in 40 years.

498
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,838
Eee-my!

499
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,898
That could be a record.

500
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,705
I guess it does add up.

501
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,870
Well, I told you.
I like words.

502
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,709
I'm not too big
on the books.

503
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,772
You could just
pick up one and start.

504
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,215
Yeah, I will, I will.

505
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,253
I want to start
with the best book ever.

506
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,345
Since you have read them all,
which is the best one?

507
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,689
Why is that funny?

508
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,217
No, it's just...
That's...

509
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,958
an impossible question.
- Why?

510
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,795
'Cause there's so many
different kinds.

511
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,426
There's fantasy, there's action,
there's mystery.

512
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,970
Oh, I see.
- There's romance.

513
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,269
What's the best love story
you read?

514
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,936
Okay, the best love story
I ever read...

515
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,606
probably was
Tale of Two Cities.

516
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,649
Tale of Two Cities.
Tale of Two Cities.

517
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,707
Who wrote that?

518
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,980
Charles Dickens.
- Charles Dickens.

519
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,579
Tale of Two Cities.
Charles... Charles Dickens.

520
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,988
Tale of Two Cities.
Charles Dickens.

521
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,652
I'll make sure
that I read it one day.

522
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,592
Good.
- You know...

523
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,222
I'm Latin. I ask you
all these questions about this.

524
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,733
You know why?
- Why?

525
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,598
It made you laugh.

526
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,265
You should laugh on vacation,
even if it's at stupid me.

527
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,001
Okay.

528
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,511
Now I'll shut up, fix it,

529
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,978
and we'll go see
some crocodiles.

530
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,515
Okay.

531
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,398
Come on, Jane,
come on, come on.

532
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,073
Ah!

533
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,095
I wonder if I can feed myself
to the wildlife

534
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,131
from here up on the bridge.

535
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,434
Would I wind up
as a pair of boots?

536
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,135
Or a handbag?

537
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,376
Or maybe a belt?

538
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,680
Go on, boys,
make me an accessory.

539
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,344
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

540
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,514
Whoa. Sorry, sorry,

541
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,525
but I don't want to find you
in a crocodile soup.

542
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,154
Come on. I have
a better view for you, yes?

543
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:45,069
Jane, please.
It's not safe.

544
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,111
Okay, come on.

545
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,192
You need to have this one.
Good photo.

546
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,650
I'm enjoying my final tour.

547
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,231
Really, I am.

548
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:47,630
There's comfort in knowing
I'm never going home.

549
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,807
Unlikely as it may have seemed,
I'm going out on a high.

550
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,461
See?

551
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,027
This place is special, eh?

552
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,039
Regular tour guides
won't take you here.

553
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:25,565
It's for ticos, locals.

554
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,908
Tourist places are
restaurantes.

555
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,176
We call this kinda place a soda,
like the soda you drink.

556
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,843
You know?
- Hmm.

557
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,819
Pura vida.
- Uh, no, thank you.

558
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,219
I don't drink.
- Oh, no, you're in Costa Rica.

559
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,224
You should try our Imperial.

560
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,921
Come on, show some of that
North American chutzpah.

561
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,021
Okay, maybe just one sip.

562
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,622
Pura vida.

563
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,498
Hmm? You like it?

564
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,540
Yeah.

565
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,767
You're right.

566
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,809
It's nice. It's light.

567
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,709
You do a lot of writing.
It is your diary?

568
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,249
Mm. Mm-mm.

569
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,182
It's my journal.

570
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,277
I guess I'm in there now.

571
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,686
I hope I'm not a clown.

572
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,281
I'd be embarrassed if Anna
reads your book one day

573
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:20,195
and her father is the fool
who was too touchy, you know?

574
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,631
You must see
the Caribbean coast.

575
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,761
It's a very different world
with the Rastas.

576
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,897
Do you know Rastas?
- Rastafarians?

577
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,307
Yes. I guess this is
the long name, Rastafarians.

578
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,313
Oh. Gracias.

579
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,939
We call this casados.

580
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,210
Casados means marriage,

581
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,911
and this is
a marriage of our foods.

582
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,954
It's rice, beans,

583
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,615
plantain and local fish,
mahi-mahi.

584
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,748
Very good.

585
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,089
It's casados in the soda.

586
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,561
Yes! Very good, very good!

587
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,928
Come on.

588
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,997
Mix it. Come on.

589
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,164
It's messy.
- Mix it.

590
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,798
Okay, very good, very good.

591
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,365
That's right.

592
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,315
Nice?

593
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,352
Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:22,189
You can put Tabasco
if you want.

595
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:29,189
You could show some real
chutzpah and go for number 4.

596
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,963
I think I showed enough
"hoot-spa"

597
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,301
going for numbers 1, 2 and 3.

598
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,897
That's right, that's right.

599
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,203
Jane?

600
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,551
Jane?

601
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,454
Whew.

602
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,114
Jane!

603
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,028
Jane! Hey!

604
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,156
It was a beautiful day, yes?
Yes!

605
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,168
Okay, tomorrow we go to Arenal,
the volcano.

606
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,999
You should bring
good walking shoes.

607
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,538
Not being touchy.

608
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:25,372
Just want to make sure
the three beers are mostly gone.

609
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,775
Okay.

610
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,541
Tomorrow should be early.

611
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,014
Is 7:00, 8:00 okay?

612
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,380
Okay, yes, thank you.

613
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,578
Okay. Good night, then.

614
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,587
Pura vida.

615
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,357
She told you to read that?

616
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,426
No. I just wanted to read it.
Is that so strange?

617
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:04,464
Yes! This is
your first book... ever.

618
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,942
Is she pretty?
- Who?

619
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,638
The librarian.

620
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,147
I don't know. Maybe.

621
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,911
How don't you know?
You look at her, don't you?

622
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,648
Yeah, but I guess I just see
how smart she is.

623
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:22,489
That's so sweet, but that means
she's not very pretty.

624
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:37,372
Fitting in is a habit you
either develop early or not.

625
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,106
There'd be nothing
more pathetic

626
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,640
than attempting it now.

627
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,687
Sitting amongst them
would make it more obvious

628
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,655
what a complete freak I am.

629
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,265
Did you go out last night?

630
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,702
Well, I went out on the beach
for a while.

631
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,708
Oh, what a beautiful night.
So many stars, yes?

632
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,506
Yes. I'm not used
to seeing so many.

633
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,548
You don't see them
in Los Angeles?

634
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,947
No. The city lights
are too bright.

635
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,714
And... smog.

636
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,950
Oh, that's too bad.

637
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,393
I guess at least you can see
the other stars in Los Angeles.

638
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,985
Who have you seen?

639
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,395
Nobody.

640
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,366
None I know.

641
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,766
It's ridiculous.

642
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,210
Anything wrong?

643
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,340
It's very fun.
- Uh...

644
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,079
Yeah?
- I'm not... I'm...

645
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,644
I'm not really sure
about this.

646
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,020
Come on, Jane.
You will like it.

647
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,652
Uh, no, I'm...

648
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,195
I'm sorry.

649
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,663
I'm sorry.

650
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,599
Jane, you do different things
on vacation.

651
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,227
You are on vacation.
That's why you came, right?

652
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,771
Come on, Jane.
That's why you came.

653
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,774
No! That's not why I came.

654
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,581
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry to push.

655
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:25,775
We can go.

656
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,082
Sure? Are you sure?

657
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,780
No, no. No vamos.

658
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,755
That's fine. We can go.

659
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,416
No, wait. No, wait.

660
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,521
Okay.

661
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,119
You sure, Jane?

662
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,062
Yeah.

663
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,066
Come on.
- It's gonna be wonderful.

664
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,308
Put that foot right here.

665
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,276
Okay.

666
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,644
Okay, your left.

667
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,084
You will like it, Jane.

668
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,146
I'll place this on the back.

669
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,248
He has to touch you
just a little bit

670
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,123
to put, you know,
the belt.

671
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,718
Doesn't matter.
- Okay, okay, okay.

672
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,162
Okay?
- Okay, I'm good, I'm good.

673
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,663
Okay.
- Hold it right here.

674
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,230
It's gonna be fun.

675
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,832
Let's go!

676
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,242
I'm gonna be first, okay?
- Okay.

677
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,246
So you can see me.

678
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,838
Okay.

679
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,214
Oh!

680
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,629
Jane! Jane! Jane!

681
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,927
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

682
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,881
I'm really sorry
to push you before.

683
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,651
Do you forgive me?
- Yes.

684
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,215
You scare me
playing race car driver.

685
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,885
And you're okay?

686
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,226
I'm fine. I'm sorry.
I just got distracted.

687
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,765
But everything is okay now.

688
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:56,959
Yeah.

689
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,609
In Los Angeles,
do you have any animals?

690
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:10,937
I have... a cat...

691
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,505
named Sydney.

692
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,881
Sydney?
Like Sydney Carton?

693
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,182
I've started reading

694
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,246
the greatest love story
in history.

695
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,757
Thank you very much.
I cannot stop reading it.

696
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,726
You went to the library?

697
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,955
Oh, yeah, yeah, well,

698
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,965
I kind of tricked you
on your third Imperial.

699
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:33,993
When we went to the town,
I went to the library.

700
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,975
You could've told me.

701
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,977
Yes, I know.
It was stupid.

702
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,606
Anyway, I love the book.
I'm only halfway.

703
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,979
The French Revolution?

704
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,881
Oh, I didn't know anything
about that.

705
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,249
It's amazing!

706
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,754
Maybe If I finish it
before you leave,

707
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,982
we can talk about it.

708
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:53,989
Is that okay?

709
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,787
Yeah.

710
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,694
See? I knew book talk
would make you happy.

711
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:07,562
Now you can hear it.

712
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,969
Let's go.

713
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,491
Sorry, but you must have
these pictures.

714
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,824
Follow me.

715
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,033
Be careful. Yeah.

716
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,055
We should go.

717
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,097
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

718
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,982
I'm sorry about the couple.

719
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,887
I should have been more,
uh, circumspect.

720
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,822
It's okay.
- Okay.

721
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,120
Pura vida.

722
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,723
Ahh...

723
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,928
I love the book.
Yeah, I'm learning history,

724
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,029
and I'm beginning to see
why you like the love story.

725
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,869
It is complicated.

726
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,900
Lucy love Charles,
but Sydney's crazy about Lucy.

727
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,106
I don't know
what will happen.

728
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,081
Maybe Sydney
will kill Charles.

729
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,584
I'm not talking.

730
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,119
I can't wait to see.

731
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,587
That's the thing
about a really great book.

732
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,352
You can't wait
to get through it,

733
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,123
but once it's over,
it's actually kinda sad.

734
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,858
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:19,096
I always read the last pages
of a book really slowly.

736
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,536
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

737
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,439
So why did you name your cat
Sydney and not Charles?

738
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,771
Read the book.

739
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,143
Okay, okay, okay, deal.

740
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,580
Books are your life?

741
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,680
Yeah.

742
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,822
Usually after this big day,
I give tomorrow off to relax

743
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,889
because the next day is the
final big trip to Puerto Viejo,

744
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,400
the Caribbean side.

745
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,131
It's very different
and very beautiful.

746
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,729
It's home of the Rastas.

747
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,501
Yes! Short for Rastafaris.

748
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,408
You're a very good teacher.
A very, very good teacher.

749
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,173
I think you
just like learning.

750
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,771
My daughter was amazed
I was reading a book.

751
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,180
She thanks you.

752
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:10,152
I hope you enjoyed the tour.
- I did.

753
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,418
And for Friday, you should
bring your bathing suit.

754
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,186
Have you ever been
in the Caribbean water?

755
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,454
No.

756
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,826
I'm not big on swimming.

757
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,194
You don't have to swim.

758
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,426
It's good just to be in it.

759
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,197
It's such a pretty blue.

760
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,205
But I'm not going to push.

761
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,436
And it's a longer drive
to Puerto Viejo than Arenal,

762
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,001
so we usually stay overnight.

763
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,205
Is that okay?

764
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,147
Yeah, okay.

765
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,874
Be careful.

766
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,984
Okay, Jane, have a good night.

767
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,920
Okay.
- Pura vida.

768
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,810
A simple bathing suit.

769
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,785
A place to buy a bathing suit.
- Yes.

770
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,584
Yes! There's a place
in Quepos.

771
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,888
I'll write down the name and
address for the taxi driver.

772
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,325
Okay?
- Okay.

773
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:36,924
And my cousin has a salon
for hair and nails,

774
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,334
you know,
if you want, okay?

775
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,668
You think so?
- Yes.

776
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,368
Could be nice.
- Okay.

777
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,004
What?

778
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,109
Nothing, nothing.

779
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,912
No, no, no, no.
What, what, what?

780
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,182
Your guide Juan,
he's treating you well?

781
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,052
You like him?

782
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,789
Yes.
- Yes?

783
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,353
He's a good guide, I think.
- Okay.

784
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,296
Why? What's the matter?

785
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,924
Nothing. I...

786
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,027
I just want to make sure
that he was treating you well.

787
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,369
Why? He doesn't
treat customers well?

788
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,375
No. No, it's...

789
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,038
It's not that.
I'm sorry. I was just asking.

790
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,672
Have fun, Jane.
I write down name.

791
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,256
I know it's clichd
to be quoting Sylvia Plath,

792
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:19,030
but she did chart her demise
with dispassionate flair.

793
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,766
"Remember, remember,

794
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,432
this is now...

795
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,238
and now...

796
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,779
and now.

797
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,439
Live it,

798
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,244
feel it,

799
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,444
cling to it.

800
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:40,388
I want to become acutely aware
of all I've taken for granted."

801
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,272
I know the feeling.
I cried at the end of Twilight.

802
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,241
I wasn't crying, babe.

803
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,279
It's okay.
Women like sensitive men.

804
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,405
Go to school, Anna.
Come on.

805
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,246
I'm late.
I need you to drive me.

806
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,945
I have to pick up
my client.

807
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,386
I know.
I'm gonna meet the librarian.

808
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,320
Anna!
- Papi!

809
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,860
"Cipher."

810
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,898
"Cipher."

811
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:11,047
You'll be okay, Papi.

812
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:22,984
# Feel my heart in you #

813
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:27,554
#And I feel your heart #

814
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,565
# I feel your heart in me #

815
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,475
Anna, sit in the front.
She sits in the back.

816
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,206
Come on.
- Okay.

817
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,379
And be calm, Anna.
Be calm.

818
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,579
I'm calm.
You're the one who's not calm.

819
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,178
Anna.
- Pap...

820
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,883
Shh! Don't say it.

821
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,526
What are you talking about?
She's pretty.

822
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,412
Wow!

823
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,506
Thanks.

824
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,608
I...

825
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,585
I thought you'd like
the T-shirt.

826
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,555
Yeah, and your hair
and everything.

827
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,615
You look beautiful.

828
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,558
Thanks.

829
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:35,394
I've never had
a Caribbean vacation before.

830
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,023
Well, you're ready for it.

831
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,898
Oh, I hope it is okay.
I have to drop my daughter off.

832
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,665
Yes?

833
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:48,043
Hello. I'm Anna.

834
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,476
I'm Jane.

835
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,639
Jane the librarian.

836
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,946
Yes. I guess...
I guess so.

837
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,679
Oh. Sorry.

838
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,946
I go to the library every day.

839
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,151
It's small, but I like it.

840
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,923
I know the libraries in America
are huge, but...

841
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,965
huge isn't always better.

842
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,659
Anna, please.

843
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,429
No, it's okay.

844
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:19,334
Do you like to read?

845
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,274
Yes, a lot.

846
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:24,576
Anything fun right now?

847
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,310
We're reading Charlotte's Web
by E.B. White.

848
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:31,150
I love Wilbur.

849
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,655
Yeah. I love him too.

850
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,691
I look up American universities
on the computer at school.

851
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,491
I'm going to be a doctor.

852
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:42,691
Do you think
I should be a librarian?

853
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,667
No. Doctor's great.

854
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:48,295
Yeah. I'm going to cure cancer.

855
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,403
My mama had that.

856
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,348
I'm sorry.

857
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,145
It's okay.

858
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,399
Okay.

859
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,014
Come on, let's go, Anna.

860
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,143
Well, you're really smart
and pretty.

861
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,377
Thank you.

862
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,750
I can Facebook you.
- Anna...

863
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,755
I'm not on the Facebook.

864
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,758
I thought everyone in America
was on Facebook.

865
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,384
Okay.
- You're probably right.

866
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,636
Bye.

867
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,697
See you later
- Have a nice trip.

868
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,442
Well, you survived
Hurricane Anna.

869
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,412
She's beautiful.

870
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:06,604
Let's go.

871
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,780
# Can you hear the night #

872
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,619
# Whisper to the morning #

873
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,352
# She's talking
about the times #

874
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,830
# When the fire burned bright #

875
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,761
# She often wonders how #

876
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,569
# How the people forgot her #

877
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,278
# It must have been the rain #

878
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,838
# That washed them with doubt #

879
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:46,379
#And so here we go #

880
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,653
# Up off the ground #

881
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,093
# Spinning round #

882
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:54,130
Cheers.

883
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,756
#Around and round #

884
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,094
# Here we go #

885
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,768
# Up off the ground #

886
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:10,108
# Spinning round #

887
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:14,082
#Around and round #

888
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,609
# Here we go #

889
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:21,521
# Up off the ground #

890
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:25,152
# Spinning round #

891
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:28,720
#Around and round #

892
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:43,676
Eee-my!

893
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,715
You look...
- I look like a woman

894
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,842
who hasn't worn a bathing suit
in forever.

895
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,684
I think it's too rough
to float.

896
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,384
Oh, I agree.

897
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:59,451
But maybe we could
just go for a walk.

898
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,895
Yes.

899
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,900
Listen,
I know I don't own you,

900
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,903
so if you wanna go
for the day, that's...

901
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,802
No, thank you.

902
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:13,832
I was planning on watching you
have the best day of your life.

903
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,518
I finished the book,
by the way.

904
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,926
Wow. That was fast.

905
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,930
Yeah, I couldn't
stop reading it.

906
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:38,263
I was like addicted to it.
- Yeah.

907
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,530
I felt very bad
for Sydney Carton,

908
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:44,438
to love someone so much
when she does not love you

909
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,533
and still be willing
to give up your life for her,

910
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,705
so she can be happy
with another man and...

911
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,974
Oof. Crazy.

912
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,516
The last line of the book
was so powerful.

913
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,248
I read it over and over.

914
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,257
I remember it.

915
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,792
Yes?
- Yeah.

916
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,658
Could you say it to me
in English.

917
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,856
Come on.

918
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:10,991
Okay.

919
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:18,770
"It's a far, far better thing
that I do than I've ever done.

920
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,869
And it's a far, far better rest
that I go to

921
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,642
than I've ever known."

922
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:29,207
He's happy to give his life
and go to death

923
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,947
because of the good
he has done.

924
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,012
Beautiful. Whoa.

925
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:37,993
To Mr. Sydney Carton,
who lives in your cat.

926
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,456
Okay.

927
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,865
You know, I've lived
in Santa Monica...

928
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,667
it's in California,
Santa Monica...

929
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,436
for, I don't know, years,

930
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:30,878
and I hardly ever...
go to the beach.

931
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,539
I forget it's even there.

932
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,446
Yeah.

933
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,009
I love this place.
I love the feel of it.

934
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,387
Yeah. This is different
from the Pacific side.

935
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,720
Right?
- Yeah.

936
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,885
It's different, yeah.
- Yes.

937
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,054
I love the Pacific side.

938
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,893
You showed me
beautiful places.

939
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,990
Yeah.

940
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,903
This is different.
I don't know. It's just...

941
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,635
I don't even know
the American word for it.

942
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,336
"Chill."

943
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,504
I think "chill" is the American
word you're looking for.

944
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,013
Yeah, you're right.
- Chill.

945
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,844
That's it.
- Yeah.

946
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,543
Chill.

947
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,552
Look at this.

948
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,386
Yeah, it's from the reef.
It's right here.

949
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:15,583
Yeah.

950
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,057
Chill.

951
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,329
Enjoy your life.

952
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,528
To the best day of your life.

953
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,867
I'll drink to that.

954
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,371
Pura vida.

955
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,112
"Dear Juan,

956
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:48,681
I truly am sorry
to have done this to you,

957
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,717
to have done this to myself
while I'm with you.

958
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,164
You really did show me
the best week of my life.

959
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,401
But unfortunately...

960
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,842
I'd already screwed up
the rest of it beforehand."

961
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,844
Do you wanna dance?

962
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,107
Come on!

963
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,453
You better, Jane.
Come on, walk with the music.

964
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,757
I don't want to.

965
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,165
I think it's just
too advanced for me.

966
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,601
Okay, okay.
- Are you...

967
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,433
No, no. Come with me.

968
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,529
Okay.

969
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,240
Here.

970
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,247
You're okay?
- Yeah.

971
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,059
Are you sure?

972
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,657
Yeah. I want to...
I want to try.

973
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,964
Okay.
- Life is short, right?

974
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,503
Yes, it is.

975
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,970
Pura vida.

976
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,097
Wait.

977
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,914
Gracias.

978
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:01,146
I got it.
- Okay.

979
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,089
No, I have...
I have a lighter.

980
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,252
Let me see it.

981
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,296
I've never seen one before.

982
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,628
Oh.

983
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:16,967
Me first?

984
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,850
Stop. Esta bien.

985
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,258
Cough it out.
Cough it out.

986
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,298
No.
- What'd I do wrong?

987
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,129
No, no, no. It's...

988
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,294
You must do it slower,
you know?

989
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,312
Okay.
- Okay.

990
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,351
Slower, you know?

991
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,924
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Out.

992
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,755
Okay, okay.

993
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,730
Slow.

994
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,269
Pura vida, my...

995
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,771
Oh, no, you have to...

996
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,570
Shh!
- Okay, okay.

997
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,338
Okay! Shh!

998
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,244
Yeah, yeah, feel free.

999
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,010
Don't, no, no, in, in.
Stop. Stop.

1000
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:37,109
Good. Out, out, out.

1001
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:41,281
As soon as you can.
Yes, take it out.

1002
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,656
Okay, okay. No more.

1003
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,354
Okay.
- Not many...

1004
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,676
Wow.

1005
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:06,647
The moon is glowing.

1006
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:11,050
Just glowing and glowing and
glowing and glowing and glowing.

1007
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,351
It's really amazing.

1008
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,289
It is.

1009
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,986
You feel okay?

1010
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,189
Uh, funny.

1011
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,823
Yeah, I don't know.
Why? Do I sound weird?

1012
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,925
No. No, no, no.

1013
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,168
Your voice sounds like...

1014
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,974
Good.
- Well, I can tell you,

1015
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,211
I don't even feel like
a pathetic librarian anymore,

1016
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,412
but...

1017
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,456
I don't really feel
like myself either.

1018
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,281
That's good.

1019
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,094
When were you ever pathetic?

1020
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,764
You're not pathetic.

1021
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,702
Yes.

1022
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,433
Yes, yes.

1023
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:07,840
Yes, I was pathetic too.
- No, you're not.

1024
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,435
Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
I'm gonna tell you.

1025
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,447
I'm gonna tell you why now.

1026
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,245
I am pathetic when I read
the dictionary

1027
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:19,118
to find big words to use
to impress American women.

1028
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:22,021
Yeah, to look smart.

1029
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,719
What, you're up
to the letter "C"?

1030
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,955
Okay. Oh, oh!

1031
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,260
Enough, enough, enough!
It's gonna ruin my day too!

1032
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,062
No. Just remember this.

1033
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,467
You're a good man, Juan,

1034
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:38,473
and you're a really good
father to Anna.

1035
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,375
So whatever you do,
just promise me this.

1036
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,470
Just promise me
that you'll remember

1037
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:48,449
that I had the best,

1038
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:52,784
best week of my entire life...

1039
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,823
with you.

1040
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,291
Okay?

1041
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,987
Promise?

1042
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,510
Your lips are like
little pillows.

1043
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,445
Okay, I'm sorry.
We don't...

1044
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:20,948
No, I, uh...

1045
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,815
I've not done this
in a long time.

1046
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,444
Jane?

1047
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:03,376
Jane.

1048
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:04,976
Jane?

1049
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,679
Jane!

1050
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,426
Jane!

1051
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,929
Are you...

1052
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:51,159
sunbathing?

1053
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,663
Yeah.

1054
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,672
Are you okay?

1055
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,173
Yeah.

1056
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,577
You're in your underwear, Juan.

1057
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,308
Yeah.

1058
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,976
Well, yeah.

1059
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,054
And you? You're okay?

1060
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,484
Yeah?

1061
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,724
Yeah. Yeah.

1062
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:26,531
You wanna go swimming?

1063
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,297
It's nice.

1064
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,736
Yeah.

1065
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,568
Yeah.

1066
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:36,040
Well...

1067
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,604
you should put
your bathing suit on.

1068
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,343
Yeah.

1069
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,652
Okay.

1070
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,551
I'm gonna grab one.

1071
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:50,285
Everything's okay?
- Everything's great.

1072
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,327
Okay, okay.

1073
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,724
Yeah, oh...

1074
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,197
Juan.

1075
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,567
Pura vida.

1076
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:04,162
Pura vida, Jane.

1077
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,673
Pura vida.

1078
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:26,726
I traveled here to do
a little living before I died.

1079
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,788
I guess I did a little
too much living.

1080
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:53,280
Okay!

1081
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,682
I have accessed
the creature.

1082
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,725
You have choos-pah.

1083
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,263
Eee-my!

1084
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,484
Anna...

1085
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:34,824
Papi!

1086
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,593
Shh! Wait, wait.

1087
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,336
Come on, go now.

1088
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,716
Anna!
- Jane.
