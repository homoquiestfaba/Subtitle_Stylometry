1
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,605
Come on. Come on. Go.

2
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,683
No, no... No, no, no, no, no...

3
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:25,669
Yeee...

4
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,388
Good job.

5
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,198
Come on. Come on let's keep it moving.

6
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,814
Good game. Good game.

7
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,843
You guys, stay out of trouble. All right... Yes...

8
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,075
Okay, back to the game.

9
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,450
Okay, guys. See you on Sunday.

10
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:25,319
All right.

11
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,652
Good morning.

12
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,216
What can I do for you, my son?

13
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:48,325
I think the question is what can I do for you,
Father?

14
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,514
I don't' understand.

15
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:51,974
Are you okay?

16
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,353
I saw you playing basketball with the kids out there.

17
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,491
A lot of poverty around here.

18
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,910
Yes, a lot of poverty.

19
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,391
Would you like to confess?

20
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,425
Confession?

21
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:10,638
Well, it's been a long time since I have done that.

22
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,122
Not father, I think I'm way beyond redemption.

23
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,416
There is just you, me and God.

24
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,605
And I'm sworn to secrecy.

25
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,378
So, what have you got to lose?

26
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,995
Come, have a seat.

27
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:24,610
Join me.

28
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,710
Take you time.

29
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,431
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

30
00:06:57,455 --> 00:07:01,312
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

31
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:06,005
Go on. Tell me... What's in your heart.

32
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:18,517
You know, everything they write about
me in the newspaper is true.

33
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:27,380
I am an undercover agent for the CIA.

34
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:32,906
Go on my son.

35
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:38,849
I am... a killer.

36
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,688
We used to believe in... something.

37
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,025
But not any more.

38
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:40,367
You did a good job in New York, Marcus.

39
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:44,434
With Zawirahowi dead,
the Iranians will not be getting their shipment.

40
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,206
Are you okay?

41
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,458
Yes, sir.

42
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,074
And your team?

43
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,481
No Problems.

44
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:56,008
I swore to defend my country against all
enemies foreign and domestic, but

45
00:08:56,842 --> 00:09:00,700
the world is becoming... complex, Marcus.

46
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:05,600
We're at war with an enemy who has no face.

47
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:08,103
Often, within our own walls.

48
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,112
The Redvale Corporation is a major
hedge fund based in Detroit.

49
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:22,909
They have invested over $10 Billion
in oil exploration in Africa.

50
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,662
Because they are unhappy with the
local government policies...

51
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,582
they have been financing an arms
dealer named Frank Smith.

52
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,587
An armed rebel. Smith is a... real son of a bitch.

53
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:40,843
Establish contact, work for him,
infiltrate his organization.

54
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,502
And, when the time is right,

55
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:46,056
I'm going to take Smith and Redvale out.

56
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,350
Done.

57
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:50,644
And Marcus,

58
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,398
the CIA can not be connected to this.

59
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:55,857
I fully understand.

60
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,673
In today's world who knows if your
actions will get you a medal or...

61
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,175
A trial.

62
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,043
This is for you.

63
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:05,659
Good luck.

64
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,802
Ronny, I don't give a shit.

65
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,731
We got $2 million in to this deal.

66
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:01,442
He's late, that's not my problem.

67
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:04,883
Well, you tell them, they don't make that payment,

68
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,177
I'm going to cut off his fucking balls!

69
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:11,869
You're my attorney, I'm paying you 800 bucks an hour.

70
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,770
You stop wasting my time.
You foreclose on this asshole.

71
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,357
Jane, what's happening?

72
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:27,405
The vault reports that the money from Mr.
Smith from the African transaction is ready.

73
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,201
Fucking Wall Street.

74
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,415
These assholes create the biggest financial
disaster the American economy has seen in 80 years.

75
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,263
Millions of people lose their homes, their jobs,

76
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:45,026
and nearly bankrupt the country.

77
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,842
And what happens?

78
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,742
They get rewarded with a government bail out.

79
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,525
All right, let's go.

80
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,593
Subject is leaving the airport.

81
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,991
Don't get too close.

82
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,399
Remember people,

83
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,214
we don't make a move before he picks up the money.

84
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,655
Marcus will give us the cue.

85
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:52,390
Is this the bakery?

86
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,902
Is the oven hot?

87
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,855
We're right on schedule.

88
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,262
To the minute?

89
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,035
To the second.

90
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,954
Everything is set, sir.

91
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,196
Punctuality is the politeness of kings.

92
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,229
Do you know who said that?

93
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,158
No, sir.

94
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,983
It was king Louis XVIII.

95
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:16,111
He was a slimy fucker.

96
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,196
Sycophantic little punk.

97
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:26,642
Sir, Mr. Smith and his team are on their way.

98
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,353
Everything is set.

99
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,680
Hey, would you do me a favor? Put on the air...

100
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:35,713
It's like a hot box in here.

101
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,382
It's already on, Sir.

102
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:38,841
Well then, turn it up.

103
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:14,918
This is Zander.

104
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,264
Dietrich is out of the picture.

105
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,880
I'm now in command.

106
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:31,184
Oh, Christ... Jesus.

107
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,563
What the...?

108
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,639
Is everything all right, back there?

109
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:41,090
Jesus... my, my chest.

110
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,304
Oh shit, he's having a heart attack.

111
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,455
Get us to the hospital.

112
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,299
What's going on down there?

113
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,512
Target is off course.

114
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:16,019
ETA?
- 5 minutes, but I think we have company.

115
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,365
Did you take anything?

116
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,982
Did you take anything? Boss?

117
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,219
Do not lose them.

118
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,380
Request permission to fire on target.

119
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,968
Keep Smith alive, at all costs.

120
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,590
We're losing him. He's heading toward the hospital.

121
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,027
Please stop. He's my client.
I'm the head of his security.

122
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,060
Sir. Sir. We'll handle this.

123
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:03,833
Sir, please. Let the doctors do their job, all right.

124
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,397
I can't go with him?

125
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,137
No, you can't.

126
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:08,746
The best thing you can do for
yourself is go to the desk over there

127
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,356
and tell the nurse all the information
about the patient, all right.

128
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,260
It will only take a couple minutes.
All right. Thank you.

129
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,971
Please, fill out this form.

130
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,516
Hi, I'm Dr. Brown. Can you tell me what happened?

131
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,810
Look, boss just had a heart attack.

132
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:24,582
I really need to stay with him. What's his name?

133
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,250
His name is Frank Smith.

134
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:27,710
Does he have a history of cardiac problems?

135
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,961
None that I'm aware of.

136
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,611
Sir, just stay here. Look, he's my client.

137
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:35,009
We're going to take care of him, all right.

138
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:11,711
Agent 1, cover the stairwell.

139
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:14,110
Agent 3, the emergency exit.

140
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,768
4 and 5, get the elevators.

141
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,323
I want the entire premises covered.

142
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,703
Guys, we got a situation out here.

143
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:48,205
We need to call 911, right away.

144
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:24,803
We're on. I know,
we just received a 911 call from the hospital.

145
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,680
We need to move up our plan.

146
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:33,875
This is dispatch. Cancel all response to the
911 call from the Detroit Medical Center.

147
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,107
This is a national security operation.

148
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,870
Undercover agents are on site. Do not interfere.

149
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,529
I repeat, do not interfere.

150
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,648
Sir, are you carrying a weapon?

151
00:20:57,752 --> 00:21:00,880
Yes, look, I am a close protection specialist.

152
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,634
Sir. Please do me a favor.
Hand the weapon to the officer.

153
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:06,928
It's hospital policy.

154
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,597
We'll put it in safekeeping.

155
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:10,718
Ok.

156
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,663
Doctor, how's he doing?

157
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,103
He's stabilized, we're taking him up to the ICU,
right now.

158
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,293
Smith is in ICU.

159
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:25,905
Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah...

160
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:31,118
Look, no... Do you have some orange
juice or a candy bar or something?

161
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:34,455
I'm a diabetic. I'll get a nurse to help you.

162
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,000
Sit down and I'll get a nurse to get you tested.

163
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,005
We're going to take care of you, right away...

164
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:53,223
Just follow me, please.

165
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,403
Thank you.

166
00:21:56,404 --> 00:21:58,123
What's going on with the hospital?

167
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:02,816
The hospital built a new wing. And, they're in the
process of transferring patients over, today.

168
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:05,370
Good timing on your part, huh?

169
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:57,244
Excuse me, sir?
But do not you're not supposed to be in here.

170
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:03,708
Mr Smith, has anything else like this
ever happened to you before?

171
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:07,462
No. We're running some tests on you, now.

172
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:13,822
You can get me the results on the enzyme analysis,
please?

173
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,784
All right, we're in.

174
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:33,425
Marcus is alone with the nurse.

175
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,012
So, what do you do for a living?

176
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,193
I protect very important people.

177
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,330
That's interesting.

178
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,823
Are you from Detroit?

179
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:48,126
No.

180
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,990
Is it dangerous?

181
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,397
Sometimes.

182
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:13,047
Well, this little needle won't hurt you, then.

183
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,175
I always wanted to date a bodyguard.

184
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,019
Thank you.

185
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:57,361
Look,
I'm real concerned about the man I came in with.

186
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,498
I think he had a heart attack...

187
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,427
Where would they take him?

188
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:03,721
I suppose, the ICU.

189
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:06,432
But, I don't think they've been moved yet.
It's on the fourth floor.

190
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,560
Can showed me where that is? Okay,
I'll take you there.

191
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,533
Did you get Marcus?

192
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,254
What's the status?

193
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:00,189
Marcus is in the stairwell on
the way to fourth pitro.

194
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:01,857
Copy that.

195
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:03,317
Kill him. Now!

196
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:14,115
I dreamed you...

197
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,456
I dreamed you and now you're real.

198
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:24,229
Please, take me out of here.

199
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:32,153
Wait...wait... wait.

200
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,096
Please take me.

201
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:47,898
Let me touch you?

202
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:51,651
Just... just once.

203
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,884
I'll be gentle, I promise.

204
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:12,818
I can show you the way out of here.

205
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:15,216
I never dated anyone, before...

206
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,884
Dr. Green?

207
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:20,701
Did you bring my pills?

208
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,662
You know, the red ones? The pink ones?

209
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,102
And, the blue ones. Dr. Green? He likes them all.

210
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:29,084
I can show you the way out of here!

211
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:33,671
Dr. Green, I need those pills.

212
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,757
It's up here.

213
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,719
Pushing man. Pushing man.

214
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:46,184
Pointing man.
Get over there against the wall, next to the door.

215
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:49,520
Can we play the door game now? Get, over there.

216
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,013
Where are the doctors?

217
00:29:53,014 --> 00:29:54,629
They said they would come back.

218
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:57,295
Please take me with you.

219
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,864
Agent 3?

220
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,679
Agent 3, report.

221
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:34,414
Get down to the third floor and find
out what the fuck is going on.

222
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,936
You can't be in here. Please leave, now!

223
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,386
This patient is a threat to national security.

224
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,732
He's going to have to leave with us.

225
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:04,235
He's not going anywhere. He just had a heart attack.

226
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:09,031
We inserted a cardiac cathater and looks certain he
will need a stent inserted into his artery.

227
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,429
Can't allow him to travel.

228
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,619
Marie, please call security.

229
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:16,121
I wouldn't do that.

230
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,501
I'm afraid, you have no choice.
No say in the matter.

231
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,690
We're security now.

232
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,780
Mr. Smith, good morning.

233
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:33,378
We're going to go see your friends, now.

234
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:35,828
Mr. Smith, please calm down, calm down.

235
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:08,308
Look, I don't care what you do,

236
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,488
but you give him something to jack him up.
Make him strong.

237
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:15,763
You want me to pump up a man who just had
a heart attack full of epinephrine?

238
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,682
It'll kill him. I won't allow it.

239
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:22,436
You can and you will.
Like I said, you have no choice.

240
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,564
How long is this going to take?

241
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:29,839
What you're suggesting, will certainly
cause him to have another heart attack.

242
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,967
You're asking me to put the life of my
patient as risk. I won't do it.

243
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:36,408
I'm not suggesting anything, Doc.

244
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,640
You either give him a shot or you take one yourself.

245
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,987
Marcus?

246
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:16,864
Floria.

247
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:18,115
Is that you?

248
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,599
What's going on?

249
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,788
There's been a change of plans, Marcus.

250
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,352
Oh, yeah?

251
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:27,708
Where's Dietrich?

252
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,774
Dietrich is dead.

253
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:34,798
What happened?

254
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:38,708
Things are complicated,

255
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,533
can we just talk about it?

256
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:44,286
No...
no, no, no, no, you people are trying to kill me.

257
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,002
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

258
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:55,652
Seems like you and me both have an interest in Mr.
Smith staying alive.

259
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,988
So, I'm going to perform the
procedure my patient needs to survive.

260
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,221
If after inserting the stent, he is not alert,

261
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:05,244
then I'll administer the shot you are requesting.

262
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:08,581
Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

263
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:12,230
Demerol.

264
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:17,757
If you give him the shot first,
he's not going to make it out of here alive.

265
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:19,581
Why don't you just tell me what's going on?

266
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:21,302
Huh.

267
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:23,908
Where's Zander?

268
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,871
Zander is in charge, Marcus.

269
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,226
In charge of what?

270
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,406
I was running this mission.

271
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:34,231
Like I said, things have changed.

272
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,302
How long is this going to take?

273
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,658
Not less than one hour.

274
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:46,639
You got 30 minutes.

275
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:53,416
So, why don't you tell me what's the new mission?
Huh?

276
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,023
The mission is we're taking the fucking money,
Marcus.

277
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,630
We're getting the fuck out of here.

278
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:01,132
You can either join us, or you can die.

279
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:05,616
Don't be stupid, Marcus. We know all your moves.

280
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:11,559
Well, I guess that puts us on opposite sides,
doesn't it.

281
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:17,919
Now, will you get that thing out of my
face so I can take care of my patient.

282
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:49,617
$100 million, Marcus. Come on.

283
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:55,769
You can have a nice life, Marcus.

284
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,138
We control this whole place.

285
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,276
You're outnumbered.

286
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:07,760
The cops aren't coming for you. You have no back up.

287
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:10,366
We're it!

288
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,926
I know this isn't about Smith.

289
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,167
That piece of shit going down,
was always part of the plan.

290
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,357
So, what is this?

291
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:27,883
The system is corrupt.
Every day we risk our lives and for what?

292
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,471
We protect sellouts and monsters, Marcus.

293
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,433
It's been like that a long time
and it's not going to change.

294
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:42,168
So, yeah, this time, fuck 'em.
We're taking the money.

295
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,728
Go find out what's happening.

296
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:04,794
And you make sure you keep this patient alive.

297
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:19,664
Marcus.

298
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:26,274
Yeah, roll with the punches, man,
you could still come out on top.

299
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,719
I'm gonna love my new life, Marcus.

300
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:44,677
I always liked you, Marcus.

301
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:46,710
Even thought, one day you might make a move on me.

302
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:48,295
Huh...

303
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:49,108
Talk to me.

304
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:28,417
I would love to talk to you, Marcus.

305
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:33,422
Well, man. I'm doing all the talking, kind of rude.

306
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,157
Haven't you got anything to say?

307
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:50,639
I got him.

308
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,203
Bring him to me alive.

309
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,876
Hello, Marcus.

310
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:19,000
Ok Mr. Smith, you start to feel better very soon.
Marcus.

311
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:21,920
My dear friend.

312
00:42:22,754 --> 00:42:24,526
My teammate.

313
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:38,550
What did you think was going to happen, Frank?

314
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:41,626
You're trusted bodyguard was going to bust
through the door and save the day.

315
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,546
He's one of us.

316
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:46,527
Let me introduce you...

317
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:51,740
Agent Marcus Jones, CIA.

318
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,276
You are the mission, Frank.

319
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:58,414
Take down you and Redvale.

320
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,959
Look at him.

321
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,627
Perfect Boy Scout.

322
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,822
You made the wrong decision brother.

323
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,115
But you know what?

324
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:14,471
I knew you would.

325
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:16,243
You killed Dietrich.

326
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:19,162
Yeah. We killed Dietrich.

327
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,675
Your beloved mentor,

328
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:23,229
He was like a father to you, Marcus?

329
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:28,547
I knew he wouldn't go along with our plan,
so we eliminated him.

330
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:33,552
You know, when this is over...

331
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,784
I'm going to kill you.

332
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:38,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

333
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,249
Right now, you ain't getting jack shit.

334
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:47,151
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

335
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:51,116
Zander...

336
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:54,718
It's time to go.

337
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,482
You've had enough time.

338
00:43:57,483 --> 00:43:58,785
Get him in the wheelchair, now.

339
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:02,747
If I go too fast, it will kill him.

340
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:07,022
Hurry this up. We don't have time.

341
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:15,259
Get a bag of supplies ready for him to go.

342
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,743
Hurry the fuck up.

343
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:24,748
Please, put that away. I'm doing the best I can.
It's not going to make this any faster.

344
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,563
I'll take it down when you got him in a wheelchair.

345
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,065
You, wheelchair.

346
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:33,402
Come on, Frank. We're going to see your friends.

347
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:39,137
Right behind you.

348
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:41,431
Come on Frankie.

349
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:43,436
And, honey...

350
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,601
You're coming with us.

351
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:47,478
So, pack you're shit.

352
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:55,403
Take what you need and get out of here.

353
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:41,072
Smith and Redvale are responsible for
more than revolutions than Karl Marx.

354
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,574
They got more blood on their
hands than most dictators.

355
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,181
Still, they're protected by the law.

356
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:49,622
This is my life, Zander. All right.

357
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:54,001
And, I've spent is serving a country
that couldn't give a fuck about me.

358
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:56,087
So, yeah. I'm a little disillusioned.

359
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,068
Listen to me Flora.

360
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,717
I've been working on something.

361
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,471
Something,
that I think will be really good for you and me.

362
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:18,192
The betrayal of my team,
the betrayal of the people I trusted.

363
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,215
We were like a family.

364
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:26,324
Do you regret your life, my son?

365
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,410
Do you want God to forgive you?

366
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,287
No, Father.

367
00:46:31,017 --> 00:46:34,145
I do not want to be forgiven for what I've done.

368
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:38,107
I stayed in the car all night.

369
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:40,818
And, then I realized... that

370
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,718
I have nothing left. My enemies have won.

371
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:50,932
And when I wake up this morning and I saw you
playing with the kids, I thought to myself...

372
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,643
Life could be so simple.

373
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,145
I just felt like...

374
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:59,482
Following you here. But...

375
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:07,198
I realized the world would be a much better place,
without men like me.

376
00:47:10,221 --> 00:47:12,098
Look, I should go, Father.

377
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,975
I do not want to take up most of your time.

378
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:16,321
Tell me,

379
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:18,459
what happened to your team.

380
00:48:55,324 --> 00:48:59,077
That is exactly what I'm saying. Are we clear?

381
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:06,272
All officers,
we have a homicide at the Detroit Medical Center.

382
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,755
The suspect is a former CIA agent,
involved in an assassination.

383
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,737
He is armed and dangerous.

384
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,230
What's so funny?

385
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:29,680
You're full of shit.

386
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:30,775
What did he say?

387
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:32,547
You're full of shit.

388
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,571
I'm not the one that's dying.

389
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,344
Yes you are.

390
00:49:38,282 --> 00:49:39,742
Yes you are.

391
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:44,643
As soon as he steps into Redvale's building,
he's a dead man.

392
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:49,022
As soon as you step into Redvale's building,
you're a dead man.

393
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:57,201
No!... You want him to live, right?

394
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:07,790
All you're after is the money.

395
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:10,397
Redvale, is about power.

396
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:14,046
He's like the Mafioso in Sicily.

397
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:18,217
They control billions of dollars and live in shacks.

398
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:21,136
They, are about power.

399
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:24,786
It's about power.

400
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:27,966
Hey, What's he saying?

401
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,686
Nothing.

402
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,189
Just the ravings of a dying man.

403
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,317
They will never give you a dime.

404
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:37,715
Well, we'll see.

405
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:53,055
Hello, welcome to the Redvale Corporation.
How may I help you?

406
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,705
This is Mr. Frank Smith.
We're here to see to John Redvale.

407
00:52:56,913 --> 00:53:00,667
Do you have and appointment? We're a bit late,
he's expecting us.

408
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,359
Let me call up to his office.
It will just take a moment, please.

409
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,876
Thank you.

410
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:28,089
Please see Mr Smith and his associates up to Mr.
Redvale's office.

411
00:53:28,194 --> 00:53:30,175
Follow me, please.

412
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:53,010
Hello, Mr. Smith.

413
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:55,512
Are you okay?

414
00:53:55,513 --> 00:53:56,867
Hi, Jane.

415
00:53:58,327 --> 00:53:59,839
I'm Mr. Smith's bodyguard.

416
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,019
He's having a little heart trouble heart trouble,
right not and isn't feeling so well.

417
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:07,281
But we're here to keep the appointment with Mr.
Redvale.

418
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,569
Yes, of course.
Mr. Redvale is on a call at the moment,

419
00:54:11,778 --> 00:54:14,697
but and has asked that you be
seated in the conference room.

420
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:16,574
It's right this way.

421
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:54,111
Mr. Smith is here to see you, but he doesn't look right.
And, he's got a lot of people with him, too.

422
00:54:56,822 --> 00:54:58,907
Humm. Lets go take a look, shall we.

423
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:02,974
Hey!

424
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:04,225
Frankie!

425
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:07,874
How are you doing?

426
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,159
Ow, look at you.

427
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,670
What's going on?

428
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:14,547
Mr. Smith's not feeling well,

429
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:16,216
He's having a little heart trouble...

430
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,386
But, he wanted to come in to conclude
today's scheduled transaction.

431
00:55:22,784 --> 00:55:24,296
Heart trouble, Frank?

432
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,173
You look like shit.

433
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:27,606
You should be at the hospital, Frank.

434
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:30,500
John...

435
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,088
Let's just finish... this deal.

436
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,429
Frank, uh...

437
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:43,742
Now is not a good time.
I wasn't expecting to do this here.

438
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:46,662
I figured, maybe we would go out,
have a little dinner, celebrate.

439
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:51,458
Mr. Smith would like to finish this
piece of business today. Now.

440
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:54,899
Isn't that right, Mr. Smith?

441
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:57,766
I'm sorry,

442
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:59,487
but who are you, again? Huh?

443
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:02,198
You work for Frank?

444
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:06,369
Because you're doing a lot of talking for him.
But, I ain't ever seen you before.

445
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:08,871
Where is your man Marcus, Frank?

446
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,312
He's been relieved of his duties. Oh, is that right?

447
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,028
Well, gentleman...

448
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:22,217
I'm not real comfortable here.

449
00:56:22,322 --> 00:56:27,535
I don't know who any of you people are. And, I
really don't like strangers walking into my office.

450
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:30,634
Frank, Frank...

451
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:33,374
Why don't you go relax, huh.

452
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:39,422
When you're feeling better, come back here in a
couple of days and we'll talk about it. OK.

453
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:48,701
Nobody needs to get hurt here today.
What is it you want?

454
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,038
Money. Plain and simple.

455
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:55,896
Just Frank's share. Is that OK with you, Frank?

456
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:02,204
I'm afraid I can't comply with that request.

457
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:04,342
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

458
00:57:04,446 --> 00:57:06,219
I don't have a choice?

459
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:09,503
You have any idea who you're fuckin with?

460
00:57:09,504 --> 00:57:11,641
Let me tell you what's going to happen here.

461
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:15,498
Let's just suppose you make it out of here alive,
with the money.

462
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:20,399
One sunny day, 10 years from now,
when you'll be convinced of your new identity...

463
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,527
And feeling very proud about what
you have accomplished...

464
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:29,575
You're going to go jogging, and by the time you
come back, your wife and kids will be dead.

465
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:34,580
And I'm going to wait another... 10 years.

466
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,542
And if haven't hung yourself out of remorse...

467
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,253
I'm kill you.

468
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:43,807
That's not going to happen.

469
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,736
You better get used to the idea.

470
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:50,220
Imagine a room, just like this one...

471
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:54,912
Filled with paperwork documenting every illegal
transaction you have done in your life.

472
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:59,812
And, now, imagine we with a key to that room.

473
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,879
Who are you? CIA.

474
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:07,320
Really?

475
00:58:07,424 --> 00:58:12,012
We've been watching you and Mr.
Frank Smith, here, for a very long time.

476
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,974
Now, we're going to back to the beginning.

477
00:58:17,017 --> 00:58:22,230
I'm going to count to three and we are
all going to lower our guns, slowly.

478
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,671
One...

479
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:29,112
Two...

480
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:31,614
Three.

481
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,539
That wasn't necessary.

482
00:58:39,747 --> 00:58:41,937
I don't like witnesses.

483
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:46,212
Let's go.

484
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,757
Let's go!

485
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,705
Call the vault, and tell them I'm on the way.
Do it now, Jane.

486
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,520
It's okay Jane, go ahead.

487
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:05,293
Yes, sir. Right away.

488
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:13,634
Sam, it's Jane. Mr. Redvale is on his way
down to the vault with some associates.

489
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:16,971
And, asked that you have it open
for him when he gets there.

490
00:59:16,972 --> 00:59:20,203
Yes, right now. Thank you.

491
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,644
That's very good, Jane.

492
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:29,587
What the fuck is wrong with you? Huh! Let's go.

493
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:33,341
Fuck you. Fucking asshole.

494
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:55,237
So, CIA gone bad, huh? I never knew a good CIA.

495
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,740
Couldn't agree with you more.

496
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,911
Looking for a retirement plan? Exactly.

497
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:05,456
Why don't you come work for me?

498
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:08,896
You would never trust me.

499
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:16,300
Hello, Sam. Sir, is everything all right, Mr.
Redvale?

500
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:18,385
Everything is all right, Sam.

501
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:24,641
Jesus Christ, man!

502
01:00:25,684 --> 01:00:27,456
Open it.

503
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:55,192
Fuckin' "A"

504
01:00:56,547 --> 01:00:59,258
Fuckin' "A", indeed.

505
01:01:06,974 --> 01:01:10,936
There you go. 100 million in in hundred dollar bills.

506
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,856
Just like we agreed, Frank.

507
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:21,884
This is your money.
You really gonna let this happen?

508
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:25,534
And, you got a better idea, John?

509
01:01:27,098 --> 01:01:29,704
You'll never get out of here with that money.

510
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:35,648
Do you really think so, Frank?

511
01:01:37,212 --> 01:01:39,401
You want to make a bet?

512
01:01:43,155 --> 01:01:44,510
How about it Frank?

513
01:01:45,345 --> 01:01:49,098
I'll bet you $10,000.

514
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:56,710
Oh, that's your money we're betting with, right.

515
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:04,686
You're not looking so good, Frank.

516
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,241
The odds are in my favor.

517
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,095
I'm looking for Frank Smith.

518
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,014
Yeah, I just saw him. He went down to the vault.

519
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,308
Sir, sir!

520
01:02:41,128 --> 01:02:42,901
Son of a bitch.

521
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,205
I need your help.

522
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:23,670
Tell them I'm feeling weaker.

523
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:28,466
Fredo, take this bag up to the roof.

524
01:03:30,134 --> 01:03:33,158
Call the chopper and have them at the ready.
Yes, Sir.

525
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,267
Tell them we'll be another 10 minutes.

526
01:04:24,562 --> 01:04:27,795
Marcus, is that you?

527
01:04:28,003 --> 01:04:30,818
You're trapped, Zander. Give it up.

528
01:04:30,923 --> 01:04:33,112
You didn't kill him?

529
01:04:33,634 --> 01:04:36,240
Get over here, move. Move!

530
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:40,098
Should have listened to Floria...
killed you when I had the chance.

531
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:46,876
There's a lot of money here, Marcus.
So, don't be a fucking idiot. Huh.

532
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:50,734
Take the bag that you got and
get the fuck out of here.

533
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:54,070
Oh, it's not going to be that easy.

534
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:56,781
There's only one path out of here and
you have to cross me to get there.

535
01:04:57,198 --> 01:04:58,971
You are outnumbered, Marcus.

536
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,160
You're all alone.

537
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:05,227
What, you think you got leverage
because you got Smith and Redvale?

538
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:07,104
Uh...

539
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:12,421
I don't give a fuck about them. You could put a
bullet in their head right now, for all I care.

540
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,905
I can't breathe. His blood pressure is dropping.
I think he's having another heart attack.

541
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:19,929
Hang in there, Mr. Smith. Hang in there.

542
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:23,247
I need some help here?

543
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:25,761
What's wrong with you people? Shut up.

544
01:05:29,521 --> 01:05:30,512
He's gonna die!

545
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:32,586
Sounds like your losing your numbers, Zander.

546
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:36,612
But, there is something else.

547
01:05:39,262 --> 01:05:40,722
Oh... God...

548
01:05:41,254 --> 01:05:41,900
No...

549
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,702
Shut up. No!

550
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,882
You hear this, Marcus? You hear this, Marcus?

551
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:49,854
Our doctor friend is trying to be a hero in here.

552
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:54,024
You might want to reconsider your position
or I'll put a bullet in her head.

553
01:05:55,588 --> 01:06:00,489
OK. I'm sending out a little package
to help you change your mind.

554
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:09,977
This is your last chance, Marcus.

555
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:14,774
Take the money and get the fuck out of here.
That's what you came here for, isn't it?

556
01:06:18,527 --> 01:06:21,447
Throw your gun down, Marcus.

557
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:25,513
I said, throw your gun down.

558
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:29,580
You got to the count of three
before I blow her brains out.

559
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:30,779
Leave her out of this.

560
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:32,832
Yeah, you keep walking sweetheart.

561
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:39,381
One...

562
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:46,158
Two...

563
01:06:56,272 --> 01:06:58,462
There you go, Marcus.

564
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:03,154
Okay, Rachel, you kick that gun over here.

565
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,477
Come on, Doc, you can do it. NOW!

566
01:07:19,524 --> 01:07:21,714
Come on, Doctor.

567
01:07:40,308 --> 01:07:43,228
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel...

568
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:47,468
I'm so very disappointed in you girl.

569
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:50,805
Three.

570
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:09,052
When this is over, I'm going to kill you.

571
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:15,308
Help her. Call the police.

572
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:18,436
Thank you.

573
01:08:18,644 --> 01:08:22,919
911, we have an emergency at the Gardian Building.
We need assistance.

574
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:25,422
Block that elevator.

575
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:49,908
Come on!

576
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:27,774
Fuck!

577
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:37,888
Zander? Come on, get the fucking key.

578
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:47,689
Grab the bags, let's go.

579
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:54,988
Come on, let's go.

580
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:21,681
Give me the key to the elevator.

581
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:52,231
Fuck.

582
01:11:44,678 --> 01:11:46,764
Ok, get ready.

583
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:52,290
Go!... Go, go, go.

584
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:21,277
Top priority is to take down Marcus Jones.

585
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:26,698
He is armed and dangerous.
Blocked stairways, block the elevators.

586
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,097
Go.

587
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:27,070
I spared your life.

588
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,075
You can have half the money.

589
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:36,767
What more do you want?

590
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:21,550
I trusted you.

591
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:24,143
You trusted me to clean the shit out of this world.

592
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,920
That's always our mission.

593
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:30,882
Nobody buys it anymore, Marcus.
Only you and Dietrich.

594
01:14:32,237 --> 01:14:35,678
I was just like you, Marcus.
I believed in the mission.

595
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,223
But I was blind, just like you are now.

596
01:14:39,432 --> 01:14:41,934
What I see is nothing but a man who has given up.

597
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,437
Don't even go there my friend.

598
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:48,920
I spared your life once,
I'm not going to do it again.

599
01:16:56,927 --> 01:17:01,202
Captain, this is Team A, we cleared the top five
floors and found no sign of the suspect.

600
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:04,782
Continue searching.

601
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:33,351
Yeah, we go it a casualty here,
but it's not your man.

602
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:41,693
Where is he?

603
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:43,048
We cleared the building, we couldn't find him.

604
01:17:43,513 --> 01:17:45,390
How do you mean, you couldn't find him?

605
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:47,479
We checked on every floor.

606
01:17:53,788 --> 01:17:56,603
Is this the man you saw in the vault?

607
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:02,546
Yes, that's the man that saved my life.

608
01:18:03,693 --> 01:18:05,883
Take her to my office.

609
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:04,586
That's quit a story, my son.

610
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:12,041
Have faith that our Lord, Jesus Christ

611
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:15,221
and he will lead you out of the darkness.

612
01:19:16,994 --> 01:19:18,767
Pray with me.

613
01:19:19,913 --> 01:19:25,335
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,

614
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:30,966
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
in earth as it is in heaven.

615
01:19:31,696 --> 01:19:34,824
And, give us this day, our daily bread.

616
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:40,559
And, forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

617
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:45,563
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

618
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:49,943
For thine is the kingdom and the
power and the glory, forever.

619
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:54,322
And ever. Amen.

620
01:19:56,303 --> 01:19:58,076
Amen.

621
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,725
Go with God, my son.

622
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:04,957
You are forgiven.

623
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,518
Here... here.
