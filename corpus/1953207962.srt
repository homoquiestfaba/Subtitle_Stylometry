1
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,891
Okay, it's two o'clock.
The bell at Sunnyside has rung,

2
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,686
so Bonnie is officially
on her winter break.

3
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,148
- Soon she'll be flying off to...
- Hay-way-I.

4
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,235
It's Hawaii, Buzz.
Does everybody have a vacation plan?

5
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,946
Rex and I have been working on
our massively multiplayer,

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,572
online, role-playing game profiles.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,908
The Rexing Ball!

8
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,202
That's me!
Can you make my arms bigger?

9
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,495
Oh, yeah. Enhancing.

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh, yes!

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,167
- Potato Head, you in?
- Sorry, fellas. He's all mine.

12
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:46,004
We're going to have a fun-filled week,
just the two of us.

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,423
Deal me in.

14
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,177
Thank you all
for coming to the audition.

15
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,804
Number one, action.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,723
Dreadful. Next.

17
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,766
Horrifying. Next.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Brilliant!

19
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,728
Bonnie's coming!

20
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,648
Vacation to Hawaii! Going on vacation!

21
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,400
- Vacation, vacation.
- Bonnie!

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,651
Coming, Mom!

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Bye, toys.

24
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,762
All right, folks, let
the relaxing begin.

25
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:14,574
Hooray!

26
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,909
Ready to lose at checkers, Slink?

27
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,077
When pigs fly.

28
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,246
Actually, I had an uncle
who was a pilot.

29
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,748
- Really?
- No, not really.

30
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,753
Here's your bag, Barbie.

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,757
- You can put my luggage right here.
- Ken, this is so exciting!

32
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,009
Picture! Say "sunscreen."

33
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,635
- Sunscreen.
- Perfect.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,221
- Ka-click.
- Barbie? Ken?

35
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,556
Woody? Hey!

36
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,351
You guys are in Hawaii, too! Groovy.

37
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,561
We stowed away in Bonnie's backpack.

38
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,687
How did you guys get here?

39
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,357
Ken, this is Bonnie's bedroom.

40
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,109
What?

41
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,612
- And there she goes.
- No. No, no. No, no.

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,030
No!

43
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,281
Bonnie!

44
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,452
You can't go.
Not without the backpack.

45
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,661
Let me get this straight.

46
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,873
You thought Bonnie would take
her school backpack on vacation?

47
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,625
- Oh, boy.
- Hawaii!

48
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,419
- You have to take us to Hawaii!
- Sorry, sir. I just zip and unzip.

49
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,296
- I don't actually fly.
- Hey?

50
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,422
Ken?

51
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,425
I... I'll be right back.

52
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,015
He's been planning this vacation
for months.

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,393
Wow. That's a lot of numbering.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,186
Did he do that all by himself?

55
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,147
Ken doesn't know I know,
but this is where he planned

56
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,192
to have our very first kiss.

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,694
You haven't kissed yet?

58
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,073
It would have been
the perfect vacation.

59
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,498
- Ken, could you please come out here?
- No!

60
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,835
I can't decide if this handbag
matches my shoes.

61
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,295
Well, are you wearing the pumps
or the espadrilles?

62
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,054
Welcome to paradise.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,141
We've got the vacation of your dreams
all planned out for you!

64
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,268
Welcome to the Bonnielikeoke Motel.

65
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,562
I thought we were staying in a resort.

66
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,438
- Welcome to the Bonnielikeoke Resort.
- This is great!

67
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,442
"Immerse yourself
in a whole new world

68
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,611
"when you go deep sea diving!"

69
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,113
I've got the perfect outfit!

70
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,451
Whoa, look at that.

71
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,328
Beautiful.

72
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,496
Watch this.

73
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,748
Shark Week.

74
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,916
Nice.

75
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,043
Next up, a guided nature hike.

76
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,797
There's the official Hawaiian
state bird, the Nene.

77
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,132
- Nay-nay.
- Ka-click.

78
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:40,428
And the state fish,
the humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

79
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,054
- Ka-click.
- And a pineapple.

80
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,306
- How you doing?
- Ka-click.

81
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,481
You're not wearing any pants.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,567
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

83
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,862
Ride like the wind, Buttercup!

84
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,739
Okay! Get off me.

85
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,617
You're really rippin' those curls, Ken.

86
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,161
Watch me hang ten, Babs.

87
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,413
Gin.

88
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,497
I'm okay.

89
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,128
Dinner is served.

90
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,466
I should've seen this coming.

91
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,802
The entertainment
will start in just a moment.

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,970
Hey, Buzz!

93
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,146
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:45,201
Barbie, we're almost ready for
the place where you have your first...

95
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,370
Thanks, but I got this one covered.

96
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,039
- Hey, Ken, come with me for a minute.
- Okay.

97
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,958
Woody, the beach is all set.

98
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,504
We removed the poop
from the kitty litter.

99
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,798
Spanish is so beautiful!

100
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,008
Hey, everybody, look out the window.

101
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,219
What are they doing out there?

102
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,806
It's got to be a
bazillion degrees below.

103
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,392
Good thing they wore
the 1982 Winter Weekend Collection.

104
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,111
Looks like she does
have this one covered.

105
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,237
Ka-click.

106
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,573
- How romantic!
- Yeah. Until they fall off the deck.

107
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,370
I'll get the shovel.

108
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,430
Best vacation ever.

109
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,764
Yeah.
