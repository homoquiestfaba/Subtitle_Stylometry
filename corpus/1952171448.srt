1
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:53,433
- Darrin, is that you?
- No, I left half an hour ago.

2
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,117
Hey. Hey, sleepyhead.

3
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,996
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

4
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,360
I meant to get up
and fix your breakfast.

5
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:03,919
You were sleeping soundly
and looked so beautiful...

6
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,352
...I just couldn't wake you.

7
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm not beautiful.
I'm sleepy and I look awful.

8
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,081
Not to me, you don't.
You look more beautiful every day.

9
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:13,320
- Do I really?
- Of course you do.

10
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,116
I'll try to get home early tonight.

11
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:17,679
The Hotchkisses and the Tates
are coming for dinner.

12
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:21,160
And I'm looking forward to them
seeing my beautiful wife.

13
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:22,956
I'll see you tonight.

14
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:35,876
<i>Mirror, mirror, on th</i>e <i>wall...</i>

15
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,242

16
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,082
Mother.

17
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:44,118
What do you mean, gullible?

18
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:48,317
<i>You'r</i>e <i>g</i>e<i>tting mor</i>e <i>and mor</i>e <i>human</i>

00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:50,719
- Thank you.

20
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,880
<i>... it's just path</i>e<i>tic.</i>

21
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:56,633
I may not be appealing to you, Mother,
but Darrin thinks I'm beautiful.

22
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,756
<i>Oh, h</i>e<i>'s not t</i>e<i>lling th</i>e <i>truth,</i>

23
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,879
Thank you, Mother.
You do say the nicest things.

24
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:06,759
<i>Human b</i>e<i>ings can't g</i>e<i>t along</i>

26
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,518
That's not true.

29
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,272

32
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,395
All right, Hagatha.

33
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,798
Here it is, Endora.

34
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,995
I'm so glad I had one
in stock for you.

35
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,399
These little truth gods
are hard to find.

36
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:36,323
I knew if anyone would have it
in her shop, you would.

37
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,560
Nobody seems to be
making them anymore.

38
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,715
There's a lot of handwork
goes into them.

39
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:44,394
And this new generation of witches
just doesn't have the patience.

40
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,397
Where shall I put it?

41
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,432
How powerful is it?

42
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,356
Oh, not terribly, really.

43
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,475
It is very old, you know.

44
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,278
But if a human comes
within three feet of it...

45
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,839
...he'll just have to say
what's on his mind.

46
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,036
Oh, splendid.

47
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:03,916
May I see it, Hagatha?

48
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,762
Of course.

49
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:10,999
Oh, it's a dear little thing.

50
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:15,597
Put it on the desk, Hagatha.

51
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:19,115
One more thing.

52
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,282
They do know what
they're saying, don't they?

53
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:23,678
Oh, yes.

54
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,000
And Samantha won't be
affected by it, will she?

55
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:27,922
Not at all.

56
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,762
She's still one of us, isn't she?

57
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:32,637
Oh, of course. Of course.

58
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:35,802
Now, would you like
a gift card to go with it?

59
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,915
Oh, yes.

60
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:41,403
Thank you, Hagatha.

61
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:50,559
If I'm not prying too much,
what did you put on the card?

62
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:54,439
Oh, just, "Thought you might be
interested in this. Uncle Herbert."

63
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:57,681
An uncle of Samantha's husband,
who travels around the world a lot.

64
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:01,433
I'd rather my son-in-law
didn't know it was from me.

65
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,402
Remember, if he doesn't like it...

66
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,799
...you can always exchange it
for something else.

67
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,313
Oh, thank you, Hagatha.

68
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,594
I'll call him right away,
Miss Thatcher.

69
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,524
Miss Thatcher, would you
come in here for a minute?

70
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:30,683
Yes, sir?

71
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:33,637
Miss Thatcher, how did this
package get on my desk?

72
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:36,597
Well, I don't know, sir.
I hadn't noticed it before.

73
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,557
My uncle Herbert's full of surprises.

74
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,277
You know, he always says...

75
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,718
That sure is a tight dress
you're wearing.

76
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,003
Your uncle always says that?

77
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,116
And I second the thought.

78
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:52,474
Wow, that dress looks like
it was sprayed on.

79
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:54,038
I beg your pardon?

80
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:58,362
Yes, sir. That is a tight dress,
is what that is.

81
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,879
I'm sorry if I'm wearing
something inappropriate.

82
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:04,315
Inappropriate? Oh, no.
Not at all, Miss Thatcher.

83
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,800
That's a very charming dress.
I shouldn't have been so personal.

84
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:12,796
Well, I don't mind your being personal,
Mr. Stephens.

85
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:16,476
To tell you the truth, I wore this dress
especially for you.

86
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:19,682
I hoped it would get to you.
It's two sizes too small.

87
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:24,082
I thought it would be nice for you to
notice that I was a woman just once.

88
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,763
Miss Thatcher.

89
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,562
I was just kidding.

90
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,073
Really, I don't know
what made me say that.

91
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,074
Yes. Well...

92
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:36,992
...that makes us even.

93
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,760
- I'll take that in here.
- I wish you would.

94
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Stephens' office.

95
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:46,403
Well, just a moment, Mr. Burke.
I'll see if he's in.

96
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,836
Mr. Burke wants to know if you've
done anything on his campaign.

97
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,114
I haven't done a thing.

98
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:55,441
I'd better tell him I had
the chickenpox or something.

99
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,198
Hello, Mr. Burke. How are you?

100
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,362
No, I haven't. Not a darn thing.

101
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,524
Well, no, Mr. Burke,
I haven't forgotten about you.

102
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,760
I've been snowed under
with other things.

103
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:15,196
I haven't been able to work up
any enthusiasm for your product.

104
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:22,393
Now, look, Mr. Burke, we have a lot
more important clients than you, and...

105
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,914
The same to you, buddy.

106
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,476
Sorehead.

107
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:31,678
Am I mistaken, or did you throw
an account out the window?

108
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,761
Yeah, I did, and it's about time too.

109
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,432
What's the matter with you?
An account's an account.

110
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,204
There are some that aren't worth it.
This is one of them.

111
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,395
What's more, you knew it
when you gave it to me.

112
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,003
That's very unfair, Darrin.

113
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,637
It's the truth.

114
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,243
I wanted the Hotchkiss account.

115
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,480
I know how to sell
that dishwasher of his.

116
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:51,835
And besides,
a raise should go along with it.

117
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,915
What's bugging you
this morning, Darrin?

118
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:57,763
I gave you the Burke account
because it was a challenge.

119
00:08:57,964 --> 00:08:59,443
And I want no part of it.

120
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,238
That's a miserable man,
a marginal product...

121
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:05,754
...and I have no intention
of knocking myself out.

122
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,479
And you can stop making goo-goo
eyes at the Hotchkiss account...

123
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,323
...because it's mine. All mine.

124
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,995
Right, Larry. Sure.

125
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,638
I hope you'll be in a better mood
when we come tonight...

126
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,402
...with Mr. Hotchkiss and his wife.

127
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:22,238
Yeah, I'll try to be a good boy.

128
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:26,880
Well, see you tonight at 7, Darrin.

129
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,354
I'm looking forward to it, Larry.

130
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,317
Big shot.

131
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:53,593
What did you stop me for?
What is it I've done?

132
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:56,477
You know what you did, mister.
You went through a red light.

133
00:09:56,684 --> 00:10:00,154
That light turned yellow just as I was
going through the intersection.

134
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,559
It was red all the way through.

135
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,675
It was yellow, and you know it.

136
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,317
Come on, now, tell the truth.

137
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,355
May I see your driver's li...?

138
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,714
Yeah, it was yellow, all right.

139
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:12,483
You admit it?

140
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:15,437
Yeah, you got me.

141
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,283
What did you flag me down for?

142
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:19,681
Oh, I was feeling lousy...

143
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:22,352
...and I just felt like I had to
hang one on somebody.

144
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,714
Always makes me feel better
when I get this way.

145
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,517
Do you get this way often?

146
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,636
You would too.

147
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:34,003
I've got two enemies who are trying
to destroy my natural good nature.

148
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:37,122
My sergeant by day,
and my wife by night.

149
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:38,843
Yeah, you've got it rough.

150
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,921
Keeping people from
killing one another...

151
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,922
...and all you get in return
is a nasty look for your trouble.

152
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,723
Mister, you really understand.

153
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,643
You know, you don't meet up
with your kind very often.

154
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:51,438
Well, I don't feel this way very often.

155
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:54,836
Would you mind removing yourself
from my car? I'd like to go home.

156
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,636
Okay, buddy.

157
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:10,553
But don't go through that light again,
or I'll throw the book at you.

158
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:16,952
Sam, I'm home.

159
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:20,520
- Fine, Darrin. Be down in a minute.
- Okay.

160
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,875
Hello, David.

161
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:40,961
Did you have a nice day?

162
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,839
Would you mind flying down
from your roost?

163
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,038
My, we are testy today, aren't we?

164
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,042
I don't know,
I'm just not myself today.

165
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,962
Oh, you're wrong.

166
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,519
You're very much yourself today.

167
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:57,282
What is that supposed to mean?

168
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,323
Hi there.

169
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,636
Hi, darling.

170
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:05,399
- What kind of a kiss is that?
- A cautious kiss.

171
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:07,993
- I didn't want a roller in the eye.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

172
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,718
I had to do my hair for tonight.
You don't mind, do you?

173
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,482
Sure, I do. All men do.

174
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,722
If women only realized how ridiculous
and unfeminine they look.

175
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,915
All that hardware in their hair.

176
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,115
You want me to look pretty,
don't you?

177
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,916
Well, look at it this way:

178
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,274
How would you feel
if I came down the stairs...

179
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,475
...with shaving cream
all over my face...

180
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,675
...and offered you
my forehead to kiss.

181
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:30,112
Darrin.

182
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:32,360
I wouldn't be at my
most attractive, would I?

183
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:34,714
No. And you're not right now.

184
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:38,041
I find his honesty
very refreshing, Samantha.

185
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:39,916
Well, thank you, Mom.

186
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:45,521
Well, if the sight of me is so
distressing, I'll go back upstairs.

187
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh, Sam. Sweetheart.

188
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,322
You are the one woman in the world
who can get away with it.

189
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:55,358
Even if you tried,
you couldn't be not beautiful.

190
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,078
My...

191
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,794
...that's the sweetest,
whitest little lie I ever heard.

192
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,677
All right, Mother. That'll do.

193
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:05,152
Oh, what's that?

194
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,761
Oh, it's from Uncle Herbert.
It arrived at the office today.

195
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:15,802
Hey, you should've seen the dress
my secretary was wearing today.

196
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:17,752
Boy!

197
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:21,121
Couldn't keep your eyes off her,
I suppose.

198
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:24,032
Well, it wasn't easy.

199
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,675
Of course, she can't
compare with Sam.

200
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:31,355
Miss Thatcher is...
Well, you take her out of that dress...

201
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:38,402
- Is everything set for dinner?
- Yes.

202
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,601
Oh, darling.

203
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:42,522
Don't let a thing like that
bother you.

204
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,919
You know how men are
with their secretaries.

205
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,160
Now, wait a minute!

206
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,520
Why don't you two go upstairs
and get dressed?

207
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,521
I hope you have a lovely evening.

208
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,521
- Thank you, dear.
- Don't worry about me.

209
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,955
I'll find something to eat someplace.

210
00:13:57,164 --> 00:14:00,076
- Okay, fine.
- By myself somewhere.

211
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,002
Maybe I won't bother.

212
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:05,116
When I'm alone,
I just don't have an appetite.

213
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,360
Why don't you stay
and have dinner with us?

214
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:10,443
Oh, darling. That's very nice of you.

215
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,396
Are you sure that I won't
be in the way?

216
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,880
No, no, of course not. The Tates
love seeing you, don't they, darling?

217
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:21,204
Oh, yes. Yes, they really,
certainly, really, really do.

218
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,883
Don't overdo it, dear.

219
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:26,395
- Seven o'clock, Samantha?
- Yes, 7:00.

220
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,515
Seven o'clock.

221
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,960
Well, I looked that man
straight in the eye...

222
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,724
...and I said, "Sir, give me
a chance to prove to you...

223
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,678
...that a 6-year-old boy can handle
the toughest paper route in town."

224
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,956
He did, and I did,
and that's how I got my start.

225
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:52,962
Ed, that's a wonderful,
heart-warming story.

226
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,916
- Isn't it, Darrin?
- Certainly is, Larry.

227
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,160
- Fresh drink, Mr. Hotchkiss?
- Oh, thank you.

228
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,162
- I'll have one, Darrin.
- Stephens, that's a cute wife you got.

229
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,878
Maybe she could help us write
slogans for my dishwasher.

230
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,518
I'm afraid I'm not very good
at that sort of thing.

231
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:08,192
Yes, it does take a little talent,
doesn't it?

232
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,555
That reminds me. I thought of a great
slogan for my dishwasher today.

233
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,324
- I'll let you have it for nothing.
- Great. Let's hear it.

234
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,196
Everybody ready?

235
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:21,119
- Frances.
- You're absolutely right, Ed.

236
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,838
I haven't said anything yet.

237
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,402
What was the slogan,
Mr. Hotchkiss?

238
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,960
Well, this is going to kill you.
Here's how it goes:

239
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:34,077
"Confucius say don't be wishy-washy,
buy a Hotchkiss dishy-washy."

240
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,239
- Hey, that's great, Ed.
- Hey.

241
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:44,481
Darrin, make a note of that,
and we'll discuss it at the meeting.

242
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,402
Sure. Sure, Larry.

243
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,435
Yes, sir. Yeah.

244
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:53,760
I won't have to make a note of that,
because I won't forget it.

245
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:56,762
How could I forget anything
as ridiculous as that?

246
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:01,032
What was that you said?

247
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:05,354
"Wishy-washy, dishy-washy."
You must be kidding, Ed.

248
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:10,838
Now, Darrin, you've got to admit
that it's pretty catchy.

249
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,000
- Watch yourself, Darrin.
- Don't get nervous.

250
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,798
I know Hotchkiss is a pet of yours.

251
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:18,957
That's right, buddy boy.

252
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,553
If anybody's going to laugh
at a pet client of mine...

253
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,595
...it's gonna be me.

254
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:28,636
"Confucius say." Did you ever hear
of anything this ridiculous?

255
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:32,234
I've heard better slogans
from a 10-year-old child.

256
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:37,120
Darrin, Larry,
don't tease Mr. Hotchkiss.

257
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:39,360
They always do this
with a new client.

258
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,681
It's a sort of fraternity initiation.

259
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,438
Junior high school fraternity.

260
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,159
You must lose
a lot of clients that way.

261
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:52,562
Oh, no, we only do it to clients
who have a good sense of humour.

262
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, like you, Ed.

263
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:56,717
Yeah.

264
00:16:57,164 --> 00:17:00,395
That's one thing you can say about me
without fear of contradiction.

265
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,198
- Right, Frances?
- Whatever you say, Ed.

266
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:07,363
A sense of humour has always been
an important ingredient in my success.

267
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:09,794
I've always been able
to laugh at misfortune.

268
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,996
Even during the grim days when
I was pulling myself up the ladder.

269
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:17,117
Rung by rung, I worked myself up
into the appliance business until...

270
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,882
Knock it off, Ed.

271
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:23,592
What did you say, Frances?

272
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:25,715
You didn't work your way
into the business.

273
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:27,642
You were kicked into it
by my father...

274
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:30,039
...who gave you $25,000
when we got married.

275
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:31,962
How can you say a thing like that?

276
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:33,922
It's very easy. It's the truth.

277
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:36,433
- But...
- Darrin...

278
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:38,362
...what'd you put in those drinks?

279
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:41,442
I don't know, but I'll give you odds
we never make it to dinner.

280
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:45,759
Now, Frances, take it easy.

281
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,758
Give him both barrels, honey.
You'll feel better.

282
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,273
- Louise!
- I've been clamming up for years...

283
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:54,794
...while he's been playing
"I Love Me" on his big trombone.

284
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:59,520
And don't you ever snap
your fingers at me again.

285
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:05,599
Say, why don't we all
have another drink, huh?

286
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,113
Samantha, is dinner almost ready?

287
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:10,280
Dinner may be ready,
but Frances isn't.

288
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,362
She has a few more things to say.
Haven't you, honey?

289
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,435
Plenty. But this'll do for starters.

290
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:20,241
The odds against dinner
are going up.

291
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:23,720
I'll be going up straight through
the ceiling if you don't do something.

292
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,392
Okay, honey. You know...

293
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:31,917
...a little bit of frankness can be
a very refreshing and healthy thing.

294
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,797
But a lot of frankness is a gasser.

295
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:40,158
- What's come over you?
- You interrupted me.

296
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:41,922
- Darrin!
- You never talked to me...

297
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,319
...like this in your life.
- It's time somebody did.

298
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,958
- And it's about time you listened.
- Hold on, Darrin.

299
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:49,120
- Darrin, listen.
- You stay out of this, Sam.

300
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:52,634
- I can handle this, Larry.
- I think it's time for dinner, everyone.

301
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,960
You might begin
by listening to your wife.

302
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,764
And then your advertising
representatives.

303
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,478
Keep going. Go on.
You're making lots of sense.

304
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:05,474
I've waited for years for you to stop
being that silent, suffering martyr.

305
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,834
You picked a beautiful time
to turn yourself on.

306
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:09,922
Silent martyr?

307
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,759
Now, you look here, Ed...

308
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:15,034
Now, just a minute, folks.

309
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,077
I'm not finished yet.

310
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,680
I think it's time for dinner, everyone.

311
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:21,802
Larry?

312
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:25,913
I think we ought to postpone
this little discussion until...

313
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,398
...right now.

314
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:31,233
There are ways of handling an account.
I don't think this is any of them.

315
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:33,594
Ed, we don't tell you how to
make dishwashers...

316
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:37,080
...because you make a good one.
We don't need amateurs telling us...

317
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,240
...how to conduct
your advertising campaign.

318
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:43,354
Well, let's go in, everyone. We might
as well fight this out over dinner.

319
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:46,518
Darrin, let him tell him off.
It's his account.

320
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,999
Louise, if I want your help,
I'll ask for it.

321
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,002
You leave her alone.
She's a fine, courageous woman.

322
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,320
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
where's your manners?

323
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:55,752
We're guests in this house.

324
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:59,036
- Oh, that's perfectly all right, really.
- This is my house too...

325
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:01,439
...and I give Frances permission
to say anything.

326
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,202
Go ahead, Frances.

327
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:04,962
Well, why aren't you laughing, Ed?

328
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,678
Where's that sense of humour
that carried you through...

329
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:10,193
...when you were
climbing that ladder?

330
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,598
Why don't we let it
wait until after dinner?

331
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,274
Good morning, daughter.

332
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:28,436
Good morning.

333
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:32,160
Is there anything you'd like to discuss
with your dear old Mother?

334
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,959
Like last night's disaster,
for example?

335
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:37,483
Wasn't it awful?

336
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:40,039
Well, as I said,
that's what you have to expect...

337
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:43,156
...when human beings
are forced to tell the truth.

338
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,793
- Mother.
- Isn't that right, my little friend?

339
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,962
Then Darrin's uncle Herbert
didn't send that. You did.

340
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,677
That's right.

341
00:20:58,044 --> 00:21:00,683
It's a little truth god.

342
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,556
Hi, sweetheart. Is coffee ready yet?

343
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,278
No, I haven't put it on yet.

344
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:07,162
Well, then how come...?

345
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:11,073
Darrin, before you come
any closer...

346
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:15,357
...I think you ought to know
that Mother sent that.

347
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:19,433
And any human that comes near it
has to say what's on his mind.

348
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:23,836
You see? They just can't
stand the truth, any of them.

349
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:27,832
That was a mean, low,
sneaky, underhanded trick.

350
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,602
Yes, it was.

351
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:32,238
And I'm quite pleased with myself.

352
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,799
It was at the party last night.
Mother kept it busy.

353
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,596
That's what caused all the trouble.

354
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:39,523
Oh, fine, great.
Then all I have to do is tell Larry...

355
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,318
...that we were all under the influence
of a magic statue.

356
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,082
He'll understand. Simple.

357
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:46,155
Here's your chance to explain.

358
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,161
He's coming up the walk right now.

359
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:51,282
- Have fun, children.
- Moth...

360
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:56,315
- Darling, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

361
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:06,155
Darrin, you made a fool
of yourself last night.

362
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,877
And you darn near made one of me.

363
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:10,962
Appeared to me that everyone was
doing a good job on themselves.

364
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,280
- Including you.
- Oh, good morning, Samantha.

365
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,076
- Lovely dinner.
- Lf you want some...

366
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:16,797
...it's still out in the kitchen.

367
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,314
I tell you, I stayed up
practically all night...

368
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,560
...trying to calm down
Hotchkiss and his wife.

369
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:24,277
Not to mention Louise.

370
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:26,156
Oh, I salvaged the account...

371
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:29,003
...but I do think I'm entitled
to an apology from you.

372
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,637
Well, Larry, I...

373
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:33,438
There's no reason for Darrin
to make an apology.

374
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,839
I'm afraid you'll have to
get along without one.

375
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:38,399
Maybe I can get along
without him at the office too.

376
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:41,437
- Why don't you try?
- You've got a deal.

377
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:44,313
And it's the worst deal I ever made.

378
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:47,801
I need you at the office, you know that.
I can't get along without you.

379
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:50,677
Oh, that's nice to hear,
isn't it, Darrin?

380
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:53,603
What about
Mr. And Mrs. Hotchkiss?

381
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,322
Well...

382
00:22:56,964 --> 00:23:00,036
...to tell the truth,
I wasn't up with them last night.

383
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:01,798
He called me this morning.

384
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:04,479
They continued the donnybrook
they were having...

385
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,323
...and cleared up a lot
of old misunderstandings.

386
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:10,715
- They're happy as larks.
- Oh, how sweet.

387
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:12,642
Did they say anything about Darrin?

388
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:16,154
As a matter of fact, he did. He said
Darrin was right about the slogan...

389
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:19,003
...and that we know more
about advertising than he does.

390
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,599
He thinks Darrin's a great guy.

391
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,442
Well, that's fine, Larry.

392
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:29,277
- You'll be down at the office later?
- Of course I will, Larry. I'll be there...

393
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:30,997
...as soon as I get a raise...

394
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,764
...and full responsibility
for the Hotchkiss account.

395
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,522
What?

396
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,515
You drive a hard bargain, Darrin.

397
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:41,792
But okay.

398
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:44,400
See you at the office.

399
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,917
Thank you, sweetheart.

400
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:59,194
Where's the statue?

401
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,595
Right here, Mother.

402
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:03,032
And you were wrong.

403
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:05,519
Nothing but good seems
to have come from the truth.

404
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,680
Well, you can't win them all.

405
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:10,318
Anything you'd like to say, dear?

406
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:12,992
Darling, you're beautiful,
sweet, charming, adorable...

407
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,523
...and I love you madly.

408
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,794
There, you hear that?
And that's the truth.

409
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,279
But your mother is an
irritating, meddling...

410
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,122
- Darrin.
- I'm not finished yet.

411
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:25,397
- I'm going to say a lot more.
- Oh, no, you're not.

412
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:30,392
As I was saying...

413
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,722
...your mother is an irritating,
meddling, nasty...

414
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,483
Well, I guess I told her.

415
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,112
Guess you did.

416
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:47,480
