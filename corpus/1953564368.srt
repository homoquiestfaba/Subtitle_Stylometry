1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,594
Also in the news, at
the California-Nevada border...

2
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:32,366
the grisly discovery
of 19-year-old Danny Phillips...

3
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,067
found dismembered
this morning...

4
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,938
in the trunk
of an abandoned car...

5
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,342
some seventeen miles south
of Lake Tahoe...

6
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:39,504
where police say...

7
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,242
they are withholding
certain grisly details.

8
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:43,544
The big news, of course...

9
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,073
is still that robbery
out of Las Vegas...

10
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,679
where police report an estimated
one million dollars in cash...

11
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:50,553
was stolen from a casino there.

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,114
The money
was reported missing...

13
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,389
approximately 2:00 a.m.
yesterday morning...

14
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:55,554
along with a small briefcase...

15
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,063
- Excuse me:
- It was being transported in.

16
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,224
Excuse me:

17
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,858
Alberto Bertoli,
owner of the casino...

18
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,529
Looking for a hank belt.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,197
There an interstate around here?

20
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:08,264
Sixty miles. You'll see it
when you get there.

21
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,276
...just picked it up
and walked away.

22
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,404
Where the hell am l, anyway?

23
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:14,709
On Capitol Hill...

24
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:17,649
the president's health bill
came under attack again.

25
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:20,585
White House sources say
the heat will continue...

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,316
until a referendum
can be reached.

27
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:53,258
Excuse me.

28
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,529
What's going on?

29
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,870
What'd you say?

30
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,307
What's the trouble?

31
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,277
Me and my wife
was driving along...

32
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,109
and we came across
that Chrysler over there.

33
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,048
So, what's the fuss?

34
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,745
Let the sheriff tell him
if he wants to, Manny.

35
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,947
You shouldn't be saying
anything.

36
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,785
Mr. Winneman...

37
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,223
what we'd like you to do is have
you go with Trooper Lee...

38
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,693
down to the station
and give us a statement.

39
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,696
Then we can send you
on your way.

40
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,097
OK.

41
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,235
Where you coming from?

42
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:35,036
Traveling through to San Diego.

43
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,406
From where?

44
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,933
Carson City.

45
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:41,208
Well, I got a strong
piece of advice for you.

46
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,340
Keep going, straight through.

47
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,476
At least until
you get to the interstate.

48
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,850
Don't stop to make
any new friends.

49
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,115
How's that?

50
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,756
We got a homicide
in the trunk of that car.

51
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,556
You don't even want
to think about it.

52
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,028
Yeah.

53
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,402
** Who's that I hear **

54
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,409
** Whisperin' in my ear? **

55
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,945
** Sugar, look who's here **

56
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,976
** Your old loverboy **

57
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,656
** Who's that I see **

58
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,595
** Sneakin' up on me? **

59
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,100
** Sweet misery **

60
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:46,299
** My old loverboy **

61
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,833
** If you knew him like I do **

62
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:55,541
** You wouldn't look at him
twice **

63
00:08:55,582 --> 00:09:00,246
** Heartbreaker by nature **

64
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:05,519
** A warm embrace,
but a heart of ice **

65
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,756
** So, that is why **

66
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,064
** Just pass on by **

67
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:19,132
** That devil smile **

68
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:23,632
** Of my old loverboy **

69
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:33,584
** Don't be a part **

70
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,182
** Of his trail
of broken hearts **

71
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,716
** Stop before you start **

72
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:46,357
** With my old loverboy **

73
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:51,767
** My old loverboy **

74
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:55,968
** My old loverboy **

75
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:56,998
** Oh, boy **

76
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,309
Thank you.

77
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,819
Pardon me.

78
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:25,291
Oh, God.

79
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,631
You're not too neighborly,
are you?

80
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,006
I said...

81
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,446
you're not too neighborly,
are you?

82
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,813
I beg your pardon?

83
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:52,789
You got a kink about watching
people fry in the desert?

84
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,952
Hey, look...

85
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:57,360
I didn't see you out there,
and when I did, it was too late.

86
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:00,992
I'm sorry. How the hell
did you get out there, anyway?

87
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,866
Look, let me buy you lunch.

88
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:10,774
I mean it.
It's the least I can do.

89
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,953
I look like a goddamn used tire.

90
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,634
It's on me,
so have whatever you want.

91
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:49,506
I don't know your name.

92
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:53,610
Adrian... your friend for life.

93
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,353
How the hell did you get dumped
in the middle of nowhere?

94
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:07,094
A fella in a big rig picked me
up about where you passed me.

95
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:11,570
But he got a little too devoted,
you know what I mean?

96
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,333
So, you got out?

97
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:18,033
Looks that way.

98
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,046
You a fag?

99
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,554
I don't mean any offense
if you are.

100
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,388
I mean,
if it weren't for homos...

101
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,257
none of us fellas
would ever get a ride.

102
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,353
I've thumbed enough miles
to know that.

103
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,125
Is that right?

104
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,461
Yeah.

105
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,301
A fella in a fancy suit
must have a name.

106
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,638
Jack.

107
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,274
You know, Jack, I can usually
tell in about two minutes...

108
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,011
all I need to know
about a person.

109
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,178
Like what?

110
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,317
Like, is he a loser?
Does he shoot dope?

111
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,293
Does he like to wear
ladies' underwear?

112
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,319
Are you telling me
you're a psychic...

113
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,764
or that you like to look
at people's pants?

114
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,790
You're a funny guy, Jack.

115
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:21,169
Here you go. Coffee, iced tea.

116
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,504
Do me a favor, would you?

117
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,373
If one of you boys
stole that million dollars...

118
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,207
leave me a big, fat tip,
all right?

119
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,610
What million dollars is that?

120
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,115
That case of money
from the Vegas casino.

121
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,377
He could be passing
right through here.

122
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,112
Is that right?

123
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,848
Deputy says so.

124
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:38,049
Says if he's smart,
he's headed for the airport...

125
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,819
with his head on a swivel.

126
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,053
A swivel? Why is that?

127
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,185
Got away
with all that mob money.

128
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,661
Ooh.

129
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:47,325
Not much a person wouldn't do
for a million dollars, huh?

130
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,492
I wouldn't know...

131
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,968
but I'd like to hear
more from you about that.

132
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,364
You ready to order?

133
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:54,805
What do you think about that,
Jack?

134
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,243
Hear what, uh, Patsy here says
she'd do for a million dollars.

135
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,473
Anything.

136
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,448
I didn't say that.

137
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:08,245
Did... did I misunderstand
what's being said, Jack?

138
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,515
You ready to order,
you let me know.

139
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,080
I love a woman
who can take orders.

140
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:17,260
You know what? I could have
your ass thrown out of here.

141
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:21,756
Jingle bells, anything you want
to do on my ass is fine with me.

142
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,069
Aw, come on, now, jingle bells.

143
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,235
What are you doing?

144
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,876
You got a problem with
the way I handle myself, Jack?

145
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,078
No. I just want to know what
the hell you think you're doing.

146
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:41,416
You got something
to be nervous about?

147
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:46,248
I just like to lay
all my cards on the table.

148
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,385
I told you once, Jack.

149
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,759
I can tell about people.

150
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:55,692
Now, what you got in there, huh?

151
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,202
Papers from the front office?

152
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,965
Executive memos...

153
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,565
you're Ioyally carrying
across the state line?

154
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,537
I don't think so.

155
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,915
Now...

156
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:16,083
you just sit tight a minute
while I go right a wrong.

157
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,391
...warn that the killing is
extremely similar in design...

158
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,596
to the discovery
of a ninteen-year-old male...

159
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:41,128
found dismembered yesterday
south of the state line.

160
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,437
Officials are not willing yet
to comment...

161
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,910
on the possibility
of serial killings.

162
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,606
Speaking of the state line...

163
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,637
the theft of what is now
estimated to be...

164
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,707
close to one and a quarter
million dollars in cash...

165
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,549
from the Pot O' Gold Casino
in Las Vegas...

166
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,214
continues to make headlines.

167
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,382
Reports confirm
the money was in a briefcase...

168
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:01,154
that was left momentarily un...

169
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,764
Join the picnic, sir.

170
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,497
You're kidding me.

171
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,062
Tanker jackknifed
five miles up the interstate.

172
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,506
The junction is closed off
for clean up.

173
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,409
What is it, for criminy's sake,
plutonium?

174
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,179
It's going to be a while.
There's a chemical spill.

175
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,705
You know what's behind you.

176
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,684
There's food and lodging
in Watson.

177
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,584
I just came from there, yeah.

178
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,145
That's all you got
within fifty miles...

179
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,750
or you can join the block party.

180
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,266
Hey, hey, hey: Hey:

181
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,411
I'm in the armpit of the world.

182
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,746
What am I supposed
to sound like?

183
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,217
It's a hundred degrees...

184
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:36,244
and I've been driving
in circles for two days.

185
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,587
I am tense, for criminy's sake.

186
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,355
What do you think
old craphead is going to say...

187
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:45,124
when I don't show up
for that meeting?

188
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,156
Well, he is a craphead, Mommy.

189
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,192
You think he needs another
reason to look the other way...

190
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,728
when the regional manager job
comes up?

191
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:57,003
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

192
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,603
Look, I might still stop
at the cabin.

193
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:04,104
I don't know. I don't know.

194
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,276
All right? L... I'm really tired.

195
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:10,277
I want to lay down. Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:58,999
Uhh...

197
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:43,146
Hey, man, I wouldn't stay here.
Check that shit out.

198
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,372
God.

199
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:38,388
Jack?

200
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,088
This a bad time, Jack?

201
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,534
I brought you something.

202
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:01,306
What?

203
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,246
Jack.

204
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:06,274
I figured you'd be long gone
by now.

205
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:10,414
Must've lost your appetite
in a big hurry, huh?

206
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:14,091
I'd hate to think
it's because...

207
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,160
you didn't like me, Jack.

208
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:20,788
I mean, you can see...

209
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,769
what an unfriendly place
the world can be.

210
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:25,929
What are you doing?

211
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,166
Tch.
I got no place to sleep, Jack.

212
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,641
You're crazy.

213
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:34,045
I'll tell on you, Jack.

214
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,112
I'll tell everybody
what you got in that briefcase.

215
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:48,653
Don't worry.

216
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:53,222
I'm a man
with a secret or two myself.

217
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,579
Like I said...

218
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:11,048
I brought you something.

219
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,649
Is that front door locked, Jack?

220
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:28,431
Deadbolt, too.

221
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,273
Hey, you don't have to leave.

222
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,245
Keep me company.

223
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,083
What the hell is that?

224
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:54,115
It goes by many names.

225
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,721
That stuff is disgusting.

226
00:26:58,764 --> 00:26:59,856
You put enough of that in you...

227
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,867
and you're going
to goddamn fall apart.

228
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:06,132
You know all about it,
don't you, Jack?

229
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,270
Yeah, people scream evil
like a motherfucker...

230
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,778
unless it's their own...

231
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:16,474
then it's cool.

232
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,244
Do you know
what they would do...

233
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,547
if they found you in here
with that?

234
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:24,783
I would lose everything...
my house, my car, my job.

235
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,484
Your briefcase.

236
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,590
You know, Jack...

237
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,827
there are two places
they send people...

238
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,561
for having too good a time...

239
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:41,561
one is church,
the other's prison.

240
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:44,234
I've done time in both, Jack.

241
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:52,015
Enough time
to know true boredom.

242
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,952
And boredom is its own kind
of misery, now, isn't it, Jack?

243
00:27:55,988 --> 00:28:00,254
And boredom is why
we look for that thrill.

244
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:04,956
And when we find it, we take it.

245
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:13,765
And while we're wondering...

246
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,569
whether to piss on ourselves
or laugh...

247
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,568
Ohh...

248
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,782
Ohh. We're getting off.

249
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,819
Hey, Jack...

250
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:32,915
I read you.

251
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,115
I read you, man.

252
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,924
Repression is a dangerous thing.

253
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:47,931
It's deadly.

254
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,318
Ohh...

255
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,090
God.

256
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:57,605
God.

257
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:04,438
Yes. Yes.

258
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,831
Car trouble?

259
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:58,825
Tch. Try it again, Jack.

260
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,274
Sounds bad, Jack.

261
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,342
OK, try it again.

262
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:25,129
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

263
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:27,028
Ooh.

264
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,868
Tch.

265
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:34,303
How long since
you had your plugs cleaned?

266
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:41,405
How long since you had plugs?

267
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:46,114
You don't get it, do you, Jack?

268
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,915
I got your license number...

269
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:52,685
and I got the best damned
eyewitness description...

270
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:55,352
of you on this highway.

271
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:58,954
So, the first time I see...

272
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:02,330
these taillights
taking off down the road...

273
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:05,530
priority one, Jackie boy...

274
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,405
is an anonymous call
to the nearest state trooper.

275
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,409
You don't think I'd do it?

276
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:16,107
Try me.

277
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,612
Get out of the goddamn car.

278
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,348
** Feel so down **

279
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:31,014
** I said you're driving
much too fast **

280
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,887
** Living in this town **

281
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:37,520
** Has made you
so heavy on the gas **

282
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:40,326
** Just be calm, you said **

283
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,595
** I always... **

284
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,962
You a married man, Jack?

285
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,639
Come on, man.

286
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,977
I'll show you mine,
you show me yours.

287
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,449
I got a family
like everybody else.

288
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:06,821
You know...

289
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:12,592
I bet nothing you do
is like everybody else, Jack.

290
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,197
What line of work you in?

291
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:21,262
I sell paper products.

292
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:25,833
What, like, plates?
Paper plates?

293
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:28,277
Straws and shit?

294
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,309
Huh.

295
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:38,616
What's a fella in paper products
take home, anyway?

296
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,621
I'm not going to say to you.

297
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,427
Careful, now.

298
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:53,301
Don't bust your ass climbing up
to that higher moral ground.

299
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,307
What do you think I am, Jack?

300
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,172
The devil?

301
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,005
What are you, anyway?

302
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:04,947
Just some angel who got a little
tarnished around the wings?

303
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:13,756
Uhh.

304
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,062
No, no, no, honey. I'm not
trying to sound mysterious.

305
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:27,834
I'm just still in the middle
of gosh darn nowhere.

306
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,433
Yep. Yep.
I've done nothing this time out.

307
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,909
No.

308
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:35,913
Uh, my credit card's
over the limit.

309
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:39,075
That's right.
I'm selling nothing.

310
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:42,177
E-mail is putting us right
out of business, floppy disk.

311
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,518
It's... it's just
driving me crazy, too.

312
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,285
Well, I...

313
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:47,951
Yeah, well, yeah.

314
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:51,018
About those sprinklers, you
know, you just put on the water.

315
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,825
Go out back there
until I come home.

316
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,389
I'll figure it all out
with you, OK?

317
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:09,273
There a problem?

318
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:11,976
- This your car?
- Nah.

319
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:15,577
- Then it's not your problem.
- Uh-huh.

320
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:19,754
Yep.

321
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,342
Massachusetts.

322
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,645
Yeah. Just... we left Boston
three weeks ago.

323
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,344
Boston.

324
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:48,511
Yeah, I got to go to Brazil...

325
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,418
to check out the rain forests
before they cut it all down.

326
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:52,082
That's my girlfriend Dahlia.

327
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:55,456
Hi. Excuse me.
I'm going to bust.

328
00:36:57,028 --> 00:37:00,156
Hi. I'm Adrian.
My friends call me Dusty.

329
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:02,359
Dusty,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

330
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,891
Wait, wait.
Hold on a sec. Hold on.

331
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,700
You got a water hose
you needs to replace.

332
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,435
That's a brand-new company car.

333
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,170
You're the boss.

334
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,737
I got to hang up.
I've got to go, honey. Bye.

335
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,715
Hey, you been keeping
your ear to the radio?

336
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,843
There's some kind of a nut
running around...

337
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:23,683
cutting people up
in itsy bitsy pieces.

338
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:25,552
You heard about it?

339
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,559
What are you telling me?

340
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:31,153
Where'd you find that thing?

341
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:33,755
According to the radio,
this ain't the best time...

342
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:35,527
to be filling out
your dance card...

343
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:36,829
if you know
what I'm talking about.

344
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,536
I just had those hoses replaced.

345
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,542
Just telling you what I heard.

346
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,943
Now, you want
that hose or not?

347
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,776
No.

348
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:55,182
Jackie boy. Now, here's some
people who know how to travel.

349
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:58,416
This is Gerald
and his very fine lady Dahlia.

350
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:00,981
They're out seeing this country
the only way there is to see it.

351
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,823
- This is Jack the man.
- We have to go.

352
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:04,987
What?

353
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,519
We're late.
We got to make up for lost time.

354
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:07,792
Hey, Jack,
what are you talking about?

355
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:09,527
I thought maybe we could get
something to eat with them.

356
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,331
I mean, you are a little
hungry, aren't you, Jack?

357
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,203
No. What's it come to?

358
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,542
41.70.

359
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,771
We're not that late, Jack.

360
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:23,303
- We're not that late, Jack.
- Keep the change.

361
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,576
Jack...

362
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,117
- Catch you later.
- All right.

363
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,211
- Yeah. Nice to see you.
- See you later, Dusty.

364
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,380
- She's a cutie pie.
- Yeah, yeah.

365
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,219
Yeah. Ahem.

366
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:52,909
- Honey?
- Yeah.

367
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:55,538
- You think they're lovers?
- No, baby.

368
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,842
Ha ha ha:

369
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,849
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,887
Talk to me, Jack.

371
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:19,831
We don't look right together,
get it?

372
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:20,997
What?

373
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,234
Everyone
within a hundred miles...

374
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:26,869
knows about the Hatchet Man
and the goddamn money.

375
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,037
Do you understand?

376
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,273
What'd that guy
say to you back there?

377
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:32,111
What, do you think
I'm some dumb ass old man...

378
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,314
that you can drag around
on your psycho circle jerk?

379
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:39,517
Jack, I was looking to do
a little business, all right?

380
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:41,684
Gerald and Dahlia
got a traveling pharmacy...

381
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,557
in that old van,
and I want some.

382
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,530
Yeah? That's too bad, because
if you want to go with me...

383
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:50,728
you might as well throw
that syringe out the window.

384
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:54,135
My rig
don't fly out the window, Jack.

385
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:56,197
Get out of my car.

386
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:59,467
Don't hurt my feelings, Jack.

387
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,038
Get out of my car:
Get out: Get out:

388
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:07,609
Get out:
Get out, God damn it: Get out:

389
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,922
You feel better now, Jack?

390
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:25,495
If we're going to do this,
we're going to do this my way.

391
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:28,937
- You get that?
- I got it.

392
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:38,546
Drive on, Jackie boy.

393
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,676
Shut up. Don't talk.

394
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,512
Ahh.

395
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,610
- You got parts?
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,981
Some.

397
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,725
Yep.
Looks like your water hose.

398
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,920
Yeah.

399
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:27,454
- Come on back.
- OK.

400
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:38,570
Harliss:
We got people coming in:

401
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:40,304
My husband.

402
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,815
That's Woolly, our tarantula.

403
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,456
He poisonous?

404
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,118
Not one bit. They just look it.

405
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:39,598
Ooh, sweet Jesus.

406
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,400
This is Victor, our boa.

407
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,999
He's a big old boa.

408
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,804
Yow.

409
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:49,506
Wow. What about this fella?

410
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:52,675
That's our gila... gila monster.

411
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:56,676
- He poisonous?
- Well, yeah.

412
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:02,492
Digestive tract is so slow
the waste backs up inside them.

413
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,756
Makes their venom toxic.

414
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,495
So, what are you
telling me there, Harliss...

415
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,899
he's so full of shit
he's poisonous?

416
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:15,838
Sinks his teeth into you,
they don't let go.

417
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:17,932
They're like vice grips.

418
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,272
That's just to make sure...

419
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,504
their venom
gets into your bloodstream.

420
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,588
Here. Keep the change.

421
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:33,283
Thanks.

422
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:45,896
Miss me?

423
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:53,943
Come on, Jack.

424
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:57,277
Let's head on down
that long Ionesome highway.

425
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:09,817
Hey, Jack...

426
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,624
you ever hear the phrase
"dead man walking"?

427
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:15,257
They use it in prison.
You know what it means?

428
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,602
On death row...

429
00:44:18,636 --> 00:44:21,104
whenever any of the boys
get escorted anywhere...

430
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:24,232
the guards all yell,
"Dead man walking:"

431
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:27,244
Every gun in the joint
gets cocked... chunk-chunk...

432
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:28,745
everyone stops
what they're doing...

433
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:31,680
they grab a piece of the wall,
and they let the man pass.

434
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,843
You know why?

435
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:38,679
'Cause he could
slit your throat...

436
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:41,351
and all they could do
is shoot him.

437
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:45,328
And so what? He's already dead.

438
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,729
Well, that's me, Jack.

439
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:51,064
That's how I feel all the time.

440
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,531
Oh, yeah. This is for you.

441
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,475
It's a souvenir...

442
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:01,000
from the Creepy Crawly Zoo.

443
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:08,977
You gotta respect
who I am, Jack...

444
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,615
what I bring
to this little relationship.

445
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:15,784
See, I'm crazy, Jack.

446
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:19,489
I am the dead man walking.

447
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,498
You're an idiot.

448
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:24,228
You sound spooked there, Jack.

449
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:27,130
Doesn't Jack sound spooked?

450
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,565
Get rid of it.

451
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:34,066
You are not seeing
my position here.

452
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,341
Now, speed up.
You're slowing down.

453
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,211
I said speed up, Jack.

454
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,342
Jack, give it the gas.

455
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,161
Uhh:

456
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,075
I want you to know, Jack...

457
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:11,543
I am one dangerous,
crazy motherfucker.

458
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,279
Ohh:

459
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:18,721
Uhh.

460
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:21,247
I want to know
you respect me, Jack.

461
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,782
That's all.

462
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:32,595
Oh.

463
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:36,929
OK, Jack?

464
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:43,146
OK... Jack?

465
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:46,075
Huh.

466
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:56,552
You've got to go...

467
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:00,086
and I don't want to see you
around here again.

468
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,699
Don't play me, Jack.

469
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:14,643
You know what I am,
and I know what you are.

470
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:17,613
That ain't never gonna change.

471
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:20,412
Now get us out of here
before you kill the both of us.

472
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:24,047
Ha ha ha ha:

473
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,490
Let's go, Jack.

474
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,803
Ahh.

475
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,520
Hey...

476
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:36,389
I'm tired.

477
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:38,793
I want to eat, then go to sleep.

478
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:41,798
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Jack, get with the program.

479
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:44,824
And tonight, the program is fun.

480
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:51,597
Oh, man.
Jackie boy, look at that.

481
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:54,236
Fun, fun, fun tonight.

482
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:56,007
- No.
- What?

483
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:57,843
You can't.
We've already been seen...

484
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:59,815
with them a bit
too much already.

485
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,647
Jack, there ain't even
a prairie dog awake out here.

486
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,245
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm getting back in the car.

487
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:06,449
Why are you trying so hard
to convince yourself...

488
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,584
that you're having
such a bad time?

489
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:14,792
Listen, I don't care at all
what you do with those people.

490
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:16,299
Jack...

491
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:22,232
Ahem.

492
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,343
Don't do it, Adrian.

493
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,369
Please don't do this.

494
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,108
Please don't do this.

495
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,117
We're partying, Jack.
You got that?

496
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:36,278
Mm. We're partying.

497
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:45,928
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:52,031
So, the thing is, I drop.

499
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:55,004
I mean, I crash to the floor
like a heap, right?

500
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,200
I still got the goddamn needle
stuck in my arm...

501
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:59,801
but the thing is... the topper...

502
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:02,573
I am dead.

503
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:04,672
I'm talkin' really dead.

504
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,347
They're taking my pulse,
but nothing's there.

505
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:14,153
They call an ambulance,
and two paramedics later...

506
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,682
I am on my way
to the county hospital...

507
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:19,025
to get a tag on my toe...

508
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:20,997
when I sit up...

509
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,090
and ask for a Snickers bar.

510
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:27,126
- No: Ha ha:
- Oh, get out: Ha ha:

511
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,469
Get out: Ha ha ha ha:

512
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:32,304
Yeah, I'm telling you.
See, I had done so much shit...

513
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,334
I shocked my system so badly...

514
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:38,041
that my vital signs,
they dropped to nothing...

515
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,346
put me in a coma.

516
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:47,019
Now, what makes you want
to go to the edge like that?

517
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:49,617
Oh, I thought you knew,
baby doll.

518
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,025
The edge...

519
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:54,526
is where it's at.

520
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:02,563
So, how much of, uh...
this and that other...

521
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:05,200
have you got, exactly?

522
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:10,644
How much we got's a lot.

523
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,248
You traveling
with that kind of money?

524
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:16,809
Might be.

525
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:18,549
What about your partner?

526
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:20,580
What about him?

527
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:23,525
He makes me nervous.

528
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,028
Nah, don't worry about Jack.

529
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:28,395
He's just strange.

530
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:30,764
I'm gonna go for a walk.

531
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,979
She likes you, man.

532
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,549
What are you tellin' me,
Brother Gerry?

533
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:58,720
I'm sayin' that, uh...

534
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:02,095
Dahlia...
she's her own woman, you know?

535
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,394
She, uh...

536
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:07,797
she does what she wants.

537
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:10,398
And you got nothing to say
about it?

538
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:13,035
Uh-uh.
We don't do that, you know?

539
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,276
So...

540
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,645
what do youse do?

541
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:24,553
You want to go to the edge
with Dahlia?

542
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:27,352
Then you got to do it her way.

543
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:32,154
And, uh, what way is that?

544
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:35,891
It's the more, the merrier,
you know?

545
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:48,239
I don't like Gerald doing it,
either.

546
00:52:49,379 --> 00:52:51,540
Really.

547
00:52:51,582 --> 00:52:55,074
Not the heroin, I mean.

548
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,718
It's just a high
he can't reach anymore.

549
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:02,088
Then why let him try?

550
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:06,691
I don't know.

551
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:10,358
I don't tell him what to do.

552
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:20,740
You have a purple aura.

553
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:24,313
It's purple and yellow.

554
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:26,509
l... I can see it change.

555
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,644
That's the conflict.

556
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,847
I'm not joking.

557
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:38,150
There's...
some kind of terrible trouble.

558
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:47,096
Well, that's how Gerald and I
decided that we were family...

559
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,765
'cause we both had
the same aura.

560
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:51,797
You don't know what a family is.

561
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,969
How could you do the things
you do and be a family?

562
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,876
Heh. I don't know what you mean.

563
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:57,904
I mean, get away from me.

564
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:01,543
You take Gerald,
and you get the hell away.

565
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,756
Fuck. Whew.

566
00:54:14,264 --> 00:54:16,824
Gerry? Gerry?

567
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:19,392
We're leaving.

568
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:21,802
We're leaving right now.

569
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:23,669
Get me out of here.

570
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,174
Come here.

571
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,108
We are so.

572
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,037
What do you think you're doing?

573
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,606
What do you think
you are doing, Jack?

574
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,619
I'm dead.
I'm going back to the motel.

575
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,746
Bullshit.
You tried to scare her.

576
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:41,849
You're trying to scare them
both away, you asshole.

577
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:44,884
- This is it, Adrian.
- This is what, Jack?

578
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,862
- We're done.
- We're not done.

579
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:48,387
We're just starting.

580
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:54,870
You think this is coincidence,
our paths crossing like this?

581
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:58,807
We attracted each other.
We were like magnets, Jack.

582
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:01,037
The two of us
colliding in time...

583
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,376
bound together
by our little secrets.

584
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:05,438
You think this is coincidence?

585
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,418
I'm going back to my motel room.

586
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,115
I want you to come with me.

587
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:14,953
I think you're a liar, Jack.

588
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:17,153
I think you want to party.

589
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:20,322
You're just afraid
you might like it.

590
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,760
You be careful now.

591
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:33,639
You be real careful
this is what you want to do.

592
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,009
Adrian, listen to me.

593
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:38,071
Let's just get out of here now.

594
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:41,016
You think you can take me, Jack?

595
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,281
- Come on with it.
- This is wrong.

596
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,686
You want to get bloody with me,
Jack?

597
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,952
- Come on with it.
- This is a mistake.

598
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:51,654
You made the mistake.

599
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,323
Putting your hands on me
like that was a mistake.

600
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:56,355
You think you know
right from wrong?

601
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,561
You think you know what that is?

602
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,467
You got as much right
to moralize...

603
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:03,098
as Jack the fucking Ripper.

604
00:56:15,552 --> 00:56:16,883
Adrian.

605
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,824
- Get in the van:
- What?

606
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:31,356
- Now:
- Adrian:

607
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:34,234
- Oh, my God:
- Get in the van:

608
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,135
Now:

609
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:43,704
Adrian:

610
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:45,408
Shh.

611
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,508
It's OK, it's OK.

612
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:50,076
It's OK.

613
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,678
Adrian.

614
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:54,122
Go back to the motel, Jack.

615
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,327
We have to talk.

616
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,331
Go away, Jack.
You're scaring these kids.

617
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:09,065
I want you to come with me.

618
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:12,707
Adrian.

619
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:16,445
Catch up with you later, Jack.

620
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:19,582
Adrian, don't do this.

621
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,082
Adrian.

622
00:57:32,162 --> 00:57:33,254
We need to talk:

623
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:36,595
No, we don't.

624
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:44,897
Mmm.

625
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,084
Adrian.

626
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,398
Decided to join the party,
Jackie boy?

627
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:17,233
Close the door, Gerry.

628
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:26,574
Close it and lock it.

629
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:54,600
Jack.

630
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:00,615
Aw, Jack.

631
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:05,048
Ahh.

632
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:10,053
Tch. It was beautiful.

633
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:18,895
I thought about you, Jack.

634
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:20,562
Could you feel it?

635
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:27,743
Jack...

636
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:33,740
Christ almighty.

637
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:35,944
Mmm.

638
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,248
What you trying to do
to yourself?

639
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:44,251
I'm going to take a shower,
so we can get out of here.

640
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,032
You're right, you know.

641
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:55,265
We should not hang around.

642
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:01,342
Hey, Jackie boy, why...

643
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,348
why don't you go to the van?

644
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,111
Huh?

645
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:13,615
You know you want to.

646
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:34,469
You OK, little buddy?

647
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:57,189
What the hell is this?

648
01:01:57,227 --> 01:02:00,822
We can't just keep
wandering down the highway.

649
01:02:02,098 --> 01:02:05,295
They find that van, and they're
going to come looking for us.

650
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:08,463
Aw, bullshit, Jack. Nobody
saw us with them last night.

651
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:11,167
I don't know that they didn't,
either.

652
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:14,005
You got a death wish?
Maybe you do. I don't know.

653
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:15,773
I have no intention
of being questioned...

654
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,575
at some police checkpoint.

655
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:20,344
You want to, go ahead.

656
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:34,394
This your place?

657
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:36,126
Inherited it.

658
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,134
Wanted to sell it.

659
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:42,298
Then Carol and I stayed out
here, fell in love with it.

660
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:47,633
There's a kitchen, bedrooms...

661
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:51,042
bathroom.

662
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,810
Our own little fortress.

663
01:02:57,387 --> 01:02:58,854
What, is this it?

664
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:01,789
That's all we'll need.
To get into trouble out here...

665
01:03:01,825 --> 01:03:05,283
you have to come screaming
and begging for it.

666
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:06,693
You were already coming here...

667
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:10,059
weren't you, Jack?

668
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,864
Even before I showed up.

669
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:15,502
I'm going
to turn the water on...

670
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:16,937
and light the pilot
for the heater.

671
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:18,964
You turn the radio on.

672
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:30,115
Dealer takes one.

673
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,794
Ahem.

674
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:47,464
Ahem.

675
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,674
I'm in for two thousand more...

676
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:56,804
and I'll raise you...

677
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:00,142
ten thousand.

678
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,086
OK. Here's the two.

679
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,652
Ten...

680
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:13,924
and I raise you twenty.

681
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:24,899
I'll see your twenty...

682
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:27,637
and I'll raise you...

683
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:29,008
Unh.

684
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,275
Fifteen.

685
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:40,120
You really are dumb, aren't you?

686
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:44,292
Well, we'll just have
to see now, won't we?

687
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,130
Your call.

688
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,832
Flush, Jack.

689
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:00,205
Ow.

690
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:04,638
Pair of deuces... oops...

691
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:08,082
and we three kings.

692
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,379
You piece of dog shit.

693
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,023
You're right.

694
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:22,759
I really should've run into you
a long time ago.

695
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,359
Ah-um. Ahem.

696
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:28,427
You wouldn't be cheating,
now, would you, Jack?

697
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:32,101
That's
a hundred thousand dollars.

698
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,134
And you have lost...

699
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,976
a quarter of a million dollars.

700
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,448
Now, how are you going
to pay that back?

701
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:45,279
Life's a bitch,
and then there's you, huh, Jack?

702
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:49,887
Get that shit away from me.

703
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:56,793
Time to dip into the Gerald
and Dahlia memorial drug fund.

704
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:02,470
Oh, you're just
a slow-motion suicide.

705
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:04,132
Ahem.

706
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:05,299
If you want to kill yourself...

707
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,808
why don't you
just get it over with...

708
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:09,277
instead of waiting
for somebody else to do it?

709
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:13,748
You think I don't know
how I got here, Jack?

710
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:17,378
Well, you don't look
like a junkie.

711
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:21,013
Then what do I look like,
Jack...

712
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:23,025
Mr. Everything Comes Easy...

713
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:24,720
Mr. Football Star...

714
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:28,322
Mr. Class President?

715
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,765
You could look like a prince
and still be white trash.

716
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,462
You make me sick.

717
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,769
You got a problem with me, Jack?

718
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:41,606
You got the problem, kiddo.

719
01:06:44,747 --> 01:06:46,840
Have another drink, Jack.

720
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:51,643
How many CCs of that nitro
you do every day anyway, huh?

721
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:54,282
A hundred? Two hundred?

722
01:06:54,324 --> 01:06:55,951
Shit.

723
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,458
You think I'm the stupid one,
Jack?

724
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:00,621
Put that needle in your arm.

725
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:02,961
I don't think you know
a goddamn thing.

726
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,699
I've lived in places
you wouldn't shit in, Jack.

727
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:10,770
I've done time with men...

728
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:13,002
who'd off themselves
and the whole world with them...

729
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,873
like they're doing
everybody a favor.

730
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:18,506
And you know what I know, Jack?
What I know from that?

731
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:20,038
Man is just a thing.

732
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,951
He eats, he sleeps, he fucks.

733
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:26,352
And all the rest
is just passing time.

734
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:28,357
Now, how much
of those things he does...

735
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:31,224
depends on how big
that hole is inside him.

736
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,718
You know the hole
I'm talking about, Jack?

737
01:07:34,764 --> 01:07:35,856
That one.

738
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,297
It rips open inside everyone...

739
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,824
when they suck in
their first screaming breath.

740
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:42,599
It's why babies scream, Jack.

741
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:45,129
We think
it's a demon inside us...

742
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:48,075
the great white whale,
the prince of darkness...

743
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:49,772
but it's not, Jack.

744
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:52,144
It's just a big empty hole.

745
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:55,344
And I see men try
to fill it with women...

746
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:57,410
with other men...

747
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,751
with the good book...
thank you, Jesus...

748
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:01,154
with money, power...

749
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,987
and everything
you can think of on the planet.

750
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:04,754
And you know
what finally separates...

751
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:08,252
the men from the boys,
Jackie boy?

752
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:11,562
The wisdom...
the knowledge of the ages.

753
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,296
You know what it is, Jack?

754
01:08:13,336 --> 01:08:16,999
That hole... it can't be filled.

755
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,939
We pretend, because
no one's got the balls...

756
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:20,237
to live with the truth...

757
01:08:20,276 --> 01:08:22,608
the truth being
that inside that hole, Jack...

758
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:26,547
is what we really are...
nothingness.

759
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:30,712
Just a need, Jack...

760
01:08:30,753 --> 01:08:36,055
the truth that we ain't any more
noble than we are knowable.

761
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:38,356
And every dark place in us...

762
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:41,090
every rabid fucking impulse
we have...

763
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,588
is just the nature of the beast.

764
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:52,268
Now, if you can live with that,
do it...

765
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:55,539
or else sit back,
have another shot...

766
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:58,479
and let me do the same.

767
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,467
Ohh.

768
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:26,070
Ohh. Ahh.

769
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:47,093
Unh.

770
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:56,903
You want
a little lesson in life?

771
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:59,635
Just for you, kiddo.

772
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:09,145
The monkey doesn't shit
where the crocodile sleeps.

773
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,785
You're the one
with the needle in his arm...

774
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:14,790
Iooking for a new daddy, right?

775
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,293
What's he supposed
to come along and do?

776
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:23,790
Finish
what the first one started?

777
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,630
Well, here he is.

778
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,138
Father knows best.

779
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:47,244
It goes by many names...

780
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,315
crank...

781
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,494
crack...

782
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,333
croak.

783
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:07,609
Uhh.

784
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:13,282
I bet you there's not even
a name for this.

785
01:11:15,551 --> 01:11:17,644
But you can think of one...

786
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,917
on your last trip
to Never Never Land.

787
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:23,990
Maybe, by rights, you should
end up in little pieces.

788
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,460
Maybe that's all
you really want.

789
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,656
I don't know.

790
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:31,064
I'm not a shrink.

791
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:41,032
But this is exactly
how you should go out.

792
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:44,803
Don't you think?

793
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:51,519
You can make this
as messy as you want...

794
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:54,955
but if I were you,
I'd hold still.

795
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:57,084
It's just a shot, little boy.

796
01:11:58,427 --> 01:12:00,588
In a second,
you won't feel a thing.

797
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,963
Please don't kill me, Jack.
Please don't kill me, Jack.

798
01:12:09,105 --> 01:12:12,302
Off to see the wizard.

799
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:37,452
Unh. Uhh. Uhh.

800
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,268
Unh:

801
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:22,463
Unh.

802
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:33,945
Unh:

803
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:36,451
Unh:

804
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:09,235
Jack. Thought that was you.

805
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:12,405
For Christ's sake.

806
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:15,081
You know, I couldn't
for the world of me...

807
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:16,880
figure out who the hell
would be knocking out here.

808
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:19,217
Heh heh heh.
Put a scare into you, did I?

809
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:20,620
Well, folks
down at the market...

810
01:16:20,656 --> 01:16:21,850
saw you drive through
this afternoon.

811
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:23,324
How's Carol?

812
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:25,884
- Not on this trip, no.
- Oh, really?

813
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:27,190
Well, listen, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

814
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:29,129
Little David...
he's my new deputy.

815
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:31,428
You remember Greg Brewer,
deputy sheriff...

816
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:32,729
big guy, about 6'2"?

817
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:34,099
Well, this is his son David.

818
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:36,263
David, this is Jack,
good fishing buddy.

819
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:37,863
The sheriff's
always looking out...

820
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:39,169
for this place.
Don't you worry.

821
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,937
- I try.
- Appreciate it.

822
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:44,241
Yeah, well, that's one
of the reasons I went on by.

823
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,941
Jack...

824
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:47,778
we got to talk.

825
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:49,477
Sure.

826
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:52,578
Now, hold on a minute.
Busy night.

827
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:54,646
Now, listen, you been hearing...

828
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,454
all that hatchet killer crap
on the radio?

829
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:58,926
A little bit, yeah.

830
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:03,398
Well, he could be out this way.

831
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:05,093
Paul and I go way back.

832
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:13,440
The sheriff's going to be on
vacation for the next 3 weeks.

833
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:16,967
I just want you to know
I take my job very seriously.

834
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:18,604
No one likes to talk about it...

835
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:21,639
but these places are so isolated
they're pretty easy targets...

836
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:24,380
for squatters, burglars,
what have you.

837
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,648
You see?

838
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:28,088
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

839
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:30,887
Now, apparently, this nutso
could be just about anywhere.

840
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,450
I mean, they tell me
they've got...

841
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:35,725
troopers and feds
crawling all over the place.

842
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:37,095
You be glad
you don't have Carol...

843
01:17:37,132 --> 01:17:38,190
out there with you tonight,
Jack.

844
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:40,929
Well, I'm going
on vacation next week.

845
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:42,198
Let me tell you
what I'm going to have...

846
01:17:42,237 --> 01:17:44,102
little David do here for you.

847
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,073
Now, we usually
check these places out...

848
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:48,338
about this time,
just after dark.

849
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:51,813
You see, I figure
the little squatter problem...

850
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:55,142
...sometime after dark.

851
01:17:55,184 --> 01:17:56,310
How long you going to be here?

852
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:58,115
About until tomorrow.

853
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:02,115
Uh...

854
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:05,149
the old Kingsley place...

855
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:07,628
three miles off,
there's an old junction...

856
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:08,823
on the old Jones Road.

857
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:12,823
Yeah, well, about...
about three months ago...

858
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:16,634
Was it three months already?
How long ago was it, David?

859
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:17,798
March. Mid-march.

860
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,467
March?
Was it that far back? Jesus.

861
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:21,635
Four months ago.
I guess it was four months ago.

862
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:23,144
Seemed like yesterday
was what it was.

863
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:27,080
Well, anyway,
David was out on patrol...

864
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:33,817
The house on the left side.

865
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:34,982
Damnedest thing he ever saw.

866
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:36,150
Thought it was
an apparition or something.

867
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,351
You know, well,
it turned out...

868
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,124
She's a bottom feeder.
She's MTV, you know?

869
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:47,158
Out of a light gene pool
or something, for Christ's sake.

870
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:52,798
You know the type?

871
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:55,366
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

872
01:18:55,411 --> 01:18:57,845
Yeah, get that, will you, David?

873
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,040
Anyway...

874
01:19:00,215 --> 01:19:02,410
people end up doing
the weirdest damn things, Jack.

875
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,385
I can't tell you.

876
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,049
My job...

877
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,183
gets weirder every day.

878
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,318
It's Charlie Juarez's.

879
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:13,623
Oh.

880
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:18,295
Old Charlie's specialty
is domestic disturbances.

881
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,598
You see what I'm talking about?
I mean, it never stops.

882
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:25,073
Come on, little David.
Got a big night of work ahead.

883
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:31,672
Oh, Jack...

884
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,237
say hello to Carol.

885
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:34,874
I look forward
to seeing the both of you...

886
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:37,044
- The next time you come up.
- Right.

887
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:45,923
Hey, Jack...

888
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:50,261
you better lock up everything
before you turn in tonight.

889
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:55,362
I don't believe in the Bogeyman,
but he might be out tonight.

890
01:19:55,404 --> 01:19:57,429
We'll see you, Jack.

891
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:59,415
That's two, Jack.

892
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:06,651
That's all you got.

893
01:23:08,964 --> 01:23:11,228
You can't kill the devil, Jack.

894
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:14,431
You ought to know that.

895
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:30,514
You know,
you really are a sick man, Jack.

896
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,420
Here I am...

897
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:36,117
the one single body...

898
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:39,525
on the face
of this shit-eating planet...

899
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:42,359
who would accept you...

900
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:45,195
for what you really are.

901
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,531
And you try to kill...

902
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,867
and bury me.

903
01:23:51,907 --> 01:23:55,172
You going to tell me
why you do it, Jack?

904
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,474
I've been dying to ask.

905
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:02,515
You tell me why...

906
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:04,849
and I'll tell you...

907
01:24:04,886 --> 01:24:08,686
how I walked off
with all that money...

908
01:24:08,724 --> 01:24:11,625
from the Pot O' Gold Casino.

909
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:19,263
People spend
their whole lives...

910
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,859
thinking that someone
is going to come along...

911
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:24,235
and take away all their misery.

912
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:27,366
For a precious few...

913
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:30,105
I am that someone.

914
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:35,342
I like that.

915
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:39,847
Every boy needs a hobby.

916
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:47,384
Didn't want to do me,
did you, Jack?

917
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:51,525
I just have one little question
for you, Jack.

918
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:56,227
Why do you cut them up
into little pieces?

919
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:00,099
Why do you do that?

920
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,406
For the fuck of it.

921
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:10,082
Uhh:

922
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:15,780
In other news, the body count
has risen to six...

923
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:17,724
in the brutal string
of serial killings...

924
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:20,922
along the rural highways
of both Nevada and California.

925
01:25:20,962 --> 01:25:23,954
The killer, who even police
and federal investigators...

926
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:25,796
are now tagging
the Hatchet Man...

927
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:28,428
may have claimed
his fourth and fifth victims.

928
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,097
Two bodies found in a van...

929
01:25:30,138 --> 01:25:31,867
with Massachusetts
license plates...

930
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:33,465
are thought to be his latest.

931
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:35,601
Authorities are doing
everything they can...

932
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:37,669
but are suggesting
that at this point in time...

933
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:40,840
hitchhiking
or ride sharing in the area...

934
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:01,466
- What happened to your eye?
- It's just a scratch.

935
01:26:01,503 --> 01:26:03,164
Hey, Mr. Powell.

936
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:05,230
Ooh.

937
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:08,742
Say, hey, Billy.
