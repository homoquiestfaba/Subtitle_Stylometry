00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,791
Where?
He's sitting with the D.A.

177
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,194
This is never going to stick.

178
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,396
Never.

179
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:26,033
You know what's the first thing I'm gonna do
when I get out? What? What are you gonna do?

180
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,802
I'm gonna come see you...

181
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,272
and that fucking kid.

182
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,407
[Man]
All rise.

183
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,581
You may now be seated.

184
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,919
[Judge] On the request of the prosecution,

185
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:50,257
this hearing will be postponed until July 31 of this year.

186
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,259
See you all then.

187
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,344
You're a crazy kid.
You know that, right?

188
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,512
Crazy.

189
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,848
In his prime...

190
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,783
Tyson would've killed Ali.

191
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,286
Tyson wouldn't have lasted five rounds.
You're crazy.

192
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:23,123
So I did a little reading on you this morning.
Impressive career.

193
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,559
Anticrime Unit, Narcotics.

194
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,762
Let's not forget the Delany case.
That was a big one.

195
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,565
Now here you are
working Homicide.

196
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:35,669
It's an amazing career for a man,
but it's spectacular for a woman.

197
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:39,206
And a Latina woman at that.
You should be proud of yourself.

198
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,777
What does that mean, Detective? What?

199
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,981
I should be proud because
I made it to Homicide?

200
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,850
Or I should be proud because I'm a
Latina woman who made it to Homicide?

201
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,686
Well, first of all, we can
drop the detective thing.

202
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,956
It's Gary.
Okay. Gary.

203
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,325
I'm just saying that you should be proud for your race.

204
00:17:58,393 --> 00:17:59,726
My race?

205
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,362
Yeah, your race.

206
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:06,967
- Are you fucking with me?
- No.

207
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,636
You Latinos.
You're a proud people, right?

208
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:11,872
- You Latinos?
- Yeah.

209
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,412
All right,
I suppose you missed the racial sensitivity training.

210
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,680
No, I took that.
Why?

211
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:24,084
Look, Gary, I don't care
if you're a bigot or a racist.

212
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,487
I really don't care.
It doesn't affect me at all.

213
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:31,392
I just care that you and I get the job
done and that you have my back.

214
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,260
Are we clear?
Of course.

215
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,195
Good.
And I'm not any of those things,

216
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:37,131
so you got
nothing to worry about.

217
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:39,299
And I certainly
have your back.

218
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,935
Oh, and, Gary,
if you touch me,

219
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,504
I will shoot you.

220
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,273
[Clearing Throat]

221
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:50,710
Okay, we're setting up boundaries.
That's-- I understand that.

222
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,012
What?

223
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:57,017
What's up, kid?
How was school today?

224
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,920
[Sighs]
The same.

225
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,888
Whoa. What the hell
happened to you?

226
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:05,192
Oh. Uh, I got jumped...
on the train.

227
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,762
Jesus Christ, Sean.

228
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,765
Did you file a report?
No, it happened so fast.

229
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,700
I couldn't tell you
what they looked like.

230
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,271
Your father
must be sick about this.

231
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:19,139
Yeah, he is.

232
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,110
I really don't want to
talk about it, Billy.

233
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,012
No problem.

234
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,115
Hope you got a couple of
shots in at least.

235
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,150
Just one.

236
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,955
I'm leaving now.

237
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,656
I'll be there, Richard.

238
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:46,400
Excuse me.

239
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,003
Excuse me.

240
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,838
Do you work here?

241
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,343
No. I don't work here.

242
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,779
You look a little young to be a cop,
so what are you doing here?

243
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,348
Um--

244
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,852
Billy-- I mean,
Detective Baldwin knows I'm here.

245
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,255
I'm just, uh, printing...

246
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:09,956
this off and--

247
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,258
It's getting late so--

248
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,260
I'm sure it's all right.
I just--

249
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,962
It's my first day here today so
I'm just trying to be careful.

250
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,365
Yeah, it's no problem.

251
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,900
Um, but I'm gonna--

252
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,836
I'm gonna go.

253
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,668
Ten minutes.
I promise.

254
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,215
[Sighs]

255
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,520
I don't know, Richard.

256
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,922
Maybe they don't
like police in this town.

257
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,093
What? You think I'm
doing this on purpose?

258
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,096
[Honking]

259
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,173
I think you need
a new phone.

260
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,410
Yeah.

261
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,046
It's pretty bad.
The lugs are rusted.

262
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:43,783
I think I'm just gonna
call a tow truck.

263
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:45,885
Let me give it a try.

264
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,554
All right.
Knock yourself out.

265
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,738
Well, you're stronger
then you look.

266
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,642
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

267
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,477
No. I'm sorry.

268
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:14,914
I'm just not being used to being
the damsel in distress type.

269
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:18,252
- I'm Teresa by the way.
- I know who you are.

270
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,956
I've seen you on TV.

272
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:26,926
I know.
Larry Childs has made me famous unfortunately.

273
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:28,862
I heard, uh,

274
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,931
he's trying to...
make a deal or something?

275
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,634
Think he'll get off?

276
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:36,002
I don't know.

277
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,272
It's out of my hands really.

278
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:45,646
You need any help down there?
No, I got it.

279
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,213
All right.

280
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:56,055
You're all set.

281
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:58,858
Well, thank you again.

282
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:03,096
- Hey, I still didn't get your name.
- Sean.

283
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,465
Can I offer you a ride
now that you fixed my tire?

284
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,435
Oh, no. No, thanks.
I take the train.

285
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,337
You sure?
Yeah.

286
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:12,639
Good night.

291

Yeah.
Sorry about that, Dad.

292
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:32,352
That's okay.
Oh.

293
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,556
I thought I was gonna end up with a matching shiner.
Let me look at that.

294
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:42,262
Yeah, you're still not upset
about the fight, are ya?

295
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,463
Hmm?

296
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:48,802
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

297
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:54,975
I had my head handed to me
more than a couple times.

298
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,243
Can you get that for me?

299
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,380
All right.

Damn, you look good. Nice and smooth.

You could be getting more power
behind your straight right.

303
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:14,861
You wanna pivot.
Pivot on the back foot.

304

with just a little bit more.

they don't give a shit about technique.

the most of it, Sean.

we could do something.

to me when I tell him to do something!

00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,729
So what do you think?

330
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,564
About what?

331
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:33,700
About his story.

332
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:36,703
I think a drug dealer got
popped and he's dead.

333
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,271
That's what I think.

Want anything?

335
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:42,242
No, I'm good.

336
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,980
I also think that more than likely
that little criminal in there killed him.

337
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:50,683
But of course we're never going
to know that because as usual...

338
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,687
nobody saw nothin'
and we got no murder weapon.

339
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,158
So you don't believe anything
he said about that other guy?

No.

341
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,763
What I know...

342
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,565
is that a patrol car saw
our boy and the victim...

343
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,434
working their usual spot
the night of the murder.

344

Tony's dead.

00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:18,444
Tony was a pretty
serious guy.

349
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:20,613
It's a little ambitious for
that kid. He's too young.

350
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:25,752
Did you grow up in
a big family, Ames?

351
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,489
Yeah, I did.
Why?

352
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:31,624
- That explains it.
- Explains what?

353
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,762
You've got
"look at me" syndrome.

354
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:39,732
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,368
Yeah, you come from
a big family, see,

356
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:44,171
so it's hard for you
to get attention.

357
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:46,273
It's hard for Mommy and Daddy
to notice you.

358
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,440
Really?
Yeah.

359
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,642
So you gotta make a big deal
out of everything.

360
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,946
Oh, boy.
No, I mean you gotta over achieve.

361
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,315
You have to excel
at all costs.

362
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:58,051
"Look at me" syndrome.
I see.

363
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:03,423
And you've deduced this from what?
Me wanting to do my job?

364
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,559
Or should I say,
wanting to do our job.

365
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,829
All I'm saying is...

366
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:12,966
don't make more out of this
than it actually is.

367
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,369
Look, there are a hundred people
out there that wanted Tony dead.

368
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,338
He was a true piece of shit,

369
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:21,007
drug-dealing pedophile,
I might add.

370
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,077
But in the end...

371
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:27,214
killer is usually the first guy
that comes to mind.

372
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,216
Really?
Yeah.

373
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:33,320
Thank you. It's great.
Homicide 101. I can manage.

374
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,456
- I'm just trying to help.
- You wanna help me?

375
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:39,759
- Yeah.
- Go get me some coffee. That's how you can help me.

376
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:43,063
Only if you come with me.

377
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:49,269
Here.

378
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:58,111
What's his story?

379
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,181
Who, Sean?
Man.

380
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,184
Mother got her head blown off
right in front of his face.

381
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,286
Like 10 years ago.

382
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,321
Car jacking.

383
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,723
That's horrible.
Yeah.

384
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:14,227
He's been coming in here
ever since then.

385
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:15,996
Baldwin lets him look
at mug shots,

386
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,365
see if the guy got grabbed
for something else.

387
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:21,001
So he just let's him come in and
use the computer unattended?

388
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,836
That's not exactly
procedure, is it?

389
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,673
Bill's senior man on the squad, Ames.
I don't ask questions.

390
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:37,450
And he's a little young for you,
don't you think, Detective?

391
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,719
[Laughing]
You're a jerk.

392
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:43,056
No, he helped me change a tire on my car the other day.

393
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,325
I just think he's
a nice kid, that's all.

394
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:47,460
That's sweet.

395
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:49,062
Look. You, uh--

396
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,597
You ready to go?
Junior mafia is about to call his lawyer.

397
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:54,801
Yeah, I'll meet you
in there in a minute.

398
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:56,602
[Laughing]

399
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,583
He's an ugly one.

400
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:15,355
I find them all
to be pretty ugly.

401
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,890
I wanted to say thank you for the other night.
For helping me.

402
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,526
Oh. It's-- It's not a problem.

403
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:24,364
So now I owe you one.
I was thinking maybe I could help you with your work.

404
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,032
I'm pretty good
at what I do.

405
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,034
Okay.
Ames!

406
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:31,137
Let's go.
I'll be right there.

407
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:33,873
So it's a deal?

408
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:36,576
I'll take a look at your case,
see how I can give you a hand,

409
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:40,680
and we'll talk about it.
You really don't have to do that.

410
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,548
You don't want my help?

411
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,617
No, no.
Then don't worry about it.

412
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:47,854
I'll take a look at it, okay?
I gotta go.

413
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:15,248
I need a girl.

414
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:20,887
[Crying]

415
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:26,859
[Man] Did you take that vitamin C I gave you?

416
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,929
Yes, I did. Thank you.

417
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,000
I want you to wear your
heavy coat tonight, okay?

418
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:37,603
I don't want this to get
any worse then it is.

419
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:39,672
[Woman]
Joe.

420
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,610
I don't think--

421
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:49,582
You don't think what?

422
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,353
- I'm sick, Joe.
- Yeah, I know.

423
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,589
That's why I'm trying to do everything
I can to make you feel better.

424
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,094
I don't want to do this, okay?

425
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:05,532
I'm sorry,
but I can't do this tonight.

426
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:11,137
I fucking told you to get up!
Get up! [Screaming]

427
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,540
I waited and waited for you!

428
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,309
I worry about you
all fucking day!

429
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:19,479
And all you can do
is think about yourself!

430
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,814
You selfish fucking bitch!

431
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:23,683
Now you are gonna
go that job,

432
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,351
and you are
gonna like it!

433
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:29,155
Get in the fucking car!
Get in the car!

434
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:35,128
Leave her--
Leave her alone.

435
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,930
Motherfucker!

436
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:44,937
Joe, don't!

437
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:46,973
[Woman Screaming]

438
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,343
You mind your own
fucking business!

439
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,780
- You picked the wrong fucking guy!
- Stop! Please!

440
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,918
- Sticking your nose into my business.
- [Screaming]

441
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,320
Shut up!

442
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,329
Fucker!

443
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:10,597
Ow. Ow!

444
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,468
[Woman]
Joe, please don't!

445
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:33,620
[Crying]

446
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,260
Get in the house!

447
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,062
Get inside! This is
all your fault!

448
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,104
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

449
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,575
You come around here again,
and I will put a bullet in your head.

450
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,710
And that bitch you
tried to save--

451
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:01,747
I am going to beat her
until she can't fucking move.

452
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:07,053
So you haven't done anything
here except waste my time.

453
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,888
Fuck up my car.

454
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,625
You didn't save her.

455
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,260
You made it worse.

456
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:17,430
Hey, Joe.

457
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:24,837
[Woman Screaming]

458
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,268
[Teresa] Did you ever see this man before?

459
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,503
I meet a lot of men.

460
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,139
It's hard to keep track.
Thanks, sweetie.

461
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:40,480
You know what I do, right?

462
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:42,114
Yeah, you're a hooker.
Gary.

463
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:45,785
Miss Winston,
I know what you do.

464
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:48,588
Please, call me Lizzy.

465
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:52,492
Miss Winston is my mother,
and I don't want to think about her right now.

466
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,460
So you're telling me
you didn't recognize him?

467
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:57,697
I never saw this guy before.

468
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,666
Anyways, I couldn't really
tell what he looked like.

469
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:04,370
He had this black outfit on,
and it was kind of dark out.

470
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:07,006
Do you know anybody who didn't particularly like Joey?

471
00:37:07,073 --> 00:37:10,343
Maybe someone
who wanted him dead?

472
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:14,213
- Who didn't want him dead?
- Lizzy I'm going to have a sketch artist come up here.

473
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:17,183
Look, Miss Detective,

474
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,219
Joe was a piece of shit.

475
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,322
He was going to kill me.

476
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:26,158
Maybe not last night, but...

477
00:37:26,226 --> 00:37:30,563
sooner or later he was going to
hit me too hard or choke me.

478
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,065
That little girl he killed--

479
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,934
Now what are
you talking about?

480
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,870
Mancini was charged with murdering a 13-year-old girl.

481
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:40,373
- He beat the charge.
- Yeah.

482
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:42,942
He used to laugh about that.

483
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:46,579
He was gonna kill me next.

484
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,415
That guy...

485
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,551
saved my life.

486
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:54,587
He was...

487
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,856
sent down by God
to save me.

488
00:37:56,923 --> 00:38:01,694
You know,
I'm getting a second chance now 'cause of him and--

489
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:06,265
You know, you seem like
a real nice person, but...

490
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,701
I'm not going to help you
arrest this guy.

491
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,840
Just wouldn't be fair.

492
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:15,975
[Phone Ringing]

493
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:20,112
Teresa Ames.

494
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,581
Yeah.

495
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,753
The 21-- no problem.
Okay.

496
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,590
Shit.
What's up?

497
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,993
The fucking Delany case
has been delayed again.

498
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,729
Larry Childs is trying to
cut a deal with the D.A.

499
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:39,331
[Sighs]
I can't believe this shit.

500
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,801
So, what do you care?

501
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,537
Fuck 'em. We get paid
to catch 'em. After that...

502
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,105
it's out of our hands.

503
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:50,075
I gave two years of my
life to this case, Gary.

504
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:53,279
I lost my marriage to this case.
I lost my fucking son to this case.

505
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,347
Who cares?

506
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,284
Are you gonna cry?
Fuck you.

507
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:02,054
No, I mean if you want I'll step out of
the car and give you a couple minutes.

508
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,589
Women...

509
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,057
like to cry.

510
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,360
Gary, what the hell
do you know about women?

511
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,495
Um--

512
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:12,331
Nothing. Thank you.

513
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:15,802
You know,
that girl's description match the one in Tony T.'s case?

514
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,271
Hey, all that hooker said was
that the guy was wearing black.

515
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:23,409
I mean, this is New York.
[Laughing]

516
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:24,811
Tell you what,

517
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,313
Why don't we go over
to the coroner's office.

00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,281
If it's the same gun,
then we got something to talk about.

520
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,552
Hey, man.
You looked good today.

521
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,822
You should try out
for the tournament.

522
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,591
Why?

523
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:14,393
What do you mean, why?
To see if you could win.

524
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:16,362
You know, for fun?

525
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,230
I don't do this for fun.

- Twenty-three and a quarter.
- Ah, shit. I'm getting killed.

528
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,712
All right.
Check out E.R.C.M.

00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:35,614
Twelve and three eights.
Ah, shit.

530
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:39,051
All right, Artie, how much longer is this going to take?
We got lives to save out there.

531
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:41,754
- A little while longer.
- All right. Well, I'm gonna take a piss.

532
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,322
I'll be back.

He's an ugly one.

[Sean's Voice] I find them all to be pretty ugly.

Hey, can you look
something up for me?

536
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,866
Sure, what's the symbol?

537
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,702
No, it's not a stock.
It's, uh, a word.

538
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,304
Triceleron.
Whoa.

539
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,706
Cool.

540
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:02,675
Pretty exotic for
a Brooklyn Homicide.

541
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:04,844
You've heard of it before?
Of course.

542
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,780
I've never worked on a case with it,
but I know what it is.

543
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,715
What is it?
What is what?

544
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,418
The detective was just
asking about triceleron.

545
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:15,254
Oh. Cool.
Pretty exotic for a Brooklyn Homicide.

546
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:18,090
Fuck, is that the word of the day?
What is it? It's a poison.

547
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:21,761
Well, some would argue against
it being classified as a poison.

548
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:23,496
It's technically an irritant.

549
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:26,632
It poisons the muscular system, Artie.
It is thus a poison.

550
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,233
It doesn't actually
poison anything, Roy.

551
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:30,536
Okay, guys, talk to me,
not to each other. What is it?

552
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:33,372
The thing that makes
triceleron so interesting...

553
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,474
is that it doesn't actually
poison the system.

554
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:37,410
And that is what makes it
virtually untraceable.

555
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:39,845
It causes a chemical reaction
in your esophagus.

556
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:42,715
It swells the muscles and
suffocates you in your own body.

557
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:45,818
You die of asphyxiation.
So it's not the poison that kills you per se.

558
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:47,486
It's your own body
that does you in.

559
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,556
And all you need it just the
slightest taste and it's over.

560
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:52,491
- So it's a poison?
- Exactly.

561
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,359
It is not a poison.
Shell fish, peanuts--

562
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,896
These cause the same reaction in some people,
and those aren't poisons.

563
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,464
If you have a peanut allergy,
they are.

564
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:00,866
Cyanide, potassium chloride.
These are poisons.

565
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,469
Peanuts are not a poison.
Artie, come on.

566
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:06,305
Less talking,
more digging for that bullet. You got it.

are still no guarantees.

I should just give it up?

686
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,968
How'd due process work out for
you in the Child's case Teresa?

687
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:27,272
Scumbag kills two fucking people
and now they're talking about...

688
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,342
tainted evidence and the
Witness Protection Program?

689
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:33,345
That's your due process?

690
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:38,817
How did due process work out
for you in your divorce case?

691
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:41,153
Think you were
treated fairly?

692
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:46,958
You can keep your due process.
Thanks for the egg roll.

693
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:49,961
What are you doing
with triceleron?

694
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:51,396
What?

695
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,001
What are you doing
spying on me?

696
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:58,370
It's a poison. It's illegal.
Do you know that?

697
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,071
Yeah, I know.

698
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,977
I wrote a paper on the history of
poisons in my Chemistry class.

699
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,614
Got an A.

700
00:51:10,216 --> 00:51:12,217
We done with
the questions now?

701
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:15,254
Yeah, we're done.

702
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:26,565
[Chattering]

703
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:30,536
[Laughing]

704
00:51:30,603 --> 00:51:32,204
Last one.

705
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,010
Mmm.

706
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:41,280
Why did you make me do that?
Why not?

707
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:44,849
As I was saying,

708
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,586
Tony and Joe...

709
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:51,523
both come from the same
fucking neighborhood.

710
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,692
And both of them
were scumbags.

711
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:57,162
Somewhere... both of them
fucked over the same guy,

712
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,198
and they both end
up getting wacked.

713
00:51:59,265 --> 00:52:01,500
I mean it really could be
just as simple as that.

714
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,336
Okay. It's the last one.
Last one.

715
00:52:04,404 --> 00:52:05,904
[Glasses Clink]

716
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:12,511
- Oh, please let it be the last one.
- Hoo.

717
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,846
- [Giggling]
- Did you know that Tony...

718
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,516
beat his girlfriend's
son to death?

719
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:19,318
A seven-year-old boy.

720
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:21,019
Did you know that?

721
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:23,755
About five years ago.
Yes, I did know that.

722
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:25,424
And he beat the rap.

723
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:27,192
That's what our victims
both have in common.

724
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,395
- They both killed somebody and got away with it.
- Oh, come on.

725
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,097
What?
Come on.

726
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:35,567
We're back to revenge killings?
Vigilante shit.

727
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:38,803
Maybe.
[Man Laughing]

728
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,681
Can I ask you a question?

729
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,719
- What?
- Are you telling me everything?

730
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:55,854
What do you mean?

731
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:57,389
Well, I mean
we're partners right?

732
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:58,990
Yes, that's-- Yes.

733
00:52:59,058 --> 00:53:02,227
Is there something about these
murders that you're keeping to yourself?

734
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:04,730
[Scoffs]

735
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,567
Of course not.
Good.

736
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:11,903
Because I don't mind saying,
you have a reputation...

737
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:14,306
for being out there
for yourself.

738
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:15,974
I mean,
you do know that, right?

739
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,278
Really?
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

740
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:23,782
Your partner's name didn't even make
it into the paper on the Delaney case.

741
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:27,586
Your partner.
Why is that, I wonder?

742
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:29,788
Why is his name
not visible?

743
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:32,857
'Cause he's still-- He's still in Anticrime Unit.
That's politics. You know that.

744
00:53:32,925 --> 00:53:35,794
There was no promotion there.
No promotion whatsoever.

745
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:47,005
You should know better than that.
It's fucked up that you're asking me this.

746
00:53:47,072 --> 00:53:49,174
Are you done insulting me?

747
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:54,212
For the time being,
I am done insulting you. Good.

748
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,284
However, I am also drunk,
and I'll probably be insulting you later on.

749
00:53:59,352 --> 00:54:02,954
Okay, good. I'm gonna
go and pay my respects.

750
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,156
I will... pay the bill.

751
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,363
Detective Baldwin?
Hi, I'm Teresa Ames.

752
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:16,000
- We haven't had the chance to meet yet.
- Oh, yes.

753
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:18,169
Wonder Woman
from the Bronx.

754
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:21,573
My pleasure.

755
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:25,377
Are you enjoying your party?
Is this party for me?

756
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:28,012
I thought it was for you.

757
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:30,482
Why would it be my party?
I don't--

758
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:34,018
This is the "Welcome to the
Squad" party for Teresa Ames.

759
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:38,223
Or couldn't you tell?
Out with the old. In with the new.

760
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,459
Yeah. Well, we'll
pick this up later.

761
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:44,996
- I'll let you be with your friends.
- No. Now is perfect.

762
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:48,600
What did you want
to talk about?

763
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:51,670
The skinny white kid?
Is that it?

764
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:52,937
Sean?

765
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:56,375
Don't be so shy, Detective.
You're his favorite topic.

766
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:59,678
And now you're in the same station with him.
[Chuckles]

767
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:01,946
Who would have
guessed that?

768
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:04,549
I'm not following you.
What do you mean?

769
00:55:04,617 --> 00:55:06,685
See if you can follow this.

770
00:55:06,753 --> 00:55:08,253
Leave him alone.

771
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:12,724
I'll be gone Friday.
I'll be golfing.

772
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:16,895
He won't have anyone else
to help him out.

773
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:18,997
The kid has...

774
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:20,999
issues.

775
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:23,769
- Get it?
- Yeah, I do get it. I read the file.

776
00:55:23,836 --> 00:55:27,539
[Laughing]
You read the file!

777
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:30,308
So... you must know
everything now.

778
00:55:30,376 --> 00:55:33,545
Let me give you a little update, Detective.
You don't know shit.

779
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:35,313
Leave him alone.

780
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:37,282
And let him get back
to his life.

781
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:41,520
When I leave,
he'll leave.

782
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:44,723
He doesn't need you fucking up his
head any more than it already is.

783
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,728
Enjoy your party.

784
00:55:56,402 --> 00:55:58,202
I don't know.
He just flipped out on me.

785
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,305
He's just drunk.

786
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:02,441
You taking the train?

787
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:04,876
Of course I'm taking the train.
I'm hammered.

788
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,021
[Snoring]

789
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:19,891
Wake up.
I'm awake.

790
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,560
You're snoring.

791
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:23,528
I am not snoring.

792
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,964
[Man] The dinner was nice.
Friday and then Saturday,

793
00:56:26,031 --> 00:56:28,232
couple of the guys came over
to the house early.

794
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,002
[Continues, Indistinct]

795
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:33,971
Please.
Men, uh-- They fighting.

796
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:35,540
Please go. Please.

797
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,021
Filthy. Filthy. Fucking dog.
Whoo!

798
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:52,890
Huh, pussy, where you going?
[Laughing]

799
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:58,163
They fuck like a bunch of dogs.
They make filthy fucking children.

800
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,966
That's right.
[Laughing] Animals like a pig.

801
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:04,302
Like a fucking pig.
[Snorting]

802
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,971
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at, family?

803
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,006
Huh? You think
you're better than me?

804
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:12,843
Ha! You think you're better than me?
You think you're better than me?

805
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:14,912
Huh? Huh?
That's what you think?

806
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,081
Please.
Leave me alone.

807
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:19,317
Please? You want me to please you?
Is that what you want?

808
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,052
No!
You want me to please you?

809
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,388
- Is that what you want?
- Hey, why don't you leave her alone?

810
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,623
Why don't you
sit the fuck down, pig!

811
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,258
Huh? You wanna die early?

812
00:57:27,326 --> 00:57:30,395
I'll give you something to die early for,
you filthy fucking fuck!

813
00:57:30,462 --> 00:57:35,132
'Cause this pig wants to talk to me.
Ain't that right, pig?

814
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:39,837
Yeah. 'Cause I think you do.
I think you want some of this.

815
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:41,839
Please? You want
me to please you?

816
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:44,175
Is that what you want?
I'll please you.

817
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:45,943
Huh? Is that what you want?

818
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:07,064
[Chinese]

819
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:13,338
I know that's what you want.
That's what it sounds like. I can hear you.

820
00:58:14,873 --> 00:58:18,042
I can smell you.
I can smell what you want.

821
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,211
I'm gonna show you
what you want.

822
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,182
Sit the fuck down, pig!
You wanna die?

823
00:58:29,788 --> 00:58:31,656
[Shouting]

824
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:50,074
Please, uh--
They fighting.

825
00:58:50,142 --> 00:58:51,942
Please go.

826
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:06,957
[Crying]
Okay. Okay.

827
00:59:07,025 --> 00:59:08,025
I quit. All right.

828
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:10,194
Stop. I quit.

829
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,938
Hey!

830
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,708
Hey!

831
00:59:55,507 --> 00:59:56,708
Fuck.

832
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:14,659
Where the hell were you?

833
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:18,062
I was at a--
I was at a party.

834
01:00:18,129 --> 01:00:19,930
Shut up!

835
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:23,200
You wanna explain this?

836
01:00:23,268 --> 01:00:25,670
Testosterone Cypionate.

837
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:27,605
Steroids?

838
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:33,077
What the fuck are you doing
looking through my shit?

839
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:36,681
Look motherfucker,
you live in my house!

840
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:39,617
This shit's in my house!
I ask the fucking questions.

841
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:41,386
You shut the fuck up!

842
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:45,890
- I will put your head right through that window.
- Fucking try me, you asshole!

843
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:48,526
You go to the gym.
You fucking do push-ups.

844
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:50,728
You fucking pussy.
You don't take this shit.

845
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:53,230
You don't take shortcuts.
What's the matter with you?

846
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:58,235
Tell me that I raised you
better than that.

847
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:02,573
Yeah, you fucking raised
me real good.

848
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,483
[Chinese]

849
01:01:14,986 --> 01:01:16,888
[Chinese]

850
01:01:20,893 --> 01:01:22,527
What do we have?

851
01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:26,263
This little boy got a good look at him
before he put that stuff on his face.

852
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:27,565
Get this.

853
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,167
Before this wacko gets up
and pummels the homeless guy,

854
01:01:30,235 --> 01:01:33,003
he tells the kid to take
his mother and leave the car.

855
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:36,006
I guess he didn't want the kid
to see what was going to happen.

856
01:01:36,074 --> 01:01:37,675
I thought they didn't
speak English.

857
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:40,077
They don't.
This guy spoke Chinese.

858
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,953
Get up.
Get up, Sean.

859
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,021
[Gasping]

860
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:54,859
Sean? Sean.

861
01:01:58,764 --> 01:02:01,866
Get up. Get up.

862
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:04,201
2:00 in the afternoon.
Hell of a way to spend your birthday.

863
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:07,772
So get up, get dressed.
We got a schedule to keep.

864
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,307
What are you talking about?

865
01:02:11,242 --> 01:02:13,077
It's a surprise.

866
01:02:13,144 --> 01:02:15,412
Get up.
See you downstairs.

867
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:29,994
So where are we going?
Where are we going?

868
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:31,629
It's your birthday.

869
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:35,666
So the first thing I'm getting you is a cake.

870
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,468
All right?

871
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:55,185
This is the best damn cake
in New York.

872
01:02:57,088 --> 01:02:58,756
It is pretty good.

873
01:03:01,092 --> 01:03:05,029
You know, your mother and I used
to come here before you were born.

874
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:08,566
Doesn't look like much,
but the food--

875
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,501
it was pretty mediocre.

876
01:03:13,872 --> 01:03:16,507
This is also where,
you know,

877
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:18,308
I would hang out
with my friends,

878
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:21,913
and we'd have a-- like, I don't know,
like a meeting of the minds.

879
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:26,617
God, I don't
recognize it anymore.

880
01:03:29,688 --> 01:03:31,756
Yeah. I guess it's
been a long time.

881
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:34,759
Not long enough.

882
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:39,363
Erin. Jesus. Jesus.

883
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:40,932
How you been?
How you doing, Rock?

884
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:43,534
Good. I'm great.

885
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:47,838
Erin,
this is my son, Sean.

886
01:03:47,906 --> 01:03:52,176
My God. I remember when Mary
was pregnant with this little devil.

887
01:03:52,243 --> 01:03:55,746
Now look at him.
Handsome like his old man. Get out of here.

888
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:58,049
Listen. It's been a long time.
How you been?

889
01:03:58,116 --> 01:03:59,817
Doing okay.
I own this dump now.

890
01:03:59,885 --> 01:04:00,718
No.
Yep.

891
01:04:00,786 --> 01:04:02,587
Bought it from Tina
years ago.

892
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:05,255
Congratulations.
That's-- That's great.

893
01:04:05,323 --> 01:04:06,958
So where have
you been, Rock?

894
01:04:07,025 --> 01:04:10,427
I mean, it's gotta be, what,
10 years since I've seen you?

895
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,496
I heard you moved out
to Marine Park?

896
01:04:12,564 --> 01:04:15,399
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I did. I, uh--

897
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:18,936
I got a nice house,
in a nice neighborhood.

898
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:22,006
Good for you, Terry.
Finally got yourself out of this place.

899
01:04:22,074 --> 01:04:25,275
- I'm proud of you.
- Nah, it wasn't so bad.

900
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,645
Ah, well, it's pretty bad.
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

901
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:33,084
Listen. Why don't you sit down
and keep Sean company.

902
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:35,953
I'm gonna hit the head.
Okay.

903
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:38,656
Oh, Terry?
Yeah.

904
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:40,290
Take a look
on the back wall there.

905
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:43,995
I got some old pictures of you and the guys.
Okay.

906
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:48,165
- Hi.
- Sean, right?

907
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,669
God, your old man--
he looks great.

908
01:04:51,737 --> 01:04:54,872
He looks better now than he did
when he used to hang around here.

909
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,440
He looks younger.

910
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:58,442
Yeah, that's 'cause
he stopped drinking.

911
01:05:00,378 --> 01:05:02,379
Yeah. Well, that'll do it.

912
01:05:06,217 --> 01:05:09,453
So, you called my dad Rock.
Is that a nickname or--

913
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:11,088
Yeah, Rocky.

914
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:14,959
You know, like the fighter,
the boxer? From the movie?

915
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:19,063
Anyway, I mean your dad wasn't a heavyweight.
[Chuckles]

916
01:05:19,131 --> 01:05:23,100
He was more of a scrapper.
You know? Really a great boxer.

917
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:24,735
He could have gone pro.

918
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:26,303
If it hadn't been
for the booze.

919
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:29,106
- Really?
- Yeah.

920
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:31,008
Yeah.

921
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:32,910
I don't know.
Your old man--

922
01:05:32,978 --> 01:05:35,813
he did a lot more fighting in the
street than he did in the gym,

923
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:37,748
If you know what I mean.

924
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:42,987
But, uh,
with those animals he used to hang out with,

925
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:46,223
I guess that was just
par for the course.

926
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:49,359
Rock. That's-- That's funny.

927
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:51,295
Oh, hey.

928
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:55,700
I was telling your son here what an
upstanding citizen you were back in the day.

929
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:57,568
Uh, yeah. Listen, um--

930
01:05:57,635 --> 01:06:00,671
- God, Erin, I hate to run out like this on you but--
- No, no, no. Come on.

931
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:02,406
I insist. I insist.
What's up?

932
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:03,874
Um--

933
01:06:03,942 --> 01:06:05,609
Come on. We gotta go.
What's the hurry?

934
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:07,277
Come on. We gotta go.
It's a surprise.

935
01:06:07,345 --> 01:06:09,580
I'm gonna stay in touch.
You better.

936
01:06:09,647 --> 01:06:11,182
Don't wait 10 years.
I won't.

937
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:14,051
It was nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you too, Sean.

938
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:15,886
See you around.

939
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:22,827
Sorry to rush you out of there like that,
but we don't wanna miss the first fight, do ya?

940
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:25,029
What fight?
What are you talking about?

941
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:27,031
Well, get in the car
and I'll show ya.

942
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:33,003
[Terry] This kid in the red is pretty good.

943
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:35,773
[Sean] Yeah, that's Angel.
I spar with him all the time.

944
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:37,274
Yeah?
Yeah.

945
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,009
Yeah, he looks pretty tough.

946
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:40,577
He's not that tough.

947
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:42,146
- Really?
- Yeah.

948
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:45,315
[Terry] He looks pretty tough to me.
Oh!

[Crowd Cheering]

950
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:50,254
Man, I forgot they had fights
at my gym tonight.

951
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:52,990

My gym first.</i>

952
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,330
Great fights.

953

Yeah, they were pretty good.
Yeah.

954
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,936
Hey, listen, one more stop.
Then we'll head back home.

955
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,504
Okay?
All right. Okay.

956
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:49,213
Why did you bring me here?

957
01:07:50,581 --> 01:07:51,916
Well,

958
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:54,651
I wanted you
to remember this.

959
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:56,386
You think
I forgot about this?

960
01:07:58,223 --> 01:08:01,058
No. No, I know you haven't.

961
01:08:03,361 --> 01:08:05,229
I know this memory is...

962
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,431
still fresh in your mind.

963
01:08:07,498 --> 01:08:09,834
I see it in your eyes
every day.

964
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,505
What I wanted you
to remember, Sean,

965
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:19,743
is that your mother
died that night.

966
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:24,148
Your mother died here.
She did.

967
01:08:24,216 --> 01:08:27,051
Not you.

968
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:30,921
You have a life to lead.
A long life.

969
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:36,227
I-I-- I think it's time
you start living it.

970
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:42,967
I know we haven't been
the best of friends.

971
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:44,902
I know.

972
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:51,408
You don't think I know,
but I know what a piece of shit I was back then. I do.

973
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:58,815
And I can't explain to you how sorry
I am for the things that I did to you.

974
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:02,186
And to your mother.

975
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:10,660
And I'll never forgive myself
for the person that I was.

976
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:17,601
But I gotta start
living my life.

977
01:09:17,668 --> 01:09:18,869
I--

978
01:09:22,607 --> 01:09:25,809
But I-- I need my son back
to do that.

979
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:31,949
I'm sorry.

980
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:38,889
I'm sorry.

981
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:58,042
- That's the last of it.
- No golf today?

982
01:09:58,109 --> 01:10:00,644
Detective Ames,
what's going on?

983
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:02,846
If I was retired,
I'd be playing golf.

984
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:04,415
What are you doing here,
Detective?

985
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:06,850
I wanna finish our conversation
from the other night.

986
01:10:06,918 --> 01:10:09,753
I was a little drunk that night.
I might have been a little out of line.

987
01:10:09,821 --> 01:10:11,188
No. You were
a lot out of line.

988
01:10:11,256 --> 01:10:13,390
Well, you're out of line coming to my house uninvited.

989
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:15,125
I need some answers
about Sean.

990
01:10:15,193 --> 01:10:17,661
Leave him alone.
That's your answer.

991
01:10:17,728 --> 01:10:20,130
I can't do that anymore.

992
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,168
Let's have a drink.

993
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,375
[Baldwin Narrating]
I was 10 years on the squad...

994
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:33,777
when they brought that kid
into the station.

995
01:10:35,513 --> 01:10:40,150
They should have brought him to the hospital.
He was in shock.

996
01:10:40,218 --> 01:10:42,019
No emotion.

997
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,988
No crying.

998
01:10:44,055 --> 01:10:45,889
He'd just stare.

999
01:10:47,925 --> 01:10:51,128
Those eyes looking
right through you.

1000
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:52,496
I wanted him to have
a look at the mugs...

1001
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:54,865
while the perp's face
was still on his mind.

1002
01:10:54,932 --> 01:10:57,634
Him and his father.
His father saw this guy up close.

1003
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:00,170
He pistol-whipped him
outside the car.

1004
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:03,273
Sean was all for it.

1005
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:05,742
Sat there for
three hours straight.

1006
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:08,879
Sure enough...

1007
01:11:08,946 --> 01:11:10,947
picks this guy out
just like that.

1008
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:16,286
[No Audible Dialogue]

1009
01:11:17,788 --> 01:11:20,657
But when we showed
the photo to his father,

1010
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:22,659
he says,
"No. That's the wrong guy."

1011
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:26,830
The kid looks at his father
like he's crazy.

1012
01:11:26,898 --> 01:11:30,567
Sean knows
this is the guy.

1013
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,672
Mr. Donovan pulls Sean
to the side.

1014
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:40,244
Gives him a lecture about the
consequences of his action.

1015
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,048
The first time he'd
dealt with consequences.

1016
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:48,618
Sean takes another look
at the photo.

1017
01:11:48,686 --> 01:11:51,905
Says he made a mistake.
His father's right. It's not the guy.

1018
01:11:57,762 --> 01:11:59,896
I felt bad for the kid.

1019
01:12:00,798 --> 01:12:02,633
He's about my son's age.

1020
01:12:04,202 --> 01:12:06,403
You know, he never
talked about his mother.

1021
01:12:06,471 --> 01:12:08,739
Never.

1022
01:12:08,806 --> 01:12:10,507
Never talked about
that night.

1023
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,278
I remember
that con's name though.

01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:17,348
I didn't even know it was still in my
head till about six months ago...

1025
01:12:17,415 --> 01:12:20,251
when I saw his picture
in the paper.

1026
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,686
Seemed some hotshot detective...

1027
01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:26,457
arrested him for the murder
of Angela Delany.

1028
01:12:27,726 --> 01:12:29,426
Jesus Christ.

1029
01:12:30,662 --> 01:12:32,663
Larry Childs.

1030
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:35,766
<i>Yeah.
Larry Childs.</i>

1031
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:39,637
Do you think
he killed his mother?

1032
01:12:39,704 --> 01:12:41,204
I don't know.

1033
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,474
He was a career criminal
before you busted him.

1034
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,042
All I know is,
when that article came out,

1035
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,111
something snapped
in that kid.

1036
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:51,248
He was different after that.

1037
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:53,284
He was convinced...

1038
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:55,486
Childs killed his mother.

1039
01:12:57,054 --> 01:13:00,658
Sad thing is,
I know his father must have seen that article too.

1040
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:09,533
Can you imagine having your son look at you every day...

1041
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,468
thinking you betrayed him?

1042
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:15,806
Can you imagine that?

1043
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,123
- This yours?
- Yeah.

1044
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:35,492
There you go.
How's it going?

1045
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,028
- Is that your mom?
- Oh, yeah.

1046
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:39,863
Yeah?

1047
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:41,665
He's pretty cute.

1048
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:43,300
What are you doing
here, Sean?

1049
01:13:44,736 --> 01:13:46,337
Hey, you like cake?
Yeah.

1050
01:13:46,404 --> 01:13:48,071
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1051
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:51,375
You should really think about
taking him to Tina's in Bushwick.

1052
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:52,976
Best cake in New York.

1053
01:13:53,044 --> 01:13:55,078
Give the ball back.
Come on. We gotta go.

1054
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:58,349
You know, you really
shouldn't be here, Sean.

1055
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:00,984
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

1056
01:14:01,052 --> 01:14:02,853
I-I got your address
from the station,

1057
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,521
and, um, I looked it up,

1058
01:14:04,589 --> 01:14:06,890
and there was only
two parks in your area.

1059
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,025
And I figured this one's
better suited for kids,

1060
01:14:09,093 --> 01:14:12,496
so I thought I'd probably
find you here.

1061
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:14,097
Every other Wednesday, right?

1062
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:17,868
[Horn Honking]

1063
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:21,238
- Is that his father?
- Come on. We'll talk about it tomorrow, Sean.

1064
01:14:21,305 --> 01:14:22,873
Let's go.

1065
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:30,614
There he is.
How was your day with your mom?

1066
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:32,048
Good.

1067
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:33,116
Hey.
Hey.

1068
01:14:35,353 --> 01:14:36,920
Everything okay?

1069
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:40,123
Richard, please,
just give me one second. Please.

1070
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:42,693
- Sean, you gotta leave right now.
- I am leaving.

1071
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:44,728
I just wanted to thank you.

1072
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:48,064
I'm giving it all up.
Like you said.

1073
01:14:48,132 --> 01:14:49,800
I'm moving on with my life.

1074
01:14:50,802 --> 01:14:52,403
You should move on
with yours.

1075
01:14:54,105 --> 01:14:56,407
No. This isn't over, Sean.

1076
01:14:56,474 --> 01:14:57,941
It is for me.

1077
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,116
I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Bye, baby. I love you.

1078
01:15:09,387 --> 01:15:11,187
You ready?
Yeah.

[Sighs]
I don't know.

1084
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:02,973
Honestly.

1085
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,510
Going crazy maybe.
Why? What's up?

1086
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:09,145
<i>Uh, you see the news?</i>

1087
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:10,781
No, why?

1088
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:13,383
<i>Childs cut a deal.</i>

1089
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:16,252
<i>It's official.
He must have had dirt on someone.</i>

1090
01:16:19,123 --> 01:16:21,358
What was his sentence?

1091
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:24,027
<i>Two years.</i>

1092
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:26,262
<i>And then he's in
the Witness Protection.</i>

1093
01:16:31,202 --> 01:16:33,370
<i>Two years.
Yeah.</i>

1094
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:34,938
<i>Just thought
you'd want to know.</i>

1095
01:16:35,006 --> 01:16:37,207
Okay.

<i>Thank you.
I'm sorry, Teresa.</i>

Two years.

1098
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,871
Mind getting me one?

1099
01:17:12,176 --> 01:17:15,612
Thanks.
I can never get my arm down far enough.

1100
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:18,949
I'm sorry. I don't--
I don't even know your name.

1101

I'm Amanda Richards.

1104

How come I've never seen you
around these things before?

1105
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:31,562
Uh, been pretty busy.

1106

Hitting the books a lot.

1107
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,066
Looks like
they've been hitting back.

1108
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:38,936
That's a serious boo-boo
you got right there.

1109
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:42,039
What happened?
Oh, um, I fell.

1110
01:17:42,874 --> 01:17:45,308
You fell?
Yeah, off my bike.

1111
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:48,278
You fell off your bike?

1112
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:50,047
Are you lying to me,
Sean Donovan?

Well, if you must know,

1115
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:57,554
I, uh, got into a fight
with a pimp...

1116
01:17:57,622 --> 01:18:00,824
and he caught me in the arm
with a baseball bat.

1117
01:18:00,892 --> 01:18:03,393
It looks worse than it is.
[Laughs]

1118

I'm not your girl, Bruce.

[Bruce] You're not cheating on me,
are you?

01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:14,805
- Bruce, will you take a walk?
- Hey, you go to my school.

I just want to talk to
you for a second.

What, you can't talk
to me now?

1125
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:26,282
- Fine. Give me a minute.
- Don't make me wait.

1126
01:18:29,386 --> 01:18:31,321
I'm sorry about that.

1127

He seems like a nice guy.

1128

He's not that bad.

1129
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:37,894

but I'll see you later, okay?

01:24:53,604 --> 01:24:56,139
Remember when you were
drunk all the time?

1197
01:24:58,075 --> 01:25:00,544
Remember those days, Dad?

1198
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,347
'Cause I do.

1199
01:25:04,415 --> 01:25:07,884
I remember this one time...

1200
01:25:07,951 --> 01:25:09,452
with the belt.

1201
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,422
And you were going
in on me real good!

1202
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,692
But Mom got in the way,
and you didn't like that, did you, Dad?

1203
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:19,429
So it was Mom's turn.

1204
01:25:19,497 --> 01:25:21,364
But she was
a lot bigger than me.

1205
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:24,867
So you could really put your shoulder into it.
Right, Dad!

1206
01:25:28,005 --> 01:25:29,405
I--

1207
01:25:29,473 --> 01:25:31,507
I remember...

1208
01:25:31,575 --> 01:25:34,043
standing there--

1209
01:25:34,111 --> 01:25:36,412
Watched you beat her!

1210
01:25:38,182 --> 01:25:40,016
And I--

1211
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:43,486
And I just stood there,
and I did nothing!

1212
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:51,560
Because I was afraid that you
would start hitting me again!

1213
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:02,906
I was a coward then.

1214
01:26:07,144 --> 01:26:08,644
But I'm not
a coward anymore.

1215
01:26:08,712 --> 01:26:11,881
- Whoa! Whoa! Put the gun down!
- For fucking money?

1216
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:14,717
- Get that gun outta my face.
- Piece of shit! For fucking money?

1217
01:26:14,785 --> 01:26:17,887
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about!

1218
01:26:17,955 --> 01:26:20,356
Don't treat me like a kid.
I'm not stupid.

1219
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:22,858
You understand?
I'm not fucking stupid.

1220
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:27,663
I'm talking
about Larry Childs.

1221
01:26:29,766 --> 01:26:30,766
What?

1222
01:26:30,834 --> 01:26:32,802
Yeah, your old pal Larry.

1223
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:35,638
How much money
did you get for her?

1224
01:26:35,705 --> 01:26:37,573
How much was she worth?

1225
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:40,910
You motherfucker.
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1226
01:26:40,978 --> 01:26:43,479
Now put the fucking gun-- I do
know what I'm talking about!

1227
01:26:43,547 --> 01:26:45,048
Yes, I do.

1228
01:26:45,115 --> 01:26:47,917
You collected money
on her life insurance.

1229
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:49,953
What?

1230
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,555
That's how we got out
of that shit neighborhood!

1231
01:26:52,622 --> 01:26:55,491
Yeah.
Sean, you better get that fucking gun out of my face.

1232
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,726
- And I mean now.
- Stay the fuck back.

1233
01:26:57,794 --> 01:27:00,796
- Get that fucking gun out of my face.
- Stay the fuck back!

1234
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,666
Goddamn it!
You think I killed my wife?

1235
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:06,135
Your mother?
Is that what you think?

1236
01:27:06,203 --> 01:27:08,171
I know you did.
I know you did!

1237
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:10,940
You don't know shit.

1238
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:18,281
Larry Childs. Okay.

1239
01:27:19,749 --> 01:27:21,951
So, yeah,
I knew Larry Childs.

1240
01:27:22,752 --> 01:27:24,820
You must have seen him.

1241
01:27:24,888 --> 01:27:27,857
But you didn't recognize him
from that night, Sean.

1242
01:27:27,924 --> 01:27:30,259
I heard him call you Rock.

1243
01:27:30,327 --> 01:27:32,061
Your nickname Rock!

1244
01:27:32,129 --> 01:27:35,498
Sean! You're wrong. Okay?

1245
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,702
You made a mistake then,
and you're making one now.

1246
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,008
Now, what is more likely,

1247
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:48,044
that I had your mother killed,
my wife,

1248
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:51,780
for that life insurance money,

1249
01:27:51,848 --> 01:27:55,851
or that I didn't get you the help
you needed when you needed it?

1250
01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:00,756
What kind of man
do you think I am?

1251
01:28:12,002 --> 01:28:13,602
Okay.

1252
01:28:18,775 --> 01:28:21,444
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1253
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:23,879
Don't be.
Don't be sorry.

1254
01:28:23,947 --> 01:28:26,382
It'll be okay.

1255
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:29,185
I'm sorry
I can't believe you.

1256
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:33,389
[Gunshot]

1257
01:28:52,876 --> 01:28:54,643
[Sean]
He killed her.

1258
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:58,047
Hired that animal
to kill her.

1259
01:28:59,783 --> 01:29:02,318
Where's your father, Sean?

1260
01:29:02,386 --> 01:29:04,520
Somebody broke in.

1261
01:29:05,622 --> 01:29:08,424
I found him
in the basement.

1262
01:29:10,727 --> 01:29:12,228
He's dead.

1263
01:29:20,804 --> 01:29:24,039
You said you wanted
to help me, Teresa.

1264
01:29:38,688 --> 01:29:40,623
[Sean]
My name is Sean Donovan.

1265
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:44,427
When I was nine years,
a woman was murdered in front of my eyes.

1266
01:29:46,463 --> 01:29:48,531
Her name was Mary Donovan.

1267
01:29:49,899 --> 01:29:52,034
She was my mother.

1268
01:29:59,643 --> 01:30:02,378
My life changed that night.

1269
01:30:02,446 --> 01:30:04,713
It changed
how I see the world.

1270
01:30:08,652 --> 01:30:12,555
I tell you this because I think that
night changed your life as well.

1271
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:17,026
I know the suffering
you must go through every day,

1272
01:30:17,093 --> 01:30:19,629
hearing the cries of
your victims in your head,

1273
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:22,331
seeing my mother's face
in your dreams,

1274
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,901
praying that one day
the pain will stop.

1275
01:30:33,009 --> 01:30:35,744
That is why I write you today.

1276
01:30:35,812 --> 01:30:38,247
To help you ease your pain.

1277
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:42,751
To let you know that I forgive you for what you did.

1278
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,858
I ask only this,

1279
01:30:49,926 --> 01:30:52,261
that you help ease my pain.

1280
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:55,698
Let me know if my father
was a part of this murder.

1281
01:30:55,765 --> 01:30:57,733
Let me clear my conscience...

1282
01:30:57,801 --> 01:31:00,269
and let my mother
rest in peace.

1283
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,980
All I want is the truth.

1284
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:15,551
The truth, and I will stay quiet
for the rest of my life.

1285
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:22,024
I've provided you with
a safe way to answer me.

1286
01:31:22,092 --> 01:31:26,929
I've included a return envelope
and two stamps.

1287
01:31:26,996 --> 01:31:31,133
Place the black stamp on the
envelope if my father is guilty,

1288
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:32,901
the red stamp if he's not.

1289
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:35,471
Childs.

1290
01:31:43,213 --> 01:31:45,448
[Sean] I implore you to help me in this matter,

1291
01:31:45,515 --> 01:31:49,652
as it would be hard for me to
continue forgiving you if you do not.

1292
01:32:08,438 --> 01:32:10,606
I wish you well, Mr. Childs.

1293
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:18,514
Sincerely,
Sean Donovan.

1294
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,298
[Gasping]
