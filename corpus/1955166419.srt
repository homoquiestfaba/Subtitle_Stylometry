1
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,439
I don't think you realize
what a godsend you are.

2
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:58,343
Not many people jump at the
opportunity to stay here alone.

3
00:01:58,345 --> 00:01:59,277
Why?

4
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,845
Oh, old ghost stories.

5
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:03,347
This is the oldest house
in the city, you know.

6
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,215
Lots of history.

7
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,283
A few unpleasant nicknames.

8
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:09,251
We've tried to rebuild
the reputation in the

9
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:15,389
neighborhood, but then last
winter the caretaker, well...

10
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,257
Yes?

11
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,192
Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

12
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:20,626
Please.

13
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:24,596
Well, poor girl, she, she
threw herself off the

14
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:25,763
upstairs balcony.

15
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,600
Why did she do that?

16
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,335
Hard to say, really.

17
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,170
But you needn't
worry about that.

18
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:36,372
This really is a
lovely old house.

19
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,374
It will take care of you,
and I'm certain there

20
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,508
won't be a single problem.

21
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,475
Of course not, ma'am.

22
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,809
Good.

23
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,343
Will a check be alright?

24
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,344
Yes.

25
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:44,911
Splendid.

26
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:47,647
Oh, I mustn't keep them waiting.

27
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,815
I left our telephone
number by the phone.

28
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:53,618
Feel free to call any time about
anything, even to say hello.

29
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,385
I will.

30
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,319
You're a doll.

31
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,720
Toodle-oo.

32
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,300
Darling.

33
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:47,296
Poor girl.

34
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,799
She threw herself off the
upstairs balcony.

35
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,036
Yes?

36
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:39,773
Hello?

37
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,641
Darling, is that you?

38
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,677
I wanted to check in and
make sure the first night

39
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,978
went smoothly.

40
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,748
I forgot to mention to you,
please, have your references

41
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,382
reach out to us.

42
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:52,316
Who?

43
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,017
Andrew Dopling or something.

44
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:54,851
Abbott?

45
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,185
Yes, that's it.

46
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,686
They were odd.

47
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:59,721
Uh, I'll try them for you.

48
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,757
I still haven't received my
final payment from them anyway.

49
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,325
Just give them the
number I left for you.

50
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:09,296
Uh, ma'am, there's one
room that I can't get into.

51
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,231
Yes?

52
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,668
Um, the room at the
end of the hall.

53
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,971
Don't concern yourself
with that room, dear.

54
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,405
Is that understood?

55
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,307
It must remain
locked at all times.

56
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,875
Am I clear?

57
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,142
Yes ma'am.

58
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,209
Thank you again.

59
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,311
- Goodbye, dear!
- Ma'am?

60
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:49,149
Miss?

61
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,353
Miss?

62
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,320
Oh, god!

63
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:57,055
Uh, Jesus,
I'm sorry. Sorry.

64
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:59,424
I just, you dropped this.

65
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,863
Here.

66
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,832
Sorry for frightening you.

67
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:15,201
Okay.

68
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:17,236
Alright then. Bye.

69
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:43,769
Hell...

70
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:45,937
Hello?

71
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,943
Hello? Hello?
Hello, are you there?

72
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:08,274
Hi.

73
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,942
Can I...?

74
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,517
Is anybody sitting here?

75
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,451
No.

76
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:22,019
Do you mind if I sit?

77
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:23,286
Eh...

78
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:29,924
Now I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

79
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:34,929
Uh, I just hope your
boyfriend doesn't come and

80
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,171
hit me in the back of the head.

81
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:38,464
Don't worry.

82
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,468
Have you...
Been here before?

83
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,470
Why?

84
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:47,437
You know, I don't know.

85
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:50,506
Um, maybe I'm mistaken.

86
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:53,675
What do you mean?

87
00:32:53,677 --> 00:32:57,011
Heh, I just, i-i guess
you look familiar.

88
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,646
I just have one of those faces.

89
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,314
Yeah.

90
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:03,382
Yeah, I guess so.

91
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,619
Hey, can I get you something?

92
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,087
Like what?

93
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,422
Uh, a drink.

94
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,925
Let me get, um, two gins.

95
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,960
Do you like gin?

96
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:19,594
Sure.

97
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,213
Very nice.

98
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,715
Thank you.

99
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:52,323
You're sure you're not
waiting for anybody?

100
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,093
I was waiting for you.

101
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:58,695
Heh, that's, that's funny.

102
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,363
It's true.

103
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:02,531
It's also very flattering.

104
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,133
Uh, heh.

105
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:10,437
I am gonna get another round.

106
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,742
You too?

107
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,711
Let me get, uh, two more.

108
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:22,713
Why not?

109
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:30,453
So uh, what do you
do for, uh, work?

110
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:31,287
Hm?

111
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:34,089
For work, your job?

112
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,990
Nothing, really.

113
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,298
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

114
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,399
W-where're you going?

115
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:49,567
I'll be right back.

116
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,001
Huh?

117
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,669
Don't go anywhere.

118
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:54,203
Okay.

119
00:35:59,663 --> 00:36:01,296
You alright?

120
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,463
Yes.

121
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:03,630
Don't I look alright?

122
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,498
Oh yeah, you look great.

123
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,665
Thank you.

124
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,567
I, I'm just, uh, waiting
for another drink.

125
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:10,768
I don't know where
the bartender is.

126
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,204
Do you want to come
back to my place?

127
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,104
What?

128
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,806
It's not far.

129
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,475
There's plenty of Brandy.

130
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,510
It's free.

131
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,947
Yeah.

132
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:30,283
Yeah, uh, let me just cash out.

133
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,556
Alright.

134
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:38,890
Let's go.

135
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:15,490
Uh, are you joking?

136
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:18,592
Are you coming?

137
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,527
This is your place?

138
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,475
You can sit here.

139
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:43,246
Oh my god!

140
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:49,551
You know, I gotta tell
you, I never pictured you

141
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:51,286
living in a place like this.

142
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:52,887
Why not?

143
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,922
Well, because...

144
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,490
I'm sorry.

145
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:01,326
Well, they have got to
tell you this kind of

146
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:03,261
thing before you move in, right?

147
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,630
That it's haunted?

148
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:07,698
Okay.

149
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,033
So they must've gave you
a big discount, or...

150
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:13,669
Which is obviously none
of my business, but...

151
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,771
No. Please.

152
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:19,975
I mean, it's just stories I
heard when I was growing up.

153
00:38:19,977 --> 00:38:24,312
But basically, they used
to tell us about this, uh,

154
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:25,780
old lunatic.

155
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:30,350
Used to live here, perform
these rituals in one of

156
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:35,788
trying to conjure up the living
devil or something like that.

157
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,490
It was kids' stories,
mostly, but...

158
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,658
You grew up here?

159
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,461
Yeah, I grew up just a few
blocks south of here,

160
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,563
so don't hold that against me.

161
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:53,969
Hey, uh, you know what, I
gotta be honest with you.

162
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:59,473
This isn't something I ever
really do with anybody.

163
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:01,975
The thing is, i-i just got
this big promotion, so..

164
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:04,310
Do what?

165
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:08,012
W-whatever it is
we're doing.

166
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,583
We're having a drink.

167
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:14,952
Oh yeah, yeah.

168
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,720
Of course.

169
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,522
It's just...

170
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:26,093
It's funny, I uh...

171
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,994
Phew.

172
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:33,432
It's just not every day
I uh, go out and meet

173
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:37,536
somebody like you,
who's so open.

174
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:41,540
This whole city is...

175
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,743
Always on the defensive,
and it's just...

176
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:48,379
It's refreshing to meet
somebody who doesn't

177
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:52,416
immediately think
you're a maniac.

178
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:56,586
You're one of the good guys.

179
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:58,887
I try to be.

180
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,558
You're not lying to me?

181
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,059
Hey.

182
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:12,665
Tell you what, does it
look like I'm lying?

183
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:15,467
Just one of those faces, Henry.

184
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,603
Mm, what?

185
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:20,904
No, i-I'm telling
you the truth.

186
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:24,707
I am honestly one
of the good ones.

187
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:27,609
Look, I waiting for my
friends at the bar.

188
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:29,043
Ask them!

189
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:32,546
I would never in a million
years just go home with

190
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:36,116
someone I just met, who
invited me to their house.

191
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,851
If I told them that,
and for whiskey?

192
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,586
They would laugh in my face!

193
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:41,988
I tell you what would be
really funny, we should

194
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,691
give them a ring later on
and tell them, tell them

195
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,826
that it's entirely
possible to have a cordial

196
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,628
meeting with someone when you
just met them at a bar 'cause...

197
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,795
Oogh!

198
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:09,509
Agh!

199
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,716
Oh god, ah...

200
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:22,552
Why did you come here tonight?

201
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,989
What did you expect?

202
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:32,426
You didn't even ask me my name.

203
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,697
Did you want to fuck me?

204
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:38,497
Agh!

205
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,865
Ahh!

206
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,972
Remember me?

207
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,741
Do you remember me?

208
00:41:56,011 --> 00:42:00,847
Because I remember you,
Henry Sullivan.

209
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:09,982
I remember every single
thing about that night.

210
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:22,932
Why did you do it?

211
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:28,069
Why did you pick me?

212
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,940
What did I ever do to you?

213
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:38,977
Why did you pick me?

214
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:41,945
Answer me!

215
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,079
Fuck you!

216
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:45,513
Agh!

217
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:09,789
Help me.

218
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:14,926
Help me.

219
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:16,861
Help me.

220
00:44:19,764 --> 00:44:20,964
Help me.

221
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,799
Help me.

222
01:03:19,918 --> 01:03:21,285
Hello?

223
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:25,922
Darling, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

224
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:27,757
Ma'am?

225
01:03:27,759 --> 01:03:31,227
We finally got a hold
of your references.

226
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:32,228
You did?

227
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,362
Yes.

228
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:36,498
Dr. Abbott.

229
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,900
Dr. Abbott?

230
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:41,769
You never cared for
his family, did you?

231
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,307
We know what you did, dear.

232
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:53,845
Darling?

233
01:03:56,248 --> 01:04:00,851
I couldn't let him live
with what he did to me.

234
01:04:00,853 --> 01:04:05,121
But Dr. Abbott...

235
01:04:05,123 --> 01:04:07,556
He says I'm okay.

236
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,227
He says I'm okay now.

237
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:14,862
We're not mad, dear.

238
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:16,430
We would just like you...

239
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:18,532
We would just like you to leave.

240
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:21,801
Take your things and leave.

241
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:23,269
We would just like you to leave.

242
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:28,907
I saw him walking around.

243
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:35,312
Henry Sullivan.

244
01:04:36,947 --> 01:04:41,050
I saw him walking around
the street the other day.

245
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:43,185
Right in front of me.

246
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:50,123
I couldn't let him live
with what he'd done to me.

247
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,925
Darling?

248
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:59,498
What do you mean you "saw him
walking around the other day?"

249
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,533
Ma'am?

250
01:05:01,535 --> 01:05:04,903
Did you do something
to somebody?

251
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:06,271
Did you do something
to somebody?

252
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:08,006
Can you hear me?

253
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,541
Can you hear me?

254
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:12,843
Ma'am?

255
01:05:17,249 --> 01:05:18,481
Please just listen to me.

256
01:05:18,483 --> 01:05:20,082
You can keep the money.

257
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,084
Please, just go home.

258
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:24,386
Is it true what they
say about this place?

259
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:26,554
What? Who?

260
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:33,026
That someone tried to conjure
the devil here once.

261
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:39,397
It happened in that room,
didn't it?

262
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,635
The one upstairs.

263
01:05:50,474 --> 01:05:52,942
They made me do it.

264
01:05:58,248 --> 01:05:59,881
Ma'am?

265
01:06:02,618 --> 01:06:06,621
I think I'll become one
of your ghost stories now.

266
01:06:06,623 --> 01:06:07,989
What?

267
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:09,290
Hello?

268
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:11,191
Hello?

269
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:47,391
What did you make me do to him?

270
01:10:22,622 --> 01:10:25,189
We can't cuff the guy unless...

271
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:27,124
She said there was a murder?

272
01:10:27,126 --> 01:10:29,493
I-I-I don't know.
That's...

273
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:06,294
Now we got four
guys trying to...

274
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:10,831
Hey, listen, shut the
fuck up! Alright?

275
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,967
- Do you have the keys?
- I'm sorry. Jesus!

276
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,702
Lighten up, will you?

277
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,369
It's a good story.

278
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:20,338
Come on...

279
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:35,818
Hello?

280
01:12:25,495 --> 01:12:27,929
This is the one you
were here for...

281
01:12:34,035 --> 01:12:36,469
You can be free.

282
01:14:33,612 --> 01:14:37,214
You don't know how much of
a godsend you are, really.

283
01:14:37,216 --> 01:14:39,883
Oh, well it was
fortunate for me, too.

284
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:45,221
Somebody at such late notice,
especially with our reputation.

285
01:14:45,223 --> 01:14:47,056
Reputation?

286
01:14:47,058 --> 01:14:50,692
With the previous caretakers.

287
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:57,799
Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.
