00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:50,986
[soft music playing]

3
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,856
Hi, there.
Hello.

4
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,829
[in French]

5
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:38,165
Espresso. We've just got the
regular type of coffee here.

6
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,670
Uh... two, please.

7
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,010
[in French]

8
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,720
[sighs]

9
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:01,657
[groans]

10
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:03,960
Ugh.

11
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,072
Okay.

12
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,940
[car engine starts]

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:55,144
[woman on CD] Bonjour.
<i>You have completed lesson 25. Well done.</i>

14
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:58,747
<i>At this point you should have a
firm grasp of the French language.</i>

15
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:03,118
<i>Let's continue.</i>
[speaks French]

16
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,691
[in French]

17
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,139
[man 1] I wish I would've been
able to see that.

18
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:27,709
[man 2] Grant is without a doubt the
worst boss on the face of the Earth.

19
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:31,047
One of these days I'm going to
punch him in the goddamn throat.

20
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,715
I can promise you that.

21
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:35,184
Are you talking about Grant?
We are.

22
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:38,121
I was thinking we should pull
an office prank on Grant.

23
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:40,456
You know, put, like,
an air horn under his chair

24
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,159
so when he sits down it makes
a really loud noise.

25
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,162
Or set fire to his house.
Something along those lines.

26
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,665
I think Maggie gave birth
recently.

27
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,766
Grant's wife, Maggie.

28
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,870
Actually, I... I know she did.

29
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:56,072
I went to the cookout at his house
last weekend. They were there

30
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:58,676
with their new baby
and their two other children.

31
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,980
It was actually
a really nice cookout.

32
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,980
Quality meats and sides.

33
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:08,217
There was even a raffle for a gift
card to that new restaurant in town.

34
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,790
Most of the office was there. Some of
them even wore their swimsuits, so...

35
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,727
Maybe burning down
the house isn't...

36
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,796
the best...

37
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,299
[quietly] But yeah, sometimes...

38
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:26,169
Sometimes, here at the office,
Grant will give me an assignment,

39
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,504
such as auditing
an expense report,

40
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:31,308
and even though it's part
of my job, reports and auditing,

41
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,245
it can be frustrating.

42
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,314
What's that magazine
you're reading?

43
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,249
What department are you in?

44
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,052
Accounting.

45
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,822
So you're the one who audits
our expense reports.

46
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,956
Yeah.

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,760
Get the fuck out of here.

48
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,134
[printing]

49
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:47,378
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,815
I didn't know we were out.

51
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:11,104
[motorcycle approaching]

52
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,978
[man] Do you have a gun?

53
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,849
[Casey] What?

54
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,171
[motorcycle engine revving]

55
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:50,009
[motorcycle approaching closer]

56
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,026
[grunting]

57
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,363
No, no, no. No, please don't.

58
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,298
Oh, here, here.
You can take my wallet.

59
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,169
There's $10 plus a gift card
to the new restaurant in town.

60
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,338
Oh!

61
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,105
[groans]

62
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,409
[grunting]

63
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,346
[coughing]

64
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:28,915
Why are you doing this?

65
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:32,219
[groaning]

66
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,525
[monitor beeping]

67
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,529
[male reporter] <i>There was
yet another mugging last night.</i>

68
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:47,065
<i>This one putting a 35-year-old
dog owner in critical condition.</i>

69
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,134
<i>The motorcycle-riding assailants
are still at large.</i>

70
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,336
[girl] Daddy, there's a doggy
in here.

71
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:54,107
[reporter] <i>In an official statement,
police are urging residents</i>

72
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:58,211
<i>to stay indoors after dark,
adding that if you must go outside,</i>

73
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:01,781
<i>you should carry a weapon,
such as a gun or a large knife.</i>

74
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:05,217
[machine beeps] <i>You have
only one unheard message.</i>

75
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:10,023
- [beeps]
- <i>Hey, Casey. Uh, this is Grant, your boss. From work.</i>

76
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,392
<i>Just calling to check in on you.
See how you're doing.</i>

77
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,527
<i>I want you to know you can take
all the time you need.</i>

78
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,129
<i>We can keep you on paid leave
for another week</i>

79
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,499
<i>and then it'll just start counting
towards your vacation time.</i>

80
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:23,436
<i>Uh, but you've got so much of that
built up, so I wouldn't be concerned.</i>

81
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,139
<i>Hey, maybe you could take that trip
to France you're always talking about.</i>

82
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:29,810
<i>I hear the people there are lovely
and the food is supposed to be...</i>

83
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:33,982
[beeps] <i>No one else left you
a message.</i>

84
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,137
[sighs]

85
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:40,348
I'm sorry. I can't go out there.

86
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,462
[grunting on TV]

87
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,401
- [man groans]
- [thudding]

88
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:02,469
<i>This isn't how
it's supposed to be.</i>

89
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:06,543
<i>I was supposed to win.
You didn't play by the rules.</i>

90
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,412
<i>There never were any rules.</i>

91
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,381
[man screams]

92
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,650
[gunshot on TV]

93
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,373
[sighs]

94
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:42,677
Can I help you?
I'm interested in buying a gun.

95
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,179
Are you a hunter?

96
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,680
No. It would be
for self-defense.

97
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,416
I need something that can fit
into my hand.

98
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,754
It sounds like you're after
a handgun.

99
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:56,693
How about something like this?

100
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:09,671
Yes. This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

101
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:12,309
I can hold it
in my hand quite easily.

102
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,782
I'll run the background check
and file the necessary paperwork.

103
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,651
Yeah, is there some sort
of box you can put this in?

104
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,819
Or a bag?
Sorry.

105
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:28,289
There is a waiting period before
you can legally purchase this gun.

106
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,693
It's so a person who is upset
with another person

107
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:33,763
can't come in here and buy
a gun to shoot that person with.

108
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,699
Instead, they have to wait a little
while before they can do that.

109
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:40,702
Do you have any children?
No, I don't. Just a dog.

110
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:44,272
Good. If you did have children I would warn
you that their risk of accidental death

111
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,441
increases drastically
with a gun in the home

112
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:49,779
but since you don't have children
that statistic is irrelevant to you.

113
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,714
You did mention self-defense,
though.

114
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:55,384
Be cautious.
In a violent altercation,

115
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:59,588
an armed victim is much more likely to be
shot and killed than an unarmed victim.

116
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,526
Suicide is more common
with gun owners too.

117
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:06,197
You're really going
to love owning a gun.

118
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,701
I'm sure you're right.

119
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,475
[shouting]

120
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,648
[shouting continues]

121
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:36,227
[shouting]

122
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:49,839
Ha!

123
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,375
Ha!

124
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,850
Karate's a language.

125
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,818
It's a way of communicating.

126
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:08,390
When you were a child, you trained your vocal
chords to manipulate air to make words.

127
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:14,396
Then you learned how to combine those words
together so that they formed sentences.

128
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:18,568
Those sentences expressed
thoughts, wants, needs.

129
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,575
Every conversation that you had
was honing your skills.

130
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,877
And now,

131
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,314
after all these years,

132
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,585
you are black belts in speech.

133
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:37,954
So at this point
in your karate training,

134
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:41,591
you are learning how
to form words

135
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:44,961
with your fists and with feet.

136
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:48,299
You'll get to the point where you
don't even have to think about it.

137
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:51,870
Ask me a question.

138
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,841
What are your plans
for the weekend?

139
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,409
I am going to do some
grocery shopping

140
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:01,547
and rent a film.

141
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,480
Perhaps a comedy

142
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,651
to watch in the comfort

143
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,387
of my own...

144
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,356
home.

145
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,723
Hyah! Gah!

146
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:16,595
[shouts]

147
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,733
[continues shouting]

148
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,603
Oh! Ha!

149
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,342
Did that answer your question?

150
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,475
That's it for today.

151
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,478
Bow to me.

152
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:35,714
Bow to Grand Master.

153
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,758
I hope it's...

154
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,029
I hope it's all right
that I watched.

155
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,499
The hardest part of your karate journey is
walking through that door for the first time.

156
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,403
That's where most people fail.

157
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,637
What was your name?

158
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,941
[stuttering] Casey.

159
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,543
My name is Sensei.

160
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,712
Can anyone take classes?

161
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,647
The first lesson is free.

162
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,819
So why don't you come in
tomorrow and give it a shot?

163
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,655
I'll try.

164
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,565
Higher, Manny. You must attain
the proper angle.

165
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,501
Remember, you're punching
his nose up into his brain.

166
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,672
The key word is "up."

167
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,541
Okay, class. Line up.

168
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:40,011
We're going to work on
a rear naked strangle.

169
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,949
With karate, our goal is always
to end a fight with strikes.

170
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:46,817
Snapping an opponent's arm with
a karate chop, that'd be one way.

171
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:51,555
Or shattering their jaw with a perfectly
placed spinning wheel kick would be another.

172
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,859
But realistically,
when engaged in combat,

173
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:57,262
it is not a matter of if a fight
will end up on the ground,

174
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:58,830
it is a matter of when.

175
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,566
Manny?

176
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,405
This is called
"taking the back."

177
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,973
I am in the dominant position.

178
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,976
He is a mouse. I am a python.

179
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:15,448
I slide my arm around his neck,
my elbow under his chin.

180
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:21,720
Like a python, I slowly begin
to squeeze my mouse.

181
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:24,823
My arm cuts off the carotid
arteries on either side of his neck,

182
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,727
starving the brain
of oxygenated blood.

183
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:34,933
Students,
what is rule number eight?

184
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,538
[all] Tap or take a nap.

185
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,878
[Manny] Tap or take a nap.

186
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:48,082
Okay, let's give this technique
a try.

187
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,754
Bow to me.

188
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,725
Bow to Grand Master.

189
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,836
[Casey] Hi there.

190
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,872
You're an excellent teacher.

191
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,909
Usually it's the mothers that bring
the children, not the fathers.

192
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,778
Which one's yours?

193
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,848
Oh, I'm not a parent.
I'm actually a new student.

194
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,649
I'm taking my first class today.
You're a new white belt?

195
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:28,687
Is that the first belt color? White is
before color. You haven't earned color yet.

196
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:32,592
That makes sense, actually. I think
I need to borrow a uniform for class.

197
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:36,963
I was going to ask Sensei but I didn't see
him... You're lucky he doesn't see you.

198
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:40,366
You're lucky he doesn't see some
white belt disrespecting his dojo

199
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,068
and everything he's built.

200
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,936
What's the first rule?

201
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:47,008
The board is behind you.
What's rule number one? Oh...

202
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,546
No shoes on the mat.

203
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,685
Take off your fucking shoes,
white belt.

204
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,870
You need a gi
and you need a belt.

205
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:19,039
Is that what you're asking?
Yes.

206
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,242
[man 1] But say I'm at an ATM
and as my back is turned,

207
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,645
- a man grabs my throat from behind.
- [man 2] Okay.

208
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,849
- May I?
- [man 1] Of course.

209
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,718
In this instance, the first
thing thing you always have to do

210
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,787
is alleviate the pressure
on your neck.

211
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,124
Mm-hmm.
Now, your center of gravity

212
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:40,059
needs to be lower than mine,
so drop your hips.

213
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:41,762
Like this?
Exactly.

214
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,231
Now you can lift me off
my feet with ease.

215
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,000
[grunts]
Good.

216
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:51,070
See, even though I have your back,
you are now in the dominant position.

217
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:54,076
I have no control
and I can easily be thrown.

218
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,210
[sighs]

219
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,946
It's very effective.
Yes, it is.

220
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,748
What if they're resisting more?

221
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:02,750
Show me.

222
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,189
I see what you mean.

223
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:13,028
Probably, uh... [shouts]

224
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,764
I'd probably do something
like that.

225
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,207
There's a lot of testosterone
in this dojo.

226
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,110
That's the hormone men produce.

227
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:32,848
Women produce it too
but men produce much more.

228
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,719
Is this your first class?

229
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,186
It is.

230
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,090
Here, let me help with that.

231
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,194
You gotta start from the front,
not the back.

232
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,951
I noticed that your belt
is blue.

233
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,118
It is. Um...

234
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,820
I feel a connection to the color blue.
It suits me.

235
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:15,756
Is blue a high rank?

236
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,293
Blue is one
of the middle colors.

237
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:18,960
The order is white, yellow,

238
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:21,796
green, blue, purple, brown,
and black.

239
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:25,934
Some schools use different colors
or change the order of the colors

240
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:30,071
but our academy does it this way
and it's definitely the best way.

241
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,006
And what do the strips
of tape mean?

242
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,841
They're called stripes.
Stripes...

243
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:36,913
Stripes signify advancements
and achievements.

244
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,547
What does
the red stripe mean?

245
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,886
It means the person has killed
another person in combat.

246
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:47,121
I'm joking.
It's for instructors.

247
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:50,391
Anna, the brown belt, has a red stripe
and she teaches the children's class.

248
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,331
The only two people with red
stripes here are her and Sensei.

249
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:56,265
And what about the black stripe?

250
00:21:56,267 --> 00:22:00,101
Sensei only gives those to select
students, green belt and up.

251
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:03,073
Today is your first day, though.
I wouldn't worry about stripes.

252
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:14,818
[Sensei] It is wise to respect the
past but foolish to ignore innovation.

253
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,886
Grand Master understood this.

254
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:23,158
He would say, "The only moves worth
learning are the ones that work."

255
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,094
Just 'cause I'm a karateka
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

256
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,162
a bow and arrow choke
from Brazilian jiu-jitsu

257
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:31,834
or an inside heel hook
from Russian sambo.

258
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:34,403
I would teach a reverse wrist
splicer from Mongolian judo

259
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:37,273
if it worked and if it wasn't
something I just made up.

260
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:39,175
Rule number ten:

261
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:44,013
if it works, use it.

262
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:47,885
Which brings me
to today's lesson.

263
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,821
To kick with your fists...

264
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:55,257
and punch with your feet.

265
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,194
I'm Kennith,
what's your name?

266
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:59,063
Casey.

267
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:02,364
I'm glad you chose karate,
Casey.

268
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:06,236
It's an excellent martial art
and will likely change your life.

269
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,638
Would you like to go first?
Maybe you should go first.

270
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,875
[chuckles] Okay.

271
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:16,080
Ha!
[grunts]

272
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,883
Not in the day class.
I'm sorry, Sensei.

273
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,054
I forgot where I was.
It was an accident.

274
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,124
You all right?

275
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,333
I'm really glad you're here.

276
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,837
That punch got away from me.

277
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:41,471
I apologize.

278
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:43,208
Would you like to try?

279
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,179
[shouts]
Okay, that was a good first try.

280
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:53,216
It felt a little more like
a kick than a punch, though.

281
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:55,118
It felt like a kick to me too.

282
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,154
Your whole life you've known
that a foot can only kick.

283
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:00,325
You've known that
a foot cannot punch.

284
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,893
Forget everything that you know.

285
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,034
[shouts]
Much better.

286
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:12,435
That felt like a punch.

287
00:24:12,437 --> 00:24:15,003
A very weak punch,
but the most important thing

288
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,408
is that you're learning
to punch with your foot.

289
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,010
Let me show you again.

290
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,380
[shouts]

291
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:25,949
Don't think of it as me punching
your body with my foot.

292
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:30,088
Think of it as you striking
my foot with your body.

293
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,559
That makes perfect sense.

294
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:39,297
[shouts]

295
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,202
Wow. You have a wonderful sense
of balance.

296
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,204
I want to sign up for classes.

297
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:49,307
That's excellent news.

298
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,422
I'm gonna go ahead
and enter you into the system.

299
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,162
Name? Casey...

300
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,196
Davies.

301
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:15,468
That's a very
feminine-sounding name.

302
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:23,207
Age?

303
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:25,476
I turn 36 next month.

304
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:29,450
Do you know what that is in months?
The system does it in months.

305
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,483
[sighs]

306
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:35,955
- [typing]
- [calculator whirring]

307
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:42,427
Four hundred thirty-two
minus one.

308
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:45,429
- Is...
- [calculator whirring]

309
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:48,301
Four hundred and thirty-one
months old.

310
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:53,105
It sounds old
when you put it that way.

311
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,377
Why karate?

312
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:02,179
Um... This question's
multiple choice.

313
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,250
A, health and fitness,
B, career opportunity,

314
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:10,223
C, New Year's resolution, D,
self-defense/traumatic experience.

315
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:13,392
What if it's none of the above?

316
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:15,593
Should I read the choices again?

317
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:19,299
No, that's okay.
A, health and fitness.

318
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:39,116
This is the equipment room.

319
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:41,386
This room is off limits.
Do you understand?

320
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:42,589
Okay.

321
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,158
Wait here, please.

322
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:12,350
This is your belt.

323
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:14,586
Do not come to class
without your belt.

324
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:17,458
It is yours. It is sacred.

325
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,496
There will be a $15 charge
to replace a lost belt.

326
00:27:22,262 --> 00:27:23,497
[door closes]

327
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:37,544
[phone rings]

328
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:45,351
- Hello?
- [man] <i>Hi, may I speak to Ms. Casey Davies, please?</i>

329
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:47,353
This is him. I'm a man.

330
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:49,487
<i>My mistake.
I thought it was a woman's name.</i>

331
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:53,359
- Who is this?
- <i>I'm calling about your gun... the handgun.</i>

332
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,729
<i>Wait, I remember you now.
Yes, you are a man. Again, apologies.</i>

333
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,498
- That's all right.
- <i>It looks like your paperwork will go through</i>

334
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,472
<i>without any complications. Tomorrow morning
you'll be able to come and purchase your gun.</i>

335
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
<i>Are you still there?</i>

336
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:09,241
I don't need a gun anymore.

337
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,643
<i>You're not having
a child are you?</i>

338
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,445
<i>Because we sell
child safety locks</i>

339
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:13,646
<i>that work reasonably well.</i>

340
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,617
No. No child. I just...

341
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,452
- I found something else.
- <i>Don't tell me you bought a knife.</i>

342
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:22,254
<i>Knives are good for self-defense
too, but nine times out of ten</i>

343
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:25,758
<i>a person with a knife who gets into a
fight with a person with a gun will lose.</i>

344
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,396
- I didn't buy a knife.
- <i>Well, the paperwork is valid for the next six months.</i>

345
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,633
<i>In the meantime, I hope you don't
get attacked by anyone with a gun</i>

346
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:35,801
- <i>Or even a knife.</i>
- Goodbye.

347
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:37,605
- <i>Good luck...</i>
- [phone beeps]

348
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,814
Ha! Ha! Hyah!

349
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:50,418
Hmm... [shouts]

350
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:53,622
Next, go.

351
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,658
Ha! Ha!

352
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,462
Next, go.

353
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,363
Ha!

354
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,434
Go.

355
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:07,334
Ha!

356
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:09,369
Horrible.

357
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,340
You do that in a fight and your
opponent will laugh at you.

358
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,342
Next, Casey.

359
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:17,746
Ha!

360
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:20,716
Good.

361
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,452
Very good.

362
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:29,759
[classical music playing]

363
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,788
[phone rings]

364
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:10,297
- [machine beeps]
- <i>Hey, Casey. It's Grant... your boss.</i>

365
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:15,368
<i>From work. So, it's been two months
since you've been to the office.</i>

366
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,671
<i>How are you?</i>

367
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:18,906
<i>I've extended your leave
five weeks past</i>

368
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:20,641
<i>what I'd originally planned.</i>

369
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:22,744
<i>And your paycheck last week,</i>

370
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,879
<i>that actually came out
of my own pocket.</i>

371
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:27,814
<i>But I consider you a friend.</i>
[clears throat]

372
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:29,684
<i>Look, I hate to be
the bad guy here,</i>

373
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,652
<i>but I'm going to need you
to come in.</i>

374
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:33,521
<i>I can give you another day</i>

375
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:35,623
<i>but you have to come back
to work after that.</i>

376
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,325
<i>Or... I'm going to have
to let you go</i>

377
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,896
<i>and I really don't want
to have to do that.</i>

378
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:44,665
<i>Look, if it were up to me, I'd give you
all the time you need but my bosses...</i>

379
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:49,472
- [machines beeps]
- <i>The inbox is full. Please clear your messages.</i>

380
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:01,451
Who are all the new people?

381
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,753
Today's the promotion ceremony.

382
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:07,655
Everyone comes
to the promotion ceremony.

383
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,858
Even students who take the night class.
The night class?

384
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,427
Black stripes.

385
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,730
The color black represents
night.

386
00:31:15,732 --> 00:31:17,398
As in night class.

387
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,569
I think I'll stick
with the day class.

388
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:24,774
Now that I think about it you're
much more suited to the day class.

389
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:27,844
Me on the other hand...

390
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:31,146
I'm getting my stripe today.

391
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:33,148
I overheard Sensei talking
about it.

392
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,450
Oh, congratulations.
Thank you.

393
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:39,856
I have...
I have definitely earned it.

394
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:58,874
Today's a special day.

395
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,510
Not only is it a day in which
we recognize those of you

396
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,746
who have outgrown
your belt color,

397
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:08,517
it is also
an important anniversary.

398
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,855
Seven years ago today, Grand Master
was killed in a tragic hiking accident

399
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:14,792
where he was shot in the face
with a gun.

400
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:20,629
He was mistaken for a bird
by a hunter carrying a shotgun,

401
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:26,568
a type of gun that fires a cartridge which
scatters 10 to 20 pellets at its target.

402
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,205
Unlike our karate,
which is clean and precise,

403
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,843
this gun was imprecise
and boorish.

404
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,378
Rule number 11:

405
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,780
guns are for the weak.

406
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,048
That board isn't just
for children.

407
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,920
The rules apply to all of us.

408
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:03,540
Grand Master is the only person
ever to wear the rainbow belt.

409
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:07,010
It's a belt color
that he created

410
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:08,945
and awarded to himself.

411
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:13,649
It is the highest honor
in all of karate.

412
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:17,587
He achieved this rank after he challenged
and defeated all three other grand masters

413
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:20,025
in the state in unarmed combat
to the death.

414
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:25,560
He finished each fight
with his signature technique,

415
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:27,897
a technique only he knew.

416
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,568
A technique he never
even taught me.

417
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:36,708
He punched through his opponents'
heads with his index finger.

418
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,813
He was the greatest man
who ever lived.

419
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,687
I do not award belts.

420
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,056
My students earn them.

421
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:55,760
And this first belt goes
to someone who...

422
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,830
I see a little of myself in.

423
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:02,865
He has devoted himself to karate

424
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:06,672
and he has more than earned the
right to wear the color yellow.

425
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,510
Casey.

426
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:58,922
The progression from yellow belt
to green belt

427
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:02,126
is one of great sacrifice
and introspection.

428
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:07,067
It is filled with immeasurable
pain, both internal and external.

429
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:23,981
Thank you all for coming
to support each other.

430
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:27,184
We are family here...
[Henry] Isn't there something else?

431
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:29,087
What was that?

432
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:33,024
I just I wanted to make sure you
weren't forgetting something.

433
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,759
What would I be forgetting,
blue belt?

434
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:39,096
Uh... I heard there was going
to be another promotion tonight.

435
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:40,767
You heard that?

436
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,702
I did.

437
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,139
Something... black.

438
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,110
Oh...

439
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,145
Something black?

440
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,715
Actually...

441
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,984
you're correct.

442
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,885
Yeah. [laughs]

443
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:02,755
There is something black.

444
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:09,629
Well, I was saving it till the
very end for dramatic effect.

445
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:31,052
As I said before,
today is a special day.

446
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:34,953
Not only because it is
the unfortunate anniversary

447
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:37,222
of Grand Master being shot
and killed while on a hike

448
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:40,059
after being mistaken
for a bird by a hunter...

449
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:46,064
Today is the first time that I get to
promote one of my students to black belt.

450
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:49,136
This student has been
with us from the very beginning.

451
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,469
They are unquestioning.

452
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:54,840
Their loyalty is unwavering.

453
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:59,180
But most importantly, they know
that despite this black belt

454
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,182
they will always be
my student...

455
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,186
while I will always
be their teacher.

456
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,060
Thomas.

457
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,312
You're in my spot, brown belt.

458
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:35,748
Black is higher than brown.

459
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,185
Please move over to your left.

460
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:51,297
This concludes the ceremony. As always,
be sure to hold onto your old belts

461
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:53,966
so that if someone questions
the legitimacy of your rank,

462
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:58,806
you can prove them wrong first with
tangible evidence and then in combat.

463
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:14,353
- [man 1] Missionary.
- [man 2] That is the best position.

464
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:17,824
[man 1] I also like when I'm behind
her and she's on her hands and knees.

465
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:20,060
Doggy style.
Yes, doggy style.

466
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:22,231
That position is also
very nice.

467
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:44,186
[clock ticking]

468
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,810
All this stuff's yellow.

469
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:43,079
Paper, please.

470
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:47,350
[loud metal music playing]

471
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:56,959
Excuse me.

472
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,162
Did you door ding my car?

473
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,095
I don't know.
I think you did.

474
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:03,964
Then why'd you ask me?

475
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,167
Because I wanted to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

476
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,968
Okay, then no.
No, what?

477
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,971
I don't think I did.
But you did, though.

478
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,972
I say I didn't.
But it doesn't work that way.

479
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,309
You obviously did, I saw you...
Do you have a problem?

480
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:19,148
The part where you slammed your door into
my car. I have a problem with that. Yes.

481
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,351
I know karate.

482
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,053
What belt are you?
Yellow belt.

483
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,323
Your arms are holding
the grocery bag.

484
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,460
You have to drop the bag in order to
strike me. In the time it would take you

485
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,228
I would punch you
in the face as hard as I can.

486
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,266
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Do you have a problem?

487
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,109
You didn't slam your door
into my car.

488
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,278
So I don't have a problem.

489
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,180
No.

490
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,421
You? Karate?

491
00:40:58,288 --> 00:40:59,889
Impossible.

492
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:05,262
[sobbing]

493
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,973
No. Bad dog.

494
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,122
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,293
[shouts]

496
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,331
Ha!

497
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,236
Ha!

498
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,040
Ha! Fuck.

499
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,945
Are you sure this board
isn't meant for green belts?

500
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,347
Here, let me try.

501
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,553
Gah!

502
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,490
Here, try a white belt board.

503
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,379
Kicks and punches lacked
conviction today.

504
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,249
Maybe I was wrong.

505
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,386
Maybe you weren't ready
to be a yellow belt.

506
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,627
No.

507
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,529
You're not supposed to do that.

508
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,664
You're supposed to stand up
for yourself.

509
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,399
But you're right, though.

510
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,435
I wasn't able to break
a single board today.

511
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:56,140
And that stops you
from being a yellow belt, how?

512
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,141
If a bear's forest catches
on fire,

513
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,179
the bear is still a bear.

514
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,213
Even if a boat capsizes
in rough seas

515
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,850
and sinks to the bottom
of the ocean with no survivors,

516
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,520
it is still a boat.

517
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,423
You will be a yellow belt
until you die

518
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,629
or until you're a green belt.

519
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,599
And you will be a green belt
until you're a blue belt.

520
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,434
And so on.

521
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,073
I wish I could wear my belt
all the time.

522
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,175
I feel less-than without it.

523
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,581
Come with me.

524
00:43:42,221 --> 00:43:44,356
I want you to tell me
why you're here.

525
00:43:45,524 --> 00:43:48,659
I... I told you before,
it was my New Year's resolution.

526
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:51,262
I thought it was
health and fitness.

527
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:53,465
That's what I meant.

528
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,068
Why are you really here?

529
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:07,079
I was mugged...

530
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,449
at night, a few months ago.

531
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:13,184
I was beaten...

532
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,221
severely, by several men.

533
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:19,258
I'm afraid.

534
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,195
I'm afraid of the dark.

535
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:26,231
I'm afraid of other men.

536
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,469
They intimidate me.

537
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,239
I want to be
what intimidates me.

538
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,611
You came to the right place.

539
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:41,646
You're learning karate.

540
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:44,316
You're a blade
and I'm sharpening you.

541
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,385
But there's a mental component
as well.

542
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:52,292
You mean like...
believing in myself.

543
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,595
Yeah. That won't hurt.

544
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,131
I'm talking about something
a little different.

545
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,400
What's your favorite style
of music?

546
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:05,303
Adult contemporary.

547
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:08,140
No. It should be metal.

548
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:11,776
You ever listen to metal?

549
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:14,511
You mean like hard rock?

550
00:45:14,513 --> 00:45:18,282
Metal is much more aggressive
than hard rock.

551
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:20,685
From now on you'll listen to metal.
Yeah...

552
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,589
It's the toughest music
there is.

553
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,288
What about hobbies?

554
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:30,561
Is there anything you feel
particularly passionate about?

555
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:33,433
Other than your newfound passion
for metal?

556
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:36,434
I enjoy France.

557
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:41,572
I mean, French things.
I haven't actually been to France, but...

558
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:44,676
I'm learning the language and I
would like to visit there someday.

559
00:45:44,678 --> 00:45:46,577
No, no, no. That's not good.

560
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,247
Historically, the perception of
the French is that they are weak

561
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,782
and that they surrender easily.

562
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:53,351
Hardly traits that you want
to embrace.

563
00:45:53,353 --> 00:45:56,724
Russia, on the other hand,
is considered a tough country.

564
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:58,790
Also, Germany.

565
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,725
Germany is very strong
and capable.

566
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:02,260
My dog's breed is German.

567
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:04,596
Excellent. A German Shepherd.

568
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:06,330
A dachshund, actually.

569
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:10,301
Well, regardless, Germany it is.
Okay.

570
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:13,337
You must start thinking
this way. Do you understand?

571
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,342
In every facet of life. What you eat.
How you interact with others.

572
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:21,247
What arouses you. Everything
should be as masculine as possible.

573
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,456
As you know,

574
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,459
I teach a night class.

575
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:33,794
This...

576
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:35,830
is your invitation.

577
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:40,499
I've never opened this class up
to yellow belts before,

578
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:43,069
but I'm gonna make
an exception for you.

579
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:44,636
What time is the class?

580
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,672
It's at night.
It's a night class.

581
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:47,842
I don't think I can.

582
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:51,375
I won't make you do anything.

583
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,645
But like the color of the belt,

584
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,647
you've earned this stripe.

585
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:59,885
This invitation,
it will be yours forever.

586
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:03,524
Just because you ignore it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

587
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:19,806
Not only does this class offer you more
of what I believe you're looking for

588
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:24,445
but I guarantee you it will help
you become what you fear.

589
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,481
Casey...

590
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:30,585
stop being afraid.

591
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:57,813
[metal music playing]

592
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:11,693
[music continues]

593
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,935
[music volume increases]

594
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,837
The usual? Chocolate croissant
and orange juice?

595
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,672
No. I've got a new usual.

596
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:29,344
Coffee. Hot. Black.
With nothing to eat.

597
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:34,581
That's mine.
It's mine now.

598
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,686
I take what I want.
I only care about myself.

599
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,727
[in German]

600
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,502
[Grant] Hey there,
Casey.

601
00:48:57,706 --> 00:49:00,506
Listening to music?
I'm learning German.

602
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:04,212
German. That's very
international of you.

603
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:06,580
You may want to start
on those reports, though.

604
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:09,617
That pile is getting awfully high and
I don't want you to feel obligated

605
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:12,518
to come into the office
over the weekend.

606
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,656
Hey, Maggie asked me if you
wanted to come over for dinner.

607
00:49:15,658 --> 00:49:16,824
What do you say?

608
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:19,526
[groans, chokes]

609
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:22,663
Stop trying to be my friend. Bosses cannot
be friends. It doesn't work that way.

610
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:25,598
Instead of coming over for dinner
with you and your wife this weekend,

611
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,801
I'll stay home and masturbate
to the thought of your wife

612
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:29,837
wearing her bathing suit
at the barbecue.

613
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,941
[coughing]

614
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:34,808
We should do push-ups.

615
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,810
Hey. Shut up. Stop talking.

616
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:39,013
What did you say? You talk too much.
I don't talk, I act.

617
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:41,682
I punched him in the goddamn throat.
It felt amazing.

618
00:49:41,684 --> 00:49:44,020
Who?
Our boss, Grant.

619
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:51,025
Do you want to... join us?

620
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:53,527
But there's just
the three chairs.

621
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:54,965
I'll sit in your chair.

622
00:50:07,844 --> 00:50:09,845
We should do push-ups.

623
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:17,587
[door closes]

624
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:23,924
You're a good dog
and I care for you.

625
00:50:23,926 --> 00:50:26,595
That said,
I won't be petting you anymore.

626
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:29,531
I've been coddling you.

627
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,467
This is for your own good.

628
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:36,605
[in German]

629
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:40,938
Ho!

630
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,949
Sorry.

631
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,617
[sighs]

632
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,385
What are you doing?

633
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:59,687
You're not supposed to be here.
You don't have a black stripe.

634
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:01,625
I thought you were my friend.

635
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:05,094
A friend wouldn't say they were
a day class student

636
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:07,397
and then go to the night class
behind my back.

637
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:09,100
- I didn't.
- [door opens]

638
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:13,737
[door closes]

639
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:28,717
Our limbs get their strength
from leverage points.

640
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,055
An elbow can only bend one way because if it
could bend more than one way it would be weaker.

641
00:52:33,057 --> 00:52:35,758
But this design is
also inherently flawed.

642
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,163
Henry, come on up to the front. I want
you to help me demonstrate something.

643
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:50,908
Watch closely.

644
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:55,214
- [bone breaks]
- [screams]

645
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,894
Leverage is a weapon. You can use
it or it can be used against you.

646
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:13,931
You earned your blue belt.
I know I could never take that from you.

647
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:17,035
So I took your arm instead.

648
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:21,037
Never come back here.

649
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,175
Not even for the day class.

650
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:29,880
Everyone,

651
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:33,283
I'd like you to welcome Casey
to the night class.

652
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:35,087
He's a yellow belt.

653
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,257
All right. Let's begin.

654
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,965
[metal music playing]

655
00:54:16,863 --> 00:54:19,698
[music continues]

656
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:58,238
[grunting]

657
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:22,996
[groaning]

658
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:29,270
[grunting]

659
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,993
[crunching]

660
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:56,330
[grunting]

661
00:56:02,636 --> 00:56:04,838
You're done for the night.

662
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:08,208
So is he.

663
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:15,883
[Sensei] Can you...

664
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,218
drag him off the mat?

665
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:30,095
Learn to love this feeling.

666
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:35,302
Your bones aching.
Your chest screaming.

667
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,871
This is karate.

668
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:41,242
I have nothing else.

669
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:45,979
Congratulations on
a great class, everyone.

670
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:48,248
Let's begin the cool down.

671
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,315
They're all gonna cool down on the
mat, but since it's your first time,

672
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,885
I want you to cool down away
from the others.

673
00:57:25,286 --> 00:57:27,088
Come with me.

674
00:57:45,073 --> 00:57:48,307
I know you're probably a little
confused about what's happening.

675
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:52,348
Just know that every one of them out
there had to do this at one point.

676
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:04,358
Again, I'm sorry to make you
cool down with her.

677
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,127
She's a woman so her hands are
naturally weaker than a man's.

678
00:58:08,129 --> 00:58:13,399
An after-workout sports massage works best
with strong hands so I know this is not ideal.

679
00:58:13,401 --> 00:58:16,138
A massage from a woman is still
better than a self massage.

680
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:25,246
Well, what are you waiting for,
yellow belt?

681
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:33,021
Take off your jacket
and sit in front of me.

682
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:52,607
Sorry.

683
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:55,244
I know they're not
as strong as a man's.

684
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:02,418
So this is
the women's changing room?

685
00:59:03,118 --> 00:59:04,652
It is.

686
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:06,487
It's the same as the men's
in every way

687
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:08,991
only it's smaller
and not as nice.

688
00:59:10,593 --> 00:59:12,526
How long have you been taking
karate?

689
00:59:12,528 --> 00:59:15,396
I was one of the dojo's
first students when it opened.

690
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:18,131
And how long have you been
a brown belt?

691
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,503
The cool down is supposed
to be silent.

692
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,412
Why was he promoted
to black belt before you?

693
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:33,282
Is that why you fought him
tonight?

694
00:59:34,383 --> 00:59:36,416
You could have killed him.

695
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:38,118
It looked like you wanted to.

696
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,354
I was proving a point.

697
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:41,124
About your belt?
No.

698
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,393
About why I'm here.

699
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,563
Never hold back.

700
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:49,429
Not ever.

701
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:52,534
It will only make you weak
and you can't be weak anymore.

702
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:54,437
Not in the night classes.

703
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:58,173
Do you understand?

704
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:02,211
I think I do.

705
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:05,315
But then again, maybe I don't.

706
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,287
You will.

707
01:00:12,121 --> 01:00:15,191
This isn't a safe place, Casey.

708
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:31,341
My turn.

709
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:37,480
You can come in.

710
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:49,223
Your belt... it's yellow.

711
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:50,592
I had it made.

712
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:53,362
It's for everyday use
with casual clothing.

713
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:56,230
Obviously, I chose yellow
because I'm a yellow belt.

714
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:58,199
I wanted to wear my yellow belt
all the time

715
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:59,704
but I knew it would look
strange.

716
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:03,307
It really is a wonderful idea.

717
01:01:04,308 --> 01:01:05,741
To be honest,
I wish I'd thought of it.

718
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,676
Now I can be a yellow belt
in everyday life

719
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:09,547
in addition to being one
in this dojo.

720
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:13,681
I mentioned before
that I had it made.

721
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:15,551
It was a special order.

722
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:18,220
The thing is, the belt company
wouldn't make just one.

723
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:19,657
I had to make at least 50.

724
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:29,231
The positive out of this is that I have
enough for all of the other students.

725
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:32,136
I even had them make
a black one for you.

726
01:01:33,204 --> 01:01:35,239
I think it turned out
quite nice.

727
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,198
[chuckles]

728
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:04,770
I don't know what to say.

729
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:07,405
I'm honored.

730
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:10,773
How much did this all cost?
Oh, don't worry about that.

731
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:12,508
This is my gift to the academy.

732
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,443
Although, I was let go
from my accounting job

733
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:17,414
the other day, unexpectedly.
Wait, you have accounting experience?

734
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,648
Oh, ten years.

735
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,185
Or... 120 months.

736
01:02:22,486 --> 01:02:24,720
I'm looking for someone
to help manage the books here.

737
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:26,723
I can't keep up
with the growth of the academy.

738
01:02:26,725 --> 01:02:29,261
There's more money coming in.
It's overwhelming.

739
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:31,728
I could use a mind like yours.

740
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:35,031
It wouldn't be permanent,
just till you get things on track.

741
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:39,304
Well... thank you. Yes.
The answer is yes.

742
01:02:39,705 --> 01:02:41,473
Good.

743
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,341
You start tomorrow.

744
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,745
I'm sure you'll find another job by the
time you finish organizing the books here.

745
01:02:48,747 --> 01:02:50,750
Casey.
Yes?

746
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:54,352
I really am excited about
the belt.

747
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:01,493
[phone ringing]

748
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:10,366
- Hello?
- <i>Casey.</i>

749
01:03:10,368 --> 01:03:12,836
- Who is this?
- <i>The men you told me about.</i>

750
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:14,741
<i>Would you know them
if you saw them?</i>

751
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:17,641
Is that you, Sensei?

752
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:19,609
<i>The men.
The ones who attacked you.</i>

753
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:21,778
- I...
- <i>Would you know their faces?</i>

754
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,848
- [Sensei sighs]
- They were wearing helmets.

755
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:27,885
- Motorcycle helmets.
- <i>So you didn't see their faces?</i>

756
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,754
Why are you asking me this?

757
01:03:29,756 --> 01:03:32,555
<i>The other day, when you told me
about what happened to you...</i>

758
01:03:32,557 --> 01:03:34,324
<i>it made me angry.</i>

759
01:03:34,326 --> 01:03:35,825
<i>I have resources.</i>

760
01:03:35,827 --> 01:03:38,628
<i>I found one of the men
who attacked you, Casey.</i>

761
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,399
<i>I need you to meet me.</i>

762
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,100
[Casey] <i>But I won't be sure.</i>

763
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:45,602
<i>It was dark.
And like I was saying,</i>

764
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:48,273
<i>they were wearing
motorcycle helmets.</i>

765
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,540
[Sensei] <i>It's him.</i>

766
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:52,543
<i>You have to trust me.</i>

767
01:03:52,545 --> 01:03:54,280
<i>You trust me, don't you?</i>

768
01:04:00,418 --> 01:04:02,686
Did you park in the garage
like I asked?

769
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:04,624
There was a motorcycle.

770
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:07,426
I'm glad you came.

771
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:11,829
I see you're wearing
your belt for strength.

772
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,365
Me too.

773
01:04:15,135 --> 01:04:18,736
Not only does it represent my black belt in
karate but it also helps keep my pants up.

774
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:21,607
Yeah... So, where is he?

775
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,711
In the bar.

776
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:27,946
I still don't under...

777
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:30,514
Are you...
Are you sure it's him?

778
01:04:30,516 --> 01:04:31,950
I'm very sure.
But how?

779
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,618
How what? You saw the
motorcycle with your own eyes.

780
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,587
How did you find him?

781
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:37,855
You don't need
to worry about that.

782
01:04:37,857 --> 01:04:39,693
Well, what does he look like?

783
01:04:40,526 --> 01:04:42,863
He... wears a hat sometimes.

784
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,798
But not always.
[door opens]

785
01:04:49,936 --> 01:04:53,470
There he is. That's the man
we're looking for.

786
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,873
Him?

787
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:57,608
Yeah, he matches
the description I gave you.

788
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,910
He's not wearing a hat,
but I told you he doesn't always wear one.

789
01:04:59,912 --> 01:05:02,647
I just don't think we should do this.
Not like this.

790
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,952
Although, I do appreciate
you trying to...

791
01:05:06,019 --> 01:05:07,953
I'm not giving you the choice,
Casey.

792
01:05:07,955 --> 01:05:09,855
Out here is no different
than in my dojo.

793
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:12,023
That belt you're wearing is
still yellow and mine's black.

794
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:14,893
I'm your teacher, you're my student
and you'll do as you are told.

795
01:05:14,895 --> 01:05:18,196
And understand this:
I'm not helping you.

796
01:05:18,198 --> 01:05:19,633
You're helping yourself.

797
01:05:21,635 --> 01:05:23,469
Remember what he did to you.

798
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,941
He stole your dignity.

799
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:31,378
Take it back.

800
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:37,650
[man yawns]

801
01:06:02,677 --> 01:06:04,679
[urinating]

802
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:22,030
Hi.

803
01:06:22,863 --> 01:06:24,631
Do you remember me?

804
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,701
I don't think.

805
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:28,703
Hey, look at me!

806
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:30,605
I'm talking to you.

807
01:06:31,973 --> 01:06:33,708
Do you remember my face?

808
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,809
Good night.

809
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,825
[grunts]

810
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:56,664
[Sensei] No, don't touch him.

811
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:00,565
Don't touch him,
he's still breathing.

812
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:01,867
What are you doing?

813
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:04,304
You taught him a lesson.

814
01:07:04,306 --> 01:07:08,708
He and his friends will definitely think
twice before messing with you again.

815
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,643
Why are you filming this?

816
01:07:10,645 --> 01:07:12,578
I'm documenting.

817
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,881
Documenting what?

818
01:07:14,883 --> 01:07:16,551
Your growth.

819
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:24,757
See you tomorrow.
We'll get you started with determining

820
01:07:24,759 --> 01:07:27,894
which accounts are delinquent and if we
have time, we'll move on to organizing

821
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:30,531
the receipts for
the business related purchases.

822
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,035
[man groans]

823
01:07:36,037 --> 01:07:37,739
You did the right thing.

824
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:39,775
You'll see.

825
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:42,704
I'm sorry. There was
nothing we could do.

826
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,707
Did he go peacefully?

827
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:49,976
No. It was likely
very painful.

828
01:08:49,978 --> 01:08:52,747
There was
a great deal of trauma.

829
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:54,182
What do you mean "trauma"?

830
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:56,983
Well, the X-rays indicated
there were broken ribs

831
01:08:56,985 --> 01:08:59,920
and severe bruising
to the internal tissue.

832
01:08:59,922 --> 01:09:01,690
I don't understand.

833
01:09:03,259 --> 01:09:04,992
Did you hurt your dog?

834
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,061
Of course not, no.
He was my best friend.

835
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:09,097
I left him alone in my house
and when I came back...

836
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:11,032
Did you notice anything
out of place?

837
01:09:11,034 --> 01:09:13,201
I... I don't know.
I came straight here.

838
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:15,870
Do you think someone did
this to him?

839
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:17,207
We found blood
on his canines.

840
01:09:18,007 --> 01:09:20,108
He bit them?

841
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,877
It seems he fought to the end.
He was very brave.

842
01:09:22,879 --> 01:09:25,614
I tried my best not
to coddle him.

843
01:09:26,883 --> 01:09:30,053
I know this is hard.
I don't want to upset you.

844
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,820
But it's
the strangest thing.

845
01:09:32,822 --> 01:09:35,289
He died from a punch.
I'm sure of it...

846
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:39,629
Only, the bruising pattern
doesn't seem to indicate a fist...

847
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:41,764
but rather a foot.

848
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,802
I know,
it doesn't make any sense.

849
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:52,974
[Anna] Sometimes your opponent
will be bigger than you.

850
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:56,744
But remember this.
You're children, you're still growing.

851
01:09:56,746 --> 01:09:59,881
If they defeat you in combat, there will
always be the opportunity later in life,

852
01:09:59,883 --> 01:10:02,918
when you are fully grown,
to exact your revenge.

853
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,888
Casey, we're in the middle
of a class.

854
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:13,930
What are you doing?

855
01:10:14,932 --> 01:10:16,800
I'm wearing shoes on the mat.

856
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,003
Also, I didn't bow.

857
01:10:19,503 --> 01:10:20,937
What happened?

858
01:10:21,804 --> 01:10:23,070
What is it? You can tell me.

859
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:24,274
I'm hungry.

860
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:33,081
[spits]

861
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,218
Don't do this.

862
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:39,123
All this not bowing and eating
on the mat has made me thirsty.

863
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:47,895
Rule number nine: stay hydrated.

864
01:10:47,897 --> 01:10:49,964
- [door opens]
- [Sensei] Enough.

865
01:10:49,966 --> 01:10:51,769
You killed my dog!

866
01:10:54,972 --> 01:10:56,974
When?
Last night.

867
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:00,877
I was with you last night.

868
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,812
Casey, that's impossible.

869
01:11:03,814 --> 01:11:06,215
Is this the dog you told me was
of German lineage?

870
01:11:06,217 --> 01:11:08,217
He was a Dachshund,
you son of a bitch.

871
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:11,153
Dachshund. Short of stature,
long of body.

872
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:13,088
Not the most masculine
of breeds.

873
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:16,127
Unfortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

874
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:19,129
My condolences.

875
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:26,001
[whispering]
Fuck you and fuck your dojo.

876
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:28,304
As I said already,
I was with you last night.

877
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:32,408
I saw what you did to that man. That
innocent man. You said he was one of them.

878
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,978
Deep down you knew he didn't have anything
to do with whatever happened to you

879
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,046
and yet you did
what you did anyway.

880
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,819
You're insane.
It didn't matter to you, did it?

881
01:11:42,254 --> 01:11:44,153
You wanted to take out your pain
and frustration on someone else

882
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:46,121
and you needed to become
what you hated.

883
01:11:46,123 --> 01:11:48,957
I'm done.
This isn't karate.

884
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:50,862
I have it all on tape.

885
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,767
[grunting]

886
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:19,122
The man from last night
has two choices.

887
01:12:19,124 --> 01:12:21,624
Either become a better version
of himself

888
01:12:21,626 --> 01:12:23,295
or succumb to his weaknesses.

889
01:12:24,129 --> 01:12:26,062
You gave him that choice

890
01:12:26,064 --> 01:12:28,399
and his life will never be
the same.

891
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:33,071
That night all those months ago was the best
thing that ever happened to you and you know it.

892
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:37,808
You are who you always wanted
to be.

893
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:40,313
Karate has changed you.

894
01:12:43,482 --> 01:12:46,151
Channel this energy
into class tonight.

895
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,090
[gasping]

896
01:12:58,897 --> 01:13:00,365
And take your shoes off.

897
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,374
Okay, children.

898
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:12,110
Back to work.

899
01:13:22,221 --> 01:13:25,123
In the art of accounting
I'm a white belt.

900
01:13:26,124 --> 01:13:29,295
And you are
a fiscal black belt.

901
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,098
Did you kill my dog?

902
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,032
No.

903
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:38,936
Even if it wasn't a masculine
dog, I didn't kill it.

904
01:13:38,938 --> 01:13:41,140
But I'm going
to make this right.

905
01:13:41,508 --> 01:13:43,008
You'll see.

906
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,010
I've been having trouble
controlling my emotions lately.

907
01:13:47,012 --> 01:13:48,280
I'm sorry.

908
01:13:56,322 --> 01:14:00,025
It's a very masculine trait.
Embrace it.

909
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,896
Women are much cooler headed.

910
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:07,467
I want you to come work
for me full-time.

911
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:10,300
This is a part-time job
at best.

912
01:14:10,302 --> 01:14:12,436
I want you to take over
the children's class.

913
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:15,039
What about Anna?
Let me worry about Anna.

914
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:18,143
But she's easily the most
qualified person for this position.

915
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:20,311
I'm a yellow belt,
she's almost a black belt.

916
01:14:20,313 --> 01:14:22,114
Anna will never be a black belt.

917
01:14:24,016 --> 01:14:27,187
To be honest, I didn't ever
think she'd last this long.

918
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,289
When she earned her blue belt, I put
her in charge of the children's class

919
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:34,158
due to her innate maternal
instincts. She is a woman.

920
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,363
But she let her feminine tendencies
interfere with her karate.

921
01:14:39,299 --> 01:14:44,070
I realize now that her being a woman will
prevent her from ever becoming a man.

922
01:14:54,181 --> 01:14:58,018
There are things in life
that men do and...

923
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:01,151
there are things in life
that women do.

924
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:03,321
There are some things that women
and men do together,

925
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:07,225
like ride a tandem bicycle
or have sex.

926
01:15:07,227 --> 01:15:08,560
But even then,

927
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:11,196
men ride a tandem bicycle
to please a woman

928
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:13,433
and sex is the other way around.

929
01:15:15,369 --> 01:15:17,103
Karate...

930
01:15:19,105 --> 01:15:21,174
Karate's a thing for men.

931
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,512
It's time for the night class.

932
01:15:31,084 --> 01:15:33,451
I just wanted
to say thank you.

933
01:15:33,453 --> 01:15:36,321
For the belts.
Oh, of course.

934
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,524
Yeah, I'm so glad you like them.

935
01:15:38,526 --> 01:15:41,160
Like it? I love it.

936
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,396
Now, while I'm walking around
in public,

937
01:15:44,398 --> 01:15:47,098
I can still feel like
a brown belt

938
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,536
by wearing this brown belt.
Thank you.

939
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,474
Tonight, I want you,

940
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:55,409
you,

941
01:15:56,142 --> 01:16:00,046
and... you.

942
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,284
How big is your head?

943
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,185
Regular size.

944
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,422
Finish getting dressed.
Meet me out in the back.

945
01:16:27,308 --> 01:16:29,443
[dramatic music]

946
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,350
[Casey]
I don't think I can do this.

947
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:41,488
Did you hear me?
I can't do this.

948
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,489
Yes, you can. You'll be fine.
You're not coming.

949
01:16:43,491 --> 01:16:45,457
I'm coming.
We don't need you.

950
01:16:45,459 --> 01:16:48,193
Casey can take my place
as runner. I'll be the driver.

951
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:52,133
Otherwise you'll only have three drivers
and one runner. You need the extra runner.

952
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:00,608
Put it on. Do it.

953
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:31,237
[Sensei] I want you two
to play spotter.

954
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:32,374
[Anna] We'll do it.

955
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:34,374
[Sensei] No.

956
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:36,509
You're lucky I even let you ride
with us tonight.

957
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,279
[Anna] Thomas is too recognizable.
You can see his disgusting face

958
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,247
and bandages
even with the helmet on.

959
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:44,186
Casey has to do it.
He needs to prove himself.

960
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:47,520
[Sensei] <i>It's time, Casey.</i>

961
01:17:47,522 --> 01:17:49,190
<i>Go find us someone to help.</i>

962
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:52,260
<i>They have to be alone.</i>

963
01:18:01,503 --> 01:18:04,472
You should have never started
taking karate, Casey. But you did.

964
01:18:04,474 --> 01:18:07,409
We don't have to do this.
He'll kill us if we don't.

965
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:23,791
[Anna] Everything's gonna be okay,
but one of us has to hurt him, Casey.

966
01:18:23,793 --> 01:18:25,394
[Casey] I can't.

967
01:18:26,362 --> 01:18:28,197
[Anna] Then wait here.

968
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:32,669
Who are you?

969
01:18:34,469 --> 01:18:36,302
Stop.

970
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:37,771
Police, stop.

971
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:39,642
Show me your hands!
Police!

972
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:43,010
Shit!

973
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:44,779
I didn't mean to shoot
your friend. Police! Stop.

974
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:47,449
Stop where you are.
Show me your hands.

975
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,584
It was an accident.

976
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:57,192
[grunting]

977
01:19:06,736 --> 01:19:08,438
[Anna] Casey!

978
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:15,411
Casey!

979
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:20,548
Casey! Casey,
we have to leave now.

980
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:23,252
[police sirens in distance]

981
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,895
[radio static]

982
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:10,734
[officer on police radio] <i>They got our guy.
He's dead. They got away.</i>

983
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:15,837
One of the jobs of the spotter is to
ask the person if they have a gun.

984
01:20:15,839 --> 01:20:18,707
And that man had a gun.
Why didn't you ask if he had a gun?

985
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:21,743
My kicks aren't going
to be so strong anymore.

986
01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:23,614
The bullet only grazed you.

987
01:20:24,948 --> 01:20:26,816
Imprecise and boorish.

988
01:20:26,818 --> 01:20:28,683
Hey, this is your fault.

989
01:20:28,685 --> 01:20:31,620
Remind me to put a red stripe
on your belt tomorrow.

990
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:34,422
What, the stripe for instructors?
You can keep that.

991
01:20:34,424 --> 01:20:37,894
Red stripes aren't for instructors.
It's for ending a life.

992
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:41,798
Red represents blood.
There's no stripe for instructors.

993
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,868
A yellow belt with both black
and red stripes...

994
01:20:45,936 --> 01:20:47,471
unprecedented.

995
01:20:49,139 --> 01:20:51,576
Thomas, take Anna home.
No.

996
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:53,778
I'll do it.

997
01:20:57,548 --> 01:20:59,848
So, how did you get yours?

998
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,786
This one, on the right.

999
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:08,893
My what?

1000
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:12,863
Your stripe. The red one.

1001
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:18,335
It was another student.

1002
01:21:20,437 --> 01:21:24,606
He was a belt above me. The highest
ranked at the time, other than Sensei.

1003
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:26,711
I was better than him.

1004
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:29,478
I knew it, but...

1005
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,847
I also knew my place.

1006
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,782
During the sparring sessions
I'd let him win

1007
01:21:32,784 --> 01:21:34,884
because I didn't want
to upset the hierarchy.

1008
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:38,389
As you've probably noticed,
there is a hierarchy in karate.

1009
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:42,758
At this point the dojo
only had one changing room.

1010
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,365
So, I would wait until the men finished
changing, then I would get dressed alone.

1011
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:51,567
And one night,
as I was getting undressed,

1012
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:54,939
the upper belt came in
and attacked me from behind.

1013
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,843
I'd always held back
in class so...

1014
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:01,378
he saw me as weak.

1015
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:04,482
An easy target.

1016
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:09,654
I ended up strangling him
to death with his own belt.

1017
01:22:11,856 --> 01:22:13,625
I made him suffer.

1018
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:18,594
And the last thing he saw
before his eyes burst was...

1019
01:22:18,596 --> 01:22:21,432
the sense of satisfaction
on my face.

1020
01:22:22,934 --> 01:22:25,003
He saw that I was not weak,

1021
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:27,907
but strong.

1022
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:31,710
I've never held
anything back since.

1023
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:35,511
After that, Sensei had
the old equipment closet

1024
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:37,546
converted into
the women's changing room.

1025
01:22:37,548 --> 01:22:40,953
He said that I had tempted
the upper belt.

1026
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:43,722
That it was my fault.

1027
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:49,762
But it wasn't your fault.

1028
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,798
I know.

1029
01:22:59,972 --> 01:23:02,639
Thanks for the ride.

1030
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:05,842
I hope I never see you
in class again, Casey.

1031
01:23:05,844 --> 01:23:09,448
I hope you leave and never come
back, I really do.

1032
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:48,554

1033
01:24:11,044 --> 01:24:13,113

1034
01:24:31,965 --> 01:24:35,101

[Anna] <i>You're gonna kill him.</i>

1037

<i>He's trying to kill him.</i>

1038
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,362
<i>You think you're the only one
that deserves a red stripe?</i>

1039
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:53,067
<i>I deserve a red stripe just
as much as you. Maybe more.</i>

1040
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,868
[Sensei] <i>He looks very weak
and hopeless.</i>

1041
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:58,807
<i>Chances of him making something
of his life are minimal.</i>

1042
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:02,044
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- [Anna] <i>Wait.</i>

1043
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:04,247
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

1044
01:28:05,014 --> 01:28:07,047
<i>Sirens...</i>

1045
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:09,882
- <i>I hear sirens.</i>
- [Sensei] <i>I don't hear anything.</i>

1046
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,319
<i>Women are much more sensitive to
higher pitched sounds than men.</i>

1047
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:15,091
<i>Trust me, I hear sirens
approaching. We should leave.</i>

1048
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:19,228
[Sensei] <i>Take his wallet.</i>

1049
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:29,954
I'm going to kill you.

1050
01:31:32,023 --> 01:31:33,458
Do you want to know why?

1051
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,398
I could say it's for the honor
of the dojo.

1052
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:44,066
I could tell you it's because
you're blackmailing former students

1053
01:31:44,068 --> 01:31:48,404
into paying membership
fees long after they leave.

1054
01:31:48,406 --> 01:31:54,112
Or because private lessons are given
to those who do not ask for them,

1055
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,180
like myself.

1056
01:31:58,115 --> 01:32:01,052
But really it's
because I hate you.

1057
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:04,990
I hate you very much.

1058
01:32:06,124 --> 01:32:08,558
Not only do I want
to watch you die,

1059
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,196
but I want to be the reason
that you stop breathing.

1060
01:32:13,398 --> 01:32:17,169
I've never wanted anything more
in my entire life.

1061
01:32:19,238 --> 01:32:21,306
I'm going to kill you, Leslie.

1062
01:32:26,345 --> 01:32:27,845
That's right.

1063
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:31,314
I found out
that your real name is Leslie.

1064
01:32:31,316 --> 01:32:34,284
I called you that
to make you angry.

1065
01:32:34,286 --> 01:32:39,459
When you think about it, Leslie is a
lot more feminine-sounding than Casey.

1066
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:44,094
I can make you a black belt.

1067
01:32:44,096 --> 01:32:45,395
You can skip all
the other colors.

1068
01:32:45,397 --> 01:32:47,165
You don't even need to earn it.

1069
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:54,373
I challenge you to a fight
to the death in unarmed combat.

1070
01:32:56,441 --> 01:32:58,176
You'll lose.

1071
01:32:59,879 --> 01:33:01,581
I'm better at fighting than you.

1072
01:33:10,188 --> 01:33:11,456
Very well.

1073
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:14,360
I accept.

1074
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:51,558
I've been thinking a lot lately about what
I would say to you after I killed you.

1075
01:34:52,994 --> 01:34:54,993
I came up with two things.

1076
01:34:54,995 --> 01:34:57,596
And I don't want second guess
my choice later on

1077
01:34:57,598 --> 01:34:59,566
so I'm going to say both.

1078
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:02,334
First.

1079
01:35:02,336 --> 01:35:05,804
You would say that using this
makes me a weak man

1080
01:35:05,806 --> 01:35:08,573
and without question it does.

1081
01:35:08,575 --> 01:35:11,376
But I am alive
and you are dead.

1082
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:14,649
So I would argue it makes you
the weaker man.

1083
01:35:16,751 --> 01:35:20,688
The second thing I came up
with is from a film I saw once.

1084
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:24,556
I didn't play by the rules.

1085
01:35:24,558 --> 01:35:27,428
But there never were any rules.

1086
01:35:32,299 --> 01:35:33,801
[squelching]

1087
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,575
I defeated him in unarmed combat
to the death.

1088
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:44,777
In the tradition
of our Grand Master

1089
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:47,879
I punched a hole through
his head with my index finger.

1090
01:35:47,881 --> 01:35:53,352
It was a move that only Grand
Master knew but now I know it too.

1091
01:35:53,354 --> 01:35:57,623
I did it to restore honor to Grand
Master, this academy and its students.

1092
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:00,625
Does anyone have a problem with that?
Because if you do,

1093
01:36:00,627 --> 01:36:03,565
I'm happy to punch my finger
through your skull too.

1094
01:36:08,069 --> 01:36:11,405
Good. I've killed enough people
for today.

1095
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:15,508
On second thought,
there is more one thing.

1096
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,746
Everyone hold their hands out
in front of them.

1097
01:36:20,915 --> 01:36:22,550
Don't make me ask again.

1098
01:36:48,543 --> 01:36:50,278
What's this for?

1099
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,682
I sprained my wrist.

1100
01:36:54,482 --> 01:36:55,583
How did you sprain it?

1101
01:36:56,384 --> 01:36:57,617
Playing guitar.

1102
01:36:57,619 --> 01:37:00,753
I didn't know you played.
I do.

1103
01:37:00,755 --> 01:37:02,656
How are you with chords
and scales?

1104
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:05,826
I'm good with them.
I can play several songs quite well.

1105
01:37:05,828 --> 01:37:09,428
What type of music were you playing
when you sprained your wrist?

1106
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,830
Soft rock.

1107
01:37:10,832 --> 01:37:14,468
Take off the bandage.
Why?

1108
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:17,704
Because it is impossible to sprain
your wrist playing soft rock.

1109
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:20,375
Only extreme metal can do that.

1110
01:37:32,688 --> 01:37:33,889
[in German]

1111
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:43,530
[in English] This is my new dog.
We've come to an understanding.

1112
01:37:43,532 --> 01:37:45,534
He knows that I'm the alpha.

1113
01:37:45,968 --> 01:37:47,536
[in German]

1114
01:37:49,471 --> 01:37:50,472
[whistles]

1115
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:57,479
- [Thomas screams]
- [bones breaking]

1116
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:04,788
This is not mine.

1117
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,490
I took it,

1118
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,826
but I did not earn it.

1119
01:38:46,729 --> 01:38:48,731
Now get in line, yellow belt.

1120
01:39:02,947 --> 01:39:06,581
Up to this point you have been
taught that violence equals strength

1121
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,816
and compassion equals weakness.

1122
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:11,085
This ideology is limiting.

1123
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:15,556
It is possible to be brutally
tolerant or peacefully savage.

1124
01:39:15,558 --> 01:39:19,696
Your karate mind-set is equally as
important as your karate skill set.

1125
01:39:20,964 --> 01:39:23,731
You're going to notice
some changes around here

1126
01:39:23,733 --> 01:39:27,570
but this is still the night
class and you are its students.

1127
01:39:28,039 --> 01:39:29,806
Do you understand?

1128
01:39:32,575 --> 01:39:34,075
Good.

1129
01:39:34,077 --> 01:39:36,780
Let's start
with some moderate stretching.

1130
01:39:47,657 --> 01:39:50,494
[Casey] All right, students.
Let's start with some warm-ups.

1131
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:52,561
Jumping jacks.

1132
01:39:52,563 --> 01:39:55,064
[children together]
One, two, three,

1133
01:39:55,066 --> 01:39:58,100
- four, five, six...
- [Casey] Very good.

1134
01:39:58,102 --> 01:40:01,971
[children] ...seven, eight,
nine, ten.

1135
01:40:01,973 --> 01:40:04,306
[Casey] Good.
Everybody, well done.

1136
01:40:04,308 --> 01:40:06,742
Now let's do your side kicks.

1137
01:40:06,744 --> 01:40:09,912
[children] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1138
01:40:09,914 --> 01:40:13,018
[Hyahs continue]

1139
01:40:17,555 --> 01:40:20,122
[Casey] Very good side kicks.
Excellent form.

1140
01:40:20,124 --> 01:40:23,658
Okay, everybody.
Now we're doing karate chops.

1141
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:24,792
Ready?

1142
01:40:24,794 --> 01:40:27,963
[children] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1143
01:40:27,965 --> 01:40:30,099
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1144
01:40:30,101 --> 01:40:31,967
[Casey] Very good chops.

1145
01:40:31,969 --> 01:40:34,770
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1146
01:40:34,772 --> 01:40:37,639
Great job, Manny.
You've made great strides.

1147
01:40:37,641 --> 01:40:41,710
All right, everybody. Now I'm going to
teach you how to kick with your fist

1148
01:40:41,712 --> 01:40:43,679
and punch with your foot.

1149
01:40:43,681 --> 01:40:45,714
Are you ready?

1150
01:40:45,716 --> 01:40:47,918
[soft rock music playing]

1151
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,920
