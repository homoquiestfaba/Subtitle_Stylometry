2
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:30,279
Unit 77, hostage situation
at 314 Elm Street. Shots fired.

3
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:34,044
Detectives Pruitt and Biggs are trying
a side entrance.

4
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,362
- Ready?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,687
- Clear?
- Clear.

6
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,479
So, what do you think?

7
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,198
I think with all that noise
we lost the element of surprise.

8
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,758
- Not exactly stealth, are we?
- I'm talking about you.

9
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,126
I can hear those corduroys
rustling two blocks away.

10
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:15,679
- Close the door, sir.
- You never heard of slacks?

11
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,205
Screw you. I got my first collar
wearing these pants.

12
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,043
Freeze! Drop the weapon!

13
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,607
Crossing.

14
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,365
Drop the weapon!

15
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,087
Gun!

16
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,879
- Pru, what are you doing?
- Look at her hands, Roy.

17
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,687
They weren't tied together.

18
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,885
The guy's the hostage.

19
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:09,681
You shot my wife!

20
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,838
- All right, ma'am. And then?
- My husband, he called 911.

21
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,442
Then they take him hostage.

22
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,248
In six months you'll be back
with a badge.

22
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:30,200
Except in Mayberry you'll be hiding in
speed traps and chasing cats from trees.

23
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:33,247
What? You got some sudden yearning
for boredom?

24
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,047
Life, Roy.

25
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:39,279
- I got a yearning for life.
- Can't you feel that feeling?

26
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,364
- You're not gonna be in the heat of it all.
- I'm gonna start a family.

27
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:48,442
You were born to be a detective, Pru.
Is in your blood.

28
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,725
I don't want it anymore.

29
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,598
Last chance!

30
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,724
You were born to be a detective, Pru.

31
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,889
Do you want to talk
about what happened?

32
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,802
Sometimes is better
if I don't tell you everything.

33
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,847
I know it must be hard for you to leave.

34
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,118
I love that we're leaving here.

35
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,287
I love that we're never coming back.

36
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,684
Now, why is there sleeping bags
in the trunk of my car?

37
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:19,005
Well, you know, sometimes is better
if I just don't tell you everything.

38
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,678
- I forgot how far it was.
- Are you tired?

39
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,238
- A little.
- We'll stop soon, get a drink.

40
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,048
You wanna get me drunk,
have your way with me.

41
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,518
Thas the current plan.

42
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:47,487
Wait, one minute. No, less.

43
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:51,801
- Is a lot further than that.
- Wait. Wait. No, wait.

44
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,842
Look.

45
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,284
Thas beautiful, but thas
not where we're moving.

46
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,237
Thas correct, but it is
where we're staying tonight...

47
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,048
...under the stars and the moonlit sky.

48
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,884
I heard a realtor talk about it.
Apparently is beautiful...

49
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,880
...and incredibly romantic.

50
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,363
- You mean sleep outside?
- Well, yeah.

51
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,407
We've been cooped up in " box land"
for a month.

52
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,447
Come on, honey. Please.

53
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,842
Please.

54
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,564
You're giving me that look.
You're giving me that look.

55
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,959
- Yes!
- All right.

56
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,284
- How are you holding up?
- I'm tired.

57
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,569
- Nothing room service wouldn't cure.
- Forget it. We're camping.

58
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:13,803
- Suddenly I could use a drink.
- Well, welcome to the Morningstar.

59
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,848
I'm just gonna go
to the little girls' room.

60
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:34,163
- What can I get you?
- Two shots of Cuervo and a Coke back.

61
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,407
- That wild thing must belong to you.
- Excuse me?

62
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,129
Thas your '66 Mustang out there,
ain't it?

63
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,761
- Dual exhaust, wide-ass tires.
- Is a 1967 Fastback.

64
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,279
Is worth some real dough.

65
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,678
Is a lot of engine for just one man.

66
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,284
- You two passing through?
- We came up the Coast Highway.

67
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,964
My wife says is twice as long,
but is twice as pretty.

68
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,327
Well, Helensville's pretty quiet,
like most places around here.

69
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,765
- Where you guys staying?
- We are camping out.

70
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,966
We've got some pretty scenery.
Is Goïs country.

71
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,928
Is there another place
we can grab a bite?

72
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,048
Only place open will be the Stop-n-Shop.
Is two miles down the road.

73
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,043
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

74
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:44,483
She says, " I can't do a guy who has
'Winona Forever' tattooed on his chest."

75
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,164
Hurt like a bitch scraping part off.
Now she won't call me.

76
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,447
- Man, you're stupid. Whas it say now?
- "Wino Forever."

77
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,328
You guys catch a load
of that city man's ride?

78
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,927
Yeah. I saw his ride.

79
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,521
Twice as long and twice as pretty.

80
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,557
- You never camped out as a kid?
- No.

81
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,118
- You must have wanted to.
- Not really.

82
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:16,248
- Just like that, " No."
- Let me think about it. No.

83
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,128
Cub Scouts have campouts.
You were a Scout.

84
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:23,328
Thas only because I thought chicks
would dig the uniform.

85
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,764
You're unbelievable.

86
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,127
I got it.

87
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,006
You were right. Is amazing.

88
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:02,928
Yeah. What would you
ever do without me?

89
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,723
I will never be without you.

90
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:11,168
If they blindfolded me, and put you
somewhere on the planet...

91
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,445
...l'd find you.

92
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,887
Really? You that good a detective?

93
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,644
What if you couldn't find me?

94
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,524
Well, then I'd spend the rest of my life
telling everybody about you.

95
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,525
Thank you, darling.

96
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,528
Jonah.

97
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:02,928
- Feels a little light again, Bobby.
- I wouldn't know.

98
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,648
Thas what the Indian gave me,
okay?

99
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,848
- Les have a drink.
- I've gotta go take care of some things.

100
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:21,283
I think I worked up an appetite.

101
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,959
I think we both did.

102
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,758
There's that little convenience store
down the street.

103
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,568
Cheetos and chili dogs. I'll go.

104
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:35,325
No. You stay here.
You wanted the view. Enjoy.

105
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:40,842
Honey, come on.
You've been driving all day.

106
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,001
Wait a sec. You think I drive too slow.

107
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,919
I think if you drive any slower,
you'd be going backwards.

108
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,081
Good. Good one.

109
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,839
In case you see a bear or something.

110
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,569
If I do, you might want
to help the bear.

111
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,879
Be right back. I love you.

112
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,758
Love you too. I'll love you even more
when you bring me food.

113
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,406
- Cheetos and chili dogs.
- Chips, candy, salsa.

114
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,207
Be right back.

115
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:52,767
Hello.

116
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,438
- Not from around here, are you?
- Why do you say that?

117
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:13,160
License plates. But I would have known
anyhow by the way you move.

118
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:17,607
- How do I move?
- Like a man in a real big hurry.

119
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,398
- I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.
- Thas okay.

120
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,885
Get off me!

121
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,288
Jess! Jessica!

122
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,887
Oh, my God. Jess.

123
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:14,888
Jess, I'm here.

124
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,160
- I'm sorry.
- Help me.

125
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,009
Never there when you need 'em.

126
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:47,159
I was about ready to give up on you.
Then I noticed the truck was still here.

127
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,524
- I gotta get home.
- Whas the problem?

128
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,964
I don't have a problem.

129
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,518
Maybe I could take care of it.

130
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,079
- Don't I always take care of it, Bobby?
- You can't.

131
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:01,559
- Don't worry. I'll handle it.
- Worry? I'm not worried.

132
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:06,359
- See, money can always be replaced.
- Listen, Jonah, I just gotta go, okay?

133
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,919
Okay, Bobby. I'm not stopping you.

134
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,688
Son of a bitch! Get out of the car!

135
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:54,918
- Calm down.
- Get out!

136
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:57,728
- Calm down!
- Why? Why?!

137
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,119
Is him! Is him!

138
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,404
Oh, no.

139
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,923
Look at her. Take a look at her.

140
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,559
- See what you did? See what you did?
- This ain't right.

141
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,002
Stop. I'm sorry.

142
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,999
I'm sorry.

143
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,558
Please don't shoot me.

144
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,159
Get up. Get up!

145
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,446
Get up. Get up there!

146
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:01,167
Help! I need help!

147
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:04,241
- Get a doctor!
- Emergency in the lobby.

148
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,238
- I'm Dr. Leeds. Nurse!
- This is my wife, Jessica.

149
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:12,163
- Tell me what happened.
- She was attacked. I don't know.

150
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,921
Baby, baby.

151
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,084
Calm down. Get me an EKG, start a drip.
I'm gonna need 10 milligrams of Valium.

152
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,241
Jessica? Can you hear me?
Is okay now.

153
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,719
Thas him!
Thas him!

154
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,767
Nurses only.

155
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,887
Okay, back away and get me that Valium.

156
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:45,884
- We need to look after her. Wait here.
- Jess, I'll be right here.

157
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:51,117
We're gonna take care of everything.
You're gonna be fine.

158
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,442
Excuse me. I need to use a phone.

159
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:00,443
- You can use this one.
- No, is private. Is there one outside?

160
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,679
Just around the corner.

161
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:13,045
- Helensville County Sheriff.
- I need a sheriff, please.

162
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,918
He's out on a personal matter.
Can you tell me what is about?

163
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,478
No. When will he be back?

164
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,244
Can't say.
Would you lik e to leave a message?

165
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,157
Dr. Leeds? How is she?

166
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,686
She's got a nasty concussion.
We're doing a rape kit.

167
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,758
I'm sorry, I have to ask you this.

168
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,478
When was the last time you had
sexual relations with your wife?

169
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,482
It was about an hour before.

170
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,925
There's no sign she was actually raped.

171
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:23,640
She's lost some blood,
but you already know that.

172
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,045
- Can I see her?
- There's no treatment other than time.

173
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,006
Right now she needs to rest.

174
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,925
Any excitement at all could send her
back into shock.

175
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,239
These are skin scrapings
from under her nails.

176
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,197
- I'm sending them to a lab in Seattle.
- I was a detective in Seattle.

177
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,523
If you put my name on it,
I'll call ahead and speed things up.

178
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:48,567
Okay. Yeah, that would be helpful.
Thank you.

179
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,119
One more thing...

180
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:54,049
- That orderly...?
- Has been here all night.

181
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:54,799
- That orderly...?
- Has been here all night.

182
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,847
Your wife is in delayed shock.

183
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,398
- I better phone the sheriff.
- He's here.

184
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,958
Down in the basement, level one.

185
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,443
Where are you going?
This is off-limits.

186
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:11,442
- I need to talk to the sheriff.
- Sheriff's busy.

187
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,727
- Go un-busy him. Is an emergency.
- Yeah, what?

188
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,158
- I know who you are, detective.
- How?

189
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,601
Your wife's admitting form.
What can I do for you?

190
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,008
- Can we talk?
- No. We just talked.

191
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:30,729
Please excuse me.
I have another matter.

192
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:36,247
All due respect, sir, but my wife
was just attacked in your jurisdiction.

193
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,843
I wasn't some flatfoot guarding
a Dairy Queen.

194
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:42,046
I worked Homicide six years in metro.

195
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,246
So I know you didn't just say
you have another matter.

196
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,924
Homicide. So what?
Whas your point?

197
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,642
I want in on this investigation.

198
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,287
Look, my wife was practically beaten
to death.

199
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,286
Come on. This will only take a second.

200
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,885
- Thanks for doing this, Ed.
- Is not a problem, Morgan.

201
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,404
He's okay.

202
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,878
What have you got for me so far?

203
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,085
It wasn't a fair fight. His hands are
pretty clean, mostly defensive wounds.

204
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:25,685
From the lividity, I'd say he's been
dead about two hours.

205
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,487
Eye sockes fractured.

206
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,325
Rectangular lacerations with jagged
markings are imprinted on the cheekbone.

207
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:36,164
But not from, say, somebody's ring.

208
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,283
See here? It looks to me
like he's been pistol...

209
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,007
Hey, not now.

210
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,727
See here? Like, from underneath
the grip of an automatic.

211
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:53,244
Is gotta be 9 millimeter.

212
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:57,561
Or Beretta maybe,
or it could be a Glock.

213
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:00,118
- Cause?
- Cerebral hematoma.

214
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,645
The back of his skull is cracked.

215
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,482
Would you all give me a moment, please.

216
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:28,487
My God.

217
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:32,044
Something wrong, detective?

218
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:35,724
What?
Aside from my wife being attacked?

219
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:40,917
For a second back there, I thought maybe
you'd seen him someplace before.

220
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,317
- Listen, you can tell the sheriff.
- You tell me on the way.

221
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:52,085
Your wife shouldn't be disturbed till
morning. I'll have you back by then.

222
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:55,878
- I think I'm gonna stay here.
- I need to talk to you.

223
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,521
You're...

224
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,088
- You're from Seattle?
- Yeah.

225
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:19,162
- How'd you hear about the campsite?
- My wife heard it from a realtor.

226
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,481
We got the directions at a bar
called the Morningstar.

227
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,766
So someone could have heard
you talking about going up there?

228
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,397
Well, we weren't whispering.

229
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:37,999
And then you left her alone.

230
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:40,444
I went to the store.

231
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,719
- I left my gun.
- What kind of a gun?

232
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,403
.38, service-issue revolver.

233
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,684
- You only carried the one?
- Yeah.

234
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:01,165
The thing is, detective...

235
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,325
...we found this.

236
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,806
One shot fired.

237
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,168
Yours?

238
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:15,039
You found it at the campsite?

239
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,007
No, we found it at the murder scene.

240
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:28,839
Which means to me,
the same man committed both crimes.

241
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,048
He could have taken it from the campsite
where he attacked your wife...

242
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:36,246
...and then lost it when he...

243
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:45,048
That is my son in there.

244
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:51,319
Someone ran him off the road
and then murdered him.

245
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:57,044
I'm sorry about your son.

246
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you.

247
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,845
- Sheriff?
- Morgan.

248
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:11,366
What?

249
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,168
My name. Morgan.

250
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,528
Morgan.

251
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,524
You think these crimes are connected?

252
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:28,648
Two assaults, same night.
A few miles apart.

253
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:30,606
Is a good bet, no?

254
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,687
Apparently...

255
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:41,799
This wasn't the weapon
my son was pistol-whipped with.

256
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:46,723
So do you have any leads?

257
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,687
I have ideas.

258
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,686
- Sheriff?
- Yeah. Go ahead, Dave.

259
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:10,080
Check ed suspects with his priors. ;
assault and battery, rape.

260
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,843
- You were right. We got a name.
- I'm listening.

261
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:17,321
Is that bookie, John Drexel.
Remember him, Mac?

262
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:23,159
- Read me his resume.
- Gambling conviction, time in Lompoc.

263
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:28,244
Two double-A 's and a double-L this year
alone. Bobby was into him for a bundle.

264
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,687
- I settled that debt personally.
- Bobby must have went back.

265
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,325
- Where is he?
- His brother says he's over at J.B. 's.

266
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,520
- Did you get that, detective?
- Two aggravated assaults...

267
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:44,761
...another for lewd and lascivious.

268
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,647
Who is he?

269
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,527
He's a creep.

270
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,559
- Where you going?
- Wait in the car.

271
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:58,118
I said, wait in the car.

272
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:25,441
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

273
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,002
Come here.

274
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,760
Wanna tell me? Tell me what you did.

275
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,442
Wanna tell me?

276
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,807
- McKenna!
- Suspect resisted. Suspect died.

277
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:50,042
- You want to tell me? Tell me.
- Thas it. Come on. Come on.

278
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:53,007
Come on. Enough. Enough.

279
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:58,478
Whatever you think he did,
you need evidence to prove it.

280
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:20,042
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall.

281
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:13,964
- I need to get back. Be with my wife.
- Why don't you let her rest?

282
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,041
I'll get you back there
in a couple hours.

283
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:22,526
- You look like you could use some rest.
- I'm not tired.

284
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:26,286
Couch is yours if you change your mind.
I'm making coffee.

285
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,804
If you want something harder,
is in the cabinet.

286
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,244
- I'll take some coffee.
- All right.

287
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,725
- Take that shirt off.
- What?

288
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,800
- Take the shirt off.
- Why?

289
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,881
Is wet, full of blood.
I'll throw it in the machine.

290
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:17,801
That was Bobby about 10 years ago.

291
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,965
So were you and your son close?

292
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,084
No, not of late, anyway.

293
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:36,207
Truth is we weren't even speaking.

294
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:44,202
Damn shame of that is that
earlier tonight he left me a message...

295
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,883
...on the answering machine.

296
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:48,641
That was...

297
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:55,325
...the first time I heard his voice
in a long time.

298
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,837
What did he say on the message?

299
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,159
Not much, really.

300
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:14,324
He sounded like he was in some kind
of fix and he needed to talk.

301
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:18,038
Probably about money.
I just was out in the field.

302
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,200
So, what did he do around here?

303
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:25,318
Worked for this Jonah Ganz. He owned
that bar you were in earlier tonight...

304
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:28,447
...along with some other interests.

305
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,841
He's got his greedy little fingers
in a bunch of pies.

306
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,967
I have yet to be able to break
one of them.

307
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:40,328
Why would he work for a guy like that?

308
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:42,963
Paid well.

309
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,683
Right.

310
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,128
Yeah?

311
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:56,197
Okay.

312
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:04,043
Drexel's got an alibi, airtight.

313
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,802
You got something
you want to say to me?

314
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,525
No, sir.

315
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:20,807
I can't imagine what you're going
through. Whoever did this to my wife...

316
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,925
...I want justice too.

317
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:33,125
Okay, then you help me get
this son of a bitch.

318
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:36,208
I'll help you any way I can.

319
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:45,679
And when you catch him?
What do you intend on doing?

320
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,844
Not miss.

321
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:52,125
You're not serious.

322
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,761
This ain't the city.
Only God is watching.

323
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,447
We're police officers.
We take an oath to uphold the law.

324
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,045
We don't have to agree with it.
We just have to abide by it.

325
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:13,004
So if I gave you a chance
to get even...

326
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:17,321
...with the guy that attacked your wife,
you wouldn't take it?

327
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:22,361
- I don't know what I'd do.
- The hell you don't.

328
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:41,728
Everyone.

329
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,598
Gentlemen.

330
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,719
This is Detective Pruitt.
He's going to be assisting us.

331
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,767
Show him the same respect
you do me. All right?

332
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,806
Les go back to work.
Les go.

333
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,918
Not one stone unturned, okay?
Not one damn stone.

334
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:44,524
Can I have one of those?

335
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,881
Help yourself.

336
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,722
Thanks.

337
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,562
Daniel.

338
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,566
Daniel.

339
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:16,046
You probably came down
this road last night...

340
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,120
...on the way to the hospital.

341
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:21,964
- You happen to see anything?
- I'd have told you.

342
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:28,004
Remember, we're looking
for any sign of a 9 mm.

343
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:39,198
- You'll be here if I need you?
- Yeah.

344
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,802
Listen...

345
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:45,407
...she may be the only real
witness we have.

346
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,037
If she's up to it,
see what she remembers.

347
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:52,122
So she can relive this whole
nightmare in some damn trial?

348
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,723
There won't be any trial.

349
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,723
Bobby struck down the power line...

350
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:25,280
...probably causing an outage
in the area.

351
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:28,521
So les start
by getting the time frame.

352
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:32,204
- Have we ruled out robbery?
- Thas been bugging me, Mac.

353
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,203
Perp stole a.38 from that campsite,
but took nothing from Bobby.

354
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:40,044
- Wallet and watch were still on him.
- With Bobby, it was personal.

355
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:44,725
What about this? Why pistol-whip
with a.9 when he'd lifted Pruis.38?

356
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,288
I'm stuck on that too.

357
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:51,204
We got two sets of prints from the gun,
not three. They belong to the Pruitts.

358
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,722
Where'd you get Pruis?

359
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:56,802
They're on computer file.
His wife's are from personal items.

360
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:00,564
Maybe our man
wiped his own prints off.

361
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:04,688
And left the other two intact?
No, he definitely dropped...

362
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,444
...that.38 by accident
at the struggle.

363
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:11,237
We got to get some prints.

364
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,645
Where do we start?

365
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,277
Where do we start?

366
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:20,601
Why'd someone want him dead so bad
they beat him to death?

367
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,647
Man has a gun on you,
you'd do whatever he says...

368
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,959
...even let him knock you around.

369
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:30,839
Look. Is the middle of the night,
middle of nowhere, no witnesses.

370
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,364
If he wanted to kill him,
he'd shoot him.

371
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:37,488
- Why take the time to beat him?
- Thas my point.

372
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:40,608
I mean, there's lots of motives...

373
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,919
...but this guy's...

374
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:45,446
This guy's was rage.

375
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:51,044
Make a list of the people that are
least likely to mourn Bobby's passing.

376
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:56,639
And he also left me a message
at about 10:00.

377
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,640
Find out where that came from.

378
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,881
- What about this Detective Pruitt?
- What about him?

379
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:05,998
- We should check him out some more.
- Save it.

380
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:09,684
He's a cop. He's going through
the same thing I am.

381
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:16,244
Dr. Cody to the pharmacy.
Dr. Cody to the pharmacy, please.

382
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:11,005
Dr. Graham and Dr. Stephen to ICU.
Dr. Graham and Dr. Stephen to ICU.

383
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,365
Is an emergency.

384
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:34,202
Come on.

385
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:38,042
- Thanks, man. Sorry about that.
- Sure.

386
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,719
- Detective bureau. Biggs.
- Roy, is Pru.

387
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:56,167
Retired country man. Don't tell me.
The boredom's got to you already.

388
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:00,402
Listen, partner, I need a fav or.
And I need it really quick.

389
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:01,558
Dr. Leeds?

390
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:06,723
You need to check with lab processing.
There's an evidence bag coming to you.

391
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,280
- My name's on it.
- Evidence? Why would your name be...?

392
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:14,486
I'm helping out a sheriff
with a sexual assault case.

393
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,603
Roy, the envelope has a blood swatch
and some skin scrapings.

394
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:22,557
Can you cross the samples
and see if they're from the same guy?

395
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:26,085
Sure I can. Danny, is everything okay?
How's Jess?

396
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:30,401
I'll fill you in later.
And don't tell anyone else.

397
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,527
- Don't talk to anyone else.
- I'm on it.

398
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:35,327
I'll call back.

399
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:38,967
Killer.

400
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:43,203
Car. Is a killer.

401
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:51,122
- Why was your picture in his wallet?
- I was his girl for a while.

402
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:53,849
- Didn't last long.
- Why not?

403
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:56,603
He hardly ever touched me.
I broke it off.

404
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:00,603
- Was he angry about that?
- Him? Angry? He stole my car.

405
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:02,043
Did you turn him in?

406
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:05,007
No, his daddy found out
and brought it back.

407
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:08,878
Whole thing was sort of funny
at first...

408
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:12,644
...and after that, I hated him.

409
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:15,358
Why's that?

410
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:20,721
He beat the living crap out of me.

411
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:08,648
He beat the living crap out of me.

412
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:13,324
Is him. Is him!

413
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:17,843
Morgan.

414
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:22,842
- Morgan, I need to talk to you.
- Not now.

415
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,079
There's something
I need to tell you.

416
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,763
- I wanna show you something.
- What is it?

417
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,004
Is another shot. Come on.

418
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,167
Get something this time?

419
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:48,483
Yeah. He was at the bar
with some other men.

420
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:54,087
He was with Bobby.
He and Bobby work for Ganz.

421
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:57,362
Anyway, his name's
Jay Redmond Sawyer.

422
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:02,120
You don't remember talking to anybody
besides the barmaid?

423
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,928
There was a lot of people at the bar.

424
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:09,207
And you don't remember
seeing my son there?

425
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:11,325
I can't be sure.

426
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:15,443
Well, maybe your wife
will remember him.

427
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:23,688
What? Forgot to pee?

428
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,845
You'll need more evidence
to link him to either crime.

429
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,728
He's a registered sex offender.
He was with Bobby.

430
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:37,359
Someone saw him with a handgun.
Whas the matter with you?

431
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,918
Come on, detective.
You ride with me.

432
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:44,804
- You must think you're pretty smart.
- Whas that supposed to mean?

433
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:49,565
I guess you'd have to be, passing
your detective exam so young and all.

434
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:54,723
The job wasn't what you think.
Sometimes you're lucky to get home.

435
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:59,804
Thas the thing about luck. It often
runs out when you least expect it to.

436
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:04,402
Think I could ever be a hotshot
detective like you, Mr. Pruitt?

437
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:06,525
I don't really know.

438
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:10,488
Yeah, you must be one smart cop.

439
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:16,007
I guess all those merit citations
cancel out those justifiable homicides.

440
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:18,605
You checking up on me?

441
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:24,520
Have I done something to offend you,
Deputy Forrest? May I call you David?

442
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:27,840
No, you may not.
You listen to me, detective.

443
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:31,240
We don't need outsiders
telling us how to do our job.

444
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:32,842
We know how to do our job.

445
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:36,797
Morgan asked me to help with this case
directly or indirectly.

446
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:38,721
I don't care what he told you.

447
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,246
I know you're involved in all this,
directly or indirectly.

448
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:03,399
Guard the entrance. The only
other way ous that back alley.

449
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,924
If you have to shoot, don't miss.

450
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:09,286
- Yes, sir. Mac, can I have a word?
- Yeah, just a sec.

451
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:15,322
You might need this. I took the liberty
of having Tustin reload it for you.

452
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:19,118
Go upstairs, look around.
Don't do anything. Just wait for me.

453
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,008
What?

454
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,846
But I might remind you...
No calls.

455
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:59,246
The young man has been paying off
his casino markers with your money.

456
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:03,368
Such men who find themselves in debt
sometimes panic...

457
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:07,886
...maybe threaten to make
our arrangement together public.

458
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:13,043
- And that, Mr. Ganz, can never happen.
- Yes.

459
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:14,164
Well...

460
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:22,801
A new man will be making the pickups,
starting this weekend.

461
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:30,206
I don't like being here.
Don't make me come back.

462
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:35,522
I said, no more calls.

463
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:39,238
I'm sorry, sir. Is the police.
A Detective Pruitt.

464
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:43,038
- Get a number.
- He's not calling, sir. He's here.

465
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,084
Can I help you?

466
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:49,717
I'm here to question
one of your employees.

467
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,288
I assume you have a warrant.

468
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,885
Red Sawyer's an ex-convict.
We don't need a warrant.

469
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:00,328
Can you find Red Sawyer
and ask him to come up here?

470
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:05,603
McKenna.
I'm truly very sorry.

471
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,045
Almost had a heart attack
when I heard about Bobby.

472
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,525
You need a heart for that.

473
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:17,448
This is hardly the time to allow
bad blood to boil between us.

474
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,887
Bobby was an important man in my
business. I'd given him a promotion.

475
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:25,405
- He was like a son to me.
- He was my son.

476
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:28,242
We both have
the same interests here, sheriff.

477
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:30,843
To right a terrible wrong.

478
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:33,202
Mr. Pruitt, isn't it?

479
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:38,566
Try one of my Montecristos. Cubans.
Just got them yesterday.

480
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:42,604
Had a hell of a time getting them here,
but worth the trouble.

481
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:43,918
No, thanks.

482
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:50,328
Well, yes. They are illegal.
You're not here to arrest me, are you?

483
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,084
Cut the crap.

484
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:57,609
McKenna,
why don't you just get off me?

485
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,329
I loved Bobby.

486
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:03,848
You.

487
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:07,079
You stay out of my face.

488
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,647
Boss, whas up?

489
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,758
We've got you on a parole violation.

490
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:21,046
Come down to the station with us.
We need a chat.

491
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:29,643
Gun!

492
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,281
Stop it!

493
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:58,727
Call an ambulance.

494
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:39,962
Wanna tell me
what you were doing back there?

495
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:41,448
No.

496
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:44,123
You tried to kill him.
You almost killed me.

497
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:48,328
- Don't impede my investigation.
- This is your own personal manhunt.

498
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:53,005
Listen, son. You got enough problems.
You want another one right now?

499
00:52:57,129 --> 00:53:01,566
The thing is, Forrest was shot
with a 9 mm. You tell me...

500
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:05,165
...why this guy would run
if he wasn't guilty. Why?

501
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:08,640
- Where's Red now?
- They're sewing him up.

502
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,683
He's guarded.
He'll spend the night here.

503
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,568
- Look, I wanna interrogate him.
- So do I.

504
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:17,289
You can't beat the truth out of him.

505
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:19,917
- Is that right?
- You want the truth?

506
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:24,924
- You know exactly what I want.
- Yeah. You made that pretty clear.

507
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,759
Tomorrow, first thing,
we'll go by the crime scene...

508
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:34,002
...find the evidence we need
to clean this up. I want you there.

509
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,639
- You got a place to stay tonight?
- I'll be right here.

510
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:39,640
Sorry.

511
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:44,677
- She making any progress?
- No. She's still pretty out of it.

512
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:49,645
When she's more alert,
I'd like to show her Reïs mug shot.

513
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,085
- Doc says thas too risky.
- This is not a request.

514
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:55,240
She's got to be questioned.

515
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:59,800
Don't you mean interviewed?
She's a victim, not a suspect.

516
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:03,439
You listen.
Your wife was attacked.

517
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,964
Thas a damn tragedy...

518
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:08,918
...but she is still alive.

519
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:15,239
Doc, we're leaving in the morning.

520
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:19,288
Sheriff McKenna says she's a
material witness in two felony crimes.

521
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:22,122
Now, I had to sedate her again.

522
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:25,406
I think he aims on hearing
what she has to say.

523
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,919
There's something else.

524
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:31,759
We couldn't save the baby.

525
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:35,001
No, thas a mistake.
She's not pregnant.

526
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:40,323
Actually, she was.
About five weeks.

527
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,887
I'm sorry.

528
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:12,361
- Jess. I'm here. Jess.
- I'm sorry.

529
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:17,284
No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have left you.

530
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,407
Everything's gonna be okay.

531
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:28,243
- Morning. Morning.
- We'll leave in the morning.

532
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:32,357
Dog. Dog.

533
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:36,728
Knife. Morning.

534
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:39,642
- Morning.
- Jess, who did this to you?

535
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,923
Morning.

536
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:59,442
- What happened to that machine?
- Is on its way to the junkyard.

537
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:07,726
Skin scrapings and blood from that
shirt are the same type, B negative.

538
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:12,602
But that don't mean squat.
They'll have to wait for the DNA.

539
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:18,241
They did find something odd
in that blood on the guy's T-shirt.

540
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,927
- What is it?
- Is full of anabolic steroids.

541
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:27,685
One major side effect, no lead in his
pencil. Know what I mean?

542
00:56:28,209 --> 00:56:31,963
Guy lik e that probably wouldn't
try to rape anybody.

543
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,767
- Danny, you still there?
- Yeah. I'm still here.

544
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:41,317
Your sheriff pal sent a blood sample
to be matched a couple of hours ago.

545
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:43,400
Name on it was Redmond Sawyer.

546
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:48,677
- This McKenna was asking questions.
- What did he want to know?

547
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:52,046
Spoke to the cap
about your service record.

548
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:56,443
You want to tell me whas going on?

549
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:58,363
Roy.

550
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:02,848
I don't want to get you
in the middle of it.

551
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:04,323
I'll call you back.

552
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:11,320
- Sheriff?
- What?

553
00:57:11,649 --> 00:57:13,685
We got a bullet casing.

554
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:21,321
- Is a 9 millimeter.
- Can I see that?

555
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:24,799
If that matches Reïs gun,
I'd say thas all I need.

556
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:27,722
You have the ability to check
that out here?

557
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:32,360
Do we have the ability?
Yes, we damn sure do. Yes we do.

558
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:34,679
Come on, les put an end to this.

559
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:38,569
So, Smitty...

560
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:39,285
So, Smitty...

561
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:43,724
...Reïs guilty, right?
- Yes, sir. He shot David, sir.

562
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:47,758
- I mean, my kid.
- Lf he did, not with the gun he had.

563
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:51,524
Ed compared the grip of his Beretta
with the marks on Bobby.

564
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:54,647
- They don't match.
- What about the bullet casing?

565
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:58,484
The case you brought in
wasn't fired from Reïs gun.

566
00:58:04,569 --> 00:58:06,366
Wait for the blood to match.

567
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:07,757
- Sir?
- Yeah.

568
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:11,001
Bobby's truck caused a power
outage on the highway.

569
00:58:11,169 --> 00:58:13,967
- The lights went out about 11.
- 11?

570
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:16,438
Right. Wayne's got those impressions.

571
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:19,760
He's getting a size and type
for the suspecs tire.

572
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,363
- He says he's close.
- Well, where is he?

573
00:58:22,529 --> 00:58:24,679
Outside, dropping off Reïs pickup.

574
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:28,922
- Weren't those impressions smudged?
- We got a pretty good one.

575
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,562
Is that Forress desk?

576
00:58:56,729 --> 00:59:00,802
Yeah. He wanted me to find some
evidence bag and get it to McKenna.

577
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,682
Excuse me.

578
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:16,606
You looking for something?

579
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,329
- These were the first photos taken?
- Yeah.

580
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:26,162
- Who was on the scene first?
- I was.

581
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:30,762
Look. In all these photos,
the doors to the trailer are open.

582
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:34,888
Yeah, thas right. They were open
when I got there. So?

583
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,725
Is there a way they can be unlocked
from the inside?

584
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:47,204
- No. Not unless they were busted open.
- Were they? Did you examine the bolt?

585
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:49,200
Whas this got to do with it?

586
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:52,600
I locked and latched the doors
before I had it towed.

587
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:56,762
I didn't see any evidence to suggest
that bolt had been broken.

588
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:06,204
Cerebral hematoma. The blow that
killed him was to the back of the head.

589
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:11,483
Someone went back there
and surprised him.

590
01:00:12,769 --> 01:00:14,043
Maybe so.

591
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:03,722
- You expect me to talk?
- I expect you to die.

592
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:28,079
Morgan. Morgan! Get off him. Get off!

593
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:49,727
- You see that? He tried to end me.
- Help me out or I'll wake him up...

594
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:52,687
...and find a bigger pillow.
- I didn't kill anyone.

595
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:55,761
- You saw Bobby leave the bar.
- He left for an hour.

596
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,920
- He came back.
- He went for my wife.

597
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:01,919
Your wife? Bobby? Hell, no.

598
01:02:02,249 --> 01:02:03,568
I got proof.

599
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:08,603
He went to steal your damn car.

600
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:11,723
- How'd he get up there?
- I don't know.

601
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:18,247
Whad Bobby do for Ganz?

602
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:21,207
He was making Jonah's pickups
from the casino.

603
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:24,406
- Kickbacks.
- But Bobby was skimming off the top.

604
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:26,727
How'd you find that out?

605
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:29,198
And you were making Bobby pay
to keep quiet.

606
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:32,839
- How could you know that?
- You just told me.

607
01:02:36,129 --> 01:02:40,566
Well, so what? I knew Jonah would
find out sooner or later.

608
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:46,204
He couldn't have Bobby telling his dad
about the poison on the reservation.

609
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:50,885
He figured he might blackmail him if
he didn't back off about the money.

610
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:58,281
- But Bobby never would have talked.
- He left a message at his daïs.

611
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:00,485
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

612
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:04,244
- He was gonna leave town, but...
- Somebody killed him.

613
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:07,961
Yeah. I heard it was you.

614
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:17,922
He came back to the Morningstar alone.
He said your car wasn't there.

615
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:20,045
He seemed messed up, scared.

616
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:21,562
Morningstar.

617
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:27,484
Who has a dog and carries a knife?

618
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:30,163
A lot of guys around here
carry knives.

619
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:36,598
He was alone the first time.
What about the second time?

620
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:39,044
The last I saw him he was with Jonah.

621
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:43,282
Go bug him. Is Friday.
He'll be at the fight club on Ninth.

622
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:48,842
One more thing. Where'd Bobby stash
the money? Don't say the bank.

623
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:54,728
Find Bobby's truck. There's a panel
under the driver's seat.

624
01:03:54,889 --> 01:03:57,005
He kept it in a gym bag in there.

625
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:08,926
I don't get it. Is the wrong gun,
wrong blood.

626
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:12,242
Is all right.
You just need to sleep it off.

627
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:15,924
What? The liquor or the chokehold
you put on me?

628
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:18,808
Sorry about that.

629
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:28,119
- Your dad alive?
- Yeah.

630
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:32,647
- Is he a cop?
- Yeah.

631
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:39,718
Whatever I couldn't do...

632
01:04:41,249 --> 01:04:44,321
...or I didn't do for my son
when he was alive...

633
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:53,522
...I gotta make it up to him now.
You understand that, don't you?

634
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,723
Yeah.

635
01:04:56,649 --> 01:04:58,605
I understand that.

636
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:01,888
Good night.

637
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:31,038
Dad?

638
01:05:31,569 --> 01:05:36,518
Is Bobby. I tried you earlier, but...
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

639
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,683
Is bad.

640
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:42,477
I'm trying to stop it.

641
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:50,241
Look, I can't talk right now.
I'll try you later on, okay?

642
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:53,362
Dad? I'm sorry.

643
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,848
We're closing up.

644
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,117
Come back tomorrow.

645
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:40,362
Detective Pruitt. I'm looking
for the hospital washing machine.

646
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:41,848
Why?

647
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:45,959
Because I work in the
None of Your Damn Business Division.

648
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:49,087
- They're over there.
- Turn those lights back on.

649
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:52,719
I can't. They're on a timer.

650
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:22,608
For Goïs sake, Billy. If you don't
throw a jab, he'll do that every time!

651
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:30,367
Tough sport, boxing.

652
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:33,605
So they say, detective.

653
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:37,126
You ever throw on the gloves
for competition?

654
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:44,006
- Back in the day. You?
- No, no, no. I prefer the corner.

655
01:09:44,169 --> 01:09:47,047
Thas where you
really control the fighters.

656
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:52,605
You got another one of those?

657
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:54,568
Sure.

658
01:09:57,769 --> 01:09:58,997
Thanks.

659
01:09:59,169 --> 01:10:02,798
Glad to see someone who
can appreciate the finer things.

660
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:07,798
Billy, if you're not gonna
trade jabs...

661
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:10,403
...then get out of the damn ring!

662
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:15,679
Bobby enjoy the finer things?

663
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:20,362
Bobby's taste in tobacco ran closer
to Camels than Cubans.

664
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:22,884
Something he learned from his father.

665
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:24,482
So he never smoked one?

666
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:27,925
- I would say not.
- Well, I found one in Bobby's rig.

667
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:32,806
It was a Montecristo. One of yours?

668
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,726
Attaboy, Billy. Go after him.
Go after him.

669
01:10:44,489 --> 01:10:49,609
Bobby was using one of my company
trucks. I could have left that there.

670
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:54,524
I considered that. But you said these
Cubans came the day Bobby was killed.

671
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:56,805
- You did say that, right?
- Meaning?

672
01:10:58,569 --> 01:11:04,007
If you just got them, how could they
be in Bobby's rig before that night?

673
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:12,766
Is this going somewhere, detective?

674
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:18,841
Yeah, it is. And so are you.

675
01:11:26,409 --> 01:11:28,365
Mr. Ganz. Mr. Ganz, I did it.

676
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:34,919
Deputy, I want to press full charges
against this man.

677
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:38,240
- Harassment, police brutality, assault.
- Shut up.

678
01:11:38,409 --> 01:11:41,765
- You're out of your province.
- Called a citizen's arrest.

679
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:45,717
You picked a pretty prominent citizen.
Whas the charge?

680
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:48,801
- Murder.
- And who did he supposedly kill?

681
01:11:48,969 --> 01:11:50,561
Bobby McKenna.

682
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:54,079
I see. And how do you know that?

683
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:58,767
His prints will match those on a
cigar band I found in Bobby's truck.

684
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:01,045
He isn't even a police officer.

685
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:05,202
How can you trust any evidence
he may have planted in my truck?

686
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:10,085
Sorry. If Mr. Pruitt has something to
say about this, McKenna will listen.

687
01:12:10,249 --> 01:12:14,003
I found this in a panel underneath
the seat of Bobby's truck.

688
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:17,479
Ganz killed Bobby for stealing.
Tell McKenna.

689
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:20,402
Maybe you better tell him.
What is this?

690
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:22,920
The nail in his coffin.

691
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,838
I don't understand why
we're in a hurry.

692
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,398
That would take too long to explain.

693
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:33,448
Sometimes is better if you don't
have to tell me everything?

694
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:37,837
You're just gonna have to trust me.

695
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:40,842
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

696
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:42,203
All right.

697
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,400
- Ready?
- Yeah.

698
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:51,127
Where are you going?

699
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:54,402
We're leaving.
Thank you for your concern.

700
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:57,603
- He what?
- Brought Ganz in late last night.

701
01:12:57,769 --> 01:13:01,557
Claimed he killed Bobby over some
money Bobby was stealing.

702
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:04,562
A lot of cash.
His lawyer drops by like clockwork.

703
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:08,164
Where did Pruitt come up with this?

704
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:12,800
That cigar band was in Bobby's truck.
Claims Ganz's prints are on it.

705
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:15,164
I checked. There is a thumbprint.

706
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,967
Mean anything to you?

707
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:21,764
Yeah. Is Cuban. Ganz just got them.

708
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:26,598
You searched that truck.
How did you miss all this cash?

709
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,727
He claimed it was in a panel
under the seat.

710
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:32,722
- Look, Mac, something else.
- What?

711
01:13:32,889 --> 01:13:36,484
After Pruitt left, Wayne came by here.
Had these with him.

712
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,765
Claims the impressions we found...

713
01:13:38,929 --> 01:13:43,923
...match the Whitestone tires on
Pruis car. Exact same tire type.

714
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:45,442
I talked to David.

715
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:49,124
He found a section of Whitestone tire
at the murder scene.

716
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:52,440
I looked through his desk
and couldn't find it.

717
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:57,247
Morgan, you said yourself
he had a blowout recently.

718
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:01,084
- Pruitt could have taken evidence.
- What are you saying?

719
01:14:01,249 --> 01:14:05,037
Wayne also brought over a
9 mm automatic. A Glock.

720
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:08,360
He found it in a washing machine
at the junkyard.

721
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:09,723
So?

722
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:14,963
Those machines were just taken
there. Pruis prints are on the 9.

723
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:19,008
I called his captain. All metro
detectives are issued a.38.

724
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:23,481
- Yes, I know that.
- Well, his primary was a 9 Glock.

725
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:26,637
Yeah.

726
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:29,768
Well?

727
01:14:30,169 --> 01:14:33,525
The shell casing was fired
from the 9 Wayne brought.

728
01:14:40,889 --> 01:14:42,208
All right.

729
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:46,959
Call the hospital.
Get somebody to his wife's room.

730
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:51,966
- Doc Leeds said he took her and left.
- Why not tell me that tomorrow?

731
01:14:53,249 --> 01:14:55,046
Danny, can you slow down?

732
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:58,768
Jess...

733
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:04,681
...you were attacked. You pointed a man
out and said he was the one.

734
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:07,317
He wasn't. Now that man's dead.

735
01:15:08,449 --> 01:15:09,848
I didn't do it.

736
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:13,761
The best thing for us
to do is get out of here.

737
01:15:19,169 --> 01:15:20,318
Danny.

738
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:24,079
Danny, he had tattoos.

739
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:26,408
He had tattoos.

740
01:15:29,249 --> 01:15:30,682
The dog and the knife?

741
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:36,039
You were describing those tattoos.

742
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,086
There was another man.

743
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:52,802
He just stood there
and he watched it happen.

744
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:59,405
I understand now.

745
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,686
You know who did this?

746
01:16:04,129 --> 01:16:08,725
- Yeah. I know who did this.
- You can't just let him go free.

747
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:31,480
This is your career, McKenna.
You think about that.

748
01:16:31,649 --> 01:16:35,961
If what Pruitt says holds water,
is your life. You think about that.

749
01:16:42,209 --> 01:16:43,437
Got a fresh eyeball.

750
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:46,402
He's turned on 21 South
toward the junkyard.

751
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:50,529
He's picking up his gun. Everyone stay
clear. I'll handle this on my own.

752
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:51,803
He's picking up his gun. Everyone stay
clear. I'll handle this on my own.

753
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:28,888
Danny.

754
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:36,328
Stop!

755
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:43,967
Danny. Danny!

756
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:50,721
- Danny, no! No!
- Drop it.

757
01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:52,408
Danny!

758
01:17:57,849 --> 01:17:59,441
Drop the weapon.

759
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:02,484
- No.
- Don't test me, boy.

760
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:03,877
Danny!

761
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:06,080
- He attacked my wife.
- Kill him!

762
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:08,969
- Start making some sense.
- Is okay, Jess.

763
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:10,847
- Tell me.
- Is him.

764
01:18:11,329 --> 01:18:14,002
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.

765
01:18:16,969 --> 01:18:18,322
All right.

766
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,599
We promised to help each other.

767
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:24,562
I'll go first.

768
01:18:35,129 --> 01:18:36,278
Next case.

769
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:39,686
- I didn't kill your son.
- You're a liar.

770
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:44,724
He went to steal my car. When the car
wasn't there, Wayne changed the plan.

771
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:46,686
I didn't kill your son.

772
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:48,762
Look, Morgan.

773
01:18:50,929 --> 01:18:53,682
I found this varsity pin
from his jacket.

774
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:57,285
He left it there. Thas why he left
you the message.

775
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:00,122
He had to tell someone.

776
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:03,362
Dad? I'm sorry.

777
01:19:03,729 --> 01:19:06,323
I was on that road
looking for a hospital...

778
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:08,480
...and we almost collided.

779
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:14,198
Jess thought he was the guy. I jumped
him and put him in the locked trailer.

780
01:19:14,369 --> 01:19:19,318
When your deputies arrived, the doors
were open. You've seen the photos.

781
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:25,728
Look, I left your son alone.
He was alive.

782
01:19:28,809 --> 01:19:32,165
It was Ganz. He was in front of the
cab the whole time.

783
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:35,002
He went back there and
he finished him.

784
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:37,797
Thas why the cigar band was in there.

785
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:42,568
You lied to me.

786
01:19:43,249 --> 01:19:44,682
You gotta believe me.

787
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:48,679
You gotta believe me, Morgan.

788
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:54,004
It was Ganz. Bobby had things on him
that would bury him forever.

789
01:19:57,729 --> 01:19:59,162
Look at him.

790
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,522
He knows.

791
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,605
He's not going anywhere.

792
01:20:13,969 --> 01:20:15,288
It was Pruitt!

793
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,517
Damn you, McKenna.

794
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:23,844
Ask his wife. Go on, ask her.
She was there. She saw everything!

795
01:20:35,009 --> 01:20:37,204
How the hell would you know that?

796
01:20:39,809 --> 01:20:42,039
Your boy was a thief, McKenna.

797
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:45,643
Turn around.

798
01:20:46,449 --> 01:20:49,043
The both of you turn around.
Turn around.

799
01:20:50,369 --> 01:20:56,160
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?
A dozen people know you brought me here.

800
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:10,765
Yeah. You're right.

801
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:13,848
I can't shoot you.

802
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,123
Morgan.

803
01:21:46,049 --> 01:21:48,882
I'm sorry.
If there's anything I can do...

804
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:56,447
I feel a little better.
How about yourself?

805
01:21:58,089 --> 01:22:02,765
Withholding evidence, impeding on a
criminal investigation...

806
01:22:02,929 --> 01:22:07,639
...aggravated assault.
I'll clean that all up.

807
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:14,887
Why don't you take your beautiful wife
and get the hell out of here?

808
01:22:15,049 --> 01:22:18,837
If you ever come back,
come by and talk to me.

809
