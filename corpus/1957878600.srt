the Los Angeles CineFest Film Festival

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,459

and the Oh Scares Awards

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,636
I see you are ready.

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,680
Already.

6
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,351
Let's begin then.

7
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:06,441
Enjoy Franny Kruugerr

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
Welcome to prime time bitch.

9
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,576
Excuse my French. I'm Franny Kruugerr.

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,370
I'm the wife of your favorite character.

11
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,206
The character you've been waiting

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,292
forever to see again on a big screen.

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,129
I can't really say that
my husband is busy nowadays.

14
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,006
Hey, big studios.

15
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:36,513
We can't just live for royalties in those old
films you play over and over again on TV.

16
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,807
My husband needs a job.

17
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,684
He needs to kill some people.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,479
Hello. Anyway,

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,024
I present to you scary stories.

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,240
Previously selected by the Los Angeles Cinefest
Film Festival and the Oh scares Awards.

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,741
Hey, guys.

22
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,410
I can't see shit through this latex mask.

23
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,162
Can somebody read it please?

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,792
A thing of a dreams.

25
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,462
Blind vacation.

26
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,007
A nightmare of a night.

27
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,385
Cakeboy.

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,847
A super surprise.

29
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,807
Fools, Gold.

30
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,602
Coffee with Friends.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,820
Now, you can watch and decide which story you like
the most and one last word to the big studios.

32
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:38,074
Just send my husband that screenplay
you've been working on for 20 years.

33
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,826
The draft is fine.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,163
You can finish it while
you start pre production.

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,748
He needs to be busy.

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,835
Enough with the price is right each day.

37
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,422
He needs to move from my mother's couch,
damn it.

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,672
Ah,

39
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,468
Anyway, enjoy the screening everybody.

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,500
How was it last night?

41
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,128
It was nice.

42
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,684
I won an award last night.

43
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,519
Big one.

44
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,398
You were there, by my side.

45
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,025
It's amazing.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:03,493
I just thought that success would have
me getting a raise or winning a lottery?

47
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,868
This is different.

48
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,455
So vivid.

49
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,747
What a word.

50
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,418
Wasn't specific.
It was just this like ambiguous award.

51
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,587
You know how dreams are.

52
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,548
So,

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,263
How was that last night?

54
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,406
What?

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,476
You've taken sexuals five nights in a row.

56
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,062
Must be pretty good.

57
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,657
I I I don't dream about you.

58
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,369
I thought you knew that.

59
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
Why would I know that?

60
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,871
I don't know.

61
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:54,419
I thought you were dreaming about somebody else
when you took sexuals and I was okay with it.

62
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,135
I only dream about you.

63
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,473
I thought the whole point was so that we could be
with other people and not have to worry about it.

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,393
Oh, then.

65
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,602
It's not me.

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,810
Who are you thinking about it?
It's no one specific.

67
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,111
It's like some ambiguous person.

68
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,488
You know, like your awards thingy.

69
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,281
Hey.

70
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,034
Hey.

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,707
Figure out what you can do.

72
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,168
I think you should mix tonight.

73
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,338
You want me to induce a nightmare?

74
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,841
It's the only way to refresh dream content.

75
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,969
Clear this way.
They can be a little intense.

76
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,223
I mean, that's what I heard
but I just can't keep doing this.

77
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
Knowing that you're
dreaming about someone else.

78
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,062
At least this way we have
a chance at starting over.

79
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,605
John,

80
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,066
Come on. I think you owe me this.

81
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,487
I owe you?

82
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,449
I do a lot for you. We
do a lot for each other.

83
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,051
I think you should do this for me.

84
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,275
Inducing a nightmare can completely mess
with your mind. People have gotten hurt.

85
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,623
I'll just stop taking them for a while.
I'll reset that way.

86
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,208
You might have an echo.

87
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,127
You've taken them so much.

88
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
It might not go away without mixing.

89
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,089
It's not going to be so bad.

90
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,632
I'm going to watch over you.

91
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,888
I'm not going to do it.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,310
Okay.

93
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,313
Okay

94
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,608
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,904
I'm sorry. I get it. It's okay.

96
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,323
Okay.

97
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,617
How could you?

98
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,433
Hey,

99
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,853
it's okay. It's okay. Come on.

100
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,986
You are alright. It's okay.

101
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,891
So,

102
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,058
how did it go?

103
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,438
You're such a fucking jerk. We're done.

104
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,993
Goodbye.

105
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,704
Goodbye.

106
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,504
To vacation.

107
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,589
Va-cation.

108
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Let's do it.

109
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,269
A DIY reliable way to find mental clarity.

110
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,770
Ready?

111
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Yup.

112
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,482
Supplies.

113
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,943
Miller's glue dissolves after 4 days.

114
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,779
Seaworld blindfolds,
knots that do not unknot.

115
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,536
Directions, use of
cellphones is prohibited.

116
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,621
Make plenty of food
that is easily accessible.

117
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,665
Wear the blindfold for seven days.

118
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,917
Warning in case of an
emergency apply water.

119
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,086
Results, a real mental vacation.

120
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,129
It coming.

121
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,009
Oh where did you go?
Hey, give me your hand.

122
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,469
I am bored.

123
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:54,518
Slide.

124
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,691
Where are you?

125
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,693
I was over here.

126
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,279
Where did you go? I was over here.

127
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,699
Another shot for being young.

128
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,914
I'm feeling good, baby.

129
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,253
Fuck. This isn't working.

130
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,588
Let's take them off.

131
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,650
Shit.

132
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:34,110
Oh.

133
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:42,918
I can't. I can't get it out.
It has only been 4 days.

134
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,466
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Get off.

135
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,637
Argh. No. No. No. No.

136
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,015
Argh.

137
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,436
Ouch.

138
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,835
Hello?

139
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,588
Hey, how are you?

140
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,048
Oh,

141
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,222
Jack and I just got in a few hours ago.

142
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,810
We are just trying to figure out something for
dinner. We haven't eaten since breakfast.

143
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:07,746
Well,

144
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,440
I was going to try this new pasta recipe

145
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,485
but now that I know that
I'm only cooking for two.

146
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,240
What? No. No. I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry.

147
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,702
Great. Well,

148
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,664
Give Jimmy my love and
tell him to rest up.

149
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,919
No, he just went out to the store
to get some stuff for dinner.

150
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,546
Will tell him you said that though.

151
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,384
No, stop apologizing.

152
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,513
We rent to the house for a whole week
so just get up here when you can.

153
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,057
Hello?

154
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,370
Hello. Hey, it's me.

155
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,540
Sorry, I just lost cell service.

156
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,544
No, it's probably nothing to worry about.

157
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,214
Uh my weather app
says there's a snow storm coming

158
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,507
so probably just knocked out the signal.

159
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,594
Hello?

160
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,394
And I guess the landline too.

161
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,155
No WiFi.

162
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,909
It's going to be a long week.

163
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,539
I am going to lose my mind.

164
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,754
Argh.

165
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,048
Argh.

166
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,353
Oh,

167
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,567
No, not the lights too.

168
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
Oh, thank God.

169
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,697
Oh Jesus Christ.

170
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,615
You almost gave me a heart attack.

171
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,827
It's not funny. Come on,
it was a little funny.

172
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,871
Wait, what,

173
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,890
what happened to your hand?
Are you okay? Oh,

174
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,499
just being a clutch like usual.

175
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,295
I dropped a glass and then sliced my hand
while picking up the pieces.

176
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,691
It looks pretty bad. Are you sure you are
alright? We could go to the hospital. I'm fine.

177
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,799
You sure?

178
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,509
I'm fine.

179
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,097
It's not as bad as it looks. It's not
that deep. It's just this causes all I had.

180
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,348
Alright.

181
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,159
What you got going on over here though?

182
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,518
Yeah. Smells really good.

183
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,052
Yeah, you don't have to lie.
I know you hate my cooking.

184
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,873
No one hates your cooking. Who told you?
Did my brother say that?

185
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,232
No,

186
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,653
And speaking of which, have you heard
from her? Shouldn't they be here by now?

187
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,295
Yeah,

188
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,742
I just got off the phone with Maggie. She said Jimmy's
not feeling well so they're not going to make it.

189
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,243
Like at all?

190
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,535
I saw them.

191
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,290
They might make it here eventually. I didn't
really have a chance to talk to them.

192
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,085
The phone line cut out
because of the snow?

193
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,418
What snow?

194
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,379
It's not snowing?

195
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,382
No, it's just out there.
I don't see any snow.

196
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:08,970
Uh I just assume
because why else would I lose service?

197
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,932
Plus the landline and
the WiFi went out too.

198
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,314
That's that's really odd. You know,
I think I saw the router downstairs.

199
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,880
I can go try and at least get
that back for you. Thank you.

200
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,399
Oh, hey, Jack. Yeah.

201
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,360
Just be careful. I will.

202
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,369
Jack?

203
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,255
Jack?

204
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:58,595
No.

205
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,384
Jack?

206
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,640
Jack, what are you doing?

207
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,478
Did you get the internet fixed?

208
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:59,114
Oh.

209
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
What do you want?

210
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,756
My boyfriend.

211
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
My boyfriend…No, he's not.

212
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,265
We have friends coming.

213
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,141
They'll be here any minute.

214
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,769
I heard your phone call.

215
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,438
No one's coming.

216
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,317
It's just me and you.

217
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,030
The police.

218
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,615
I'll call the police.

219
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,328
That's going to be kind of hard since
I cut the phone line.

220
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Your face.

221
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,545
I haven't seen your faces. No.

222
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,090
You can just leave. I won't tell anyone.

223
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,969
Mia.

224
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,140
Mia.

225
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,267
Come on.

226
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,144
Turn around.

227
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,271
Look at me.

228
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,066
I want to see that beautiful face of yours.

229
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Come on.

230
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,415
There we go.

231
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,669
Please don't hurt me.

232
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,632
Come on.

233
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,553
We both know it's far too late for that.

234
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,598
Mia?

235
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,769
I'm going to kill you.

236
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,188
Ouch.

237
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,249
Mia.

238
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,592
Mia.

239
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,136
Jack.

240
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,596
Please.

241
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,140
Jack.

242
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,520
Are you hurt?

243
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,312
No.

244
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,439
I'm coming.

245
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,864
Hold on there. Hold on. Hurry.

246
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,001
I'm coming Jack.

247
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,555
I am coming.

248
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,122
Jack.

249
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,583
Jack,

250
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,668
I'm here. Where are you?

251
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,755
Jack.

252
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,134
Jack.

253
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,554
Mia.

254
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,267
Mia.

255
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,021
Mia.

256
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,026
Mia.

257
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:44,365
Come out.
Come out wherever you are.

258
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,872
What are you doing down there?

259
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:59,164
Run.

260
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,145
Mia.

261
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,399
Mia.

262
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,277
Mia, come on.

263
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,735
Mia.

264
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,030
Mia.

265
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,264
Mia.

266
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,641
Wake up.

267
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,260
I am not mean yet. Not too mean?

268
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,597
Insult my shark one more time and
I'll show you mean.

269
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,098
You like my shark?

270
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,225
There's a shark.

271
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,478
Kinda reminds me of a
bottle-boased dolphin.

272
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,853
Where is it's bloat hole?

273
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:31,277
I am sick and tired..When I am done…

274
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,811
This is going to look like the

275
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,322
Sure, can I take this?

276
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
I don't think I ordered anything.

277
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,847
You didn't? Your neighbor did actually.

278
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,474
Uh do you know your neighbor?

279
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,643
Yeah, a little. Why?

280
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:08,481
Well, this needs to be delivered today and it needs to
be refrigerated. Otherwise, I would just leave it here.

281
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Well, what is it?

282
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,902
I honestly don't know. It just
has the handling instructions with it.

283
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,906
Yeah, well, he's like some sort
of food pastry scientist or something.

284
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,244
He's probably some rare French
bullshit you know, like ultra perishable.

285
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,996
He's having special meats
delivered all the time.

286
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,751
Yeah, that's cool. Uh so, I was just
wondering if maybe you could hold on to it

287
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,171
and give it to him when he gets home.
Just keep it in the fridge.

288
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,540
You know, that kind of thing.

289
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,299
Yeah, I guess.

290
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,468
Dude, thank you. I appreciate that.

291
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,680
Here, if you could just
sign right there for me.

292
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,807
Isn't this against like your
delivery policy or something?

293
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,182
Yes.

294
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,018
Hey Pat,

295
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,521
I have your cake that was delivered today.

296
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,733
Come over anytime to grab it tonight.

297
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,027
I'll be up pretty late.

298
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,638
Pat didn't come for his cake today.

299
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,608
That's alright. I'll get
it to him tomorrow.

300
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,170
Pat.

301
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,365
Jesus, what the fuck?

302
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,243
Hi there, neighbor. How you doing?

303
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,664
What time is it? And what can't I move?

304
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:34,460
Whoa, it's about 4 AM buddy and you can't
move because I've restrained you to the bed.

305
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,629
Okay, question. Why?

306
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,548
I'll get to that in a minute but first,

307
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,966
how's the cake?

308
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,011
Dude, I'm sorry I eat a slice of your cake.

309
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,596
No, no, I'm serious.

310
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,765
I need to know how it tasted.

311
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,935
I need to know how my work was received.

312
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,728
If you made the cake,

313
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:57,233
why did you have it sent to your house
instead of just bringing it home yourself?

314
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,883
I knew if I had it sent to you,
you probably wouldn't eat it.

315
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,281
You're so paranoid about being poisoned

316
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,493
and you're bored
so the thrill of eating someone else's cake

317
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,496
and having to deal with me tomorrow,
drama, drama.

318
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,913
Give you something to do.

319
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,749
You're a goddamn psycho.

320
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,836
I needed to know that
you would eat that cake and now,

321
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,088
Now,

322
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,341
you're a part of history.

323
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:28,723
The cake you ate is the bridge
between man and dessert.

324
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,183
Oh, help me.

325
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,936
Dear god, help.

326
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,981
Shhhh.

327
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,483
Let me clue you in.

328
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,943
A few years ago,

329
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,405
I developed a taste for human flesh
while on the Amazon.

330
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,282
Lately,

331
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,328
lately, I've been craving something sweet
rather than savory

332
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:55,374
and nothing could be found to satisfy that
sweet tooth and I've tried everything.

333
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
Chocolate marrow cake,

334
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,003
pork belly donuts,

335
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,005
black truffle,

336
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,507
and foil gras bread pudding. Hm?

337
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,219
Inspired, huh? And then,
it dawned on me.

338
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,140
What be sweeter than the real thing.

339
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,767
Oh.

340
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:17,563
What in fuck's fuck is going on?

341
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,731
Don't you get it?

342
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,358
You're the cake man now.

343
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,112
Not much of a man so we're like cake boy.

344
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,197
Cake boy.

345
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,117
What in the actual fuck

346
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,456
How the hell am I
supposed to live like this?

347
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:37,750
You're not.

348
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,753
No. No.

349
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,588
No. No.

350
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,758
No. No. No. No.

351
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:53,974
Oh my god. I can feel that. Ah.

352
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,186
Would you like a piece?

353
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,189
Pat, don't, don't take,
don't eat that. Pat,

354
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:06,362
don't eat that. I'm your neighbor.

355
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,995
You're you're eating me Pat.

356
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,915
Hey Dad, you want to bring air freshener?
I'm going to destroy that bathroom later.

357
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:08,174
If you guys wanted to swim, Frank
said that there's towels in the bathroom.

358
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,711
Did anyone bring any drinks?

359
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,758
Any what?

360
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,385
Like water.

361
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,391
Hey, tomorrow we're driving for five hours to
disposal and you want to stop halfway where?

362
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,560
I just wanted to stop
by at the Oregon Organs.

363
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,395
They have the best shoe though.

364
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:27,109
Uh we just told your aunt's show that
we'd get to her before 5 PM.

365
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,695
Honestly, if we don't have time,
don't worry about it.

366
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,112
Are you sure?

367
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,656
No stress at all.

368
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,536
Are we supposed to all sleep on this crap?

369
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,995
I call upside.

370
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,103
Where's my other bag?

371
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,148
Did you leave it in the car?

372
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,860
Do you think he knows?

373
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,489
No, I don't think so.

374
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,826
Yo. Hey, man. Happy early birthday.
Thanks, Frank.

375
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,788
So, the nephew's still giving you that
birthday party?

376
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,499
Um,

377
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,975
You know I'm not supposed to know right?

378
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,463
Oh well that's right. It was supposed
to be a surprise wasn't it? Right.

379
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,549
But yeah I'm pretty sure.

380
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,759
Yeah my phone's dying.
Does anyone have a charger?

381
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,842
What happened to yours?

382
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,885
I left mine in the car.

383
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,136
Do you have a charger?

384
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,347
I got one right here.

385
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,807
What is this?

386
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,268
Uh that's just a pic of dad with us.

387
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,812
I took it from... Cool.
Do you have a charger?

388
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,398
Uh charger. Dude I left mine in the car.

389
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,108
Uh idiot. Do you have a charger?

390
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,028
I need a big one. Thank God.
Does No one bring me a charger anymore?

391
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,947
Are the boys doing okay by the way?

392
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:55,697
Yeah.

393
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,951
Uh it's good. I thought it would be
really rough actually with their dad dying

394
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,971
but I I guess they're
really hanging in there.

395
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,248
I mean, man, especially with the
police coming after him and everything.

396
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,710
You know, they're a tough bunch.
They're really mature for their age.

397
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,169
Why don't you just shut up?

398
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,020
Why don't you just get your own charger?

399
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,047
No, ask me for it.

400
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,048
Out of three.

401
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:17,469
Okay. One, two, three, two. Idiot.

402
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,973
Thanks again for letting us
stay in your guest house.

403
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,602
Oh, yeah. No problem at all. Hey, when
you have time, come on up to the house.

404
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,020
Yeah, cool.

405
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,606
I will be up in 5 minutes. Is that cool?

406
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Hello.

407
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,942
Still there,

408
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,280
bro? Ah shoot.

409
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,167
Oh, that was quick.

410
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,464
What the hell? Where's my charger?

411
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,883
Okay, I'm getting it.

412
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,345
Also get my phone. Yep.

413
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,930
Your light back too. Thank you. Yep.

414
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,766
Yo. Where are you going?

415
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,492
I'm just getting some stuff in the car.

416
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,557
Cool. Could you grab
my charger while you are at it?

417
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,481
The key's right there at the table. Okay.

418
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:16,028
Oh my God. What was that?

419
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,238
What's going on?

420
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,451
Oh my God, that's Frank.

421
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,578
Call the police. I got it. I got it.

422
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,456
Fuck my phone's dead.

423
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,420
Oh my God. Guys,
you might have company.

424
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,595
Turn off the lights.

425
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,630
We don't have any money.

426
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,341
We called the police. They're on their way.

427
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,179
I don't want money.

428
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,100
What do you want?

429
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,355
To kill the boys.

430
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,321
Why are you doing this?

431
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,230
How are you guys holding up?

432
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,050
Don't worry about it too much.
We're going to get out of here.

433
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,990
All we have to do is think,

434
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,535
positive

435
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,733
Hey boys, do me and yourselves a favor.

436
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,610
Take the cyanide pills.

437
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,406
It's quick and painless and less
gruesome than shooting you in the head.

438
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,868
Let me know
on the walkie talkie when you decide.

439
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,165
Can't we just make a run for it?

440
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,043
He has to fall asleep sometime, right?

441
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,963
Yeah, but how would we know
when he falls asleep?

442
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,173
I can risk it. Alright.

443
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,216
Alright.

444
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,551
I got a plan.

445
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,281
I'm going to go up there and rush him

446
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,267
and when I see him. Stupid idea.
He has a gun. He's going to shoot you.

447
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,307
You're right.

448
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,976
We'll think of something though.

449
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,312
Something will come up.

450
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,985
A stack.

451
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,700
Okay. Moment of truth.

452
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,455
Looks like your fragile phone.

453
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,875
Nice going, idiot.

454
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,710
Did you guys feel that?

455
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,379
What are you talking about?

456
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,257
Feels like air.

457
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,387
Woah.

458
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,028
He's got a gun.

459
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:57,285
Help me out. I can't. I'm stuck.

460
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,710
Good try.

461
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,754
You almost got away with it.

462
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,300
I am sorry guys,

463
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,262
I can't let that happen.

464
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,783
Guys, the letter has dad's handwriting.

465
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,951
But dad's dead.

466
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,746
There is just one way to find out.

467
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,789
Dad.

468
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,957
Dad, is that you?

469
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,964
You figured it out.

470
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,681
What happened to your voice?

471
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,645
Broken windshield lodged into my throat.

472
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,067
I'm lucky I'm able to talk.
I'm lucky to be alive and all.

473
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,905
Why do you want to kill us?

474
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,828
Because boys,

475
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,580
you tried to kill me.

476
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,544
You tried to kill me.

477
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,094
So what did you guys do exactly?

478
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,305
Tamper with its brakes

479
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,850
Tamper with its brakes? Okay.

480
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,230
You know he deserved it, right? He
was a murderer. He just never got caught.

481
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,694
So how do you guys feel
about electrocuting him?

482
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,045
Man, I can really go
for some sushi right now.

483
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,006
Maybe some Indian food.

484
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,260
How about Tafoo?

485
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,970
Are you sure he's not out there?

486
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,387
Yeah, sure.

487
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,766
So you sure that he never wears shoes?

488
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,269
Yeah, he's always careful when he can be?

489
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,689
So the main question is,

490
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,793
how are we going to get him down here?

491
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,153
Oh, just give him the locket.
He'll come down for sure.

492
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,616
Hello.

493
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,496
Hey bro, are you there?

494
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,544
Remember that locket that
you wanted when we were kids?

495
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,631
It's yours if you want it.

496
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,843
Mom used to say that

497
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,514
a locket is supposed to protect you
from anything bad and evil.

498
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,226
I do want that locket.

499
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,730
So what's your story?

500
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,817
When I was in the hospital,

501
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:02,739
I paid the doctor a lot of money
to make it look like I was dead.

502
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,032
Why?

503
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,161
So the police would stop looking for me.

504
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,665
I was trying to leave town

505
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,668
but the boys tried to
get rid of me instead.

506
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,754
They were protecting themselves. No,

507
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,841
they tried to kill me just
because they wanted to.

508
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,595
I don't believe that. What can I say?

509
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,055
It runs in the family.

510
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,598
Makes a father proud.

511
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,935
But to let them live
after what they did to me.

512
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,478
I'm sorry.

513
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,982
I can't let that happen.
Then you're going to have to kill me too.

514
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,608
Okay, fine.

515
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,653
Everyone's going to
die in that guest house.

516
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:45,532
It's time for a super surprise.

517
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,909
Wait, what'd you say?

518
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,787
Time for a super surprise.

519
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,416
I always say that
before I end someone's life.

520
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,619
Alright, now.

521
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,548
It is not working.

522
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:44,966
Try the other one.

523
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,471
What the hell? Why is it not working?

524
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,937
What the hell happened?

525
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,856
I don't know, I plugged it in.

526
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,824
Shit.

527
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,094
Growing up.

528
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,890
I believed everything mom used to say.

529
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,561
I still believe till this very day.

530
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,232
I believe in the locket.

531
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,194
I believe it keeps you safe.

532
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,282
I believe it keeps
everything that's bad away.

533
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,205
And he gave it to me.

534
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,584
You gave it to me, bro.

535
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,089
I want to thank you.

536
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:14,431
Cause now you guys have nothing to protect
yourselves from me.

537
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,074
Oh, Shoot.

538
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,580
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get out now.
Get out now.

539
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,753
Oh shoot, it's everywhere.

540
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,676
Guys, bounce it. Now.

541
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,525
Where are you?

542
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,530
No more hiding

543
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:19,162
It's time for a super surprise.

544
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,012
Is he alive?

545
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,890
Check his pulse idiot.

546
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,140
No.

547
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,352
Please check if he's breathing.

548
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:46,981
I don't

549
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,617
Check his pulse idiot.

550
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,639
I'm going to taste better
with some real food.

551
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,703
What are you going to eat?

552
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,830
You guys want tafoo?

553
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,709
Yeah? Okay, cool. Let me go places.

554
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,054
Guys, I don't feel so good.

555
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,433
Don't worry, the cyanide
works pretty quick.

556
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,901
A few weeks ago,
I overheard you guys talking about me.

557
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,903
I heard someone say,

558
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,281
time for a super surprise.

559
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,617
I bet you guys are going to
give me a birthday party but now,

560
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,870
I know you guys just wanted to kill me.

561
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,624
I'm sorry guys.

562
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,544
I can't let that happen.

563
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,832
Hell,

564
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,668
looks like I had a nasty fall.

565
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,630
I am the shadow with no name

566
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,633
I am the cold wind.

567
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,554
I extinguish man's flame.

568
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,473
You know what, stranger?
I thought I twisted my ankle but

569
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,684
I guess it's just a false alarm.

570
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,645
Come, Wesley Jenkins.

571
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:18,401
I shall shepherd you off this mortal goile
and Gazoos.

572
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,529
Gazoos.

573
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,364
It's kind of like a harmonica.

574
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,117
You blow into it and
a funny sound comes out the other end.

575
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,077
Kids absolutely love em.

576
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,371
Now, that's something I could invest in.

577
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,833
Invest? That's right. I'm rich now

578
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,292
and when you're rich,

579
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,383
you need to start making wise decisions
if you want to keep it that way.

580
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:43,801
Material goods of a living no
longer concern you. Material goods?

581
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,263
Well, of course, we buy some land,
stranger if that's what you're getting at.

582
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:53,394
I don't rightly know where yet but once I figure
that out. I reckon I'll build a big old house,

583
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,687
barn,

584
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,272
horses,

585
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,650
possibly six. I grow tired of this.

586
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:00,984
Your brand.

587
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,279
Enough.

588
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,785
My goodness,
I can't believe I didn't see this before.

589
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,244
You are.

590
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,498
You are. Yes!

591
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,166
A thief.

592
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,375
What?

593
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,004
No. Trying to steal my gold, huh?

594
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,049
My patience grows thin.

595
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,636
Wow.

596
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,514
So you sell snake oil?

597
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:33,059
Is that it? I am the collector of souls.

598
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,309
Uh huh.

599
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:39,732
And you those souls.

600
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,651
$21, 000.

601
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:42,584
What?

602
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,697
Chunk of gold this big is easily worth
21 thousand dollars.

603
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,575
So I admire the smoking mirrors partner

604
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:53,037
but there's no way in
hell you're getting my gold.

605
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,581
No way in hell.

606
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:56,998
Well

607
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,601
Shit.

608
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:45,790
Birds flying sound

609
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,269
Maybe you should try that on yourself.

610
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,939
You think so?

611
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,523
Why not?

612
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,360
Add a little flavor to your coffee.

613
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,821
Ever think I'm alive despite you?

614
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:58,037
It is a chore to be haunted by the living.

615
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,667
Look out that window.

616
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,211
Nobody is alive out there.

617
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,339
They're just moving automatically.

618
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,052
Well, the weather is nice at least.

619
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,846
You know what this world needs?

620
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,057
Applied eugenics,

621
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,267
birth control in the water supply,

622
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,062
rigorous psychological testing,

623
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:26,691
and auditing of finances before
breeding is allowed.

624
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,695
Are we expecting more?

625
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,657
You never know who might show up.

626
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,377
Coffee's good today.

627
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,477
Do you remember when you were a little boy

628
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:56,345
and your father and I found you in the
driveway pulling the wings off a dragonfly?

629
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,014
No.

630
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:04,520
I asked you how you would feel
if somebody did that to you.

631
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,023
Do you remember what you said?

632
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,443
How old was I?

633
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,281
Eight or nine I think.

634
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:19,952
I don't remember.

635
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,166
You said it wouldn't matter
because you'd be dead

636
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,626
and you wouldn't feel anything.

637
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,964
A sad and lonely boy.

638
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,218
I wanted to give you a hug

639
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,220
but you terrified me.

640
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,724
Had nightmares for years about you.

641
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,559
About me.

642
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,898
I thought for sure
you'd kill us in our sleep.

643
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,652
Is it so bad?

644
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,616
What's so bad?

645
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:00,993
The rest of it.

646
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,084
I suppose not.

647
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,921
I guess nightmares do come true.

648
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:15,382
Sometimes.

649
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,679
This is really good coffee.

650
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,681
Would you like some more?

651
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,186
No, but I think I'd really like a
cup of water. That'd be great.

652
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,190
Just stay hydrated.

653
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,250
How long do you plan on being here today?

654
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,088
Are you sick of me already?

655
01:08:55,464 --> 01:09:00,761
No, on average, it takes three
generations to be completely forgotten.

656
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,139
You know, your father and I tried.

657
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,100
We really did. It was your mother.

658
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,769
Your mother made it so hard.

659
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,896
You don't know the half of it.

660
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,815
We gave up.

661
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,067
Oh, We had to.

662
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,237
It was making life harder on you.

663
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,572
That's right.

664
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,490
You gave up.

665
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,953
Yeah, but you got your pound of
flesh in the end now, didn't you?

666
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,734
Can we talk about something else?

667
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:35,045
When are you going to assume
some responsibility for your own actions?

668
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:43,470
Did you read that article about the millionaire
whose body was found at the bottom of a cliff?

669
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,682
I didn't.

670
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,977
And I'm sure you know something about it.

671
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,064
This guy was completely crippled

672
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,733
but he makes a comeback.

673
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,362
He decides he wants to
dedicate his life to helping people.

674
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,910
So, he opens this gym
and it is a brilliant success.

675
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,786
Then, last week,

676
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,830
they find him at the foot of a cliff.

677
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,458
Nobody has a clue what happened.

678
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,002
I always loved a good mystery.

679
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,298
You should have stayed in Albuquerque.

680
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,764
And miss having coffee with my stepson.

681
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,148
So dry.

682
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:45,524
Sigh.

683
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,787
Hello.

684
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,458
That is not how we taught you
to answer the phone.

685
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:58,754
You say hello, Smith Residence,
Dennis speaking,

686
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,340
I am so dry.

687
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,245
What's up, bitches

688
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,497
Good morning, Nora.

689
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,499
Ladies don't speak like that.

690
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,793
Ladies don't do anal, Carla.

691
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,212
You smell like piss. I smell great.

692
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:41,504
Don't be rude.

693
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,048
She's a slut.

694
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:44,674
A slut?

695
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,222
Carla, I was a virgin until your son got
in this. Oh, it's okay. Spare me. Really?

696
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,556
I was just pissed.

697
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,894
Technically, no.

698
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,480
Love, Carla. I was his first love.

699
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:06,772
You are and always will be.
You know, I forgive you if I could.

700
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,330
This coffee looks like shit.

701
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,456
Can I make some more?

702
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,665
Go ahead.

703
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:26,133
That is disgusting.

704
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,303
I can't breathe.
Can someone please open the door?

705
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,762
Sure.

706
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,351
Ladies and gentlemen,

707
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,144
above and below.

708
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,812
Beware our host.

709
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,273
He is a heartbreaker for sure.

710
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,027
Don't do that.

711
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,739
Nobody is listening, Dennis.
No one even cares.

712
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,824
Just another rebel runaway.

713
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,700
No one even considers that you might
be rotting away in a junkyard something

714
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:59,041
or a shallow grave in the desert
or left on the floor like fucking garbage.

715
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:02,878
For fuck's sake, can't we have
a normal cup of coffee for once?

716
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,554
I need some music.

717
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,975
There's always music in the air.

718
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:20,020
From a balcony to in Venice

719
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,898
to the auto body shop down the street.

720
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:29,154
You can feel it.
So don't ruin it with your garbage.

721
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:35,285
Uh Dennis,
do you even think of stepping the shit up?

722
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,080
I haven't moved it. Thank,

723
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,658
What is this?

724
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,994
She's right, it's garbage.

725
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,830
It's not for zombies but it's okay.

726
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,044
There.

727
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,507
Can we please enjoy our coffee in peace?

728
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,357
You know, the birds are my favorite part.

729
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:49,108
What birds?

730
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,196
The ones at 6 AM when
the sun isn't quite up.

731
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,490
Mist is on the ground.

732
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:57,034
You're at the sound of a
train off in the distance.

733
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,745
Beaks pecking against your fucking scones.

734
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:03,665
Yes, the music nobody hears but you.

735
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,047
Dearness,

736
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,549
did another one follow you home?

737
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,220
I don't remember this one.

738
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:20,557
Hey,

739
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,560
why don't you come join us?

740
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,605
We have coffee and whiskey.

741
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:29,649
Water?

742
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,361
No? Okay.

743
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,363
So I'll make you some coffee.

744
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:47,209
Eustes, right? How have you been?

745
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:50,003
Coffee is really good.

746
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,051
Oh.

747
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:03,725
Young lady, I know this is a confusing time
but you will behave yourself in this house.

748
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,395
Feel better now?

749
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:10,649
So, tell us about yourself.

750
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,526
How do you know my son?

751
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,404
Probably not the way I do.

752
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,322
Oh, shoot.

753
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,616
So are you from around here?

754
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,201
She is now.

755
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,375
Look,
I know it can be really confusing at first

756
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,087
but you get used to it and
we're actually not the worst company.

757
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:36,967
I'm fine with it.

758
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,467
You're fine with it?

759
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,304
It's just so dry.

760
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,355
Hello.

761
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,863
Maybe it was your conscience calling.

762
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,492
Your jokes are what I hated most about you.

763
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,286
They were never funny.

764
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,582
I know you too.
Don't even get me started on you and you.

765
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,063
I think I'll switch back to coffee.

766
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,190
I think that's a good idea.

767
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,610
It's really a good coffee, Dennis.
Where'd you get it?

768
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,907
Uh down the street,
this little hipster coffee shop.

769
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,199
Hipster.

770
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,283
Is that a new word?

771
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,662
I can't wait. Thanks, Carla.

772
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:47,829
It's okay.

773
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,958
I don't like their to-go cups.

774
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,209
The to-go cups?

775
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,963
I need some water.
Yeah, it, the liner in them.

776
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,340
The Liner?

777
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,051
My mouth is so dry.

778
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:09,385
It's it's not wax like most paper cups.
It's this weird plastic.

779
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,895
Hurry. It gives you cancer.

780
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,940
Do you know what cancer is?

781
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:18,318
It's a growth in your body and kills you.

782
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,739
Cancer is your own body
rebelling against mortality

783
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:30,163
like any other cell with a life cycle.
It lives it grows it dies,

784
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,124
but this cell,

785
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,167
this cell decides it doesn't want to die.

786
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,836
So what does it do?

787
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:41,550
It eats all of the other cells around it.
Feeding, growing,

788
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,343
metastasizing,

789
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:48,140
and a relentless quest for life and
basically refusing to die.

790
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:50,593
It's kind of like you Dennis.

791
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,644
You're a fucking cancer.

792
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,126
Elevens.

793
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,467
Coffee.

794
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,452
This is delicious.

795
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,788
I knew it was your favorite.

796
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,664
You seem to know a lot about me.

797
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,627
Sure he don't want some coffee?

798
01:19:58,919 --> 01:19:59,919
God no.

799
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:04,382
I serve served that cheap shit every day.

800
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:05,926
I can't stand the smell.

801
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:33,411
You know, ice cream isn't
a very nutritious breakfast.

802
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:38,208
I don't think nutrition
matters much anymore.

803
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,449
I was about to go back to school.

804
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:17,080
I was only working at that coffee
shop on break for extra cash and.

805
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:20,292
I know. I mean,
astrophysics is a tough major.

806
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,587
Serving coffee was about as mindless
of a job as I could do.

807
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,581
I thought you did it well.
And I thought you were nice.

808
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,469
But you were going to leave.

809
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,347
What is that gotta do with anything?

810
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:38,685
Everyone always leaves.

811
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:45,859
It was was the only way that
I could keep you.

812
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,194
I wasn't yours to keep.

813
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,164
But you are now.

814
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,419
Would you dance with me?

815
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:07,631
I guess.

816
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,136
It was good once.

817
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,305
Sure of it.

818
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,892
Did it tell you about the Randy?

819
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:20,644
No.

820
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:22,604
It's 12.

821
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:25,065
Just come home from shopping with mama.

822
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,484
You know it's out the way for you.

823
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,236
I heard this terrible screams.

824
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:33,949
Hiding in the trees with
all these morning birds.

825
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,326
It's this awful sound.

826
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,956
I looked around finding
this rabbit hit by a car.

827
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:43,792
Didn't die. In the desert sands.

828
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,002
His intestines were out.

829
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:50,757
I mean it was pulling itself along,
dragging, screaming.

830
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,509
In the radio static.

831
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:55,804
My mom gave me a pellet gun

832
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:58,264
and told me to take care of it. So,

833
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:04,020
I did but something has always bothered.

834
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,647
What?

835
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,484
Where do you think it was going?

836
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:16,449
I wish we could have just discussed
the weather like normal people.

837
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,243
I'm sorry.

838
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,245
I know.

839
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:55,757
Hey, guys. Do you need me or?

840
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:59,010
Nope. That's it for today.

841
01:24:59,385 --> 01:24:59,985
Oh,

842
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,098
I thought you wanted me to say something at
the end of the compilation

843
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:06,726
or in between shorts.
I prepared some lines.

844
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:10,021
Nope, that's it. It's a wrap.

845
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,820
Finally! I was dying in that mask.

846
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,073
Okay, see you next time.

847
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:08,256
Aaaaa.

848
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:13,770
Please, no, no.
