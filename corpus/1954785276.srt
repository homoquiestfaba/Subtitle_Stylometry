1
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,770
For the first two weeks of my life,
I didn't have a name.

2
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,600
- Dede couldn't make up her mind.
- Hi, kid.

3
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
She finally decided on Fred.

4
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,740
She said she'd never heard of
a little kid named Fred before.

5
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,240
When I'm dancin' at Radio City once a
week, you can have fries when you want.

6
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,660
But right now, you gotta eat this shit.

7
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,040
- Yes, you do.
- No.

8
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,920
- No?
- No.

9
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
If you think I'm gonna say "choo-choo"
to get you to open up your mouth...

10
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,680
...you got another think comin'.
- Koffer.

11
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,520
What is with you today, huh?
No koffer. That's food for you to eat, OK?

12
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,900
- Koffer, Mommy.
- No, Fred. That's a plate. No koffer.

13
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,400
Koffer!

14
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,950
Look. All right? No koffer, it's a plate.

15
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,660
Jesus.

16
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,420
Koffer.

17
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,190
Definitely not like Matt Montini.

18
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,950
He's the kid I admire most.

19
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,580
Matt Montini is always
kickball team captain.

20
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,960
Matt Montini always has
someone to eat lunch with.

21
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,750
- What about Fred?
- Tate's a wuss.

22
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,550
Oof!

23
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,100
- What a dork!
- Tate's a loser!

24
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,910
...that I never paid attention,
that I was probably retarded...

25
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,460
...and that I had a very limited future
as a citizen of the United States.

26
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,510
Then, a week later, she said
I should probably skip second grade...

27
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,470
...maybe even skip
elementary school altogether.

28
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,400
All I want is someone to eat lunch with.

29
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,030
Fred Tate?

30
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,540
Fred Tate!

31
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,090
All right. Let's all be good citizens...

32
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,600
...and be very, very quiet for Fred.

33
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,520
Oh, a visitor.

34
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,310
How lovely to see you, Miss Tate.

35
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,860
Fred and I are just getting
ready to do a little duet.

36
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,150
The kid's got an appointment.

37
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,160
Then we'll just make it one quickie
little verse, if that's all right with you.

38
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,080
- Yeah, whatever.
- Fred.

39
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,430
that there's just too little of

40
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,720
- You were playing backwards again.
- It's a stupid song, Dede.

41
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,610
Dede says I don't have a dad.
She says I'm the lmmaculate Conception.

42
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,330
That's a pretty big responsibility
for a little kid.

43
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,590
His allergies might be getting better,
but I see no improvement in the stomach.

44
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,100
Has he been following the diet?

45
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,430
Fred just doesn't like baby food.
He never liked it.

46
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,730
Does he like havin' an ulcer?
Dede, if he doesn't follow the diet...

47
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,280
...he's not gonna get better.
That's as simple as that.

48
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,240
Jeez, drink a little water,
will you, Freddie?

49
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,990
- I spilt some.
- So you did.

50
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,250
Why don't you wait for me at the table?
We're almost through here.

51
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I tell you, Dede...

52
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,380
...l've seen cops on the bomb squad
with better stomachs than he's got.

53
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,300
- He does worry a lot.
- About what?

54
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,970
About the world. About me.

55
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,980
The only thing he should be
worrying about is a loose tooth.

56
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,520
He's got his whole adult life
to be miserable.

57
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,900
Hey, you know what day
next Saturday is?

58
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,120
You get your period.
I spend the day alone in the park.

59
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,830
Very funny, lame-o. It's your birthday.

60
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,210
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

61
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,970
Fred!

62
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,270
Hey, turn that up. It's a good one.

63
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,480
Wait a minute. Get your shoes on.
There you go.

64
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,240
Getting heavy.
Care to cut a rug, handsome?

65
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,700
Huh? Remember how I showed you?

66
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,870
Whoo!

67
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,000
This one calls himself Joey X
but his real name is Joseph Zimmerman.

68
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
12 years old. Experimental painter.

69
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,330
He's currently working
on a $200,000 commission...

70
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,760
...for Hiroshi Electronics
corporate headquarters in Tokyo.

71
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,800
- What does he call this painting?
- "Irony".

72
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,970
Write him down, please.

73
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,230
Cherry Reynolds. 10 years old. Just
published a volume of feminist poetry.

74
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,190
In the preface, she refers to
the American housewife as, and I quote...

75
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,780
..."A pathetic slamhound with
no notion of self-worth whatsoever."

76
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,790
- Whatever I pay you, it's not enough.
- True.

77
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,580
Fred Tate. Seven years old. Second
grader at Eisenhower Elementary School.

78
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,210
He writes poetry, paints in oils and water,
plays the piano at competition level...

79
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,720
...all the while maintaining
unlimited skills in math and physics.

80
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,140
I can't explain it, Jane.

81
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,640
It's not so much what he knows, but...

82
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,980
...what he understands.

83
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,360
"Death". There stands death,

84
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,700
A bluish distillate
in a cup without a saucer.

85
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,410
Such a strange place to find a cup,

86
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,910
Standing on the back of a hand.

87
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,460
Oh, shooting star that fell
into my eyes and through my body:

88
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,590
Not to forget you. To endure.

89
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,150
- Has this boy been tested?
- Just the Stanford-Binet.

90
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,440
His numbers are here.

91
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,030
This is extraordinary.

92
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,240
- Where's the rest of his stuff?
- Apparently...

93
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,160
...the mother refuses
to let him take any other tests.

94
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,250
What about the father?

95
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,790
- I don't know what happened to him.
- She probably doesn't either.

96
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,340
- Did you send them our material?
- Yes, but I don't know if she'll respond.

97
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,510
Well, keep trying.

98
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,430
Stupid woman.

99
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,680
M-A-I T-A-I.

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,810
Mai tai. Did I say "margarita"?

101
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,980
I don't think so.

102
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,360
Scotch rocks, vodka tonic and a Bud.

103
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,370
The kid's mind is just somewhere else.
Maybe he's bored or somethin'.

104
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,330
He hasn't said anything, but I can tell.

105
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,080
- Have you heard a word I said?
- Yeah, Dede. I always hear you.

106
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,170
Today your kid's bored.

107
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,800
Yesterday he was having
some funny nightmares.

108
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,800
He woke up inside of some painting
I never even heard of.

109
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,390
Day before that, correct me if I'm wrong,
he wrote you an opera for Mother's Day.

110
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,520
I mean, Jesus, Dede,
if anyone's bored, it's me.

111
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,560
Am I that bad? Sorry.

112
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,650
Psst!

113
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,320
- What?
- Come here.

114
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,820
- What?
- I got a line on somethin'.

115
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,490
Yeah?

116
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,450
Guy comes in here yesterday.
He owns this big hotel down in Orlando.

117
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,420
They do a show every night
and he says he needs dancers.

118
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,800
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

119
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,090
Oh, come on, Gina. I ain't danced since
I was 19. And even then, I wasn't so hot.

120
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,010
And there is the matter
of my big, fat ass too.

121
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,930
Please, we're talkin' Orlando, honey.
Not Vegas.

122
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,480
Down there, if you can tap your feet,
you're Madonna.

123
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,190
I say we go down there for the summer
and make a vacation out of it.

124
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,620
Hey, you two wanna blab,
go work for the phone company.

125
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,790
Why don't you take a pill, ape-shape?
We're tryin' to talk here.

126
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,580
Well, the place does look really nice.

127
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,670
Fred does like to swim.

128
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,430
Contrary to what
you're saying, Ms Montoya...

129
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,730
...welfare is in fact bad for minorities.

130
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,780
As a social worker, every day you must
see people who have simply given up.

131
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,910
And who's to blame them?

132
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,790
I mean, with people like yourself fighting
for bigger and bigger hand-outs...

133
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,670
...there's no incentive...

134
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,890
- Dede?
- Mm.

135
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,310
Wake up.

136
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,690
What? What's wrong, kid, huh?

137
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,610
You sick?

138
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,240
You feel OK to me.

139
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,830
This is for you.

140
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,580
Looks like somebody already opened it,
huh?

141
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,960
It's from the Grierson School.
They wanna meet us.

142
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,590
Yeah, yeah. I can read, Fred.

143
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Do me a favour. I had a bad night.
Go get your mother a Coke, OK?

144
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,140
Come on, I'd do it for you.

145
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,190
This jerk, he's got all his stuff
separated into whites, off-whites...

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,030
...whites with stripes,
whites with polka dots.

147
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,570
He's got ten dryers all to himself.
Drivin' me crazy.

148
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,950
So you know what I do?

149
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,660
I go outside and I kick his car
so that his siren goes off.

150
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,210
So the alarm's goin' off. He comes
back in screamin' and he goes...

151
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,010
..."Hey! What happened to my briefs?"

152
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,760
So you know what I do?
I start talkin' like I don't speak English.

153
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,110
- Hey! Did I hit anybody?
- I'm trying to read.

154
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,150
What are you such
a crabby appleton for, huh?

155
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,240
"The Mathematician". Any good?

156
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,830
"The MatheMagician".
It's Jane Grierson's new book.

157
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,130
Oh.

158
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,840
Jane Grierson again. Great!

159
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,760
This boy, Damon Wells, can multiply
two columns of 20-digit numbers...

160
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,140
...in five minutes.

161
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,770
Oh.

162
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,600
When Jane Grierson found him,
he was living in a foster home.

163
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,110
Now he travels all over the place.

164
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,730
Really?

165
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,240
Dr Grierson played the violin for the
Cleveland Philharmonic when she was 11.

166
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,000
Is the book about her or the kid?

167
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,590
Looks like a real bozo in that cape.

168
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,140
Quit it.

169
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,020
You got no sense of humour,
you know that?

170
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,780
All right, you win. Come on, let's go.
Put your shoes on. Come on!

171
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,920
Hi. Garth Emmerick.
I'm Dr Grierson's assistant.

172
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,340
Dede Tate. The place is... It's nice.

173
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,560
You must be Fred. All set?

174
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,020
Dr Grierson likes to meet
the children by themselves.

175
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,610
Feel free to wander around.
The interview should take a while.

176
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,870
It's OK, Fred. I'll meet you right
back down here when you get out.

177
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,870
All right? OK?

178
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,770
We wouldn't want him to come down with
some ear infection and miss the test.

179
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,030
I'm sorry. I realise at some schools letters
of recommendation carry influence...

180
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,750
...but here it's really test performance
that determines admission.

181
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Did Garth give you
a copy of our pretest diet?

182
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,210
Well, you have to make sure
he stays on that diet.

183
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,380
We'll see you in two weeks.

184
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,760
Hello, Fred.

185
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,140
I'm Jane Grierson.
Do you know why you're here?

186
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,520
How do you feel about it?

187
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,150
I'm hot.

188
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,450
Dominum. Domino.

189
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,040
Now, Fred. What's wrong in this picture?

190
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,310
This?

191
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,780
- This?
- I wake up in his paintings sometimes.

192
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,240
Van Gogh.

193
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,310
I wonder why he only
painted one iris white.

194
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,940
Because he was lonely.

195
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,570
Let's look at May.

196
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,790
I like Sunflowers best.

197
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,470
I understand you're quite a pianist.

198
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,300
Check!

199
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,180
That was lovely.

200
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,100
Thank you very much.
I really enjoyed that.

201
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,690
Hey, Fred. I gotta go to work. Come on.

202
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,030
Ms Tate. I'm Jane Grierson.

203
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,360
Please, come in. Sit down.

204
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,210
- Your son is very talented.
- Yeah, I know.

205
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,550
Every year, I take five students
to compete in "Odyssey of the Mind".

206
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,510
It's a kind of mental Olympics, if you will.

207
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,930
They're going to Disney World.

208
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,610
That's not the first thing
I would have told you, but it's true.

209
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,570
We stop many places along the way,
including my ranch in Virginia.

210
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,370
I like to pack as much learning
experience into the three weeks as I can.

211
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,160
Yeah, well, I gotta go. Gettin' late.

212
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,000
Ms Tate. Ms Tate, please.

213
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
I didn't make myself clear.

214
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,840
I'm inviting your son to come with us.

215
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,640
If he enjoys himself, he'll be free
to enrol in my school in the fall.

216
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,770
Wait a minute. Um...
I don't even know you.

217
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,490
Why would I let you take my kid on some
trip, let alone enrol him anywhere, huh?

218
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,820
I see.

219
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,290
Well, in this case,
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

220
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,870
Goodbye, Fred.

221
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,170
You may keep this calendar
since I won't be seeing you again.

222
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,420
That way, you can look at
Sunflowers any time you want.

223
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,520
Come on, kid.

224
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,290
Jesus, Fred!
What do you think you're doin'?

225
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,380
- I was just...
- You were just gonna walk into the street!

226
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,590
You know better than that.
You always look first.

227
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,650
Who can tell me how many of
these numbers are divisible by two?

228
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,160
Anybody?

229
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,080
- Fred!
- Hm?

230
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,630
I know that you can tell me how many
of these numbers are divisible by two.

231
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,760
Um... All of 'em.

232
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,890
Hey, check it out.

233
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,730
I thought we could make
our own invitations, huh?

234
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,770
- Invitations for what?
- For your birthday party.

235
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,610
Why don't we just go to McDonald's
like we did last year? That was fun.

236
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, yeah? Fun for whom?
You threw up all over me, remember?

237
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,960
I had to burn my favourite shirt
cos of you. Stinky!

238
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,300
- The mail's here.
- Let's see if your chain letter paid off.

239
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,640
What have you got?
The phone bill, gas bill, water bill.

240
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
- Throw this one away.
- How come?

241
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,140
We left 'em a deposit.
They can just take it out of that.

242
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,850
Fair enough.

243
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,400
So, what do you want
for your birthday this year?

244
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,570
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

245
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,450
Oops.

246
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,370
How about one of those Lego things?
Hey, what's the matter with the toaster?

247
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,750
Nothing. I was fixing it.

248
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,580
Fixing means to repair
something that is broken.

249
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,340
Not to break something
that works just fine the way it is.

250
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,690
We'll get some hot dogs. Ice cream and
cake. Pin the tail on the donkey, huh?

251
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,780
It's next Saturday
at 12 o'clock at my apartment.

252
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,290
Give me that. Hey!

253
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,460
- Come on, guys!

254
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,850
Many gifted children go through
some period of existential depression.

255
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,400
Pain of the mind can often
be worse than pain of the body.

256
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,280
There is some ground for belief
that genius is touched with madness.

257
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,580
No! Dede! Dede! Dede!

258
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,040
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Ssh.

259
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,460
It's OK.

260
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,880
Did you wake up in another painting?

261
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,600
- Cortin.
- Cortin, huh?

262
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,010
Hm.

263
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,810
I don't really know his work. Cortin?

264
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,770
It's a secretion
that comes from some gland.

265
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,480
I forget which one.

266
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,740
It can turn a little kid into an old man,
Dede.

267
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,620
Oh, yeah? You don't seem
to be secreting anything now.

268
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,210
I tell you what, though.

269
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,420
Tomorrow, after your birthday...

270
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,420
...we'll go to the library
and we'll look it up, OK?

271
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,260
What about work?

272
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,970
Don't worry about work.

273
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,930
All right? Try and get some sleep.
You ain't been sleepin' enough lately.

274
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,350
- I can't.
- You can't, huh?

275
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,940
- You wanna do shadows?
- OK.

276
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,400
All right, we'll do shadows here.

277
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,490
All right.

278
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,410
Mm. How about that one right up there?

279
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,000
It's kinda pointy, see that one?

280
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,540
A man and a boy in a clipper ship.

281
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,930
Yeah. How about that one next to it
with the little round circle on the side?

282
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,520
Let's try the other side now.
See right there in the corner?

283
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,940
Kind of round things all on the side?

284
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,860
Got three little points. What's that?

285
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,030
I don't want a birthday party, Dede.

286
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,370
Course you do.
Every little kid wants a birthday party.

287
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,100
- Hello.
- Uh... Jane Grierson, please.

288
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,180
Speaking.

289
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,430
Hi. This is Dede Tate. I'm Fred's mom.

290
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,350
Yes.

291
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,230
Yeah. I was just, uh...

292
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,570
I was wonderin', you know
that trip you were talking about?

293
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,070
Yes. What about it?

294
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,870
Well, it's just for a couple of weeks, right?

295
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,830
Ms Tate, I'm sorry
but I've already selected my students.

296
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,170
Look, um... I don't know how much you
know about Fred, but the kid is amazing.

297
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,090
He writes, he paints, he does everything.

298
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,890
You should see this painting
he made for me. It's like, incredible, so...

299
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,180
Just a minute here. Why are you
suddenly changing your mind? Hm?

300
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,940
Excuse me?

301
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,650
I don't mean to pry but, um...

302
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,330
...do you need time alone or have you
made plans that don't include your son?

303
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,120
Look, lady. You wanna make me
work for it, that's fine, OK?

304
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,170
But we both know that
Fred's a hundred times smarter...

305
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,670
...than the plateheads
you got at that school.

306
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,170
Now, you want him or not?

307
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,430
Does he have a suitcase?

308
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,350
Of course, every parent would like
to think of their child as gifted.

309
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,430
Yldidnelps!

310
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,850
- Stop it.
- Tipots!

311
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,400
Jane, he's talking backwards again.

312
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,610
I got some kinda hellacious
booger hangin' out of my nose?

313
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,320
What are you staring at?

314
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,410
You're the mathemagician.

315
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,660
Want an autograph? Go scrounge a pen,
I'll sign your forehead.

316
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,960
Hey, Damon.
How about a game of magic digit?

317
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,550
Check out this magic digit, Garth.

318
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,760
Now, Damon. You're being hostile.
We agreed that you would work on that.

319
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,520
Scusez-moi, Janey-poo.
I've been working on a problem all day.

320
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,440
I haven't slept in a week
cos of that frog nightmare.

321
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,690
And I'm hungry.
I get pissed off when I'm hungry.

322
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,070
Here. Have a fig newton.

323
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,150
Well, it's official, Garth.
You've misnavigated and now we're lost.

324
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,410
Sir, uh... perhaps you would take
a few moments and show the children...

325
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,910
...how an internal
combustion engine works.

326
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,430
It's said that the genius
learns without study...

327
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,010
...and knows without learning.

328
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,640
That he is eloquent without preparation...

329
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,150
...exact without calculation
and profound without reflection.

330
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,690
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

331
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:49,120
...it is a great pleasure to welcome you all
to the 13th annual "Odyssey of the Mind".

332
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,630
Now, you have been
captured by Polyphemus...

333
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,470
...and you have 60 seconds
to write or draw graffiti...

334
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,390
...pertaining to your situation. Go!

335
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,790
Oh, little boy. Don't touch that.

336
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,590
We're ready for opening remarks.

337
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,770
...it doesn't mean I can waltz on private
property and make myself at home.

338
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,860
Now, our crybaby defence may like to
turn this into an issue on homelessness...

339
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,990
...but we can't forget the law,
and the law states...

340
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,000
...book three, paragraph 5350875, that
what Goldilocks did was against the law.

341
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,550
Well.

342
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,100
It's certainly much quieter out here,
isn't it?

343
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,730
Do you mind if I sit down?

344
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,950
Fred?

345
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,760
This is beautiful.
Why don't we go show the others?

346
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,850
Nobody's gonna laugh at you.

347
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,690
I'm not gonna let them.

348
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,040
All right, let's begin
with another round of questions.

349
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,250
How many minutes are there in 48 years?

350
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,590
25,228,800 minutes.

351
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,350
How many factors are there of 3,067?

352
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,560
Come on, guys!

353
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,520
There are no factors of 3,067!
The number's prime.

354
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,070
Yeah. Another correct answer
from Damon Wells.

355
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,870
Somebody, for God's sake, challenge me!

356
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,290
OK.

357
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,170
How about giving me a number that,
when divided by the product of its digits...

358
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,960
...the quotient is three, and if
you were to add 18 to this number...

359
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,050
...the digits would be inverted?

360
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,980
24.

361
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,990
- You said 24.
- No, I didn't. I mean, I would have, but...

362
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,470
Open your mouth like that again,
I'll put my foot in it.

363
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,350
- It was an accident!
- I don't give a damn. Don't do it again.

364
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,560
Damon! Damon, what are you doing?

365
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,980
Fred and I were having a little chat.

366
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,690
I wouldn't call ripping
his hair out "chatting".

367
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,490
I was rollin' till the little quark stepped in.

368
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,240
Damon, now contrary
to what you might think...

369
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,370
...this is not Caesars Palace
and you are not Wayne Newton.

370
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,000
And you're not Freud, so why don't you
just give it a rest. Get a life, will ya?

371
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,930
Hey, don't cry, lepton. You can do
the math tomorrow. I was bored anyway.

372
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,180
Shotgun!

373
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,610
Fred. Fred, are you all right?

374
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,570
Why is he so mean to you?

375
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,340
Fred, what's the cube root of 3,796,466?

376
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,350
156.

377
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,430
- Correct.

378
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,770
What number has
the following peculiarity?

379
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,980
That if its cube were added
to five times its square...

380
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:07,110
...and from the result 42 times
the number and 40 is subtracted...

381
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,280
...the remainder is nothing.

382
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,560
- The telescope moves all by itself.
- Yeah?

383
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,190
Just like the earth does.

384
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,100
- And you know what else?
- What?

385
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,320
- On Friday, we're going to Jane's ranch.
- It sounds like you're having lots of fun.

386
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,780
Miss you, though. Miss you big.

387
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,620
- Me too.
- Go back to sleep.

388
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,330
- OK. Night, Dede.
- Good night.

389
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,880
What are you looking at, lepton?

390
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,060
Jane!

391
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,270
All right, now who has a song?

392
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,150
When I was a girl, we used to sing
Liebesliederwalzer on our car trips. Hm?

393
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,320
"Nein, es ist nicht. "

394
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,580
auszukommen mit den Leuten

395
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,580
auszukommen mit den Leuten

396
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,720
auszukommen mit den Leuten

397
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,860
My great-great-grandparents built
this house after the Civil War.

398
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,110
Now, who can tell me
what style of architecture this is?

399
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,950
Is this Shaker or neoclassical?

400
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,450
Edward Soloman joins "Live Wire"
tomorrow to answer that...

401
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,080
...and to talk about his current best seller
"Family of One: Today's Career Woman".

402
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,160
I just wanted to put this back.

403
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,010
Tell me, Fred. Why won't your mother
let you take any more tests?

404
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:56,270
That's wrong of her. You must tell her that
your intelligence is nothing to hide from.

405
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,650
- Are these your parents?
- Mm-hm.

406
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,530
- This is your father?
- Mm-hm.

407
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,620
Yes.

408
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,080
Yes, he was a terrific music-lover.

409
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,920
In fact, when I was your age
I used to play the violin.

410
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,340
How come you don't play now?

411
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,560
Well, we decided that I would be
happier pursuing my academic career.

412
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,850
How come you're not
in any of these pictures?

413
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,770
Oh, I'm sure I'm in some of them.

414
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,360
No, you're not.

415
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,120
Well.

416
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,000
Both my parents were very busy people.

417
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,500
They were both physicians.

418
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,970
They both lectured a lot, travelled a lot.

419
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,890
Sometimes they just needed to be alone.

420
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,100
If they travelled a lot, they were alone.

421
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,980
Mm-hm.

422
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,190
Well... it's time for bed.

423
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,870
Good night, Fred.

424
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,960
Bleuh!

425
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,560
Damon?

426
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm waxing my Buick.

427
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,990
- What the hell does it look like I'm doing?
- What are you so mad at?

428
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,160
I noticed you and Jane are getting
to be as close as a couple of fingers.

429
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,590
I bet back in the slum you got friends
up the ying-yang. Am I right or am I right?

430
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,260
No. I don't have any friends at home.

431
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,550
Oh.

432
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,810
Well, then boohoo, Fred.
I'm all busted up inside.

433
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,100
What about you?

434
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,270
Come on. Wake up and face north, twink.

435
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,980
I'm an asshole.
Assholes don't have friends.

436
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,490
But then, I don't really care.

437
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,490
- You don't?
- The reasonable man adapts to the world.

438
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,540
The unreasonable man expects
the world to adapt to him.

439
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,330
Therefore all progress is made
by unreasonable men.

440
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,250
- Jane say that?
- It was George Bernard Shaw.

441
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,260
- Like to ride horses?
- I dunno how.

442
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Well, then, today's your lucky day.

443
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,280
When I was a kid, the guy'd grab me
by the neck and shake me and say...

444
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,950
..."So, shithead, you think
you're smarter than your old man?"

445
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,330
Well, were you?

446
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,450
I'm smarter than everybody...

447
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,540
...except Jane.

448
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I dunno. Guys like me...

449
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,420
...and maybe you, we're different.

450
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,720
I mean, I hate to admit it, but...

451
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,050
...without Jane I'd be just
another creep in a cape.

452
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,020
The only drag is listening to her give
those same stupid lectures over and over.

453
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,070
- If it weren't for the game, I'd go crazy.
- The game?

454
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,910
Yeah. Sometimes, instead of listening
to her, I just count the words she says.

455
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,080
Actually, I count everything.
Buildings. Dance steps.

456
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,080
Airspace. Trees.

457
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,630
Wow.

458
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,370
See, Fred. It's not the size
of a guy's IQ that matters.

459
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,790
It's how he uses it.

460
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,540
I like you, Damon.

461
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,840
Come on. I'll race you back.

462
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,380
Damon?

463
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,550
Damon!

464
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,230
Damon, how many fingers?

465
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,440
- Orange.
- You'll be fine.

466
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,430
Here's your jacket. Bye-bye, Fred.
I hope I see you soon.

467
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,860
Fred.

468
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,910
Let me take these, OK?

469
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,830
Let's go.
I'm gonna make your favourite dinner.

470
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,050
French toast and fried apples.

471
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,020
Hey, ta-da!

472
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,070
Money's been kinda tight lately, but...

473
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,910
...l'll think of somethin'.
Don't worry about it, OK, kid?

474
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,800
You didn't paint the right number
of keys on here, lepton.

475
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,970
I ran outta paint. What'd you just call me?

476
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,060
- Lepton.
- What the hell's that?

477
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,060
- You wouldn't understand.
- Whoa, wait a minute. Speak slowly then.

478
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,810
OK.

479
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,780
- A lepton is a Z particle.
- So?

480
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,700
Do you know what
protons and electrons are?

481
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,570
Yeah.

482
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,700
OK. What are they?

483
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,590
They're those, uh... those teeny,
tiny things that atoms are made out of.

484
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,090
Well, leptons are even smaller.

485
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,230
- So have you looked for a new job yet?

486
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,400
- Hello.
- Hello, is Derf there?

487
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,490
- Derf? You got the wrong number.
- Wait! That's Bob Yee.

488
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,740
- Hi, Bob. What are you doin'?
- Guess what?

489
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,120
- I got that job at TRW this morning.
- Really? Wow.

490
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,330
So what are you doin', huh?

491
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,840
Uh, nothing. Just sitting around.

492
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,260
Do you think Damon'll be OK?
For a second, I thought he was dead.

493
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,800
I thought he was dead, too,
but Jane says it's just a concussion.

494
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,010
Jane knows CPR.

495
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,060
She did? I didn't know that?

496
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,980
She told me she was
gonna teach me sometime.

497
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,440
Did you know Jane speaks
five different languages?

498
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,540
"Clipper Ships" by Matt Montini.

499
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,170
"Me and my dad make
models of clipper ships."

500
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,960
"I like clipper ships
because they are fast."

501
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,590
"Clipper ships sail the ocean."

502
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,380
"Clipper ships never sail
on rivers or lakes."

503
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,350
"Clipper ships have lots of sails
and are made out of wood."

504
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,020
OK. Who's next?

505
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,740
I want to write a book about Fred...

506
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,240
...about his formative experiences.

507
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,330
His life story, if you will.

508
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,290
Well... Gonna be a short book.

509
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,170
Ms Tate, over the years, I've met
many math and music prodigies...

510
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,350
...but never one with
Fred's kind of intuition...

511
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,180
...his, uh...

512
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,140
...his kind of, um, sensitivity.

513
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,230
This summer, I've been asked
to teach a class at Fieldhurst...

514
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,700
...and I'd like to use that time
to really observe Fred.

515
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:19,910
He would take a class and, in return,
I would waive his tuition at the Institute...

516
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,660
...for as long as he attends.

517
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,630
Wait. Wait a minute.

518
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,720
- You wanna take Fred to college?
- Just for the summer.

519
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,510
Why can't you just wait and,
like, observe him in the fall?

520
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:41,270
I wouldn't have time.
I'd be busy running the Institute.

521
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,980
Well. As it happens, we already got plans.

522
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,780
Me and a friend got good jobs dancing
at this hotel in Orlando for the summer.

523
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,240
The place is really nice.
It's got a big pool and everything.

524
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,120
- A pool?
- Yeah, so that's that.

525
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,960
Ms Tate, Fred is not a leper.

526
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,790
Intelligence is not a disease
that you have to protect him from.

527
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,840
He's blessed, but he's certainly not alone.

528
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,130
There are many gifted children out there.

529
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,930
Yeah? How many of 'em
are blessed with ulcers, huh?

530
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,770
How many of them go to bed worrying
about the ozone layer, the rain forest...

531
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,530
...and why innocent people
get murdered all the time?

532
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,660
Fred worries about everything.
He can't help himself.

533
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,490
You wanna send him to college. Jesus.

534
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,120
You hear about kids
ten years older than him...

535
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,120
...jumping outta windows
on account of the pressure.

536
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,630
Let's not get hysterical. We're talking
about one class for one summer.

537
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,760
I told you. We already made plans.

538
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,890
What I'm trying to tell you is that...

539
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,640
...your son is starving for stimulation and
challenge, and for some order in his life.

540
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,180
Things that you don't provide
but that I will.

541
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,310
I know that to deny a child's potential
is to smother his true self.

542
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,900
Fred doesn't give a shit
about his potential.

543
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,820
He just wants to be a normal,
happy little kid.

544
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,950
Well, he's not normal, thank God,
and he's certainly not happy.

545
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,320
And you underestimate him greatly...

546
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:17,620
...if you think that a summer by the pool
will ever be enough for him.

547
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,330
Fred wants to go to college.

548
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,120
Don't take my word for it. Ask him.

549
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,600
Hey. What are you doin'?

550
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,230
Your résumé.

551
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,240
Oh.

552
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,530
So, I understand that you and Jane
made some plans, huh?

553
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,250
So, were you just gonna sneak off
to college without saying anything?

554
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,960
Fred, do you wanna go to college?

555
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,800
You know, Jane says you do.

556
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,470
It sure sounds great to me.

557
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,390
Sounds like a great opportunity.

558
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,770
I mean, you hang round here
for too long and you might, uh...

559
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,310
...you might smother
your potential or somethin'.

560
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,150
I'd sure feel real lousy if that happened.

561
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,490
Course, you know you're
gonna have to live with her.

562
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,910
Which means you'd also miss out
on a real summer vacation.

563
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,790
Hey.

564
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,040
You wanna go to college
or you wanna go to Disney World?

565
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:58,420
I've already been to Disney World.
I went with Jane, remember?

566
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,070
You look crabby.

567
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,150
I'm not crabby.

568
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,780
I'm pensive.

569
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,170
This'll take a couple of minutes,
so why don't you just go park the car?

570
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,340
- Hi, Jane.
- Wait, wait.

571
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:49,090
Just a minute, Fred. OK, now!

572
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,390
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi, Fred.

573
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,560
Wow.

574
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,140
- You need a belt, kid.
- No, I don't. I just need to tuck in my shirt.

575
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,560
You need a belt.

576
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,520
Hey, how about if we just say
"See ya tomorrow" instead of "goodbye"?

577
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,570
If you send me the chequebook,
I'll balance it for you.

578
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,900
I think I can take care of that, Freddie.

579
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,990
Who's gonna water the plants?

580
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,160
Hey, forget about the plants, OK?

581
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,540
Forget about the chequebook.

582
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,170
You're gonna have a great time.

583
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,840
So are you.

584
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,880
Every day that I know you, I...

585
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,350
I admire you a little bit more every day.

586
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,270
Every day I say to myself...

587
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:25,350
...this little kid is exactly
the kind of person I wanna be.

588
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,690
I mean, let's face it.

589
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,230
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

590
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,070
So don't worry so much. OK?

591
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,580
Hey, love you big.

592
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,750
Go get your bag.

593
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,640
Dede, I know this must be difficult for you.

594
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,260
You might wanna keep
an extra telephone around.

595
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,020
- Excuse me?
- He likes to take 'em apart, you know.

596
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,770
Sometimes, uh... sometimes...

597
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,440
I understand.

598
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,280
Listen to me, Jane.

599
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:24,570
If anything happens to him,
anything at all...

600
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,080
...l'll kill you.

601
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,790
Now, I don't mean that I'll just hurt you.

602
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,580
I mean that I'll kill you.

603
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,840
Hey. Give you a call from Orlando, OK?
Hear all about your first day.

604
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,180
Bye, sweetie.

605
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,390
Hands on noses, guys.

606
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,110
See you tomorrow.

607
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,690
See you tomorrow.

608
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,210
Now, Fred.
These chores are your responsibilities.

609
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,340
And for every week
that you do them correctly...

610
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,970
...we'll do something fun like go to the
symphony, or rent a nice documentary.

611
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,100
These are soup bowls. These are not.

612
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:38,060
These are my glasses
and these are your glasses.

613
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,690
These are your pens and your pencils.

614
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:45,360
And, Fred,
these are my pens and my pencils.

615
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,450
It's not your mother's fault.

616
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,410
Most parents are ignorant
to the benefits of macrobiotics.

617
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,620
If your mother had put you
on a diet like this sooner...

618
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,250
...you might never have gotten an ulcer.

619
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,130
- Can I have a Coke?
- Absolutely not.

620
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,900
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

621
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,490
Everything that comes
from the body is natural.

622
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,040
- Now can I have a Coke?
- In the fridge.

623
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,320
Fred, I'll meet you outside
on the steps right after class.

624
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,530
- All right?
- Mm.

625
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,570
Good luck.

626
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,970
Come on. Let's sit you down in the front.

627
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,180
Would you mind sitting over there,
please?

628
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,610
All right.
Let's all calm down and shut up...

629
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,730
...so we can start getting
Dad's money's worth.

630
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,070
Now, for those of you who may be lost...

631
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,330
...the name of this class is Phys 105.

632
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:11,040
Quantum physics. Not physical education.

633
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,050
All right. Everybody in the right place?

634
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,600
Goddamn college kids.

635
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,850
Morning.

636
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:33,640
Used to be young people respected other
people's property. You could trust 'em.

637
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:38,020
Now, they come down here
on vacation and they trash the place.

638
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:41,480
What do they care?
It's not their house. Damn brats.

639
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:46,700
Then on top of that I got five
undercover ABC guys circulating.

640
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,700
- The network?
- Alcoholic Beverage Control, Gina.

641
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:53,580
Half my clientele on this
particular evening is underage.

642
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,370
How am I supposed to know this?

643
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:01,290
Anyway...
my liquor licence is now toilet paper.

644
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,050
Wait a second.
You sayin' you're not gonna do the show?

645
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,050
Don't tell me we came
all the way down here for nothin'.

646
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,140
Oh, boy.

647
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,970
You two got any waitressing experience?

648
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,100
- Come on!
- Don't dive in the shallow end!

649
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,640
- At least they got water in the pool.
- I could murder you.

650
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:23,060
- He said it's temporary.
- He said his lawyers were working on it.

651
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,150
We can still make a vacation of it.

652
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,650
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

653
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,200
Hey, this ain't lemons, Gina.
This is dog shit.

654
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,370
I mean, if I wanted to wait tables,
I coulda stayed in the city.

655
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,340
Did you lose your mommy, sweetie?

656
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,680
Yo, kid! A little help with the Frisbee, huh?

657
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,350
- Whoa! Watch it, kid.
- Sorry.

658
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,900
I have 50. Now, come on, people.
Do I hear 60?

659
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,490
- Come on, people. This is for charity.
- 70.

660
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,750
All right, I have 70. Do I hear 80?

661
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:27,210
I said 1,000, you racist frat-head.

662
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,210
Come on, mister. This is for charity.

663
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,340
What charity's that?
The Inter-Geek Recreation Center?

664
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:37,010
That should change a few lives.
Get outta my face, you jughead.

665
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,220
Hey, wait a minute.

666
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,680
Heads!

667
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
Excuse me, fellas.

668
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,370
- Eddie, you killed him.
- I wasn't even aimin' for him.

669
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,420
- Besides, what's a kid doin' out here?
- He's not a kid!

670
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,790
Get away from him.

671
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,550
Oh, God. Not again.

672
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,260
Fred! Fred?

673
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,090
Oh, Fred.

674
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,180
- This is called a sphygmomanometer.
- It is?

675
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:37,770
- Hello.
- Hey, Jane. Let me talk to Fred.

676
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,820
Dede. How are you?

677
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,400
Just peachy. Now where's Fred, huh?

678
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,240
- How many fingers?
- Two.

679
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,240
- He can't talk right now.
- How come?

680
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:53,000
- He's taking a nap.
- So wake him up.

681
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,750
- I wanna hear about his first day.
- He's very tired, Dede.

682
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,880
Cut the shit, Jane.
Put the kid on the goddamn phone.

683
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,970
Here he is.

684
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:10,720
Now, Fred. You don't wanna get
your mother all upset over nothing. Hm?

685
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,810
OK.

686
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,020
Hi, Dede.

687
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:19,610
Jane was late picking me up
and I got hit on the head with a globe.

688
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,190
How's Florida?

689
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,530
Bicycle! Ohh!

690
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,410
The spin angular momentum
of the beta particle of one half...

691
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:44,300
...must be balanced by
a particle having a spin angular...

692
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,950
He's studying real hard.

693
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,300
He must be all of ten.

694
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,380
Yo, Muffy! What the hell you lookin' at?
Get outta here, you punk.

695
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,220
Hey, how's your head?

696
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,220
Remember me?

697
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,220
I'm the guy that took
your lights out the other day.

698
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,350
Well, look. I brought you a present.

699
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:50,190
Ta-da! Remember this? It's got a little
blood on it, right there on El Salvador.

700
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,480
I think that's pretty cool.

701
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:55,110
- It's for you. I brought it for you.
- Thanks.

702
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,320
You're welcome. My name's Eddie.

703
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,030
- Fred.
- Nice to meet you, Fred.

704
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,370
- What's your major?
- What's my major?

705
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,710
Damn! Who you been hanging out with?

706
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,330
Jane. What's your major?

707
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,800
Well, let's see.
Russian Lit. Afro-Am. Poly Sci.

708
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,420
French. Swahili. Ooglie booglie.

709
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:22,640
Toilet trainin'. Eatin' dirt. Nose-pickin'.
One of those. I dunno.

710
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:26,180
- So who's Jane? That your girlfriend?
- The lady I live with.

711
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,480
Say, what are you doing this afternoon?

712
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,820
Just bringing in the mail.

713
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,810
Ooo-wee! That was swingin'!
Was that swingin' or what?

714
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,900
We're gonna go on the road together.

715
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:19,230
But I can't play the classical stuff.
You have to handle that.

716
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,490
You know what the funniest thing
about Mozart was? His hair.

717
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:25,400
I'd say to Mozart
"That's the ugliest hairdo I've seen".

718
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:29,030
I think Mozart should have a big Afro
or a Mohawk, or a something.

719
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swing along!

720
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,210
Yeah, man.

721
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,390
Swing it.

722
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,650
Well?

723
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,780
Looks good.

724
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,540
It's funny, Garth.

725
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:19,830
I'm experiencing a whole
new side of me I've never felt before.

726
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,960
It's just a meat loaf, Jane.

727
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,920
No. To me, it's a lot more than a meat loaf.
It's a milestone.

728
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,050
I mean...

729
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,300
...who would have thought
that I'd ever cook anything?

730
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,970
Maybe you're turning over a new loaf.

731
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,850
- What do I do about Live Wire?
- Do we have to discuss that now?

732
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,900
If Buckner wants to do
an hour on gifted children...

733
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,440
What does Winston Buckner know
about gifted children?

734
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:53,700
Why doesn't he do a talk show on
petulant talk show hosts instead?

735
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,370
Oh! I've gotta make the salad.

736
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:01,410
That's why he needs you.
And he wants to bring Fred on, too.

737
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,710
You could bring
a few examples of his work.

738
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,420
He'd like that.

739
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,040
What time is it?

740
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,050
The object of the game
is to bank the ball...

741
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,180
...so that you hit the other one
right where the shadow is.

742
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,600
You wanna try to hit the ball nice and low.

743
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,230
That way you get a lot of backspin on it.

744
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,640
Pow!

745
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,940
- Like that.
- Hey, Eddie.

746
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:33,230
- Hey, where the hell y'all been?
- Anna fainted in the parking lot.

747
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,990
Say, everybody. This is my son Fred.

748
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,780
- Fred!
- How ya doin', Fred?

749
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,120
Hey, kid.
What are you doin' with the world?

750
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:46,040
It was a present.

751
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,140
Never mind, Officer. He's back.
Yes, just now. Thank you.

752
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,720
- Fred!
- Sorry I'm late.

753
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,930
Fred, where have you been?

754
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,730
Fred, you smell like a brewery!

755
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,150
And have you been smoking?

756
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,820
I was in a pool hall.
I'm learning how to play pool!

757
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,820
- Good game.
- Shut up, Garth.

758
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,080
Do you know what time it is?

759
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:30,580
7.03.

760
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,160
Do you remember what time
I asked you to be home?

761
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,580
5.00.

762
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:40,260
Fred, if I tell you to be home at five
o'clock, you're to be home at five o'clock.

763
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,670
Not six o'clock. Not seven o'clock.

764
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,430
Not 7.01, not 7.02 and certainly not 7.03.

765
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,560
I can't eat this.

766
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,850
No, of course you can't. It's cold.

767
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,890
No. My stomach.

768
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,110
Oh, my God, that's right.

769
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:03,110
Now, Fred. Let's not whine. There must
be something for you to eat around here.

770
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,910
- I could go pick something up.
- It's OK.

771
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,320
I already ate.

772
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,160
What? You ate without me?

773
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,410
We could have dessert.

774
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,710
No. We cannot.

775
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,420
A rule has been broken.
We don't reward that kind of behaviour.

776
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,340
Now, Fred,
I'm sure if we thought about it...

777
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,300
...we'd decide that pool halls
are no place for someone your age.

778
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,220
If you want to play something,
come and talk to me.

779
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,100
And, Fred, when I scold you,
it doesn't mean I don't care about you.

780
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,440
It only means I'm trying
to correct your mistakes.

781
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,360
Now, how about a nice game of Scrabble?

782
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,700
And... go.

783
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,660
Done.

784
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,580
- Isn't this fun?

785
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,790
Damn it.

786
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,760
- Fred.
- I'll go get you another phone.

787
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,970
Fred.

788
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,020
- Hello?
- Hey! What's up, huh?

789
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:23,890
- Nothing. What's up with you?
- I'm gettin' a tan.

790
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,770
Oh.

791
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,820
Actually, it's more of a burn.

792
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,820
- So?
- So?

793
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,200
So, listen.

794
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,330
What are you doin' next weekend, huh?

795
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,990
Huh?

796
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,620
Come on, it's 4th July.
What are you doin'?

797
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,250
- How about a barbecue on the beach?
- I'm gonna be on TV.

798
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,590
Let me speak to her.

799
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:56,340
Hi, Dede. It's Jane.

800
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:02,180
We were gonna call you. Fred and I have
been invited to appear on "Live Wire".

801
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,970
Isn't that exciting?

802
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,770
Uh-huh.

803
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:11,860
I thought, if it's OK with you, we'd stay
overnight to see the fireworks in the park.

804
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,190
Yeah, sure.
Freddie'd love that. He would.

805
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,490
Great. Don't forget to watch.

806
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,950
It's Saturday at 12.30. Here's Fred.

807
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,780
Don't talk too long.
It's costing your mother a fortune.

808
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:27,080
Hi.

809
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,000
Hey. Everything's good, huh?

810
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,210
Everything's perfect.

811
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:37,510
- I'm learning how to play pool.
- Pool?

812
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,340
Yeah. My friend Eddie's teaching me.

813
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,720
Wow. Eddie.

814
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,430
Don't put down too many bets, OK, kiddo?

815
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:53,560
Look, I gotta go.
Jane's giving me this test.

816
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,110
Yeah, OK. I tell you what. Um...

817
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,940
I'll call ya in a couple of days, OK?

818
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,240
OK. Bye.

819
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,480
- Oh, man, what time is it?
- Too early for visitors.

820
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,400
Uh, Dave. Where's he goin'?

821
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:55,620
- Hey, girl.
- Sorry. I didn't mean that.

822
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,790
- Hi, Eddie.
- Fred!

823
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,880
- Fred, what are you doin' here?
- You said we could...

824
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,880
Oh, Fred. Would you get outta here?

825
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,300
Go on, get outta here. Damn.

826
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,850
Very nice, fellas!

827
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,510
Very nice.

828
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,730
Fred!

829
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,360
Come on, Fred. Wait up, man.

830
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:33,450
Fred, wait up. Freddie. Wait up, Freddie.

831
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,740
Freddie, Freddie. Wait up, man.

832
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:42,120
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you, but
you can't walk in on people like that, man.

833
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,920
You said we were gonna play pool.

834
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,880
- I did?
- You said so.

835
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,590
People say that stuff
to each other all the time.

836
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,130
That don't really mean that they mean it,
you know?

837
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,010
Look.

838
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:00,350
You're a kid and I'm a grown-up.

839
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,560
I love doing stuff with you, but I can't
do stuff with all day every day...

840
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:08,900
...cos I gotta do stuff with other grown-ups.

841
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:14,240
What I'm tryin' to say is that
we can't hang out together all the time.

842
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,740
I'm not your babysitter, Freddie.

843
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,700
I just can't take that kinda responsibility.

844
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:24,450
But, hey... it's no big deal, is it?

845
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,690
Hi.

846
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,060
Hi.

847
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,710
Oh, Fred.

848
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,090
What was the name of that computer
that you raced in Dr Ellis's class?

849
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,550
- Mike.
- Mike. That's it.

850
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:16,020
Fred, it's two o'clock in the morning.
What are you doing up so late?

851
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,730
I had a bad dream.

852
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,860
Oh.

853
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:25,280
Well, why don't you get a drink of water?

854
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:29,030
What for?

855
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,990
Don't you want a drink of water?

856
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,700
I'm not thirsty.

857
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:44,040
Well, why don't you leave the light on,
or turn on the radio? Something.

858
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:47,710
It's really late
and we've got a big day tomorrow.

859
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,620
Uh... I can't hear you.
Hey, is that you, Fred?

860
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,670
How you doin'?
Are you missin' a good party down here.

861
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:29,420
- Is Dede there?
- Whoo! We're celebrating 4th July early.

862
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:34,510
Me and Valerie woke up and everyone
was in the pool. Bottle rockets!

863
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,590
Fenton, will you just tell...

864
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,030
A man waving goodbye.

865
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,870
Two cats fighting.

866
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,830
A capsized boat.

867
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,710
A dead body.

868
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:07,220
Well, we can stop on the way
to the city and get something to eat.

869
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,930
Where's your tie?

870
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,820
- I need a belt, Jane.
- Hm?

871
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,620
- I need a belt.
- Oh.

872
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:33,500
Just tuck in your shirt, you'll be fine.

873
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:39,000
It seems to me you had
a midterm the other day.

874
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,040
- How do you think you did?
- Fine.

875
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,630
I'm sure you did splendidly.

876
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:51,010
You think you can tell me
Beaton's refraction formula for the sun?

877
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,140
Mr Buckner might ask you that.

878
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,770
Energy plus parallax equals...

879
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,810
How come you always
ask me about school?

880
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,270
Hm?

881
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,900
How come you always talk
like you're reading a book?

882
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,240
How come nobody ever comes over?

883
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,820
And... how come you don't
have any kids of your own?

884
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,790
What's wrong with you?

885
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,750
Now, remember, sweetface...

886
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,920
...zillions of people all over the world
are gonna be watching you.

887
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:34,680
And that means no farting,
no pickin' your nose...

888
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,510
...and no playing with little Mr Peabody.

889
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,310
Close your eyes.

890
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,480
Knock it off, Evan.

891
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,480
Fred?

892
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,950
You look very handsome.

893
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,330
Is she your mom or what?

894
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,170
She's my...

895
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,670
I dunno.

896
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:11,300
I'll go see if they're ready for you.

897
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:16,800
Do you like old pinball machines?

898
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,510
I dunno.

899
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,470
We have one in the basement.
You can come play with me.

900
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,790
- Marco!
- Polo!

901
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,130
Hey, you guys! Keep it down!

902
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:03,010
Welcome to "Live Wire".
I'm Winston F Buckner.

903
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,600
Today we're gonna be asking
the question "Is your child gifted?"

904
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:12,480
With me here to answer that
are two distinguished academics...

905
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,610
...and several bright kids...

906
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:19,280
...from the best schools around
the country. Welcome, everybody.

907
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:26,580
Now, children, do you read books
or watch television like normal kids?

908
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm working on experiments involving
lasers, sulphuric acid and butterflies.

909
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,000
I'm designing a summerhouse
for my parents.

910
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:38,670
- I bring in the mail.
- You bring in the mail?

911
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,250
God, you look like hell, kid.

912
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:46,050
Well... Fred, we do many things together.

913
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,510
We go to museums, we go to the opera.

914
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,350
He writes letters to his Romanian pen pal.

915
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,900
These books are fake.

916
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,190
Fred, as I understand it,
you're a poet, a painter, a musician...

917
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,280
...and what I guess one could call a...

918
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,070
- Marco!
- Polo.

919
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,370
Now, with all that under that
tiny little belt of yours...

920
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:12,660
...what would you like
to be when you grow up?

921
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,040
- A fireman.
- A fireman.

922
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:20,670
That's a pretty normal profession
for such a... how shall I put it...

923
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:23,590
...an unusual boy like yourself.

924
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,090
When I was a boy, our mothers all
wanted us to grow up to be doctors.

925
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:30,470
My mother's dead.

926
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,800
l, uh... I'm very sorry to hear that.

927
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:37,560
Well, enough small talk, Fred.
What shall we do for our audience?

928
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:43,190
I thought maybe you could play the piano
for us and do a few quick calculations?

929
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,610
- No.
- No?

930
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,740
- Mr Buckner...
- I'd like to recite a poem.

931
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:55,200
Ah, a poem by Fred Tate when
we come back, right after this.

932
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,710
Hey!

933
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,130
Hey, you guys!

934
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:14,050
"Clipper Ships" by Fred Tate.

935
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,840
Go get your mother!

936
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,970
"Me and my dad make
models of clipper ships."

937
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,060
"Clipper ships sail on the ocean."

938
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:29,060
"Clipper ships never sail
on rivers or lakes."

939
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,450
"I like clipper ships
because they are fast."

940
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,080
Fenton!

941
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,760
"Clipper ships have lots of sails
and are made of wood. "

942
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,350
- Stand by. We'll be back in 30 seconds.
- Oh, Fred.

943
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,160
Yes. Is Dede Tate there, please?

944
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,540
Where is she? Gone where?

945
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,000
Nice to meet you, too, Fenton.

946
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:20,000
Which flight is she on?
Fenton? Which flight?

947
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:26,050
She's on her way.

948
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,890
Oh, what have I done?

949
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,520
Hi, kid.

950
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:28,610
Come here.

951
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,360
I figured you'd be here.

952
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,870
Sorry.

953
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:41,040
Sorry for what?
You didn't do anything. Shh.

954
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,580
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

955
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,000
I missed my dance partner.

956
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,460
Jane's mad at me.

957
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:54,470
No. She ain't mad at you.

958
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:59,180
She was just worried, that's all.

959
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,890
We're all gonna work it out, you'll see.

960
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,890
From now on,
I'm gonna take care of everything.

961
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:07,190
You. Me.

962
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,520
Even Jane, OK?

963
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:15,320
Listen, Freddie.

964
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:20,740
The day you were born, first minute
I saw you, you know what I said?

965
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,410
I said "This kid's special."

966
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,040
"This kid's gonna be different
and I'm not gonna blow it."

967
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,750
But, um...

968
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,920
...sometimes, uh...

969
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:41,090
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'.
Sometimes I just wing it.

970
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,720
I figure that...

971
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,060
I figure... I love this kid so much...

972
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:53,480
...it's gonna be OK.

973
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:56,940
And it will.

974
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,070
You'll see.

975
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:16,210
I love you, Mom.

976
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,550
I love you too, kiddo.

977
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:43,530
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late, but the cake
took me longer than I thought to make.

978
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,920
Come here, birthday boy!

979
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,880
And incredible as it sounds,
when I turned eight...

980
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,390
...I had the best birthday party ever.

981
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:12,510
At least, that's the way I remember it.

982
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,430
- Happy birthday, Fred.
- Ooh, look at that!

983
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,150
Even Jane had a good time.

984
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,360
- Thanks, Jane.
- You're welcome.

985
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,070
- Care to cut the rug with me?
- N-no, thank you.

986
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:29,530
Come on, dance with the kid, Jane.

987
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:39,830
Nobody seemed to worry about anything.

988
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:48,800
- Hey, yaks. Wanna play a game?
- Yeah.

989
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,630
You two hold your breath until I say stop.

990
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,970
Ha-ha ha ha-ha!

991
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,560
I once got this fortune cookie that said...

992
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,270
..."Only when all who surround you
are different will you truly belong. "

993
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,190
- Thanks for the dance, Fred.
- Hey, it's a party.

994
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,480
Gotta wear your party hat, Jane.

995
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:10,490
Well, we were all different, that's for sure.

996
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,490
I'd see Jane every day at the Institute.

997
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,870
And once in a while, Dede'd let her
take us out to fancy restaurants.

998
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:21,870
Sometimes we even had fun.

999
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:24,040
- Ready?

1000
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,000
For a while, I was the most
famous kid at Jane's school.

1001
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:33,210
But a year later, a six-year-old boy named
Roy Yamaguchi got into law school...

1002
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:36,340
...and suddenly I wasn't
such a big deal any more.

1003
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,470
But I didn't care...

1004
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,100
...because I was happy.
