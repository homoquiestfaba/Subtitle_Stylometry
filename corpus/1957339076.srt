00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,170
You'll just have to wait and
pray.

179
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,070
No, I'm going to have to do a
lot more than that.

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,000
CAPTAIN (OVER SPEAKER): This is
your captain again.

181
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,080
We're anticipating, uh-- food
and [INAUDIBLE] this afternoon

182
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,160
to Kansas City.

183
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,070
The tornado problems that
they've had

184
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,220
have settled down now.

185
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,200
It shouldn't affect us on our
flight pattern.

186
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,080
We have, uh-- three lovely
flight

187
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,030
attendants on board today--

188
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,070
Sheri, and Joanne, and Mark-- to
serve you.

189
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,060
[SIRENS]

190
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,020
So what you're saying is no
insurance, no protection.

191
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,150
And if you watch every dime,
you'll

192
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,140
have enough money to get you
through the next three months?

193
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,150
- Don't worry about it. - We'll
be fine.

194
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,010
It could have been a lot worse.

195
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,100
Yeah, a nuclear bomb could've
dropped on your head.

196
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,200
But what about a loan?

197
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,090
Didn't I just say don't worry
about it?

198
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,130
Look, you know what?

199
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,030
You should go back to where you
belong--

200
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
school-- that's your job.

201
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,210
I didn't even know if you were
alive.

202
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,180
Well, if we were dead, we'd
have called you.

203
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,130
Can you get a loan or not?

204
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,180
Listen, Ally, you may be--

205
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,020
It's not Ally, it's Alan.

206
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,080
--a big [INAUDIBLE] basketball
star, but you are

207
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,020
not too old for me to spank.

208
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,210
You ask me a question once, not
twice.

209
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,180
Oh, come on, Steve.

210
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,210
He's just trying to--

211
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,070
I feel as if I should be
helping out.

212
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,070
Fine. You want to help out?

213
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,090
You get back where you belong.

214
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,190
You got the Dartmouth game
coming up.

215
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,160
You know, I can't believe with
the roots you have here,

216
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,020
you can't get a fucking loan.

217
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't use that language in
front of your mother.

218
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,020
To rebuild a fucking house.

219
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,090
Hey, I said, cut it out.

220
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,210
So where do they expect you to
live?

221
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,010
In the toilet stall of an
elementary school boy's room?

222
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,040
Who's they?

223
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,020
The government?

224
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,070
The banks?

225
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Nobody owes us a thing.

226
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,030
I owe you something.

227
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Well, fine.

228
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,100
When you get to be a big, rich
guy,

229
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,050
you come on back and help us
out.

230
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,140
In the meantime, take a look
around.

231
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,080
We're not the only people in
trouble here.

232
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,170
Nobody has a place to live.

233
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,200
Alan, we appreciate your coming

234
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,040
back and trying to help out, but
there's

235
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,060
nothing for you to do now.

236
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,010
The best thing for you to do is
go back.

237
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,130
We'll be fine.

238
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,170
CHESNEY: So what are both
Heidegger

239
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,060
and Kierkegaard saying about the
concept

240
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,160
of dread versus simple fear?

241
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,050
Fear is a manageable emotion, no
matter

242
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,140
how intense or extreme because
fear

243
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,140
is always fear of something,
something physically real--

244
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,110
failure, disease, poverty, loss.

245
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,090
And the instant the cause of
that fear

246
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,140
is eliminated, the fear itself
vanishes as well.

247
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,060
Dread, by contrast, is the
feeling of terror

248
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,020
without any concrete cause.

249
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,030
Dread is the fear of nothing.

250
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,150
So no change in the
circumstances of one's

251
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,020
life can weaken the power of
that inexplicable and consuming

252
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,120
void.

253
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,090
Now, what state of consciousness
are we describing here,

254
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,190
if not madness, or to use the
clinical term, psychosis?

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,050
Why do you need that?

256
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,170
It brings me closer.

257
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,010
CHESNEY: Closer to what?

258
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,230
It.

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,110
Oh, and what's it?

260
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,190
I'll know when I get there.

261
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
These are all previews.

262
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,080
CHESNEY: These what?

263
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,190
Breakouts-- marijuana, orgasm.

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,140
Fear being neurotic, dread
being psychotic.

265
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,210
Fear resting within the realm of
the rationally comprehensible.

266
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,030
Dread ranging beyond into the
intellectually unreachable.

267
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,050
So, to you, sex and drugs are
the same thing.

268
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,110
Well, they have the same goal--
transcendence.

269
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,130
Are you sure you're not just
talking about feeling good?

270
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,110
Mm.

271
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,110
Absolutely.

272
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,110
It's way beyond that.

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,030
See, I'm trying to get the thing
inside--

274
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,150
the thing behind the I, behind
the hi,

275
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm Alan, front that we put out
to the world.

276
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,120
It's like I'm in a straight
jacket

277
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,180
that I'm trying to unsnap.

278
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,230
You're not following me, are
you?

279
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,220
Of course I'm following you.

280
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,180
What do you think I was talking
about in class today?

281
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,050
Has it ever occurred to you
that,

282
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,200
maybe, what's behind the hi, I'm
Alan, is nothing--

283
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,000
the void.

284
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,180
That's what I'm trying to find
out.

285
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,070
Impotent in the face of this
annihilating dread,

286
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,060
we turn to chemicals,
particularly the so-called

287
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,210
antipsychotics of which Prozac
is

288
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,190
the most familiar at present.

289
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,050
What other drugs have you done
besides marijuana?

290
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,100
Not much.

291
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,110
A little this, a little of that,
just to see.

292
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,090
Have you ever done LSD?

293
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,070
No.

294
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,070
All right. well, don't.

295
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,060
It could fuck you up for life.

296
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,030
You think so.

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,050
Yeah, I know so.

298
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,120
Everyone says it's coming back.

299
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,010
Everybody's telling me it's
benign.

300
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,050
Benign?

301
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,120
But what won't work against
dread, what

302
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,150
is laughable in response to that
nothingness,

303
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,130
that gaping inner void is
words--

304
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,170
words.

305
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,000
I have a friend, Sandy King,
she's a--

306
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,100
she's a chem major.

307
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,070
She's working on it.

308
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,190
She's making it?

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,170
Synthesizing it from the
original [INAUDIBLE] formula,

310
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,170
the true Swiss blue.

311
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,090
First off, she's not your
friend.

312
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,220
Second, think of it as cyanide.

313
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,150
It is words in their suddenly
cacophonous,

314
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,090
meaninglessness, words in the
very multiplicity of the voices

315
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,000
that haunt one's mind, voices
that won't shut up,

316
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,010
which uniquely characterize all
forms of madness.

317
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,060
You know there's people who did
acid in the '60s

318
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,060
who are still out there today.

319
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,000
The lucky ones are in the
mountains of Nepal

320
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,150
staring out into space.

321
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,150
And the unlucky ones are
screaming in agony whenever

322
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,230
they're not tranquilized.

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,080
You're talking about addicts.

324
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,200
No, I'm talking about people
like you and me.

325
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,030
The fact that these words have
no meaning, that they

326
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,200
are nothing but sounds haunting
us,

327
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,120
makes the condition of dread all
the more impossible to bear,

328
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,220
which leads us to Ludwig
Wittgenstein,

329
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,030
the Austrian philosopher we
shall be reading next, whose

330
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,040
major contribution was precisely
to level

331
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,090
a devastating assault on the
validity of language itself.

332
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,150
Are you in love with me?

333
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,020
That's a question you wouldn't
ask

334
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,010
if you weren't getting stoned.

335
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,140
No transition, coming out of
nowhere.

336
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,140
What's the answer?

337
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,170
I don't have an answer.

338
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,210
ALAN JENSEN: Have you been
fucking other people?

339
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,170
What do you want the answer to
be, yes or no?

340
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,220
I want the answer to be the
truth.

341
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,090
No, you don't.

342
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,000
Now where were you?

343
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,220
ALAN JENSEN: With you.

344
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,080
CHESNEY: Only at the end.

345
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,200
Were you thinking about another
girl?

346
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,100
ALAN JENSEN: I was thinking
about my parents.

347
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,200
CHESNEY: Oh, that's pretty
perverse.

348
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,040
ALAN JENSEN: No, not sexually.

349
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,220
Their house was blown away in a
tornado.

350
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,100
No insurance?

351
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,200
Not against tornadoes.

352
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,210

00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,010
So how many other students of
yours have you fucked, huh?

889
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,120
Why do you want to know that?

890
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,070
Because it excites you or
because you're not

891
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,190
sure I think you're special?

892
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,170
How many?

893
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,140
This year?

894
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,030
Any year.

895
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Maybe none.

896
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
ALAN JENSEN: Look into my eyes.

897
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,170
CHESNEY: I am looking into your
eyes.

898
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
ALAN JENSEN: While I'm inside
you.

899
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,000
CHESNEY: You're scaring me,
Alan.

900
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,050
ALAN JENSEN: Look into my eyes.
Keep looking.

901
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,070
Look in my eyes.

902
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Don't look away.

903
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,200
Look into eyes. Who are they,
huh?

904
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,180
Don't stop looking.

905
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,040
Keep looking.

906
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,060
Keep looking.

907
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,100
Who were they, huh?

908
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,030
Who were they, those people you
were with?

909
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,150
What people?

910
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,170
Can I offer you anything?

911
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,140
a Coke?

912
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,140
Got any tequila?

913
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,110
[LAUGHS]

914
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,160
Not at work.

915
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,010
Business [INAUDIBLE] what would
your father

916
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,200
say if he thought I was drinking
on the job?

917
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,230
Huh?

918
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,020
That raises an interesting
question.

919
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,100
Can I trust you, totally,
completely, absolutely?

920
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,050
Of course. Of course.

921
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,080
I can trust you not to talk to
my father,

922
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,190
or like a girlfriend of yours?

923
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,030
Between us is between us, like
a priest and confessor.

924
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,020
I've got a game that I'm
willing to bet $250,000 on,

925
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,060
cash.

926
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,150
When it wins, I will kick you
back $25.

927
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,190
Get it up high. A little
higher.

928
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,150
Yo, man, you OK?

929
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,130
Mm.

930
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,160
That's a hard question.

931
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,180
That's a strange answer.

932
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,010
What's wrong with you? -
Nothing.

933
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,230
Everything's fine.

934
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,040
You think we'll beat Dartmouth?

935
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,120
We got to beat Dartmouth.

936
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,020
I thought you said it didn't
make a difference?

937
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,180
I mean, in the cosmic scheme of
things, what

938
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,080
could be less significant than
whether or not

939
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,190
Harvard beats Dartmouth?

940
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,230
A lot of things.

941
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,100
First of all, I'm sick and tired
of losing.

942
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,070
It sucks.

943
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,150
You've got to have pride, man.

944
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,200
Yeah, but you said you only
played

945
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,050
basketball for the girls.

946
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,100
What am I, in court of law?

947
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,160
Am I under oath?

948
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,090
Girls and winning are why I play
basketball.

949
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,150
What the fuck is wrong with you
today, man?

950
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,130
Damn.

951
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,060
Are you interested?

952
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,050
Well, first of all, I don't
want to make any profit on it,

953
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,000
so you can forget about the $25.
- No way.

954
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,120
I insist.

955
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,220
And secondly, why don't you
tell your father about this?

956
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,060
If you have some inside
information,

957
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,110
why don't you just share it with
him?

958
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,220
Because this is my thing.

959
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,150
Look, if you don't get involved,
just say so,

960
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,090
and I will find somebody else.

961
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,060
ANNOUNCER: It hasn't been a
banner season for the Harvard

962
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,140
basketball team, but here
tonight,

963
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,000
on the whole floor of
[INAUDIBLE] pavilion,

964
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,030
there's still a chance to save
face and play for some

965
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,090
pride against a big league--

966
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,200
- Yo, man, you feeling better? -
Yeah, I'm fine.

967
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,230
- You cool? - Cool.

968
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,010
We going to whip Dartmouth's
ass?

969
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,120
Ferociously.

970
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,010
ANNOUNCER: The thing is, they
have

971
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,020
to contain that dynamic duo of
Dartmouth, Harmon and Cobb.

972
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,030
I just never saw you going into
the family business.

973
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,030
But if I did take your action, I
could only do it as a prope.

974
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,120
What does that mean?

975
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,200
That means that considering
that a bet of this size

976
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,190
is going to have to be laid off,
I'm going to need

977
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,180
to have the cash up front.

978
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,160
No problem.

979
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,140
What's the game?

980
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,050
Dartmouth over Harvard.

981
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,040
ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE] intends
to make [INAUDIBLE] pavilion.

982
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,050
The ball is released from the
referee's hand

983
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,190
and we are on our way to Harvard
and Dartmouth.

984
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,220
[INAUDIBLE] gentle [INAUDIBLE]
looking inside for Blake.

985
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,170
Blake putting to the hoop. The
ball is lost.

986
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,060
[INAUDIBLE] now attacking in
transition.

987
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,080
[INAUDIBLE] at the other end of
the floor,

988
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,120
looking for the layup, and is
dropped

989
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,160
in with the right hands.

990
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,060
Jensen and Blake unable to
connect there

991
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,060
at the other end of the floor.

992
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,030
Usually such a great work
between those two,

993
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,170
but couldn't cash in at the
offence that time.

994
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,150
Neither in this instance either
as another pass is thrown away.

995
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,230
Here comes Dartmouth, and once
again, Harmon hung

996
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,210
fake, shot in the air is good.

997
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,160
Dartmouth over Harvard--

998
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,080
$250,000.

999
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,160
You sure are your father's
daughter.

1000
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,160
I assume that's a compliment.

1001
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,230
Oh, of the highest.

1002
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,050
ANNOUNCER: Jensen and Blake
struggling

1003
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,160
in the early going, but still
plenty of time

1004
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,020
to turn it around.

1005
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,170
Jensen bringing the ball up with
the left-handed dribble,

1006
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,200
feeds Blake on the wing.

1007
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,140
Blake hesitates, looking at what
he

1008
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,070
has, now drives into the lane,
goes

1009
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,070
with the left-hand and scores.

1010
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,050
[CHEERING]

1011
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,080
[INAUDIBLE] by Marcus Blake.

1012
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,140
He [INAUDIBLE]

1013
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,000
TEDDY: You'll be taking six and
a half points.

1014
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,180
So you win the bet if Dartmouth
wins outright,

1015
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,070
or if they lose by less than
seven.

1016
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah, I know all this, Teddy.

1017
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,030
I'm not a novice. TEDDY: I'll
say.

1018
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,180
You must have turned into a
pretty sharp handicap

1019
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,020
to go for $250,000 on one
basketball game.

1020
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,120
ANNOUNCER: Here's Jensen looking
for Blake.

1021
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,040
And again, the pass off of
[INAUDIBLE]

1022
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,040
another turnover for the
[INAUDIBLE] Now, Marcus Blake,

1023
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,060
he's a superstar.

1024
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,040
He's got to be able to get down
and dig

1025
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,090
that ball out of his shoes.

1026
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Doesn't your friend, Alan, play
for Harvard.

1027
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,060
uh-huh.

1028
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,160
ANNOUNCER: Here's Blake for the
steal.

1029
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,120
Blake in transition, heading
down

1030
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,180
to the other end of the floor,
elevates [INAUDIBLE]

1031
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,190
Marcus Blake showing how defense
creates offense [INAUDIBLE]

1032
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,050
court to the other end.

1033
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,000
[INAUDIBLE] around handling the
ball for the big green.

1034
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,110
Marching deliberately up the
court.

1035
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,150
Crosses the center court line.

1036
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,010
It's a [INAUDIBLE] on the
baseline.

1037
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,010
Front layup-- that's good.

1038
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,120
TEDDY: How do you think your
boyfriend would

1039
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,160
feel if he knew about this?

1040
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,090
He'd hate it.

1041
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,130
But he won't find out, will he?

1042
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,090
It's just between us, right?

1043
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,010
ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE] the way
is no [INAUDIBLE] rims out.

1044
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,060
Blake with the rebound.

1045
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,000
He'll carry up floor in this
seesaw contest.

1046
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,140
But he turns the ball over.

1047
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,190
The big green coming back the
other way, underneath for the

1048
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,210
lay up.

1049
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,100
That's good and the game is tied
at 33.

1050
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,220
Marcus Blake just seems a step
off so far.

1051
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,140
[PHONE RINGING]

1052
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,190

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,190
of the beep, thanks.

I'm, uh--

1056
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,010
ANNOUNCER: Jensen holds head of
the key, looking to distribute.

1057
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,190
Finds Blake. You never-- stop
the connection.

1058
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,080
Blake trying to go up. Stripped
once.

1059
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,120
Stripped again.

1060
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,170

We should have you into Kansas
City at 2:13 Central Standard

1238

00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,000
I'd like to ask you to just sit
back, relax, and enjoy

1240
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,160

TEDDY: Hey.

1243
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah, hey, baby.

1244
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,200
Yeah. Guess where I am.

1245
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,080
I have something for you--

1246
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,070
$100.

1247
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,160
$100 what?

1248
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,190
$100,000 for a house.

1249
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,190
Alan--

1250
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,110
Where'd you get it?

1251
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,200
It's a long story.

1252
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,100
Well, you flew out here twice
in one week.

1253
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,080
I think you've got the time to
tell us how you came by it.

1254
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,130
I borrowed it.

1255
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,070
You borrowed $100,000?

1256
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,140
Who would lend you that kind of
money?

1257
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,220
Why?

1258
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,050
But don't you think we should
be thanking Alan?

1259
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,200
I'd like an answer to my
question, son.

1260
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,220
I borrowed it from a teacher
who wishes to remain anonymous.

1261
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,110
Her father is extremely rich--

1262
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,170
no strings, no interest, no debt
collection.

1263
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,150
If you had to do anything wrong
to get this money,

1264
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,060
I want you to take it back right
now.

1265
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,030
I just told you how I got it.

1266
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,110
It is more important than
anything

1267
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,040
that you always tell me the
truth--

1268
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,020
more important than a house, do
you understand?

1269
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,030
Yes, I know that.

1270
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,120
And I am telling you the truth.

1271
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,090
Now will you please give me the
pleasure of knowing

1272
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,060
that I've helped out?

1273
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,110
Oh, Come here.

00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,150
Teddy, it's Cindy.

1275
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,100
I'm in my apartment, waiting for
my money.

1276
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,150
Where's my money?

1277
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,220
Look, where are you? Can you
just call me?

1278
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,210

1280
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,130
You got it?

1281
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,050
Got what?

1282
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,050
The money.

Where are you going?

Hey, where is my money?

What do you think you're doing?

1287
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,060
So who is the player, Alan

Where is my money?

1289
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,220
What did you pay him-- $50,
$75?

1290
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,080
Listen, lady, you are testing
my sense

1291
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,080
of humor and my patience, and
that is a big mistake.

1292
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,220
I'm a big gambler, like you.

1293
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,020
I'm sure you are.

1294
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,180
Now give me my fucking money.

1295
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,000
Where's Teddy?

1296
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,080
I want to speak to Teddy--

1297
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,160
Oh, you'll have plenty of time
to talk to Teddy.

1298
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,110
How much did you pay Alan Jensen
to dump the game?

1299
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,090
Get out of my apartment.

1300
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,070
I don't think so.

1301
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,040
You don't think so?

00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,230

fucking with.

Oh no, we know exactly what
we're fucking with.

1308

My father will bury you.

1309
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,060
Or maybe you'll get smart and
help to bury him.

1310
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,220
- Do you have a warrant? - Not
at them moment.

1311
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,030
Then I don't have to talk to
you.

1312
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,220
No, you don't, but you'd be
foolish not to--

1313
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,060
very foolish.

1314
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,050
If you promise to behave, Cindy,
I'll let you up.

you can't be civilized,

down again.

with reality.

Now unless you are planning to
leave the country

1325
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,040
and hide for the rest of your
life,

1326

cooperate.

got my father,

jail.

what.

As opposed to your father,
who's a fucking saint.

At least my father isn't some
two-faced

friend

try to have a little fun.

It would be good for you.

That's what I've been trying to
get to all along.

What if-- and I'm not saying
that I could

1388

or even that I would, but--

sorts of incriminating

that,

could I get my father out of
this totally clean and myself?

Why don't you tell me what you
have to tell me

and I'll do my best.

it is a lie and traps.

1408
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,010
So deny everything.

1409
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,180
TEDDY: You all right?

1410
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,180
Do-- do you want a doctor?

1411
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,040
No, I am a doctor.

1412
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,200
Doctor Jensen, nice to meet you.

1413
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,220
In fact, that's where I met you.

1414
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,080
You were one of my patients
once.

1415
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,150
Didn't I prescribe you some
really good shit once?

1416
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,190
What are you on? huh?

1417
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,080
What drug did you take? What did
you take?

1418
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,210
- That's a good question. - What
are you on?

1419
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,050
- An airplane. - Where'd you get
it?

1420
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,060
I didn't get it. It got me.

1421
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,050
- Hey. - Hey.

1422
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,100
Sorry I'm late.

1423
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:45,090
No problem.

1424
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,130
What are you writing?

1425
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,100
I'm working on this big case.

1426
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,180
Do you want to hear about it?

1427
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,160
I thought you weren't allowed
to discuss cases.

1428
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,060
Or is this particular case, one
in which I could be of some use

1429
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,160
to you? - Use you?

1430
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,000
We would never use you.

1431
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,060
Well you use me all the time,
just as I use you.

1432
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,090
Where's Teddy?

1433
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,150
I'm not sure.

1434
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,130
He took one fork in the road and
I took another.

1435
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,130
Can I get you something?

1436
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,040
- What are you having? - Coke.

1437
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,010
Nothing in it?

1438
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,100
I'm on duty.

1439
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,090
Bacardi Limone on the rocks.

1440
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,120
So what's on the tape, the
American cream team?

1441
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,010
- The American what? - Cream
team.

1442
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,190
How old are you? - How old do
you think I am?

1443
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,020
- 29. - Not bad.

1444
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,030
Why?

1445
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,020
Are you growing dissatisfied
with us?

1446
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,140
Do you prefer someone else?

1447
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,200
Do you think there's others who
might

1448
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,110
fuck you better than we do?

1449
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,200
Differently.

1450
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,020
And how many others are there
at present, if I may

1451
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,050
be so aggressive as to inquire?

1452
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,070
Fewer than you'd wish.

1453
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,190
Than I wish?

1454
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,160
Why would I want you to have
lots of lovers?

1455
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,190
Because the thought of me like
a lot of different men

1456
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,090
excites you, and it excites
Teddy,

1457
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,150
and that excites you even more.

1458
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,000
And what about you?

1459
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,170
Do you claim innocence in all
this?

1460
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,070
No.

1461
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,100
But it's not my fault you two
need a third party to get off.

1462
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,000
You're being very harsh,
Chesney.

1463
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,150
Are you angry with me for some
reason?

1464
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,150
I'm just compensating for your
coyness.

1465
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,170
How am I being coy?

1466
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,040
How am I being coy, she asked
coyly.

1467
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,040
By not answering my simple
question, what's on the tape?

1468
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,170
And by beating around the bush
instead of just coming clean

1469
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,170
and asking me for the help you
need in this big case of yours.

1470
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,080
Has anyone ever told you that
you would make a first-rate

1471
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,130
agent at the Bureau?

1472
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,210
Not that I recall, but I'll
keep it in mind

1473
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,020
if I ever get desperate.

1474
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,010
Now what's on the tape?

1475
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,090
- Gangsters. - Ooh.

1476
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,060
There's a shock.

1477
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,110
The FBI is bugging gangsters?

1478
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,090
Who's the target?

1479
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,230
Andrew Bandolini?

1480
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,010
How did you know that?

1481
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,230
I didn't.

1482
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You just guessed?

1483
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,060
His name came to mind. Oh, come
on.

1484
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,200
Life is nothing but a series of
coincidences.

1485
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,080
This is just a particularly odd
coincidence.

1486
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,190
Like guessing your age.

1487
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,050
Now why don't you get to the
point like a big boy.

1488
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,010
If you want a favor, just ask.

1489
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,030
Think of it as sex.

1490
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,170
Maybe that'll make it easier.

1491
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,130
OK.

1492
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,230
There's a student I would like
you to find out about as much

1493
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,150
as you can, quietly.

1494
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,020
Does she have a name?

1495
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,000
Alan Jensen.

1496
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,050
Vaguely familiar.

1497
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,030
What did he do?

1498
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
He's a rotten kid.

1499
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,190
Is that a felony or a
misdemeanor?

1500
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,000
Let's just say we could have
him put away for a long time,

1501
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,000
if we wanted to. - Why wouldn't
you want to?

1502
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,160
Because he will end up serving
a more useful function.

1503
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,170
Such as?

1504
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,080
Use your vivid imagination,
Chesney.

1505
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,090
I would say to get Andrew
Bandolini,

1506
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,050
but what possible connection
could

1507
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,050
a Harvard man have with some
mafia hood.

1508
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,120
You wouldn't believe me even if
I told you.

1509
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,010
I'm tired of playing this game.

1510
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,030
Just tell me.

1511
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,110
Gambling, but that's just the
start.

1512
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,170
Sorry.

1513
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,160
Sorry.

1514
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,160
Can I help you?

1515
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,140
No, I'm fine.

1516
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,190
I've got it.

1517
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,210
CHESNEY: I'm really sorry.

1518
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,200
KELLY: Don't worry about it.

1519
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,030
It's-- it's fine.

1520
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,010
Actually, um-- I have to go,
anyway.

1521
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,010
So it's fine.

1522
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,010
I'll see you later.

1523
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:38,030
Hey, can I offer you a ride?

1524
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,090
What, in a car?

1525
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,120
[LAUGHS]

1526
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,200
- Yeah. - No.

1527
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,230
No, no, no, no, no.

1528
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,030
No, no small boxes.

1529
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,060
Oh, no, no, this is a big
luxurious car.

1530
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,020
See? - No, I'll be trapped.

1531
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,100
Come on. You'll be fine.

1532
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,100
It's a beautiful car.

1533
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,150
Right there.

1534
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,220
It's a free ride, wherever you
want to go.

1535
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,220
- Who are you? - [INAUDIBLE]

1536
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,200
Do I know you?

1537
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,020
Yeah, I'm Teddy.

1538
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,090
We just spent two hours
together.

1539
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,100
No, I mean, who are you?

1540
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,070
I'll tell you what, you get in
the car,

1541
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,040
and I will answer all your deep
questions,

1542
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,190
and maybe you can even answer
some of mine.

1543
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,160
All right?

1544
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,140
Come on.

1545
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,130
It'll be fun.

1546
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,020
We'll go for fun ride.

1547
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,050
Look.

1548
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,190
The pretty lady, she driving
us-- take

1549
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,180
you wherever you want to go.

1550
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,190
Come on. Come on.

1551
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,110
You'll be fine. It's all right.

1552
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,200
There you go.

1553
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,190
Oh.

1554
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,090
ALAN JENSEN: No little boxes.

1555
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,150
It's too small.

1556
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,050
I gotta get out of here.

1557
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,160
Oh.

1558
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,130
How do you open this?

1559
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,190
TEDDY: You don't.

1560
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,130
Excuse me, could you open the
door, please?

1561
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,050
I want to go back to my room and
listen to music.

1562
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,150
You can listen until your
heart's content.

1563
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,020
We're just going to ask you a
few questions.

1564
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,130
I believe Mr. Jensen may have
ingested

1565
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,070
some chemical substances, which
alter

1566
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,150
his perception of reality.

1567
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,020
What did I do?

1568
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,100
Do I do anything sexual with
you?

1569
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,220
Not yet.

1570
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,060
But you never know what can
happen if you give the right

1571
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,000
answers to the right questions.

1572
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,090
What drug did you take, Alan?

1573
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,150
TEDDY: You're not going to get
anything out of him.

1574
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,000
He's totally gone. - You look
very familiar.

1575
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,130
Are you sure we never made love.
- Quite.

1576
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,230
Quite, indeed. You would
remember.

1577
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,200
I'm sure I would.

1578
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,180
Do you want to?

1579
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,220
KELLY: What drug did you take?

1580
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,070
Do you want my penis inside
your vagina?

1581
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,060
Hey, do you want me to shove my
cane up your ass?

1582
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,130
Does that wild look mean yes or
no.

1583
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,230
Maybe after we get to know each
other a bit.

1584
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
What drug did you take?

1585
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:08,220
Oh.

1586
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,010
And how does that happen?

1587
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,120
I'm getting to know another
person--

1588
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,230
knowing another person.

1589
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,140
KELLY: Like I said before, the
right

1590
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,050
answers to the right questions.

1591
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,090
God, but those are just words
and words are just noise.

1592
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,120
KELLY: Are you on ecstasy?

1593
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,180
What, did you smoke some crack,
Alan?

1594
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,010
[MUTTERING GIBBERISH]

1595
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,090
KELLY: Did you drop acid?

1596
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,160
Alan?

1597
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,180
You're looking for Alan?

1598
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,200
Who are you?

1599
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,160
My name's Chesney and yours is
Cindy.

1600
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,140
How did you know that?

1601
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,030
Alan talks about all the time.

1602
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,180
That's funny, because he's
never mentioned you to me.

1603
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,140
You guys need any help?

1604
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,210
Uh-uh.

1605
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,210
We're looking for Alan.

1606
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,030
I haven't seen him.

1607
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,070
If you want, I can give him a
message or a--

1608
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,150
better yet, why don't the both
of you hang in my room

1609
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,150
for awhile? - Thanks, but, um--

1610
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
No.

1611
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,030
Yeah, it is a bit early for
that.

1612
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,120
Yeah, well, um--if change your
mind, you know, just knock.

1613
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:18,020
Cause you know my motto is, you
got the bear, I got the time.

1614
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,040
Would you shut the fuck up?

1615
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,150
Did you-- if you don't mind my
asking--

1616
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,100
did you have an arrangement to
meet him here?

1617
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,230
- No, did you? - No.

1618
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,150
- So he could be anywhere? -
Doing anything.

1619
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,150
Unless--

1620
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,120
Unless what?

1621
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,130
How do I know who you are?

1622
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,110
You could be anybody.

1623
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,080
I'm his professor.

1624
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,090
Unless what?

1625
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,130
Unless somebody already grabbed
him?

1626
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,060
Somebody, meaning the FBI.

1627
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,120
What would the FBI want with
Alan?

1628
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,110
I have no idea.

1629
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,090
Maybe you could help me?

1630
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,210
I don't think so.

1631
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,120
KELLY: Oh, do you believe this
asshole.

1632
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,110
TEDDY: Oh, man.

1633
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,180
Ugh.

1634
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,230
Hey, you got to backup.

1635
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,220
This is one way.

1636
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,150
Excuse me, sir?

1637
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,190
You got to back up. You got to
move this.

1638
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,060
I got no room. What do you want
me to do?

1639
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,070
Back up.

1640
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,140
- Teddy? - Move it.

1641
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,130
- Teddy? - Hey, hey.

1642
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,000
- It's all right. - Hey.

1643
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:05,220
Let me just talk to--

1644
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,200
Hey!

1645
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,170
Alan!

1646
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,150
Fucker.

1647
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Hey, move it.

1648
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,130
Oh, Jesus.

1649
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,000
Hey.

1650
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,030
- [INAUDIBLE] - OK.

1651
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,160
Look, we gotta look at it this
way.

1652
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,120
You're a legacy, so you got a
leg up.

1653
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,030
But I mean, it's just gotten
incredibly competitive.

1654
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,120
You look around this place, it's
like half Asian.

1655
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,060
I mean, I don't know if I could
get in now.

1656
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,000
Dad, maybe I don't even want to
go here.

1657
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,060
Honey, you want to go to
Harvard.

1658
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,190
It's Harvard.

1659
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,010
Well, what about the other
schools that we looked at, dad?

1660
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,020
Like what about Duke?

1661
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,110
Duke was a lot more fun than
Harvard.

1662
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,120
Honey, Harvard is just-- it's--
it's a great

1663
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,130
calling card.

1664
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,230
Doors just open up.

1665
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,170
You're going to forge
relationships here that will

1666
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,220
last you the rest of your life.

1667
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,130
The kids are amazing here.

1668
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,060
It's the best of the-- excuse
me?

1669
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,040
Excuse me? - Dad?

1670
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,010
Hi.

1671
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,100
Al Franken, college, '73.

1672
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,120
Dad?

1673
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,090
I actually was at [INAUDIBLE]
here.

1674
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,130
Dad?

1675
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,080
Yeah, uh-- this is my daughter,
Thomason.

1676
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,170
She's high school junior.

1677
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,080
I just wanted her to meet a
Harvard student,

1678
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:02,070
because it's kind of a random
process.

1679
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,210
I thought I'd pick your brain,
because you've been through it.

1680
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,050
She got a 1520 on her SAT.

1681
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,010
Dad, don't tell people my SAT
scores.

1682
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:08,230
Sorry.

1683
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,050
800 on her math.

1684
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,110
Dad, how do you even know he
goes to Harvard?

1685
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,160
Of course he goes to Harvard.

1686
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,220
He's been through this process--

1687
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,070
letters of recommendation.

1688
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,050
Say she got a letter from
Hillary.

1689
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,220
Dad, Hillary doesn't even know
me.

1690
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,220
Honey, she met you at the
fundraiser.

1691
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,090
She was very impressed with you.

1692
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,230
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

1693
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,170
Honey, this is one of your
weaknesses.

1694
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,170
You get embarrassed too easily.

1695
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Maybe you can use that.

1696
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,230
Like in the interview today, if
they

1697
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,090
ask you your strengths and
weaknesses,

1698
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,090
my weakness is I get embarrassed
too easily.

1699
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,010
Yeah, I know how to give an
interview, OK?

1700
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,170
Summer program-- we're thinking

1701
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,190
like an Indian reservation.

1702
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,080
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

1703
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,090
I hate these things.

1704
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,090
Excuse me.

1705
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,130
Listen, I'm really--

1706
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,180
Yeah?

1707
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,190
Hi, Adam.

1708
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,060
If I were you, I would free
myself.

1709
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,040
I would open myself up.

1710
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,130
I would sing.

1711
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,040
I would sing a high C, sing a
high C in the middle

1712
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,090
of Harvard Square.

1713
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,120
No, no, no [INAUDIBLE] sing a
[INAUDIBLE]

1714
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,100
I know.

1715
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,220
He's a pathological liar. - Dad?

1716
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,060
I gotta go. I'm at Harvard.

1717
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,040
Dad?

1718
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,020
She got a 1520.

1719
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:07,010
Dad, this guy is high, OK?

1720
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:07,220
How do you know?

1721
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,210
Just look at his eyes.

1722
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:14,080
Dad?

1723
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,130
Dad, let's go.

1724
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,120
Dad?

1725
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,000
Dad, let's go.

1726
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,210
OK.

1727
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,050
Um-- uh-- thank you.

1728
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,080
Oh, it's a Harvard man-- river
man.

1729
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,040
Run, river. River run.

1730
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,210
Charles River by the Charles
River, by the river.

1731
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,100
Run, river. River, run.

1732
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,110
River, run.

1733
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,200
Harvard man, run, River Charles,
run.

1734
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,180
Run.

1735
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,230
Run, river. Run, run,

1736
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,220
COED 1: Holy shit.

1737
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,180
Mr. Al Franken, right?

1738
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,040
I'll tell you what I'm going to
do.

1739
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,090
I personally, Alan Jensen, will
accept

1740
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,030
your daughter into Harvard.

1741
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,170
But if you don't want to go, I
would

1742
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,080
strongly suggest against it.

1743
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,000
Don't-- don't let your father
pressure you.

1744
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,040
He is weird.

1745
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,170
Did you know that the earth is
the insane

1746
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,010
asylum of the universe?

1747
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,170
What did you take?

1748
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,040
Are you OK?

1749
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,210
- What can we do to help you? -
Run, river.

1750
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,230
River, run. Run, river.

1751
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,010
River, run.

1752
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,070
Run to the banks of the Charles
River.

1753
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,170
Run, Charles River, run.

1754
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,140
Run.

1755
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,220
Run.

1756
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,130
COED 2: That's why I gave up
drugs my junior year

1757
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,230

Go ahead.

Can I help you guys out?

2113
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:03,070
Yeah, we're looking for Alan
Jensen.

2114
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,120
Yeah, everybody's looking for
him.

2115
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,190
Yeah? Who else?

2116
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,030
So who's this kid we're going
to shoot?

2117
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,030
His name is Alan.

2118
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,060
Is that the kid from the house?

2119
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,100
Yes, it's the kid from the
house.

2120
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,130
The basketball kid?

2121
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,220
Yes, it's the basketball kid.

01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,200
Why are you asking?

2125
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,120
FBI-- no shit.

2126
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,150
What did he do?

2127
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,190
Why are we shooting him?

2128
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,230
I don't know if we're going to
shoot him.

2129
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,050
We didn't get the OK from
Andrew.

If we get the OK from Andrew,
we'll shoot him.

2131
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,070
You're going to shoot him
though, right?

2132
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,170
- Why am I going to shoot him? -
It's your turn.

2133
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,210
I shot the last guy.

2134
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,110
I don't recall you shooting the
last guy.

2135
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,000
Do you even remember who the
last guy we took care of was?

2136
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:34,080
- Of course I remember. - Who?

2137
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,050
What? Are you testing me?

2138
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:35,230
Go ahead. Tell me.

2139
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,030
Who.

2140
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:37,210
That [INAUDIBLE] kid on Queens
Boulevard.

2141
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,230
And who fired the shot?

2142
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,210
I did.

2143
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,190
You?

2144
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,050
No more voices?

because your other problems,

away.

2153
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,050
Why you looking out the window?

01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,100
what

2155
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,150
How come you keep looking out
the window?

2156
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,210
I feel like looking out the
window.

2157
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,200
What are you looking at?

2158
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,220
The scenery.

2159
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,040
There's birds and flowers and
shit.

2160
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,040
Since when are you so
interested in scenery?

2161
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,230
You may stay here until things
become a bit more calm.

is like cyanide from this day

on.

Your drug taking career has come
to an absolute conclusion.

2165
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,020
- It's my breath, right? - What?

2166
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,020
My breath stinks, right?

2167
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,030
No, your breath don't stink.

2168
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,230
How's that? A little bit
better?

2169
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
We tend to take consciousness
for granted.

2170
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:57,070
It evolved so subtly and so
slowly from the day

2171
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:03,000
we are born until the time we
form thoughts and express

2172
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:07,010
those thoughts in language, that
we forget what

2173
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,080
a fragile edifice it is we have
built,

2174
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:13,180
this thing called I, the self.

2175
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,150
And we forget how, once
shattered,

2176
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,100
how hard it is to reconstruct.

2177
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,150
Treat it with respect.

2178
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,050
I seem to remember jumping out
of an FBI window

2179
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,100
not too long ago.

2180
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,230
I think you might be interested
in hearing this.

2181
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,100
Apparently, the FBI has been
bugging Bandolini's

2182
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,190
house for quite a while now.

2183
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,160
And from what I can gather, this
conversation

2184
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,190
must have taken place the day
you went to get your loan.

2185

ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Why'd
bring him here?

2186
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,200

lost their house

2187
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:53,080
in that tornado in Kansas and he
needs

2188
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,180
$100,000 to bail them out.

2189
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,080

are we, the Red Cross?

01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,080
Told you, he ain't fucking
here, man.

2192
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,090
He ain't stupid.

2193
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,200
He's a fucking Harvard man.
What?

2194
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,030
You think he's going to be
waiting around when he knows

2195
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,140
he got guys coming for him? Huh?

2196
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,070
How do you know that he knows
that he's

2197
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,160
got guys coming after him?

2198
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:09,120
CINDY (ON RECORDER): We can make
a huge score, daddy.

2199
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:11,070
Alan will do anything to get
this money.

2200
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,070
I can get him to dump the
Dartmouth game.

2201
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,080
We could bet like $1 million on
Dartmouth,

2202
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,050
and Alan walks away with his
home for his parents,

2203
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,100
and we walk away with $1 million
cash for one day's work.

2204
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,220
What do you think?

2205
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,080
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): I think
I've been too easy on you,

2206
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,140
letting you do anything you want
since your mother died.

2207
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:24,090
CINDY (ON RECORDER): What do you
mean?

2208
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,090
It's fool-proof.

2209
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,050
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Only a
fool

2210
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,070
says anything is fool-proof.

2211
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,220
All this misery, all this
danger.

2212
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,110
Why do you think I've given you
so much money?

2213
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,210
What girl has $1 million cash
stashed in a vault.

2214
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,050
CINDY (ON RECORDER): OK. OK.

2215
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,110
It was just an idea.

2216
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,170
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Yeah, a
terrible idea.

2217
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,010
CINDY (ON RECORDER): It'll never
come up again.

2218
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,060
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): You're
damn right it won't.

2219
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,120
Well, he's gotta come back here
eventually.

2220
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,020
It's where he lives. - So what
are you saying?

2221
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,130
We sit here, fucking jerking our
shit until next fucking Easter?

2222
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,230
Come on. - Yeah, well what's
your idea?

2223
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,180
We drive around the block in
circles

2224
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,200
and hope we bump into him.

2225
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:49,030
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): And answer
me this.

2226
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,190
If you're so concerned about
this guy's house,

2227
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,020
why don't you just spot him
$100,000 yourself, as a loan?

2228
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,150
CINDY (ON RECORDER): That
wouldn't be any fun.

2229
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,010
Besides, haven't you always told
me,

2230
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,130
never give away something for
nothing?

2231
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,010
ANDREW (ON RECORDER): That's my
little girl.

2232
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:04,080
Wow.

2233
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:06,110
She's even more lethal than I
thought.

2234
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,090
You chose her.

2235
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,080
Yeah, I chose her.

2236
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:12,080
But you chose two FBI agents who
tried to force me to get

2237
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,140
Andrew Bandolini put away.

2238
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,130
When he not only didn't try and
set it up,

2239
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,050
but he tried to stop his
daughter from setting it up.

2240
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,030
What a saint.

2241
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,050
Someone should canonize him.

2242
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,090
You're not defending them, are
you?

2243
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,090
Teddy and Kelly?

2244
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,070
Yeah, Teddy and Kelly.

2245
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,170
No, and I'm not defending your
little group either.

2246
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:33,220
Let's not argue about each
other's friends' vices,

2247
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,000
all right?

2248
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:37,050
Let's just try and get you out
of this.

2249
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,170
You know them better than I do,

2250
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:43,050
but from what I know of them,
friendly persuasion is not

2251
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,220
going to get them to back off.

2252
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:47,110
- Depends on what kind. - What
do you have in mind?

2253
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,190
Hello?

2254
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,200
Hi, Chesney.

2255
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,180
What?

2256
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,160
Tonight?

2257
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,210
Hold-- hold on a second.

2258
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,100
All right.

2259
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:04,170
[INAUDIBLE] Sounds very
intriguing.

2260
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,220
[INAUDIBLE] What, uh-- time?

2261
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,190
Actually, I'm in the real
estate acquisition

2262
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,090
and development business in the
United

2263
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,090
States, Canada, and Mexico.

2264
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,170
And my most recent acquisition
was

2265
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,210
the Pele Island Hotel and Pub.

2266
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:19,010
[CHATTER]

2267
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,140
[INAUDIBLE] the morning is a
joke.

2268
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,170
You better go to the doctor.

2269
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,080
You don't sound good at all.

2270
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,180
So I go home.

2271
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:39,150
I ask my wife, I say, Becky, am
I sleeping OK?

2272
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,010
[INAUDIBLE] I sound like I'm
dying.

2273
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,080
She says, no, no, you're
sleeping like a baby.

2274
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:47,100
I go to the sleep doctor. he
tells me it's about one

2275
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:50,030
of the worst cases of sleep
apnea he's ever seen.

2276
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,000
And he puts me on a breathing
machine.

2277
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:54,020
Now, I go home and ask my wife,
I said,

2278
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,030
honey, why did you tell me I'm
sleeping OK?

2279
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,000
She said, you sounded great,
again I'm like,

2280
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,150
I think you're thinking about
insurance policies.

2281
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,140
Suppose this fucking kid does
come back in, let's say, I

2282
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,200
don't know, the next fucking 10
years, then

2283
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:05,230
what are we going to do with
him?

2284
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,050
What do you think we're going
to do?

2285
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:08,160
I don't know. You see what my
point is though?

2286
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,220
No, what is your point?

2287
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,080
My point is that we don't have
a fucking plan.

2288
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,000
Maybe you don't have a plan. I
do.

2289
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,070
Oh, really? You have a plan?

2290
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,210
Would you care to fucking
enlighten me on it?

2291
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,000
We tell him that we got Andrew
waiting for him down

2292
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:20,160
at this restaurant, that we have
a proposition to offer him

2293
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:22,060
to settle everything, and that
we think

2294
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,210
he should come down with us.

2295
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,100
We get him in the car peacefully
and quietly, and we drive.

2296
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:29,090
Then we shoot him on the way to
guys and dump the body.

2297
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,070
At Donny's?

2298
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,150
Of course at Donny's.

2299
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,140
Where the fuck else are we going
to dump the body?

2300
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,020
All right.

2301
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,070
Then well, let me ask you one
more question, because as

2302
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,210
of right now, you've got to be
the biggest

2303
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,090
fucking hard on I ever met.

2304
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,040
Why don't we cash this kid out
of the fucking street

2305
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,110
and put a fucking bullet in his
head?

2306
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,120
Commotion.

2307
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,170
What commotion?

2308
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,080
People-- they hear shots, they
take notice.

2309
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:48,090
Don't make me explain something
to that should be obvious.

2310
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,120
It insults my intelligence.

2311
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:54,080
You know we can get a silencer
for this, right?

2312
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,140
Hey.

2313
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,230
Oh, look who it is. We've been
waiting for you.

2314
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,090
How you doing, [INAUDIBLE] -
Yeah, I can see that.

2315
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,170
What's up?

2316
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,180
We've got Andrew waiting for us
at this restaurant

2317
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,160
down near the square. - Oh,
yeah?

2318
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,210
You better go. You'll be late.

2319
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,060
No, us, meaning, you.

2320
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:06,140
And they were selling it to,
you know, the United

2321
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:07,160
States during Prohibition.

2322
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,130
Oh my god, hi.

2323
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,010
When did you get back in town?

2324
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,030
Not long ago.

2325
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,160
I can't believe how great you
look.

2326
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,000
Um-- this is Joe.

2327
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,030
Joe, this is Elaine.

2328
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,090
It's a pleasure to meet you
Elaine.

2329
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,180
Likewise.

2330
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:21,050
Elaine is one of my oldest
friends in the world.

2331
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,140
Would you mind terribly giving
us a few moments alone?

2332
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,180
No.

2333
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,130
Come visit my hotel on the beach
any time.

2334
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,060
What actually is your name?

2335
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:29,040
Chesney.

2336
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,080
Juliet.

2337
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,200
Just tell Andrew to hang in and
lie low.

2338
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,230
I've got it all under control.

2339
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,190
Hey, come on, fellows.

2340
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,180
It's a camera.

2341
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:40,030
It shoots pictures, not bullets.

2342
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,100
Can I tell you something?

2343
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:42,200
I don't know what it is you guys
think

2344
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:45,030
I'm going to do that you need to
prevent me from doing,

2345
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,100
but whatever it is-- - Rat.

2346
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,110
Rat what?

2347
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,180
Not what rat what, rat to the
FBI.

2348
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:49,160
Think we don't fucking know?

2349
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,170
Out of the question.

2350
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,030
I'm handling that.

2351
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,190
If you want, you can follow me
down there and watch.

2352
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,030
Just don't get too close,
because you'll

2353
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,080
screw everything up.

2354
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,120
I heard this was kind of a
pick-up place.

2355
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:01,110
It can be, if that's what
you're looking for.

2356
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,190
Is that what you're looking for?

2357
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,110
Hey, Russ, look, I'm getting a
little too fucking

2358
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,180
hungry to deal with this--

2359
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,230
What is this, a pleasure a
vacation for you?

2360
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,080
You're getting paid for this,
aren't you?

2361
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,160
Of course I'm getting fucking
paid.

2362
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,060
What the fuck do I look like, an
amateur?

2363
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,150
But what I'm saying is, look, we
either kill this motherfucker

2364
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,090
right here, right now, in his
fucking room,

2365
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,140
or we give him to--

2366
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,210
Late morning is actually all I
really need.

2367
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,070
All right. FBI cleared out of
the way.

2368
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,200
Everything's cleaned up. - What
if he's fucking with us?

2369
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,000
No, he ain't fucking with us.

2370
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,130
He just made us an offer to
follow him.

2371
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,040
Do you want to come back to my
place?

2372
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:28,020
I can't.

2373
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,140
I need you to come to mine.

2374
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:30,160
You live alone?

2375
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,130
I live alone, but we won't be
alone.

2376
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,010
So what you're saying is you
want to follow

2377
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,160
him for your next 14 hours?

2378
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,150
You're missing my point.

2379
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,000
We don't have to follow him.

2380
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,030
The fact that he just made us an
offer to follow him

2381
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,090
is enough, because he didn't
know when

2382
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,170
he made us that offer that we
weren't

2383
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,050
going to take him up on it. See
what my point is?

2384
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,110
The kid ain't got nothing to
hide

2385
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,080
or he wouldn't have made us that
fucking offer.

2386
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:48,180
Please tell me you understand
this.

2387
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,050
- I understand. - Thank you.

2388
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,140
So what do you want to do then?

2389
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:52,180
When?

2390
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,230
- For the next 14 hours. - I
don't know.

2391
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,230
Let's go get something to eat,
some pussy,

2392
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,200
get some food-- whatever.

2393
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:56,210
Whoa.

2394
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,230
Where do you think you're going?

2395
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I gotta fix things.

2396
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,000
I can't be late.

2397
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:01,010
Look, just hang out.

2398
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,020
I'll call you tomorrow.

2399
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,110
Use the phone as much as you
like.

2400
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,120
Do you trust this guy?

2401
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:13,080
I don't even know what the fuck
just happened?

2402
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:17,070
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2403
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:48,200
TEDDY: Oh, fuck me.

2404
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,020
Any particular reason you chose
black and white

2405
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:52,040
instead of color?

2406
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:54,080
More authentic, more
incriminating.

2407
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,020
I expected to see you in a
wheelchair

2408
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:57,130
or at least on crutches.

2409
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,180
Yeah, I guess I got lucky, huh?

2410
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:00,190
Oh, you got a lot more than
lucky.

2411
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,090
You have a mole, an inside
source, a traitor.

2412
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,110
- A traitor? - Yeah, a traitor.

2413
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,170
- Who, Chesney? - Yes.

2414
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:06,150
Not to me.

2415
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,120
Well--

2416
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,220
To me, she was a savior.

2417
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,080
Besides, what does that make you
two?

2418
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:12,090
We're law enforcement officers
and that's what we do.

2419
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,100
We infiltrate and arrest.

2420
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,170
What about Bandolini?

2421
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,100
What does what you did to
Bandolini make you?

2422
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,160
Yeah, well, to him, I'm a
traitor.

2423
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:19,180
Who gives a shit?

2424
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:21,070
Will bust him on book making at
Shylock.

2425
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,230
That's all we're going to get,
given that Mr. Jensen here,

2426
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,230
seems to hold all the cards.

2427
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,130
Or in this case, all the
photographs.

2428
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,140
No.

2429
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,220
Not even Bandolini.

2430
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:29,200
All right.

2431
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:31,080
What are your demands?

2432
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:32,190
To be left alone-- forget this
whole thing ever happened,

2433
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,000
say goodbye, move on--

2434
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:36,190
a clean slate for everybody.

2435
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,010
What do you think?

2436
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:39,030
I think we're fucked.

2437
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,070
We don't have much choice, do
we?

2438
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,230
None, that I can see.

2439
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,210
All right.

2440
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,090
You've got a clean slate.

2441
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:48,020
But for your own sake, you
better look over your shoulder.

2442
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,210
That popping sound you hear just
might be

2443
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:52,160
a bullet headed for your brain.

2444
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,010
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.

2445
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:57,020
- Yeah, you do that. - Oh, uh--
no, one other thing.

2446
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:58,160
Princeton's playing Harvard next
week

2447
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,070
and I was going to dump that
game too,

2448
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,060
only this time, I'm going to
make some real money doing it.

2449
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:04,040
And I was thinking, maybe you
two could pone

2450
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,100
a little score for yourselves.

2451
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,180
You know, bet some serious cash
on Princeton.

2452
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:08,220
You saw how easy it was for me
to pull it off.

2453
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:10,080
Why not?

2454
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:12,040
Just the three of us will know
and I'm sure as hell

2455
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:13,010
not going to tell anybody.

2456
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,150
What do you say?

2457
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,060
I don't this is an issue that
needs to be discussed in words,

2458
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,110
do you? - Uh-uh.

2459
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,230
You mean, we can all just nod
in agreement

2460
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,200
and acknowledge each other's
greed and criminality.

2461
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:22,000
I think he's taping this.

2462
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,010
You're taping this, aren't you?

2463
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:23,230
He's wired.

2464
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,200
Are you wired?

2465
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,010
Huh?

2466
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,130
He's not wired.

2467
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,110
He's just having a little fun at
our expense, right, Alan.

2468
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

2469
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,040
How does it feel to grovel,
Eddie?

2470
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,160
Not nice, is it. - Teddy.

2471
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:35,120
To be on your knees, hoping you
get nailed for some moment

2472
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:36,160
of human weakness.

2473
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:38,040
Hoping some guy in a position of
authority

2474
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:40,140
doesn't make you suffer because
that's what gets him off,

2475
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:41,210
doing you in for your
transgressions.

2476
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,040
Yeah, I agree. You're
absolutely right.

2477
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,000
- About what? - Everything.

2478
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,170
Anything you say. All right?

2479
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,040
As long as we just call it a
clean slate

2480
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:48,140
and act as though we never met
as

2481
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,020
soon as you leave this office,
isn't that what we want?

2482
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,030
Huh?

2483
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,010
Clean slate.

2484
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,160
CINDY: Nice shot.

2485
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,060
Don't tell me you came alone.

2486
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,170
I was expecting the Italian
army.

2487
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,010
CINDY: Hey, no racial
stereotyping, remember?

2488
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,150
I'm sorry things had to work out
the way they did.

2489
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,120
Had to, huh?

2490
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,070
That's a very interesting way of
putting it.

2491
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,190
As if we have nothing to do with
what happens to us--

2492
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,100
all fate.

2493
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:20,050
Very interesting, especially in
the light of the fact that if I

2494
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,220
don't give you some satisfactory
information

2495
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:24,090
in the next few minutes, you're
going to go to a phone

2496
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,050
and call your father or Mario or
Russell, or whoever the fuck

2497
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,160
those guys are, and they're
going to bop, bop--

2498
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:31,020
shoot me.

2499
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,040
But you wouldn't have had
anything to do with that.

2500
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,080
It would have just happened.

2501
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:35,050
You're getting way too deep for
me, Alan.

2502
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,220
Pardon me.

2503
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:38,180
I keep forgetting that you're
just a simple cheerleader

2504
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:40,040
with nothing on her mind but the
winning

2505
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,070
and losing of basketball games.

2506
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,110
You know, none of this would
have

2507
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,200
happened in the first place if
you hadn't

2508
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:46,000
wanted money from my father.

2509
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:47,080
I was naive.

2510
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:48,200
I thought he was into real
estate and construction.

2511
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,200
You know what? Don't start the
accusations--

2512
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:50,200
I didn't know he had rich
daughter

2513
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,200
that was into fixing games.

2514
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,210
We'll just get into an
argument.

2515
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,220
See? I'm not accusing him, only
you.

2516
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:57,010
You are one sick fuck, Alan.

2517
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,110
Yeah, well, I'll try and do
better.

2518
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,030
In the meantime, you can tell
your family and friends

2519
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,080
that the FBI is backing from the
case.

2520
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:07,050
You and they won't have to hear
from them anymore.

2521
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,120
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

2522
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,110
How'd you pull that off?

2523
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,170
Modern technology.

2524
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,220
You mean, we'll never--

2525
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,120
I mean, they won't--

2526
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,150
Let me keep they money and you
won't hear any more about it.

2527
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,170
About anything?

2528
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:18,140
Well, anything relating to this
case.

2529
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,070
I'm sorry I couldn't get you a
blanket

2530
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,010
license to fix, embezzle, and
kill

2531
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,120
in other areas of your life.

2532
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,210
But I'll tell you what, I'll
work on it for you.

2533
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,090
You're a strange guy, Alan.

2534
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,080
Well, we can't all be normal,
if there is such a thing.

2535
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:32,180
We weren't really going
anywhere.

2536
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,130
I mean, it's not like you were
going

2537
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,140
to ask me to marry you and have
your children, were you?

2538
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,230
No, I can't say that I was.

2539
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,120
Then I Think it all worked out
for the best.

2540
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,200
That's not a bad way of looking
at it.

2541
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:42,080
You really are kind of cute,
you know that?

2542
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,140
Thanks.

2543
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:45,100
I'm sure glad you didn't have to
have me killed.

2544
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:47,160
I would have been much less cute
as a corpse.

2545
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:48,190
I gotta run.

2546
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,060
Yeah, give me a year or two,
I'm

2547
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,120
sure I'll get sufficiently
sentimental about the memory

2548
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,120
of our relationship.

2549
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,110
Take your time.

2550
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,120
So I guess we can say, you
saved me twice.

2551
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:01,100
Saved-- never.

2552
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,190
helped-- maybe.

2553
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,220
No, you saved my mind and my
freedom.

2554
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:06,040
You saved my life.

2555
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,180
No way I could ever balance the
books with you.

2556
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,150
Sounds like a polite way of
saying goodbye.

2557
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,180
No, I didn't mean it like that.

2558
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,230
I know. I'm teasing.

2559
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,020
I don't handle compliments too
gracefully.

2560
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:15,080
Well, at the risk of making you

2561
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,010
feel even more uncomfortable, I
should

2562
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,020
apologize to you as well. - For
what?

2563
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,190
For having caused an abrupt end

2564
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:23,080
to that little erotic triangle
you were obviously enjoying

2565
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,130
so much with America's finest.

2566
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,180
I think I'll survive.

2567
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:27,040
It had just about played itself
out anyway.

2568
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,220
So tell me something.

2569
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,060
Why did you choose--

2570
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:32,160
Teddy and Kelly in particular,
or sex in general?

2571
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:34,210
Oh, well, sex in general I
think I understand.

2572
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,170
Although, you are farther out
than I guess--

2573
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,200
Than who? Than you?

2574
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,100
You are 22 now.

2575
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:41,230
Let's compare notes when you're
28 and we'll see who's where.

2576
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,040
Yeah, well what-- what about
them?

2577
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,030
I mean, why choose such--

2578
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,120
Why two FBI agents?

2579
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,140
Maybe because they were FBI
agents.

2580
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah, well I don't want to be
rude, but--

2581
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:50,160
Oh, come on, be rude.

2582
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:52,130
I think I can handle it.

2583
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:56,070
What does that make you, some
kind of collector?

2584
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,020
The way I see it, you're on
this earth

2585
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,170
for about a split second.

2586
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,000
You find out what excites you
and as long

2587
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:05,020
as you're not forcing it, or
hurting anyone, you try it.

2588
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,160
- What about love? - What about
it?

2589
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:08,180
Don't you want to fall in love
and have children?

2590
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,010
Sure, if it happens.

2591
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,230
But you cant make yourself want
something?

2592
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,100
Do you think you and I could
ever do that?

2593
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,040
- Fall in love? - Why not?

2594
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:16,050
With each other?

2595
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,050
Yeah, of course, with each
other.

2596
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,020
I wouldn't rule it out.

2597
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,060
Yeah, that's the way I feel--

2598
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:22,210
wouldn't rule it out.

2599
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,170
Wouldn't rule it out.

2600
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,070
In the meantime, I think I've
gone about

2601
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,060
as far as I can in your general
thinking about life and sanity

2602
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:33,030
and madness and death.

2603
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,140
I think what I need to do is get
concrete, find something

2604
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:37,130
that I can get good at and
something

2605
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,090
that I can make a living doing.

2606
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,150
Any ideas?

2607
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,050
Yeah, actually.

2608
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:47,120
I thought of it last night, as I
was going to sleep.

2609
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:48,110
[LAUGHS]

2610
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,140
Are you serious?

2611
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,200
Yeah, well, I'm not saying it's

2612
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:54,080
going to be forever, or even for
the next year,

2613
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,070
but I'm going to try it.

2614
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,140
Good for you.

2615
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,110
Those pictures last night don't
really count.

2616
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,190
No one's going to put them on
exhibit.

2617
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,150
Do you want be my first subject?

2618
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,230
It would be my pleasure.

2619

Well, we'll do more later.

I hope so.

and see it, and seize it,

2627

and maybe even enrich it.

angle and every way.
