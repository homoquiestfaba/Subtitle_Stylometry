00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,546
AUTUMN DREAMS

2
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,278
Subrip: Pix

3
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,214
Guess who?

4
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Hancock,
I'll have it ready by sundown.

5
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,329
They'll see us!

6
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,665
Stop!

7
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>Annie?</i>

8
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:09,868
<i>Annie?</i>

9
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:13,739
Hey, Ben.

10
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,040
Hey, Joe.

11
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,675
Did you feed the horses
this morning?

12
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,343
No, no...

13
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,478
<i>Annie?</i>

14
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,081
Annie Hancock,
where are you?

15
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,849
Right here.

16
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,951
There's my little girl.

17
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm not really your little
girl anymore, dad.

18
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,821
No, honey.

19
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,989
You'll always be my little girl.

20
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:31,890
You found her.

21
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:32,958
Yeah.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,293
Where are the boys?

23
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,294
Joe?

24
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,395
Ben?

25
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,867
I just want to let you know
that we made the harvest quota.

26
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,203
Just barely, but barely
is good enough.

27
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,003
Thank you, boys.

28
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:45,671
Good work.

29
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,538
Thanks.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,739
Annie, you better
go get cleaned up.

31
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,274
You don't want to be late
for the dance.

32
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,109
See you later, guys.

33
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,443
See you there, boys.

34
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,321
I love this song.

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,892
You're not changing your mind?

36
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,860
No.

37
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,796
I just don't want to hurt
my parents.

38
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,938
Annie, we have to leave now.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,440
Ok, I'll see you outside.

40
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,475
Okay.

41
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:32,317
Joe, I need you to do me
a favour.

42
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,352
Yeah, of course.

43
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,720
Anything.

44
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,928
I need you to give this
to my dad in 30 minutes.

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,110
I can't believe this.

46
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:01,346
I'm having a Cinderella moment.

47
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:13,058
Annie, with this ring
I thee wed.

48
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:25,070
Ben, with this ring
I thee wed.

49
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,307
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

50
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,142
You may kiss the bride.

51
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,144
Nobody waits for that anymore.

52
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,082
Congratulations.

53
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,221
Thank you.

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,329
I'm sorry, I truly am,

55
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,630
but you two are just too young
to get married.

56
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,298
Dad, you don't understand.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,701
You're only 18, Annie.

58
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,469
Your mother will be so upset.

59
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,204
What about your plans?

60
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,872
You haven't even
started college.

61
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:04,109
But dad, my future is with Ben.

62
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,245
Look, it's not too late,
we can get it annulled.

63
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,146
Sir, I have a job lined up
in New York.

64
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,882
It's a big opportunity for me.

65
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:11,817
For us.

66
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,653
And they want me there
in two days.

67
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,787
I want to go with him.

68
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,389
I love him.

69
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,924
I love your daughter
very much, sir.

70
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,828
Well then I know you'll want
what's best for her.

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,430
Deep down you know I'm right.

72
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,398
Come on, Annie.

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
Get your things.

74
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,035
Ben...

75
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,338
I understand.

76
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,284
Maybe you two just need a
little time to think it through.

77
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,118
Think more clearly.

78
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,420
See the sense in this.

79
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,955
I'll send your pay along
with the annulment papers.

80
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:50,956
Mr. Hancock...

81
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,658
You're a decent kid.

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,160
I always liked you, Ben.

83
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,528
I hope I wasn't wrong
about you.

84
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,730
You're not wrong about me,
sir.

85
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,033
One day I hope to prove that
to you.

86
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,065
Annie!

87
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,166
Joe, what is it?

88
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,000
You did it again.

89
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,234
What?

90
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,438
Oops.

91
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,172
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,340
I'm sorry!

93
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,442
It just feels so weird wearing
something so pretty

94
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,111
when I'm up to my elbows
in farming all day.

95
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,814
Look, it matters to me.

96
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,182
Ok.

97
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,617
I'll make you a deal, ok?

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,054
I won't worry about the ring
if we set a date.

99
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,456
We will.

100
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,523
We will, I promise!

101
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,192
It's just, I have so much
work to do

102
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,928
if I'm gonna get that grant.

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,896
How am I supposed to
revolutionize farming

104
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,699
and look for a wedding dress
all at the same time?

105
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,667
Wear coveralls.

106
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,001
I don't care.

107
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,270
Hey, we've been engaged
for nearly two years.

108
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,740
Yeah, but I had graduate
school...

109
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,008
And then planting
and the harvest

110
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,877
and taking care
of your mother...

111
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,379
there's always gonna
be something.

112
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:25,083
Hey, we make a good team.

113
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,791
Ok, let's do it.

114
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,658
You mean it?

115
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,893
Yeah, yeah!

116
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,727
Alright!

117
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,663
Alright, one
month from today,

118
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,898
right after harvest.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,366
Ok.

120
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,035
Fall is my favourite
time of year.

121
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,937
<i>Annie.</i>

122
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,205
<i>Hey.</i>

123
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,039
This came for you.

124
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,143
This could be about the grant.

125
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,246
Fingers crossed.

126
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,452
Good news?

127
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,456
The foundation just wants
some more information

128
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,459
about my study.

129
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,861
Now don't you use this as an
excuse to postpone the wedding.

130
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,830
You finally set a date?

131
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,831
Right after the harvest.

132
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,635
Congratulations.

133
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,402
Thank you.

134
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,137
Annie.

135
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,373
Your father would have been
so proud.

136
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,009
I know how much he wanted
to walk you down the aisle.

137
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,011
I know, mom.

138
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,246
I miss him every day.

139
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,284
We've got a wedding
to plan.

140
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,121
Yeah.

141
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,457
Is everything ok?

142
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,791
Yeah.

143
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,060
Yeah, of course
everything's alright.

144
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,662
She's just getting cold feet.

145
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,497
No, I'm not.

146
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,867
My feet are on fire.

147
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,570
I just-I gotta run to the house
to grab something.

148
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,883
A divorce?

149
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,219
This can't be.

150
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,721
The marriage was annulled.

151
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,623
Anthony McAllister.

152
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,626
McAllister.

153
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,101
Hi, could I speak to
Anthony McAllister?

154
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,074
Yeah.

155
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,141
Ok.

156
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,042
No, that's ok.

157
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,344
I'll call back.

158
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,781
This isn't happening.

159
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,050
What's not happening?

160
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,186
Where's Joe?

161
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:41,820
He's out in the barn.

162
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:42,687
Why?

163
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,823
Come here.

164
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,026
So dad filed those annulment
papers, didn't he?

165
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,027
Of course he did.

166
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,762
Well, look what I've got.

167
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,601
Divorce?

168
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,702
This doesn't make any sense.

169
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,037
Yeah, I know.

170
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,572
But those papers say I have to
appear in a New York City court

171
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:05,577
with Ben the day after tomorrow
or I face contempt.

172
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,013
Mom, what am I
gonna tell Joe?

173
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,414
I mean, I never even had
a heart to tell him

174
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,784
that Ben and I actually
got married.

175
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,220
He's gonna be so upset.

176
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:19,925
Maybe you've been asked to take
a meeting with the foundation.

177
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:25,130
I'm sure it's just a
paperwork glitch and...

178
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, I've gotta go and make
a reservation.

179
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,803
Well, at least you get
to see New York City.

180
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:46,284
<i>Here you go.</i>

181
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,686
<i>Thank you.</i>

182
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,997
Well, we're not in Iowa anymore.

183
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,005
Excuse me.

184
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,107
Our wedding is finally
coming together,

185
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,042
and let me tell you
it hasn't been easy.

186
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,611
I was appalled by
the flower choices

187
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,346
that Francois designed
for me.

188
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,648
I asked for chartreuse
and he gave me lime green.

189
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,917
And he was offended!

190
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,721
On the flip side, you're going
to adore my new architect.

191
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,430
Poor groom?

192
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,515
Excuse me, I'm...

193
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,284
I'm so sorry, I didn't
see you there.

194
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,886
That's quite alright.

195
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,755
Is there something
I can help you with?

196
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,224
Yes, I'm looking for
Anthony McAllister.

197
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,393
End of the hall, left,
first right.

198
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,194
Thank you.

199
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:18,943
No need to break
the door down,

200
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,812
I don't think he's in there.

201
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,080
Do you know
when he'll be back?

202
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,015
No idea.

203
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,321
Annie?

204
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,190
Ben?

205
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,763
I don't know what to say.

206
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,266
How about "hello"?

207
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,301
Hello.

209
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,904
Hi.

210
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,174
You look great.

211
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,809
Yeah, you too.

212
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,343
Thanks.

213
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,111
So...

214
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm looking for your lawyer.

215
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,414
Do you work here?

216
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,318
Yeah, I do.

217
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,720
Well, I...

218
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,488
I really need to find out
what's going on here.

219
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,623
Yeah, why don't we go
over here.

220
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,093
We can talk and I'll try to get
a hold of Tony.

221
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:08,760
Ok.

222
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:09,294
Give me this.

223
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,762
Thanks.

224
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,169
Your boss has a great office.

225
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,372
He'll be very pleased
to hear you say that.

226
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,741
Do you like him?

227
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,476
He has his good days
and bad days.

228
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,545
I think he's liking this one.

229
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,013
Voice mail.

230
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:29,781
Tony, it's Ben.

231
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,983
Call me asap.

232
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,151
So I don't understand
what's going on.

233
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,354
We have to get a divorce?

234
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,923
It's kinda hard to do
when you're not married.

235
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,692
Did you not get the note?

236
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,760
No note,

237
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,796
just those very intimidating
legal documents.

238
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,465
I told Tony to include the note
with the documents.

239
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,733
Let me explain.

240
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,435
Excuse me, Mr. Lawson.

241
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,337
You have to leave now
for that appointment.

242
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,338
I'll be right there, Tracy.

243
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,840
Thank you.

244
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,676
This is your office?

245
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,380
Not bad for a farm hand,

246
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,048
Sure beats the barn.

247
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,049
Hey!

248
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,417
I got your message,
I was on my way in.

249
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,487
Tony, this is Annie.

250
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,255
Nice to meet you.

251
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:10,922
We gotta go.

252
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:11,856
We're expected.

253
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,724
I'll update you on the way.

254
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,691
Let's go.

255
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,726
Annie, sorry, this won't take
very long.

256
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,528
Where are you staying?

257
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,096
I just came
from the airport.

258
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:18,663
Ok.

259
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:19,898
Tracy?

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,166
Tracy?

261
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,734
Can you please set Miss Hancock
up at the corporate suite

262
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,536
and have Hector take her?

263
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,670
Thank you.

264
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,905
That's ok, I'm fine.

265
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,573
Annie, I insist.

266
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,841
Wait a second.

267
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,075
You're the Annie?

268
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,377
Annabelle Hancock?

269
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,079
That's right.

270
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,382
If we're complete
by the 26th,

271
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,150
should be there in 10 minutes.

272
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,218
No, it has to be done
by then.

273
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Forget the small print.

274
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,721
Can you hold please?

275
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,356
Hector.

276
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,692
Hi. This is Miss Hancock.

277
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,093
She's an old friend.

278
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,862
Please take good care of her.

279
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,597
My apologies, I have
to travel with Tony,

280
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,899
we're about to finish a deal
but I promise when we're done

281
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,001
we can talk.

282
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,902
Would you mind following me?

283
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,037
Yes sir.

284
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
An hour and a half.

285
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,943
He's a busy guy?

286
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,011
Yes, miss.

287
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:13,017
He enjoys this
larger-than-life life?

288
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,587
I don't think he has the time.

289
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,290
It's just you and me?

290
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,059
That's right.

291
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,228
Hector, I drive a tractor.

292
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,363
I'm not really a limo
kind of gal.

293
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,098
Mind if I ride up front
with you?

294
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,666
It would be my pleasure.

295
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,068
Ok.

296
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,171
Thank you, sir.

297
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,939
You're very welcome.

298
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,820
What a day.

299
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,189
Excuse me, we'll have
whatever she's having.

300
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:55,159
Annie, thank you
for your patience.

301
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,461
We are all yours.

302
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,762
Great.

303
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,330
Can one of you tell me what's
going on with this divorce?

304
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,832
'Cause we're not married.

305
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,434
The thing of it is I recently
found out that your marriage

306
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,737
was never officially annulled.

307
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,006
No paperwork
exists anywhere.

308
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,741
I don't know how it happened,

309
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,075
probably got lost in the mail.

310
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,710
But it is a problem.

311
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,880
It's a big problem, because
I'm getting married next month.

312
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,148
Ok, great.

313
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,951
So you both need to get this
resolved as soon as possible.

314
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,452
Both of us?

315
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,122
I'm getting married on Saturday.

316
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,857
I thought you knew that.

317
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,159
No. I didn't.

318
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,495
Ok, well anyway,
that's why the court date.

319
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,630
Technically, in the eyes
of the law,

320
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,899
you two are husband and wife.

321
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,736
This is not good.

322
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,072
Ok, well surely when
the judge hears our story

323
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:44,509
he'll grant a divorce and
that will be that, right?

324
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,376
Right.

325
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,411
Because Joe's going
to be crushed

326
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,079
if we can't get
married next month.

327
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,848
You're... you're marrying Joe?

328
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,917
My old buddy Joe?

329
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,085
Yeah.

330
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,920
He's the one.

331
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,922
I always knew he had
a crush on you.

332
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,924
The crush was mutual.

333
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,393
I don't know what I would
have done without him.

334
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,331
Normally when a divorce is filed
it takes quite a while

335
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,566
to process and become official.

336
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,136
I plan to expedite that by
arguing special circumstances,

337
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,671
but it is crucial

338
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,308
that you both show up
tomorrow morning to testify.

339
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,376
Ok.

340
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,944
Alright.

341
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,647
Well, it's been a long day
and I know it's cliche

342
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,783
but we farmers get up
with the roosters.

343
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,286
Not a lot of roosters
in the Upper East Side.

344
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,621
I'll have Hector take you
to the corporate suite.

345
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:31,289
No, it's ok.

346
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,256
I can get a hotel.

347
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,424
Annie, please.

348
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,493
It's the least I can do for
dragging you all the way

349
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,796
to New York.

350
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,466
I'm too tired to argue
with you.

351
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,134
Thank you.

352
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,338
It's ok, the car is just
right out here,

353
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,574
I'm sure I can find it myself.

354
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,610
Ok, well, see you
in the morning.

355
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,178
Don't be late for court!

356
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,175
Hello?

357
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,309
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

358
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,944
Annie, hi!

359
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,746
Hey, sorry, I know
it's late there.

360
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,881
Don't be silly.

361
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,182
I've been dying to talk to you.

362
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,050
How's New York?

363
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,886
How's the little problem?

364
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,122
It should be resolved
in court tomorrow.

365
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,123
<i>Have you seen Ben?</i>

366
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,726
<i>How was that?</i>

367
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:45,363
Well, it was...

368
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,733
it was strange and awkward.

369
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,636
<i>He's a very successful
investor.</i>

370
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,537
He's changed.

371
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,008
Well, it's been such
a long time, hon.

372
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,344
Considering where things
were left off and everything.

373
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,046
Yeah.

374
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,549
So how's
everything there?

375
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,416
Yeah.

376
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,717
Couldn't be better.

377
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,521
Except I miss you.

378
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,091
Alright mom, well...

379
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,358
I got a big day tomorrow

380
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,329
so I'll talk to you later, ok?

381
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,130
Ok.

382
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,398
I'll tell Joe you say hello.

383
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,133
Yeah, ok.

384
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,302
I love you. Bye.

385
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,950
Hello?

386
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,017
Yeah.

387
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,152
Yeah, I'll be right down.

388
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,854
Ok. Thanks.

389
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,900
<i>Helloooooo!</i>

390
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,135
Jovanna?

391
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,469
Good morning, my love.

392
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,540
I cannot wait to transform
this place.

393
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,442
It's just not suitable
for entertaining.

394
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,443
Can we do this later?

395
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,712
I gotta get to the office.

396
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,581
You don't want your bride moving
into something so ordinary.

397
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,183
It's just not me.

398
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,418
Us.

399
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,254
Ours.

400
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,622
Wait!

401
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,657
I want you to see these plans
before I have them finalized.

402
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,059
I only have a couple of minutes.

403
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,095
That wall is going to come
out and everything

404
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:27,798
will be all white with
touches of red and black.

405
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,536
Clean, modern, bold.

406
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:35,006
I thought we were going
with warmer colours.

407
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,274
And if you knock down the wall,

408
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,843
where are we gonna put my
grandmother's antique chest?

409
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,548
We'll find the right spot
for it.

410
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,950
You'll be amazed how much
room there is

411
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,719
once we get rid of that piano.

412
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,521
Wait, I thought that was
still up for negotiation?

413
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,991
You told me you don't have time
to play it anymore.

414
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,994
It contradicts my vision.

415
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,663
You have to trust me.

416
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:03,234
Interior design isn't just
my job, it's my calling.

417
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:07,972
Let me turn our home
into a work of art.

418
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,874
I want you to be happy.

419
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,843
Whatever you need to make
that happen, go ahead.

420
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,745
I have to go.

421
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,280
I'll see you later for dinner?

422
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,649
That new French place
on Madison.

423
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,852
Maybe we could eat in sometime?

424
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,988
Duck a l'orange, take out.

425
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,889
Yeah.

426
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,457
See ya.

427
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,698
Thank you.

428
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,967
Morning, Hector.

429
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,134
I got you a little surprise.

430
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,937
Why, thank you, Annie.

431
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,505
May I call you Annie?

432
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,741
What else would you call me?

433
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,010
Thoughtful, considerate.

434
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,645
That works.

435
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,120
It's a very elegant apartment.

436
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,990
It's a little cold
for my taste, but...

437
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,659
I trust you slept well.

438
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,327
I got up at dawn.

439
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:03,995
I can't help it,
you know?

440
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,930
It's just in my genes.

441
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,933
Plus all the honking
and the sirens...

442
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:12,837
we don't have a lot
of that in Iowa.

443
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,406
I gotta be honest with you,
Hector.

444
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,476
I didn't sleep a wink.

445
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:23,281
I was pretty nervous
about today.

446
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,816
May I ask you a question?

447
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,252
Of course, ask away.

448
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,055
How long have you worked
for Ben?

449
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:34,258
Since he was a junior executive,

450
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,960
and there was always
something special about him.

451
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,764
He was polite, he was friendly,

452
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:43,934
he was completely different
from the privileged young men

453
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,737
who were his competition.

454
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,473
He worked harder
than anyone else.

455
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,778
It was like he was
chasing a dream.

456
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,018
Looks like he finally
fulfilled that dream.

457
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,321
I just wish he was happier.

458
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,005
Are you alright?

459
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,541
Yeah, just ready
to move forward.

460
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:24,875
Ok.

461
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,379
All rise.

462
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,017
Mr. McAllister.

463
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,086
Back in my courtroom
so soon?

464
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,487
Yes, your honour.

465
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:41,092
But I was told Judge Norton
was going to be presiding.

466
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,493
He had an emergency.

467
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,095
You're stuck with me.

468
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,763
Well, this shouldn't take up
too much of your time.

469
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,232
Let's hope not.

470
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,334
Proceed.

471
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,170
15 years ago, Benjamin Lawson
and Annabelle Hancock

472
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,205
were married.

473
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,074
That marriage was annulled
or so we thought.

474
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,309
Why the confusion?

475
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,710
The annulment papers
were sent in,

476
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,880
but there's no record of
them ever being finalized.

477
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,883
I discovered this fact
while writing his pre-nup.

478
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,720
Mr. Lawson needs to be legally
divorced as soon as possible.

479
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,789
He's getting married Saturday.

480
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,057
This Saturday?

481
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:13,958
Yes, your honour.

482
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,693
So I'm citing special
circumstances

483
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:19,663
and asking that you grant
them an immediate divorce.

484
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,166
You realize what would happen
if I obliged every attorney

485
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,368
with the same request?

486
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,072
I need to hear
from the couple.

487
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:31,108
How did this occur?

488
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,711
Miss Hancock and I eloped

489
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,013
but her father felt
we were too young.

490
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,281
How young?

491
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,718
Annie was 18,
I was 19.

492
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,519
Both of legal age.

493
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,586
Why did you agree?

494
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,088
I didn't want the annulment.

495
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,892
We were very much in love,

496
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,394
but I did what I felt
was best for Annie

497
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,798
and reluctantly signed
the papers.

498
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,533
And then what?

499
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:56,634
That's all I know.

500
00:23:56,736 --> 00:24:00,738
And then Mr. McAllister
discovered the problem.

501
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,373
This was the last time
you two saw each other?

502
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,809
We haven't spoken
in 15 years.

503
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,812
Once I left Iowa she stopped
all communication.

504
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,113
What?

505
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,981
You're the one that got on
that bus and never looked back.

506
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,817
Your honour, Mr. Lawson
is simply asking

507
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,519
for the ability to get married
as scheduled on Saturday.

508
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,521
I got the message loud and
clear when you didn't show up

509
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,589
at the bus stop.

510
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,458
Mr. McAllister, a little
order in the court.

511
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,592
I'm sorry...

512
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,060
I had a really good reason,
not that you cared.

513
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,930
You never even bothered to
find out why I didn't show.

514
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,898
I waited as long as I could.

515
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,566
I wrote letters.

516
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,234
I called.

517
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,535
He never called.

518
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,470
Why are you lying?

519
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,004
I mean, none of this even
matters anymore.

520
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,606
Your honour, I'm not lying.

521
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,575
I just want to get
this over with.

522
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,076
Annie, Annie, no...

523
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,911
What is going on, counsellor?

524
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,980
Ben! Ben!

525
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,648
I'm going to review these
special circumstances

526
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,916
and take them under advisement.

527
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,652
You and your unruly clients
will be back in my courtroom

528
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,554
Monday morning 10am.

529
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,290
Your honour,
Monday is too late.

530
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,692
This court is adjourned.

531
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:55,793
Your honour!

532
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,662
Mr. Lawson is going to be
married Saturday!

533
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,164
That is not my problem.

534
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,265
No, I realize that.

535
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,268
It's-it's that would be
my problem.

536
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,103
Ok.

537
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,443
Annie.

538
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,582
I got on that bus because
you never showed up.

539
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,585
Not even to say goodbye.

540
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,655
'Cause dad had a heart attack
that day.

541
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,491
It was the first of many
and I couldn't leave him

542
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:32,696
and I couldn't leave my mom.

543
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,335
I am so sorry.

544
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,838
I had no idea.

545
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,209
He was just never the same
after that.

546
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:54,885
This proud man suddenly
couldn't do much of anything.

547
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,522
Why didn't you answer
my letters?

548
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,925
Or return my calls?

549
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,427
'Cause I never got any letters.

550
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,898
You tried to contact me?

551
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,234
You honestly had no idea?

552
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,242
Dad.

553
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,245
He was just trying
to protect you.

554
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,714
He should have told me.

555
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,250
Psst. Guys.

556
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,685
What hap...

557
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,385
What hap...

558
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,690
Ben?

559
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,591
Hi.

560
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,026
What-what are you
doing here?

561
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,762
I stopped by your office
after seeing the architect.

562
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:39,897
Guess what?

563
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,065
You weren't there.

564
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,434
So I looked at your calendar
and it said "court".

565
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,935
Nothing about a pretty girl.

566
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,670
This isn't a pretty girl.

567
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,938
I think she could pass
for pretty.

568
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:48,706
No.

569
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,107
Annie is my client.

570
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,542
She and Ben are old friends.

571
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,844
He asked me to help her out
of a jam.

572
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,279
Am I missing something?

573
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,013
A deposition.

574
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,514
I'll take care of it later.

575
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,016
We haven't been introduced.

576
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,353
I'm Ben's fiancé,
Jovanna Jorgensen.

577
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,322
Annie Hancock.

578
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,391
We go way back.

579
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,892
To Iowa.

580
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,662
Our time on the farm together.

581
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,297
It's Annie's first time
to the city.

582
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:13,964
Yeah.

583
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,001
How long will you be
in town?

584
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,203
Our court date got postponed
until Monday.

585
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:19,903
Monday?!

586
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,338
Yes.

587
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,375
Well, enjoy the big city.

588
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,276
I will see you later,
my love?

589
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,647
I'm having lunch with a client.

590
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,882
Jovanna is an interior designer.

591
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,385
Lovely to have met you.

592
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,486
You too.

593
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,029
We're getting married
on Saturday.

594
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,330
Why can't we come back sooner?

595
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,132
We have four days
to fix this.

596
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,267
The judge's docket is full
and you two walking out

597
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,670
of the courtroom didn't help
the case!

598
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:54,238
So what are we gonna do?

599
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,107
I got a plan.

600
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,077
You'll get married as scheduled.

601
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,112
Jovanna will sign a faux
marriage certificate,

602
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,148
although you won't be
legally married

603
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,384
until I get the judge to wave
her magic gavel on Monday,

604
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,720
but I'll switch the papers, no
one will know the difference.

605
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,854
I don't know, Tony.

606
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,624
Ben, I'm going to shuffle
around some papers, ok?

607
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,859
Jovanna shouldn't have
to cancel the fairytale wedding,

608
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,163
it is the social event
of the season.

609
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,231
What do you think, Annie?

610
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,966
I think I need to get
back home.

611
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,501
Ben, I have so much going on.

612
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,603
You can't get married
until this is resolved.

613
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:30,474
The judge insisted that
we all be present Monday.

614
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,077
What difference does a few
days make, right?

615
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,017
Ok.

616
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,585
Alright, but I have to get
some work done

617
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,154
because I'm doing a thesis
on the acidity of soil.

618
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,323
That sounds exciting.

619
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,593
You can have an office, a
computer, whatever you need.

620
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,730
You can have an office and a
computer, whatever you need.

621
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:53,897
Maybe a plant.

622
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,199
You're at home.

623
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:55,933
Let's go to lunch.

624
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,334
I'm starving.

625
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,238
Come on, Ben.

626
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,574
According to our analyst
the whole sector is hot.

627
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:06,443
Hi.

628
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,311
Tracy said you wanted
to see me?

629
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,512
Yes.

630
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,548
We don't usually have an
in-house farmer down the hall.

631
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,784
I want to buy King
Fertilizer Corp.

632
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,687
We have to move fast because
it is poised for a big bump.

633
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,723
I don't know anything
about stocks.

634
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,825
But?

635
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,928
I do know fertilizer, and that
brand is lacking in minerals

636
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,664
and it just depletes
the soil over time.

637
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,334
But our team has done reams
of research and...

638
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,569
My degree is in agricultural
chemistry

639
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,538
with an emphasis
on biotechnology.

640
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,243
No disrespect, but I think that
King Fertilizer is a bad bet.

641
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:42,980
Ok.

642
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,215
It was your idea to ask her.

643
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:45,916
Is that it?

644
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:46,483
Yes.

645
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,252
That's it, thanks.

646
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,456
Funny.

647
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,424
Real funny.

648
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,135
Annie!

649
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,737
Good call.

650
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,672
King is down by $6.

651
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,707
You saved us a lot of money.

652
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,342
Yeah, it was my idea
to ask her.

653
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,043
Great.

654
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,044
Yes, it is.

655
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,979
And because of that we owe
you a first class

656
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,849
New York City dinner tonight,
I'm buying.

657
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,184
That's not necessary.

658
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,352
Jovanna and I already
have plans.

659
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,754
Great, why don't we all go?

660
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,521
Perfect.

661
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,323
See you tonight.

662
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,895
Congratulations.

663
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,233
And it is lucky for me
you got that degree.

664
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:36,767
Cheers.

665
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,502
Cheers.

666
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,141
What kind of degree?

667
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,743
I'm a doctoral candidate.

668
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,479
That's a lot of education
for running a farm.

669
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,115
Well, running a farm
is hard work.

670
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:56,520
Ben and I used to hear my dad
say that all the time.

671
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,525
I have some good news.

672
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,627
We have a final head count
for our wedding.

673
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,430
Only 406.

674
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,632
I thought you said 350.

675
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,968
It's the social event of
the season.

676
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,370
406 people?

677
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,973
That's more than the whole
population of Granby.

678
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,842
It'd be like Joe and me
inviting the whole town

679
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,010
to our wedding.

680
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,279
You're getting married?

681
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,981
Didn't I tell you that?

682
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:24,648
No, Ben.

683
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,883
You left that part out.

684
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,885
When's the wedding, Annie?

685
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,954
It's like four weeks from today.

686
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,323
I don't even have a dress.

687
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,825
Seriously?

688
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,460
I scoured every inch
of this city

689
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,995
to find the perfect
wedding dress.

690
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,264
I know just where to take you.

691
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,466
Jovanna, I'm sure you have
enough on your plate

692
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,901
with our wedding.

693
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,737
I can spare a few hours
for your old friend.

694
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,639
You can tell me all
about young Ben

695
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,941
and his idyllic days
on the farm.

696
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:54,144
No, I couldn't
possibly impose.

697
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,446
Come by my office
tomorrow morning.

698
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,547
I'll take you shopping.

699
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,916
Just us girls.

700
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,084
It'll be fun.

701
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,020
Great.

702
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,403
Hey, Joe.

703
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:20,137
Hey, Annie.

704
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,138
How are you doing?

705
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,806
<i>I'm ok.</i>

706
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,708
<i>How's everything there?</i>

707
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,109
The tractor is running
a little sluggish

708
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:29,980
but I'll have Ed
have a look at it.

709
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,348
You know, your mom and I
sent out the save the date

710
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,318
wedding invitations.

711
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,319
That's great.

712
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,321
When do you think
you'll be back?

713
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,791
I should know a little bit
more on Monday.

714
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,961
You know, it's not the same
around here without you.

715
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:44,761
<i>Hey, your mom's here.</i>

716
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,629
<i>I'll put you on speaker.</i>

717
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,463
Ok.

718
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,998
Annie, honey, we miss you.

719
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,099
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

720
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,734
Miss you, too.

721
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,235
Listen guys, I gotta get going

722
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,704
but I'll call you tomorrow, ok?

723
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,572
Ok hon, good luck.

724
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,007
Alright, bye.

725
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,445
Bye.

726
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,753
Tell Francois he's colour blind.

727
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,089
The roses he showed me
are fuchsia.

728
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,590
And I don't like the chairs
in the banquet hall.

729
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,293
Tell Sergio to replace them.

730
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,562
Yes, I do realize
it's 430 chairs

731
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,697
and yes, by Saturday.

732
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,965
Thank you.

733
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,610
She needs something
much simpler.

734
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,246
There's too much tulle.

735
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,815
It's very pretty, though.

736
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,984
You'll know when it's the one.

737
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,786
Let's try the ivory A-line.

738
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:47,557
Look, Jovanna,

739
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,060
I really appreciate
your help with this

740
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:53,764
but I'm just feeling a
little bit overwhelmed.

741
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,266
Maybe I should look for
something back in Granby.

742
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,868
Not on my watch.

743
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,872
Iowa isn't exactly the fashion
capital of the world.

744
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:05,375
You're not leaving New York City
without a wedding dress.

745
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:09,980
Now you march right back
into that dressing room.

746
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,348
You only get married once,
right?

747
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,216
Right.

748
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,584
Right.

749
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,588
It all starts with the dress.

750
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,923
It dictates the feeling,

751
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,692
the theme of the entire wedding.

752
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,828
I guess.

753
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,963
So tell me all about the groom.

754
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:30,233
How did you guys meet, how
long have you been together?

755
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,969
Joe, he's...

756
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,805
Joe is a solid guy,

757
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:41,044
he's been our right hand at the
farm ever since, well, forever.

758
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,547
It kinda feels like
we grew up together.

759
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,982
I can't believe you run
a farm.

760
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,351
After my dad died I had to.

761
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,220
But I couldn't do it
without my mom and Joe.

762
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:56,693
He's... He's
a really loyal guy.

763
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,229
That's what I love most
about Ben.

764
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,499
How honest and loyal he is.

765
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,167
You know what I mean?

766
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,803
Yep.

767
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,572
How are you doing in there?

768
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,085
No.

769
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,260
No.

770
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,108
That's the one!

771
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,445
Once they make the adjustments

772
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,714
we'll have it sent right over.

773
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,151
Joe is a very lucky man.

774
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,852
Thank you.

775
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,697
I think Walker is playing us.

776
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:11,434
Hello?

777
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,637
Earth to Ben.

778
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:14,604
Sorry.

779
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,673
Walker.

780
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,675
I was just thinking about
Jovanna and Annie.

781
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,844
Wondering how things are going.

782
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,479
That's why you're so distracted.

783
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:25,248
Yeah, my future wife is helping
my other wife

784
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,617
pick out a wedding gown so she
can get married to a guy

785
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,587
who has no idea she was ever
married to me.

786
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,256
What a tangled web
we weave.

787
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,292
I'm counting on you to
un-weave it on Monday.

788
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,159
What am I, new?

789
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:36,893
I got it.

790
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,196
Relax. It's going to be fun.

791
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,200
Annie, hey.

792
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,802
We were we were just
talking about you.

793
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,471
How's the shopping
expedition going?

794
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,740
I got a dress.

795
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,108
<i>That's great.</i>

796
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,946
Yeah, Jovanna was determined
to find the perfect one,

797
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,949
and we did.

798
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,917
So everything was ok?

799
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,787
Yeah, Ben, she's great.

800
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,523
I just feel badly about
deceiving her about you and me

801
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:10,093
and Tony's whole faux
license scheme.

802
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,063
I know what you mean, but
soon it'll all be resolved

803
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,632
and there will be no
more secrets to keep.

804
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,033
<i>Yeah.</i>

805
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,736
She's really excited
about the wedding.

806
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,772
Jovanna!

807
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:23,807
Hello, my love.

808
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,041
Do you mind if
I call you back?

809
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,777
My fiancé just walked in.

810
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,146
Yeah. Yeah.

811
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,692
Fashionista farmer.

812
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,704
I'll have to surprise
you more often.

813
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,972
What brought that on?

814
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,241
Can't a guy kiss
his bride to be?

815
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,679
Later, lovebirds.

816
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,581
I got work to do.

817
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:07,417
Thank you for going
the extra mile with Annie.

818
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,453
Just another wonderful thing
you do.

819
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,888
How did it go?

820
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,556
We found the perfect dress.

821
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,259
And I learned a few things
about her, too.

822
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,529
Like what?

823
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,764
This and that.

824
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,633
Just girl talk.

825
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,802
But that's not why I came by.

826
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,571
That remodel I did in Chicago
just snagged the cover

827
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,241
of By Design magazine,
along with an eight-page spread!

828
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,409
That's great!

829
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,711
The only problem is it's not
absolutely perfect yet.

830
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,813
You know how I am about details.

831
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,149
So I'm on the next plane
to Chicago.

832
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,418
I'll be back in time
for the rehearsal,

833
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,553
I hope you don't mind.

834
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,088
Of course not.

835
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,397
Annie!

836
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,032
What are you doing here?

837
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,268
Ben was kind enough
to lend me an office

838
00:38:58,403 --> 00:38:59,769
so I can get some work done.

839
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,503
Hey.

840
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,438
Listen.

841
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,772
I just, I really want
to say thank you

842
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,808
for helping me find
that dress.

843
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,010
I'm excited.

844
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,878
It was my pleasure, honestly.

845
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,047
Wait!

846
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,249
I just had a great idea.

847
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,884
Since you're stuck
here anyway,

848
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,386
why don't you come
to the rehearsal?

849
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,487
And the wedding?

850
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,521
What?

851
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:19,122
No...

852
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:20,056
Nonsense.

853
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,091
You and Ben are such
old friends,

854
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,493
I know he'd want you there.

855
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,329
I... don't know what to say.

856
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,130
Say yes.

857
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,131
I gotta run.

858
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,900
See you at the rehearsal.

859
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,402
Ok.

860
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:40,643
Are you ok?

861
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,012
I'm coming to your wedding.

862
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,981
What did you say?

863
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,750
Hey.

864
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,651
You just missed
your shopping BFF.

865
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,753
No, I didn't.

866
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:50,987
I didn't miss her and
she didn't miss me.

867
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,622
In fact, she insisted that
I come to the rehearsal

868
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,057
and the wedding.

869
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,458
You don't have to do that.

870
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,461
But she's been so nice,
I couldn't refuse.

871
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:03,066
You know, it's gonna be strange,
but I'll be fine.

872
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,167
You're a real trooper.

873
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,602
Piece of cake.

874
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:06,736
Literally.

875
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,306
Seven layers and counting.

876
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,741
Maybe you shouldn't go
to the wedding.

877
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,610
I'll be fine.

878
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,245
Let me make it up to you.

879
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,680
Jovanna has to go to Chicago

880
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,316
so I'm off wedding duty for
a couple of days.

881
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:23,787
How about after work I show
you some of my New York?

882
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,888
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,991
Take her out to dinner,
celebrate the divorce.

884
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,526
You've barely seen the city.

885
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,361
It's crazy to come to the
big apple and not take a bite.

886
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,496
You may not get this
chance again.

887
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,636
Ok.

888
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,870
Ok.

889
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,546
Hector, allow me.

890
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,783
Let's do some touring,
shall we?

891
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,585
As you wish.

892
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,031
This is great.

893
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,373
There's so many people here.

894
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,566
You should have been
a tour guide.

895
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,034
Well, we've only covered
Manhattan.

896
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,136
We've got four more boroughs.

897
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,639
I wish we had that kind of time.

898
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,508
Me too.

899
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,613
So how do you know
about this place?

900
00:41:56,715 --> 00:42:01,618
Well, when I first got here
it was pretty overwhelming

901
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,755
so I'd find tiny, low-key
places like this

902
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,758
so I wouldn't feel like such
a stranger.

903
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,994
It looks like you fit in now.

904
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,563
I'm just a country boy
in a designer suit.

905
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:16,299
And a chauffeur
and over 400 people

906
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:20,103
coming to your wedding!

907
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,205
You know, why don't
we go uptown?

908
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,306
I'll show you Fifth Avenue,

909
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:27,010
and then we have
dinner reservations.

910
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,979
Can I be honest with you?

911
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,215
Fire away.

912
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:35,985
I really appreciate you showing
me all the wonderful things

913
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:40,657
that New York has to offer but
you don't have to impress me.

914
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,660
I'm not trying to impress you.

915
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,296
Well, maybe a little bit.

916
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,665
But it's only because the life
I'm living right now

917
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,902
is what I always dreamed of...

918
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,837
for us.

919
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,310
Ok, you tell me.

920
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:04,247
Where do you want to go?

921
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,451
How about somewhere
where I won't feel like a fool

922
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:12,655
for using the wrong fork?

923
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,791
I know a perfect spot.

924
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,560
No forks required.

925
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:18,595
Come on, let's go.

926
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,563
Ok.

927
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:30,607
Where to?

928
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:34,410
Hector, let's go to Brooklyn.

929
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,179
Yes, sir.

930
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,037
I'm afraid we may be lost.

931
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,839
We're not lost.

932
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,008
I used to live around here.

933
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,910
Fourth story walk-up,
no hot water.

934
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,412
It was all I could afford.

935
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:14,217
See now this is my favourite
part of the tour.

936
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,519
I wanted to see your New York.

937
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,821
Let's go check it out.

938
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,963
Hector, why don't you
grab something to eat?

939
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,531
I'll catch up with you later.

940
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,800
As you wish.

941
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,470
Walk with me?

942
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,372
Sure.

943
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,111
So this is the first place
that I landed after I arrived.

944
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:42,612
Yeah?

945
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:45,915
Yeah.

946
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,351
I loved it.

947
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:52,088
My landlady, Mrs. Pederson,
gave me a break on my rent,

948
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,157
said she believed in me.

949
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,491
Thought I had a future.

950
00:44:56,494 --> 00:45:00,196
How right she was?

951
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,498
So how did you get you

952
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,935
from a four story walk-up
to a penthouse?

953
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,370
Luck.

954
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,938
And a little bit of talent.

955
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,008
Actually, it started
with your dad.

956
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,079
He used to have trouble with
his books and I'd help him out.

957
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,814
You helped my dad?

958
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,749
I mean, he knew his stuff,

959
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,984
he just wasn't great at putting
it on paper

960
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:26,289
and bottom line thinking
came easy to me.

961
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:32,295
So you... you get to New York,
and then what?

962
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,498
I kinda became a gopher
for a Wall Street trader

963
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,637
and he noticed I had a knack for
it and he became my mentor.

964
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,405
I'm pretty lucky.

965
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:43,639
I love what I do,

966
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:51,514
but I work so much that
sometimes I forget to slow down.

967
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,583
Still hungry?

968
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:56,886
As long as it's nothing fancy.

969
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:57,987
See for yourself.

970
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,490
I love pizza.

971
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,057
Yeah?

972
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,058
Yeah.

973
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,060
Can we get two cheese please?

974
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,628
You just wait.

975
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,929
It's the best?

976
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:07,864
My absolute favourite.

977
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,265
Your favourite?

978
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:09,932
Ok.

979
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,601
Hands down.

980
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:12,368
Thank you.

981
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,970
Thank you.

982
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:15,571
There you go.

983
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,039
Yum.

984
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,344
So this is the best pizza
you will ever have.

985
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,012
Really?

986
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:23,646
I promise.

987
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,781
Ok.

988
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,949
Woah, woah, wait.

989
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:28,618
This is how we do it
in Brooklyn.

990
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,254
Ok, you gotta bend it.

991
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,289
Alright.

992
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,261
Yeah, that's good.

993
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:39,629
That is good.

994
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:40,296
Right?

995
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:41,731
Mmmhmm.

996
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,534
Yeah.

997
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,369
You got a little...

998
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:47,503
What?

999
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,675
It's all over me,
isn't it?

1000
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,844
I mean, you know it's great
pizza when you start wearing it.

1001
00:46:56,514 --> 00:47:00,383
And no forks required.

1002
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,452
So have you ever brought
Jovanna here?

1003
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:08,524
This isn't really her style.

1004
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,869
Are you kidding me?

1005
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,871
In the middle of Brooklyn?

1006
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:28,978
This is my favourite part
of town.

1007
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,913
You want a soda?

1008
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,248
Yeah, I would love a soda.

1009
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,717
Thanks.

1010
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,819
Can I get two sodas please?

1011
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,628
That was the best pizza
in the world.

1012
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,831
Sometimes it's good to remember
where you came from.

1013
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:56,172
I haven't been up this late
in ages.

1014
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:17,393
I think this is the most
beautiful place

1015
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,661
in the whole city.

1016
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,598
You know, it's crazy 'cause
I always thought New York City

1017
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,868
was just a bunch
of big buildings.

1018
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,806
This park always reminded me
of Iowa.

1019
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,675
Yeah.

1020
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,278
I can't get over how big
this city feels.

1021
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,513
And if you think about it,

1022
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,649
it's really small in land acres.

1023
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,752
Always thinking like a farmer.

1024
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:44,253
That was meant to be
a compliment.

1025
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:47,590
Mmmhmm.

1026
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:50,960
Yeah, I can see why you
thrived here.

1027
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:53,829
Granby is just too small
for you.

1028
00:48:53,932 --> 00:49:00,569
It had its advantages.

1029
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,638
Ben, this has been...

1030
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,942
it's kinda been perfect,
these past two days.

1031
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,177
Yeah, it has.

1032
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,579
How about dinner tonight?

1033
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:29,665
Hi.

1034
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,500
Come in.

1035
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,207
You look beautiful.

1036
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,477
Just a country girl
in a designer dress.

1037
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,714
Touché.

1038
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:48,851
Ben, this is amazing.

1039
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,453
I really wanted you
to see it.

1040
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,923
It took me a lot of years
to get here.

1041
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,624
You like it?

1042
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:56,292
Do I like it?

1043
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:57,093
Yeah!

1044
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:57,693
Yeah.

1045
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,295
What's not to like?

1046
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,530
Well, Jovanna wants
to redecorate.

1047
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:04,867
She wants a cleaner,
modern look.

1048
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,937
I don't know.

1049
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:11,173
I kinda like it the way it is.

1050
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,541
Make yourself at home.

1051
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,709
I'll get us something to drink.

1052
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,277
Alright.

1053
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,119
Sorry, the piano...

1054
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,021
Please, don't stop.

1055
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:02,992
It's probably the last time
it'll get played, anyway.

1056
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,294
Jovanna wants to get
rid of it.

1057
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,862
Why?

1058
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:09,598
Well, I never have any time
to play

1059
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,201
and it's not in keeping
with her vision.

1060
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,371
Maybe her vision needs
some revision.

1061
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,275
Come on, I'll show
you the terrace.

1062
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:22,344
Ok. Thank you.

1063
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:25,214
I always loved to hear
you play.

1064
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,851
I'd go out on the back porch
and close my eyes,

1065
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,786
get carried away.

1066
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,155
That's why daddy was always
looking for you.

1067
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,230
Ben!

1068
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:50,673
Hey, let's...

1069
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:54,176
let's toast to something.

1070
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,079
Ok.

1071
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:01,851
Here's to our divorce.

1072
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,253
To our divorce.

1073
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:12,428
Ben, this is...
this is incredible.

1074
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,498
Yeah, it is.

1075
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,503
So you're getting your PhD
in agricultural chemistry?

1076
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:21,437
Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:24,340
Well, to gain credibility.

1078
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:25,941
I'm trying to do this study
that could eliminate

1079
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,277
the need for pesticides.

1080
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:28,978
Ambitious.

1081
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,713
Yeah, I know.

1082
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:35,084
That's why it's so hard
to get that grant.

1083
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:39,054
What I'm doing is I'm taking
generations of corn

1084
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:41,524
and planting them
in very alkaline soil.

1085
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:45,427
I'm breeding for pest resistance
and...

1086
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,064
and then I'm taking herbs
that are natural deterrents

1087
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,001
and I'm placing them on
the periphery of the land

1088
00:52:52,103 --> 00:52:56,105
and that eliminates the need
for chemical pesticides.

1089
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,674
That's beautiful.

1090
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:01,210
You know, I'm pretty good
at writing cheques.

1091
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,111
Maybe I could help.

1092
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,746
No, no, no.

1093
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,981
I don't think that would
sit well with Joe.

1094
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:07,082
Or me, you know.

1095
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:10,486
I kinda have to do this
on my own.

1096
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:11,086
Don't worry, though.

1097
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:13,589
I'll get my grant.

1098
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,758
You know, I envy you.

1099
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,259
Why?

1100
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,994
Your passion.

1101
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,729
You're doing something
meaningful.

1102
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,200
Well I think you're doing
ok here, Ben.

1103
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:27,503
All I do is buy and sell things.

1104
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:33,509
At the end of the day it seems
hollow somehow.

1105
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,911
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

1106
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,480
if I stayed in Iowa.

1107
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,158
Ben, don't go there.

1108
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,631
Found out a broken heart
is a great motivator.

1109
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,568
I'm just glad you're back
in my life

1110
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,072
because you remind me
of who I really am.

1111
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:04,940
Or want to be.

1112
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:10,546
I feel like I sacrificed that
to obtain all this.

1113
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,880
Ben.

1114
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:14,550
I'm not back in your life.

1115
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,485
You have Jovanna
and I have Joe

1116
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,088
and as soon as this divorce
is granted

1117
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:26,629
then we need to move on.

1118
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,897
Maybe.

1119
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,698
We...

1120
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,304
Are both marrying other people.

1121
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:40,209
We've chosen our lives.

1122
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,682
This can't happen...

1123
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:50,252
Ben, I'm sorry.

1124
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:51,053
Annie!

1125
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:51,887
Annie!

1126
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,322
Thank you for a lovely evening.

1127
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,056
<i>I had a wonderful day.</i>

1128
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:54,857
Annie.

1129
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,392
<i>Thank you.</i>

1130
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,135
Annie!

1131
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:06,769
Annie, wait.

1132
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:07,970
Let me drive you.

1133
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:08,804
It's ok, Hector.

1134
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:09,838
I'm fine.

1135
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,706
Please, come on.

1136
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,441
Come.

1137
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:55,351
Do you care to talk?

1138
00:55:55,453 --> 00:56:00,389
This is just all so strange.

1139
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,691
I'm guessing you know
our story by now.

1140
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,626
Yeah.

1141
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:07,396
Ben tends to confide in me.

1142
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:10,366
It must be a very confusing
time for both of you.

1143
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:11,166
Yeah, that's the thing.

1144
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,635
It's not supposed
to be confusing.

1145
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:17,539
I'm marrying Joe,
he's marrying Jovanna.

1146
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,174
End of story.

1147
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:22,644
Except seeing each other has
stirred up some old feelings.

1148
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,680
Yeah.

1149
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:27,216
Very old.

1150
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:30,619
I mean, Ben and I
loved each other.

1151
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,521
But that was
once upon a time

1152
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:37,726
and all of this is just pining
for what might have been.

1153
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:39,261
I see.

1154
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,563
I don't know, I think
I should just go home.

1155
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:46,668
This whole charade has
just gotten too difficult.

1156
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:54,443
Do you mind some advice?

1157
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,679
Go ahead.

1158
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:03,018
Do you care about Ben
and his future happiness?

1159
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,153
Yeah.

1160
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,954
I do.

1161
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,524
You see, this charade,

1162
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:12,261
it's also for your
future happiness.

1163
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:13,929
You know, as difficult
as it may be

1164
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:18,066
I think you should just stick
with the plan.

1165
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:21,737
Just stay till Monday.

1166
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,746
I guess.

1167
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:35,851
Everything will work out
just as it's supposed to.

1168
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,854
My dad always said that.

1169
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,662
Annie Hancock, I'm glad
you're staying.

1170
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:47,362
No, no, no.

1171
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:50,365
I got this.

1172
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:53,168
Hector, you're my best friend
in New York,

1173
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,603
you know that?

1174
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,674
Good night.

1175
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,142
Good night.

1176
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,524
Don't lose that girl, Ben.

1177
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:37,713
Hey, I've been calling you
all day.

1178
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,716
I thought you went back
to Granby.

1179
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:43,285
No, I stayed.

1180
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,787
For everybody's sake.

1181
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,223
Hector said you two talked.

1182
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,993
Is everything ok?

1183
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,094
Yeah, yeah.

1184
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,161
I'm fine.

1185
00:58:53,264 --> 00:58:54,429
As far as I'm concerned,

1186
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,098
Monday can't come
fast enough though.

1187
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,535
Look, I get it but I still think
we need to talk about

1188
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:01,436
what happened.

1189
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,771
Nothing happened.

1190
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,039
It's not going to,

1191
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,374
so we don't really need
to talk about anything.

1192
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,776
Annie!

1193
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,511
There you are.

1194
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:10,979
Benny, Benny.

1195
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,684
How was Chicago?

1196
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,185
You're so sweet to ask.

1197
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,253
It was my first magazine cover

1198
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,556
so thankfully everything
went perfectly.

1199
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:21,857
Great.

1200
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,525
You look beautiful.

1201
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:27,930
If everyone could take
their places, please.

1202
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:29,197
That's my cue.

1203
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,399
Ok.

1204
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:31,934
Ladies, if you would assemble
at the foot of the aisle.

1205
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:34,436
Gentlemen, if you would
stand to my left.

1206
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,246
And proceed once you're ready.

1207
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:48,050
Now, tomorrow when all the
guests are here at this point

1208
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:51,119
everyone will stand
as the bride enters.

1209
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,696
And as the bride and her
father approach,

1210
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,130
he gives her away.

1211
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:11,773
And Ben if you take Jovanna's
hand and face each other.

1212
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:15,644
And here I'll say a few words
about the happy couple.

1213
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:18,180
At which point where
you exchange your vows...

1214
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:27,689
Finally I will pronounce you
husband and wife.

1215
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,434
Hey, Joe.

1216
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,937
<i>Hey, listen Annie,
I've got bad news.</i>

1217
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,839
<i>There's a really big storm
heading our way.</i>

1218
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:45,574
How bad is it?

1219
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:48,710
Well, if the river rises
we could lose the crops.

1220
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,981
Ok, well, I'll just...
I'll be home as soon as I can.

1221
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,783
Yeah, ok.

1222
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,987
Annie, everything ok?

1223
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,556
Yeah, there's
a big storm coming,

1224
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,593
the crops are in danger of
flooding so I have to go home.

1225
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,662
What about Monday?

1226
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:07,262
I don't know.

1227
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,163
I don't know.

1228
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,465
Tony will figure out something.

1229
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:13,669
All of the corn crops in
my study, they could be gone.

1230
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:17,839
I mean, everything
that I worked so hard for.

1231
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,275
What about your wedding?

1232
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:21,743
I'm just going to have to try
to make Joe understand

1233
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:25,614
and hopefully he'll forgive me
for lying.

1234
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:29,418
Just have Tony send me the
papers whenever they're settled.

1235
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:35,424
Goodbye, Ben.

1236
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,392
Annie...

1237
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,828
Just, please, don't.

1238
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:48,937
The runaway groom.

1239
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,906
What happened to you two?

1240
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:51,940
Where's Annie running off to?

1241
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,809
Is everything alright?

1242
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,646
No, Jovanna, it's not.

1243
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,884
You and I need to talk.

1244
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:37,686
Thank you.

1245
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,511
Morning.

1246
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,846
Morning.

1247
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:07,816
It's a beautiful sunrise,
isn't it, honey?

1248
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:08,984
Yeah, that was quite the storm.

1249
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:12,120
I think we saved
most of the crops though.

1250
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,159
We still haven't talked
about what happened.

1251
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:20,262
That's because nothing
happened.

1252
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:23,465
Just a bunch of reminiscing.

1253
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:27,135
Well, anytime you want to talk
about nothing happened,

1254
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:30,105
I'm always here for you.

1255
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:33,341
Thanks, mom.

1256
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,977
Any news?

1257
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,679
No.

1258
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:41,783
Community is taking
too long to deliberate.

1259
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:44,419
I don't think I'm gonna get
my grant.

1260
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,721
Well, you've gotta hang
in there, honey.

1261
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:51,059
I'm just trying to do some good,
you know?

1262
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,361
You have done plenty of good.

1263
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,463
You've kept this farm
from going under.

1264
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:58,333
Mom, we're barely making
our quota.

1265
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,970
Did you know that your dad
almost lost this farm twice?

1266
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,371
What?

1267
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:07,776
He wasn't good at handling
the pressure or the money.

1268
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:09,411
He always wanted to work
the land,

1269
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,946
not the books.

1270
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:13,849
Ben was a big help.

1271
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,384
You knew about that?

1272
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,286
He didn't know that I knew.

1273
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:20,388
I kept it that way.

1274
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,192
Your dad was a proud man.

1275
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:27,829
I always thought
he was so in control.

1276
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,433
Girls always like to think
of their daddy that way.

1277
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:34,236
Yeah.

1278
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:39,674
Well, I gotta get to work.

1279
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:42,077
Don't worry, everything's gonna
work out.

1280
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,712
As it's supposed to.

1281
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:45,313
I know.

1282
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:47,315
Like dad always said.

1283
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,787
Any other rabbits to pull
out of your hat?

1284
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,256
I'm working on it.

1285
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,067
Good morning, your honour.

1286
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,369
Where is Miss Hancock?

1287
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,603
I specifically asked that
both of your clients

1288
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:09,738
be here this morning.

1289
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,172
Well, your honour,
it's complicated.

1290
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:14,943
Your honour, Miss Hancock
had to go back to Iowa

1291
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:17,345
for an emergency.

1292
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:22,150
If I could just plead our case.

1293
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,921
I'm not planning on getting
married anytime soon,

1294
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:28,089
but I'm begging the court
to expedite the divorce

1295
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:31,893
so Annie can marry her fiancé.

1296
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:36,231
She deserves to be happy.

1297
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,801
Regardless of your heartfelt
plea on her behalf,

1298
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,970
I'm afraid I can't grant
a divorce at this time

1299
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:45,106
without hearing
from the other party.

1300
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:45,907
Next case.

1301
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:46,474
Your honour...

1302
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:48,076
I've already ruled.

1303
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,210
We're done.

1304
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,195
It was a nice speech.

1305
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,596
I almost believed it.

1306
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:10,231
I want Annie to be happy.

1307
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:11,466
I believe that part.

1308
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,902
Just not about marrying Joe.

1309
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:38,660
Hey.

1310
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:41,029
Hey.

1311
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,164
The stars are so bright tonight.

1312
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,667
Nice and clear after the storm.

1313
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:49,938
Annie, I...

1314
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,774
I got something I'd like to say.

1315
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:55,443
But first off I'm so glad
you're back.

1316
01:06:55,545 --> 01:07:00,949
You could have told me

1317
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:05,120
you and Ben were married
all those years ago.

1318
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,525
I'm sorry.

1319
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:14,629
I just-I didn't know how.

1320
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:17,132
I want you to know I don't mind
waiting for the divorce

1321
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:21,202
to come through.

1322
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:24,839
I'm just glad that we're back
in sync again.

1323
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:28,109
You and I, we're like
a well-oiled machine,

1324
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:32,280
you know?

1325
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,450
You know what I mean?

1326
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,619
Not really.

1327
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:43,291
We plant, we harvest,
we get the job done.

1328
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:50,799
Look Joe...

1329
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,807
I don't want to be part of
a well-oiled machine.

1330
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,810
It's just a turn-of-phrase,
Annie.

1331
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,417
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me

1332
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,755
over the years, but that,
that's gratitude.

1333
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:15,757
That's the kind of love you
have towards a friend,

1334
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:19,928
not the kind of love you build
a marriage on.

1335
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,097
Like you and Ben.

1336
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,099
You know, I can't compete
with a ghost, Annie.

1337
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:25,934
It's not about me and Ben.

1338
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,102
You sure about that?

1339
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:30,939
Maybe.

1340
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,208
I don't know.

1341
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:38,346
It doesn't matter,
he's with Jovanna now.

1342
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:45,987
Joe... this, this is
about you and me.

1343
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:00,502
Well, I guess a two-year
engagement

1344
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:04,506
should have given me
a clue.

1345
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:05,340
Where are you going?

1346
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:08,343
I have no idea.

1347
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,645
Don't you dare
go out of my life.

1348
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,914
I can't.

1349
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:15,083
There's too much work to do.

1350
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:44,913
That's a lovely piece.

1351
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:54,455
I was just wrestling
with a few things.

1352
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:56,124
Have you spoken with her?

1353
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:58,259
Jovanna will never
speak to me again.

1354
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,928
I embarrassed her.

1355
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,931
She wants nothing to do
with me.

1356
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:08,803
I meant Annie.

1357
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:11,005
I've picked up the phone
a dozen times,

1358
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:12,740
but what would I say?

1359
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,776
She's made it very clear
that she wants the past

1360
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:18,413
to stay in the past.

1361
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,982
I have a confession to make,
sir.

1362
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,351
I grew very fond of Annie
when she was here

1363
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:26,354
so I've checked in a few times.

1364
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:27,021
Is she alright?

1365
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:28,122
What did she say?

1366
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:29,190
She's in a bit of a bind.

1367
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,426
She didn't get her funding.

1368
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:33,428
She must be devastated.

1369
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,429
Perhaps.

1370
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,264
She's a resilient woman.

1371
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:41,169
However, I thought that it
might present an opportunity.

1372
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:44,539
I've offered her money,
she turned me down.

1373
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:47,008
I've never known you to take no
for an answer.

1374
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,910
I don't want to insult her.

1375
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,878
I'm sure you'll find
a graceful way

1376
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:55,316
to part with your money.

1377
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,218
Maybe so.

1378
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,924
Hector, where would I be
without you?

1379
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,927
Stuck in your penthouse

1380
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:08,129
when you should be in Iowa.

1381
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:19,841
Mud.

1382
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,778
What a way to lose a grant.

1383
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,446
How're you doing?

1384
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:27,315
Hey.

1385
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,217
I'm fine.

1386
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:32,620
Nothing a little moody walk
in the field can't fix.

1387
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,155
I'm so sorry, Annie.

1388
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,057
It's ok.

1389
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,593
They were worried that
the flood might compromise

1390
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:43,097
my study but I don't know,
I just think it still worked.

1391
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,565
You did your best.

1392
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:45,867
I'm proud of you.

1393
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,036
Thanks.

1394
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,371
I'm sorry about you and Joe.

1395
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,641
He seems to be doing ok.

1396
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:57,478
I hope so.

1397
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,783
I think you did the right thing.

1398
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:03,951
You just didn't have
that spark.

1399
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:08,623
Or whatever it was your dad
and I had.

1400
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:11,359
It's times like this
when I miss him the most.

1401
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:13,761
Yeah.

1402
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,264
Me too, mom.

1403
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:19,033
Me too.

1404
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,602
Let's hope for a great
harvest tomorrow.

1405
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:24,766
<i>Annie?</i>

1406
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:27,535
Yeah.

1407
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:30,438
Annie?

1408
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:30,972
Yeah.

1409
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,176
Everyone's here to start
the harvest.

1410
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:35,710
You alright?

1411
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:37,912
Yeah. Fine.

1412
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:38,880
Shoes.

1413
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:39,747
See you downstairs.

1414
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,082
Ok.

1415
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,843
Sir, I've got the numbers
on that deal.

1416
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,312
Should we move on this
before the close?

1417
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,613
Tracy, I'm running late.

1418
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:14,615
You decide.

1419
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,484
Sir?

1420
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:18,586
Where's he going in such
a rush?

1421
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,354
I have no idea.

1422
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,861
I just got an update,
flight's right on schedule.

1423
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,496
You're sure you want me
to come with you?

1424
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:29,497
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1425
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:30,731
This'll be quite an
adventure for me,

1426
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,500
I've never visited the mid-west.

1427
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:33,601
You're gonna love it.

1428
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:36,103
If Annie's any indication,
I'm certain I will.

1429
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:39,474
They say you never go home
again, but here I go.

1430
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,847
Twelve hour day?

1431
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:47,982
Thanks so much
for your hard work.

1432
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:52,720
Alright everybody, so
it is my pleasure to tell you

1433
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:56,591
that even with the flooded
fields we made our quota!

1434
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:59,060
Whooo!

1435
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:01,629
Thank you so much, guys.

1436
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,297
So go out tonight, go to
the harvest festival,

1437
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:03,931
have a good time.

1438
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,066
Y'all earned it, alright?

1439
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:06,667
There's some water right
over there by the barn

1440
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:07,568
if you guys want it.

1441
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,469
Thank you.

1442
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,471
Thank you.

1443
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:11,239
It was a tough one.

1444
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,642
You did it again.

1445
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,644
We did it again.

1446
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,057
You better go get cleaned up.

1447
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,894
Do your hair and
all that fun stuff.

1448
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,962
I was thinking of wearing
my pink dress.

1449
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:38,966
Mom, I'm not gonna go
to the harvest festival.

1450
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:41,135
It's always been your favourite
night of the year.

1451
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:46,707
I know, but I just can't really
see myself dancing right now.

1452
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:49,710
I know things have been tough
lately, but trust me.

1453
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,547
Dancing is exactly
what you need.

1454
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:58,920
McAllister.

1455
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:01,923
Yeah.

1456
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,225
Really?

1457
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:06,661
So it's official?

1458
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:08,596
Thank you.

1459
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:09,597
Yes!

1460
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,631
I rock!

1461
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,133
Tracy, find Ben!

1462
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,101
It's urgent, urgent good.

1463
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,803
He is gonna be happy.

1464
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:19,907
<i>I'm glad you came, Annie.</i>

1465
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,176
Dancing is fun.

1466
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:23,144
I know.

1467
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,312
Come on.

1468
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,586
Annie, come on.

1469
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,087
Let's have some fun.

1470
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,022
Come on.

1471
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:38,626
Look, it's Marla, hi.

1472
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:39,827
<i>Hey.</i>

1473
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,596
So nice to see you.

1474
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,164
Are you having fun?

1475
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:43,831
Good to see you.

1476
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:44,966
Well, well...

1477
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,248
Welcome to Granby.

1478
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:04,418
Are you kidding me?

1479
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,253
Nice to see you, too.

1480
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:09,090
What are you doing here,
Ben?

1481
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:09,657
No, you know what?

1482
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,325
I don't even care.

1483
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:12,159
You know what I wanna do?

1484
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,261
I want to pop you
in the mouth.

1485
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:17,832
But I won't, because I want
Annie to be happy.

1486
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:20,167
What do you mean?

1487
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:23,337
Wait, you don't know?

1488
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,206
What?

1489
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,175
We broke up.

1490
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,578
Joe, I'm sorry.

1491
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,213
No, no you're not.

1492
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,889
I'd say we arrived
right on time.

1493
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,820
Going to be fun.

1494
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:21,662
Excuse me, do you know that
song, "Forever Love"?

1495
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,432
Would you mind playing it?

1496
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,205
What are you doing here?

1497
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:09,276
Dancing with the love
of my life.

1498
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:13,214
What about Jovanna?

1499
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:16,117
We broke up.

1500
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:23,057
Joe and I... we...

1501
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,593
I know.

1502
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:34,401
Hi.

1503
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:36,303
Hi.

1504
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,117
Hey, Joe.

1505
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,852
Hey, Mary-Jane.

1506
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:53,687
Lou.

1507
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,624
Mary-Lou.

1508
01:19:56,726 --> 01:20:01,996
You look nice.

1509
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:05,533
When Annie's all out of
your system,

1510
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:08,102
look me up.

1511
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,979
Can we talk outside?

1512
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,864
Why didn't you call?

1513
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:38,299
You were with Joe.

1514
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:41,101
Well then why did you come?

1515
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:43,237
I heard you didn't get
the grant.

1516
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,472
I wanted to give you the money.

1517
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:47,241
Ben, I don't need saving.

1518
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,777
Maybe I do.

1519
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:53,914
I'm tired of buying and selling
and padding my own pocket.

1520
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:56,684
I want to do something
that matters.

1521
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:58,485
It's a grant.

1522
01:20:58,588 --> 01:21:02,022
From the "I believe in you"
foundation.

1523
01:21:02,124 --> 01:21:04,925
You can pay me back
after you save the world.

1524
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,794
Every penny.

1525
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,467
Ben!

1526
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,404
How did you find me?

1527
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,540
Tracy tracked you down.

1528
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:22,176
I finally got the judge
to sign off.

1529
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,349
You two sign on the dotted line
and you are officially divorced

1530
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:32,052
and free to marry whomever
whenever you want.

1531
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,629
What-what're you doing?

1532
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:42,897
Sorry.

1533
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,431
What did I miss?

1534
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:53,073
Miss Annie Hancock,
will you marry me again?

1535
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:54,942
Yes! Yes!

1536
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,282
I guess I missed a lot.

1537
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,729
True love never dies.

1538
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,499
Sometimes it just takes
a 15-year detour.

1539
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:30,811
Annie, with this ring
I thee wed.

1540
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:44,024
Ben, with this ring
I thee wed.

1541
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,728
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1542
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,863
You may now kiss the bride.

1543
01:22:53,753 --> 01:22:57,253
