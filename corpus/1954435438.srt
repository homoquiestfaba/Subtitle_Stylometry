MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:29,295
let me ask you a very
important question.

3
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,731
Are you ready to pass judgment
on one of your peers?

4
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:36,736
And today, you must do what you
think is right to find true justice.

5
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,839
Now, the prosecution has painted
a picture of my client,

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,875
and they've told some very
very interesting stories.

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:48,581
But I'm not here to paint any pictures
and I'm not here to tell you any stories.

8
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,619
Because my client is not made of canvas,
and my client is not made of paper.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,757
He is made of flesh and blood.
And he has a heart and he has a soul.

10
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:00,827
And right now he has a future.

11
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,596
You have the power
to change all of that,

12
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,898
so what I need you to do
is I need you to be strong,

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,735
to feel with your heart,

14
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,572
to feel with your soul
and to do what's right.

15
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:17,542
Not what's popular, but what is good.

16
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,914
His life...

17
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,452
His life is what's on the
line here. He's innocent.

166
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,128
I am Jaxon Stone and
I am your attorney.

167
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,465
First of all, anything you tell me is
covered under attorney-client privilege,

168
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,036
meaning that nothing we talk about
can go further than this room

169
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:41,040
and it's not admissible in court.
Do you understand? Okay?

170
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,342
Now let's start off
with a few basics.

171
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,879
Um, what is your official
birth name for the record?

172
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,846
I didn't hire an attorney.

173
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,319
Okay, Mr. Torres, you don't
know me, I don't know you,

174
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,921
but let's come to some sort
of agreement here, okay?

175
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,256
I'm pleading guilty.

176
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,227
Your sister hired me to help you out,
to keep the needle out of your arm.

177
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:05,931
I'm good. That's what I do.
I need you to trust me.

178
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,934
Now... let's talk about
the night of the murder.

179
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,936
Can you tell me exactly
what happened?

180
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,638
I killed a man with these hands.

181
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,941
If that's the case, we need
to talk about a plea deal.

182
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:20,511
Can maybe get you 15...
I don't know maybe even 12 years.

183
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,880
Are you listening?

184
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,320
- All right.
- Hey, guard? I'm done.

185
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,689
I'm pleading guilty.
That's all you need to know.

186
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,628
Your brother's not
telling me anything.

187
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,063
I mean, he's knows I'm
here to help him, right?

188
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,966
Sometimes he can
be a little difficult.

189
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,936
Difficult I get.
Difficult I even understand.

190
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,473
But what I don't understand is why a
guy that I'm trying to get out of jail

191
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,642
is withholding crucial information.
I'm on his team.

192
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,712
Look, I don't know.

193
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,416
If he doesn't help me,
I'm gonna have to dig up

194
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,120
the information by myself
and build a case without him.

195
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,056
- Got it.
- Let me tell both of you guys...

196
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,661
we've got a lot of work ahead of us.
I mean, this is some serious shit.

197
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,429
You have to have a plan or
something though, right?

198
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,632
Yeah, of course I've got a plan.
We're gonna review the documentation.

199
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,401
I'm gonna talk to some people
that know your brother,

200
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,403
talk to some people
that knew the victim,

201
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,706
find out some information on the wife
and we're gonna prepare for trial.

202
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,274
Okay, we're gonna
get your brother out.

203
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,313
I'm here to help, okay?
Maybe you can talk to him.

204
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,747
All right.

205
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,185
I should really head back.

206
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,289
I mean, you don't have to head back.

207
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,691
Why do you want to leave?
Why don't you...

208
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,125
- Wanna just hang for a little bit?
- Look, I just...

209
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,462
I just need some time to think, and you
should really get to work, anyway, so...

210
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,431
All right.

211
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,034
I'll talk to my brother. I'll get
you an update in a couple of days.

212
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,201
Okay. That'll work.

213
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,341
- (PHONE RINGS)
- WOMAN: Mr. Vincent De La Cruz

214
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,643
is insisting on meeting
with you today.

215
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,944
Yeah, thanks.

216
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,149
Gentlemen, come on in.

217
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,086
What's good? Mr. Stone,
Mr. Vincent De La Cruz.

218
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,454
- Mr. De La Cruz.
- Salvadore.

219
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,557
Salvadore, you wanna
pull up that chair?

220
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:16,128
Okay, standing is fine. What can
I help you fine gentlemen with?

221
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,098
I need an attorney for a civil case.

222
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,066
What... what kind of case
are we talking about?

223
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,069
I wanna sue a gun shop.

224
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,339
- Okay. For what?
- Negligence.

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,740
What kind of negligence?

226
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,713
Recently, I lost a son,
and he bought the gun

227
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,583
from Mountain sport.

228
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,785
(STAMMERS)

229
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,487
I'm sorry for the loss of your child.

230
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,489
I know that's tough,
but I have to tell you...

231
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,291
negligence is something
that's very hard to prove.

232
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:50,062
- My sources tell me that...
- Your sources?

233
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:54,633
That's correct. The owner of the gun shop
is notorious for not following protocol.

234
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,802
Didn't follow the proper protocol?

235
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,204
Well, he just sells guns
straight out the back.

236
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,608
Okay, well, Mr. De La Cruz,
why don't we get started with

237
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,643
what exactly is it that
you do for a living?

238
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,680
I own a chain of jewelers.
You might've seen one down on Olympia.

239
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,285
Yeah, I'm familiar with one or two
of those. Are they both you guys?

240
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,621
All right, well, um, I don't
have to tell you then,

241
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,591
you know there's a cost, obviously, to run
a business, and that's what I'm doing here.

242
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:24,129
So, you know, a case like this could
get really expensive and fast.

243
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,648
What do you estimate?

244
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,168
I'd say 75 to 100
grand for a retainer.

245
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,570
I think we have a good case.

246
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:35,240
And that's just getting us started.
550 an hour is my billing rate.

247
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,143
So, just wanna let you know.

248
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,778
Can I borrow your pen?

249
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,549
Yes, you can. You can keep the pen.

250
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,285
I presume we can get started today.

251
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,188
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

252
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,492
I don't like wasting people's time.
I don't like my time being wasted.

253
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:59,331
All right. I think we can make this happen.
I've just got one more question.

254
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,267
A guy like you could obviously
afford any attorney he wants.

255
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,870
- Why me?
- Quite simple.

256
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,673
My sources tell me you're
the best in this field.

257
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:11,942
- Oh, I don't know about the best...
- I only hire the best.

258
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,247
WOMAN: I was just bumped up
to felony division last month.

259
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,851
- JAXON: Lisa, congratulations.
- Rios assigned it to me this morning.

260
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,386
You've never handled a
first-degree murder case before.

261
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,322
Well, Jaxon, there's a
first time for everything.

262
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,325
Are you sure that you wanna
dance with me on this one?

263
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,894
(SCOFFS)
I think the real question here is

264
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,430
are you ready to put
one in your "L" column?

265
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,234
- This is a clear-cut case.
- Okay. Let's talk about a deal.

266
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,437
- 30.
- 30? Whoa, whoa, you're dreaming.

267
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,805
- 15.
- I'll take your 15. You've got a deal.

268
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,543
Jaxon.

269
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,147
Walter. It's good to see you, buddy.
Listen, I need a huge favor, okay?

270
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,315
I have a piece of paper to give you.

271
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,351
All right, all right, all right.

272
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,487
I'll call Kelly at the clerk of courts
right away, see what I can do, okay?

273
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,855
All right. Thank you.

274
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,836
- Mr. Stone, can we have a chat?
- (SIGHS)

275
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,939
- I insist.
- Okay, sir, but...

276
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,906
Get in.

277
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,413
- (SIGHS)
- So where are you headed?

278
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,849
I'm actually going to the
courthouse right up the road, sir.

279
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,218
You got that, Salvadore?

280
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,754
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

281

(DOORS LOCK)

282
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,329
So where have you got to on my case?

283
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,932
Well, sir, I was actually gonna have
my assistant call you tomorrow.

284
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,834
You know, there's some information
we need to find out like, uh...

285
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,503
Well, maybe I'll make
another appointment

286
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,705
and bring you up to speed
with all the details.

287
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,942
You're just probably overwhelmed
the first time we met.

288
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,812
Yes sir, and I'm sorry about that. You see,
I'm trying a big murder case right now,

289
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:57,382
and we've got a lot of other things
going on. You know how it is, just...

290
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,419
my son's been murdered
by his wife's lover.

291
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,323
Now I'm hearing that you intend

292
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,725
to take the case and represent him.

293
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,728
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, your son...

294
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,998
are you trying to tell me that
your son is Alberto Lopez?

295
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,234
One step behind,
aren't you, counselor?

296
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,836
Okay, well, sir,
then we've got a big problem,

297
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:23,375
because I can't represent you and Ms.
Torres at the same time. You know that.

298
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,912
Well, a well-prepared man
is always two steps ahead.

299
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,214
I think you should read this.
It might be of interest.

300
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:39,456
- You're waiving conflict of interest.
- Exactly.

301
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,694
Okay, well, you know what?
Let's make this simple.

302
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:46,263
I don't accept. Can you open
the door for me please?

303
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:53,503
- Look, sir...
- No, you look, sir.

304
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,308
It's come to my
attention that you plan

305
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,811
on taking a plea for Torres
and that is unacceptable.

306
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,014
What?

307
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,982
I think you're still messed up

308
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:07,886
with seeing Mr. Harper take
his own life in front of you.

309
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,389
Okay, look, Mr. Harper has
nothing to do with this.

310
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,359
And second, we are taking the plea,
so let's just let things happen.

311
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,829
No. He's interrupted my bloodline
and that's unacceptable.

312
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,631
I wanna meet him in person.

313
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,567
Okay, so what,
you want me to defend him,

314
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,536
set him free and then what?
Deliver him to you?

315
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,671
Yeah, and I'll handle the rest.

316
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,410
Okay, and what if I refuse?
What if I say no?

317

If you refuse? (LAUGHS)

318

- I'm not a murderer. Fuck no.
- Well, that's easy. Two choices...

your law license or your life.

let's get this straight.

321
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:51,096
We're both on the road to justice.
I suggest we try and meet in the middle.

322

- What do you say? Huh?
- Do I have a choice?

323
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:58,570

We're done here.

Mr. Torres, do you speak English?

When you're asked a question in my
courtroom, the response is "yes sir,"

333

or "no sir," or "yes, your honor"
or "no, your honor."

334
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,973
- Understood?
- Yes sir. I speak English.

00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:39,977

need to appoint one for you?

You can appoint me.

You are charged with murder in the

it noted for the record,

- Excellent.

in the arrest affidavit,

rape and homicide.

433

And when you arrived, did you
make contact with anyone?

00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,195
- (SIREN BLARING)
- TUCKER: Yes, there was a deceased adult male

435
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,363
and a distressed adult female.

436
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,767
LISA: Did you ascertain the
identity of these individuals?

437
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:39,904
TUCKER: The female was Selena Lopez,
and the male was Alberto Lopez.

438
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,074
Can you describe
Mrs. Lopez's demeanor?

439
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:48,079
The female was wrapped in a blanket,
laying in the fetal position on her couch.

440
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,382
- Was she injured?
- She had bruising on her face,

441
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,186
which appeared recent.
She was very upset as well.

442
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,922
Did you speak with this Mrs. Lopez?

443
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,192
- (WHISPERING)
- Yes, the victim said that her neighbor Juan

444
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,828
broke into her place,
physically assaulted her,

445
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,331
raped her, stole her
wallet, her rings,

446
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,666
and shot her husband when
he caught him raping her.

447
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,505
Thank you. No further questions.

00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,006
Your witness, Mr. Stone.

449
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:19,511
Officer Tucker, you did not process

450
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:23,221
- the alleged crime scene, did you?
- No.

451
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:27,552
So it's safe to say that you are not an
investigator, are you, officer Tucker?

452
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,987
No.

453
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,823
Well, what about the
bruising you said you saw?

454
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,025
Do you know exactly
when that happened?

455
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:38,029
- They were recent.
- Officer, that is not what I asked you.

456
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,720
I said, do you know exactly
when that happened?

457
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:44,836
- An exact time? No.
- Well, what about some pictures?

458
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,907
Do you have pictures of these so-called
bruises that the jury can see?

459
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,164
Pictures? I didn't take any pictures.

460
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:54,145
You didn't take any pictures
of the bruises. Okay.

461
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,581
Well, what about the
alleged point of entry?

462
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,017
Obviously, you took
pictures of those, correct?

463
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,020
- No.
- You were the first law enforcement agent

464

to arrive on the scene at the first
point in time after the alleged crime.

465

Yet you're telling me that
these fine people here

466
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:15,734
have no evidence other than your
word so they can make their decision.

467
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:19,137
- Is that correct?
- Yeah, I... I guess so.

468
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,841
Officer Tucker, do you
believe that the truth today

469
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:26,945
- is the same that it was yesterday?
- Objection. Badgering.

470
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,948
- Sustained.
- JAXON: Officer Tucker,

471
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:34,117
you did write a report
in this case, right?

472
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:37,155
I see that you have
it in front of you.

473
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,924
Can you do me a favor?
Can you look at it and...

474
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,461
Find the place where you
talked about the bruises?

475
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,500
It's not there.

476
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,915
Are you sure it's not there?
You wanna take another look?

477
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:56,975
- It's not there.
- Is it not there because it disappeared,

478
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,846
or is it not there because
it never existed?

479
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:02,413
- Sergeant Smith...
- Sergeant Smith is not here,

480
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,983
Sergeant Smith is not on the stand,

481
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:09,287
and Sergeant Smith was not there
when you saw what you said you did.

482
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,989
Officer Tucker, I wanna ask
you one final question.

483
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,097
Were you suspended for falsifying
evidence during your training?

484
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:21,466
- Hey, wait a minute... that's sealed!
- Objection.

485
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,335
Your honor, officer Tucker

you one more time, officer Tucker.

identification of the perpetrator,

Sergeant Smith and myself
traveled to 1148 Pierce Street.

While at that location, we made
contact with an individual

687
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,758
who identified himself
as Juan Torres.

688
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,794

in the courtroom today?

Yes, I do.

Can you please identify
him for the record?

He is the individual

00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,976
It will so reflect.

695
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,868
Sergeant, when you contacted
the defendant, did you search

696
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,217
- his person and his residence?
- Yes, I did.

697
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:03,221
And before you made contact with the
defendant, did the victim, Mrs. Lopez,

698
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:06,957
identify any missing items that were
forcibly removed from her home?

699
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,728
Yes, it was reported to us by the
victim that a number of items

700
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:15,232
had been taken... a couple of
rings, a knife and a wallet...

701
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,269
the knife, more specifically,
being the knife that was held to her

702
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:20,904
during the time of the crime.
That was taken as well.

703
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,307
And did you ever recover
any of these items?

704
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,775
Yes, I did.

705
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:29,569
Upon searching him, I found
two rings and a pocket knife,

706
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:34,316
both of which were consistent with the
victim's statement as to what was taken.

707
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,243
And upon searching the defendant's
bedroom, we found a wallet.

708
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:43,193
The contents of this wallet contained
the victim's personal identification.

709
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:46,463
So it was at that time that
we placed him under arrest

710

and transported him to the
law enforcement center.

made it through the
alleged point of entry,

720
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,843
especially considering that
alleged point of entry

721
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:39,183
was a 9x16 hole next to a window
with an air conditioning unit in it.

722
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,951
Now, Detective Pritchard,

723
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:45,322
was that air conditioning unit still
in the window when you arrived?

724
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,357
- Yes, it was.
- It was.

725
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,129
And, um, had anyone called and,
you know, complained and said

726
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,566
the air conditioner had been
stolen or maybe removed?

727
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:59,136
- Not to the best of my knowledge, no.
- Not to the best of your knowledge, no.

theory that my client...

a six-foot, 225-lb grown man...

730
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:13,350
fit through a 9x16 hole. Now how
do you think that's possible?

Okay. There was no blood that
was found in the bed either.

Now if you had been cut, or he
put a knife up to your throat,

898

wouldn't there be some blood that
was found in the bed, Mrs. Lopez?

899

How is it that if he put the
knife up to your throat,

900
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:45,183
and it didn't scratch you,
it didn't cut you,

- how is it that you woke up?
- I'm a light sleeper.

902
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,976
So you expect this jury to believe
that you're such a light sleeper

00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:57,614
that you slept through an intruder
trying to break in to your home,

904

but when a guy gets close to you,

905
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,020
puts a knife up to your throat
that doesn't cause a scratch,

906
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:08,758
that doesn't draw any blood
or anything you just woke up?

907
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,695
- Where was your wallet, Mrs. Lopez?
- I don't remember.

I don't remember.

910
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:22,171
Then why is it that he only took...
one diamond earring?

00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,255
With all that jewelry,
all that money, why not take more?

Why weren't there any signs of
trauma found on the rape kit?

914
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,248
I don't know.

915
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,754
It sounds to me like a story...

916
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,089
from a woman without a way out.

917
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,423
Mrs. Lopez...

918
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,829
It's gotta be tough
to stay that strong.

919

It's gotta be tough to wake up every
morning and to lie to yourself,

920

to tell yourself that it's gonna be okay,
things are gonna be all right.

921
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:58,107
The truth is, Mrs. Lopez,
your husband beat on you.

922
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:03,012
Your husband physically and mentally
abused you over and over and over again.

923

And every day you
woke up, you took it.

- Am I correct?
- No.

925
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,303
So your husband never
laid a hand on you?

926
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:12,161
- He never physically abused you?
- Never.

927
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:15,893
Did your husband
physically abuse you?

00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:17,559
Never.

that on June 22nd

husband had assaulted you...

933
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:42,284
hit you in the head, kicked you in
the stomach and used deadly force?

- JAXON: Your husband beat you.

935
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:48,224
He abused you. He raped
you over and over.

00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:53,628
He went in night after night and you
had no choice but to give it to him!

937
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:59,102
You killed your husband.
You were trying to protect yourself.

to fight it anymore.

You did what you had to do.

940
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:09,912
And now you have to do something
else, you have to tell the truth.

You have to, so my client...

942
