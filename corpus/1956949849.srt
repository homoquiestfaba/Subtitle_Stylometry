1
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,200
Carol Glackman.

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,500
Happened just last night.

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,840
- An autopsy was performed?
- Yes.

4
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,990
Tiffany Lee, two weeks ago.

5
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,950
Same as the other one?

6
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,600
Yep, stabbed and
dumped in an alley.

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,000
I suppose we should
make arrangements

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,560
for a memorial service.

9
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,860
Oh, yes, of course.

10
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,640
You know, this makes two.

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,510
Either we shut down campus.

12
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:26,050
Do we refund 15,000 tuitions?

13
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,080
Living on an urban campus
presents all kinds of dangers.

14
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,890
The police are on top of it,
we'll beef up our own security,

15
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,060
put the campus on high alert.

16
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,050
These are sex crimes--

17
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,640
these girls were raped!

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,280
And it makes me sick.

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,630
I swear I've lived in this
city for over 20 years, Jack,

20
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,040
and I'm still shocked at what
some people are capable of.

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,410
The macroeconomic
models are developed

22
00:02:52,410 --> 00:03:00,570
from N, output, I,
interest rates, T,

23
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,340
prices, and F, inflation.

24
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,660
And of course, there are
other variables, as well.

25
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,880
There are trade
deficits, and surpluses--

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,370
I hate this fucking class.

27
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,650
Professor's such a faggot.

28
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,650
Yeah?

29
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,770
I thought you said
he was Indian.

30
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,270
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,990
Right out of his face.

32
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,600
A plus.

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
You get those handouts
from last week?

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,890
I think I lost mine.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,680
Hey, you're still
playing afterwards, right?

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,830
You know it.

37
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,930
Geez, man, it's hot in here.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Whatever, man, you're just
trying to get extra credit.

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,530
Wherever I can get it, man.

40
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,740
Wherever I can get it.

41
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,510
Value of the parcel
to the purchaser

42
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,370
is reflected on this line,
T, F, with the relative point

43
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,810
being B. So the monetary value
would drop to an I negatives 0.

44
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,460
When we follow through
on this function,

45
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,710
we're going to discover
that risk-averse

46
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,590
people actually will buy
risky assets, if they are--

47
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,290
Card please.

48
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,110
Now, pick nine cards
with your left hand.

49
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,000
Three for the past,
three for the present,

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,330
three for the future.

51
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,690
You are familiar with the Tao?

52
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,360
The basics.

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,550
Let's start with the past.

54
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,310
The influx of human life.

55
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,730
Here is something you
hear about your parents--

56
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,800
it's hard to see.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,090
A-- a misfortune, perhaps?

58
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,060
They died when I was young.

59
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,580
Oh, but have a great male
influence in your life.

60
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,280
A-- a brother, or an uncle.

61
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,380
My brother, Cassidy.

62
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,390
We're very close.

63
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,210
He lives in the
house of falsehood.

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,410
Now, I want you to
pick four cards.

65
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,930
An unwanted inheritance,
an unexpected transmission.

66
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,680
I see an emerging acquaintance--

67
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,660
but there's a dark
shadow across it.

68
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,140
A line meaning, be wary.

69
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:24,600
Perhaps we can see a result.

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,110
Oh, god.

71
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,550
Oh, don't worry--

72
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,280
it doesn't necessarily
have to mean death,

73
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,250
even if it is the last card.

74
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,370
It's maybe a transformation of
some kind, or even a rebirth.

75
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,300
Well, I'm afraid I have
to see my next guest.

76
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,670
Afternoon rush.

77
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,050
Sure.

78
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,370
Everything's going to be fine.

79
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,820
Got ya.

80
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,520
Ah.

81
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,500
Did you think I
was a psycho killer?

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,570
Oh, yeah, cause psychos
have hands this soft.

83
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,570
Shut up.

84
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,050
You were scared.

85
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,550
Shit, I've got to
go and interview

86
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,960
security about Carol Glackman.

87
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,040
Who?

88
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,620
Hello, that girl they
found in the dumpster?

89
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,320
Oh, OK.

90
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,040
She was in my bio study group.

91
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,230
What are you up to?

92
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,080
Well, I am--

93
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,250
got class, and then
I'm going to go

94
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,220
grab a quick game afterwards?

95
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,740
So we still on for tonight?

96
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,880
Yeah, see,
I have to finish

97
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
writing a paper for tomorrow.

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,360
But you have time
to play basketball?

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,790
Exercise, keeps
the mind fresh, hey.

100
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,470
Hey, we can do this
tomorrow, though.

101
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,040
Can I come over
and study with you?

102
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,500
Tomorrow, promise.

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,350
Fine?

104
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,170
Fine.

105
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,920
See you later.

106
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,620
All right.

107
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Whoo!

108
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,500
So, looks like you
found my hideout.

109
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,960
Yeah, I tried you
at Sandy's, but she

110
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,050
said I could find you here.

111
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,530
Yeah, what's up?

112
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,810
I'm going to go jump in the
shower, so I can

113
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,120
my shit from this rat hole.

114
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,040
Play again tomorrow?

115
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,030
Yeah.

116
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,510
All right.

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Mike, this is my
sister, Jessica.

118
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
Nice to meet you, Jess.

119
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
Jessica is a freshman.

120
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,610
Just getting used to the place.

121
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,580
Well, the first few
weeks are the hardest.

122
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,020
Took me almost a month to
realize that I own this place.

123
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,920
No, it's good that you
have your big brother here,

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,390
Cass, to show you around.

125
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,000
I mean, we know
everybody around here.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,490
We're the biggest men on campus.

127
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,120
Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Yeah, um, I'll walk you out.

129
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,290
I'll see you later.

130
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:51,990
Later.

131
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,070
Hey, Jess, you, um, ever
still want to use this place,

132
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,830
you know, give me a call.

133
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,100
I'll hook you up
with a choice locker.

134
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,400
So there was
this shadowy figure

135
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,190
I have to be wary of, right?

136
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,280
And then, at the very end,
she turns over the death card.

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,320
I mean, what do you
think that means?

138
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,300
Means enough to get you
all worried, you'll keep

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,720
coming back more, so--

140
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,970
Well, then, it's working,
because I'm a little spooked.

141
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,440
All right, Jess, come on.

142
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,740
You know, it always
seemed kind of cool

143
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,250
when you did magic
and Tarot stuff

144
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,330
when we were little kids--

145
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,840
most little girls don't do that.

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,370
But, well, by the time
we were in high school,

147
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,070
it was already lame.

148
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,190
Hey, that's not helping.

149
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,340
What I'm saying is,
you're in college now.

150
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,070
This is your chance to
find out who you are.

151
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,690
Don't let some
hoaxster tell you.

152
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,710
Well, I know that, Cassidy.

153
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,900
It's just that I've
seen a lot of these,

154
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,250
and it's unusual for that
card to be turned over.

155
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,480
And especially with
everything that's

156
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,130
been going on around here.

157
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,980
So it's really those girls
dying that's freaking you out.

158
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,160
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

159
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,540
You just hear so
many rumors that

160
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,640
are all conflicted and
garbled, and I mean,

161
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,940
who knows what could happen?

162
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,210
Hey, I know it worries you--

163
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,350
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,070
It's only been two girls.

165
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,570
It's hardly a pattern-- it's
more like a coincidence.

166
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,880
Yeah, I guess so.

167
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Even if there is
a maniac on campus,

168
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,530
I'm here to protect you.

169
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,790
All right?

170
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,360
You know I'd never let
anything happen to you,

171
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,490
right? 'Cause you're all I got.

172
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,460
Mm-hmm.

173
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,180
Listen, I've got to
go to the library.

174
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,020
Dude, you're bleeding.

175
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,670
No fever or
severe migraines?

176
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,660
No.
- Prolonged cold symptoms?

177
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,160
No.

178
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,670
Any yellowish,
nasal discharge?

179
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,770
I don't think it's sinusitis.

180
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,020
Your blood pressure is a bit
high-- that makes some people

181
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,100
more prone to bleeding.

182
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,860
Do you have a history of this?

183
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,810
Wait, yeah, my nose bleeds
from time to time, it's just--

184
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,280
it's never been that bad.

185
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,590
Do you ever abuse nasal drugs,
like cocaine or amphetamine?

186
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,740
No.

187
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,150
OK.

188
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,700
One last question--
have you been

189
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,650
under any psychological
stress lately?

190
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,810
Mental strain has been known
to cause these symptoms.

191
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,140
It's my senior year--

192
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,120
I rule this school.

193
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,360
Well then, here's
what I think--

194
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,820
the weather is cooling off,
and the humidity levels

195
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,110
are dropping.

196
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,990
Dry air is notorious
for causing nosebleeds.

197
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,260
Try eating less salty food,
and warm up for a longer period

198
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,570
before you lift weights.

199
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm going to give you
this saline nasal spray.

200
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,690
It'll moisten the nostrils
and prevent bleeding.

201
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,590
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

202
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,740
But if you have a
nosebleed, lean your hand

203
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,190
forward put an ice pack on it.

204
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,940
Hello?

205
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,470
Hi, is this Victor?

206
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,350
Yeah.

207
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,660
I had called a while
back about making

208
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,550
an appointment with you for,
you know, your services.

209
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,410
And I had to cancel, but
now I want to reschedule.

210
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,540
That will work.

211
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,470
How about now?

212
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,170
Now?

213
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,650
Yeah, yeah, now's fine.

214
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,060
Where do you live?

215
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,480
No, no, we can't do it here.

216
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,230
All right then,

217
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,400
come over to my place.

218
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,750
OK.

219
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,250
All right, um, hold on a second.

220
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,570
All right?

221
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,670
210
East 112 Street, 3C.

222
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,750
3C, OK.

223
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,900
I will be there soon.

224
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,370
What
was your name again?

225
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,740
Jason.

226
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,010
Jason.

227
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,760
All right, Jason, just remember
I get paid in cash only.

228
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,510
All right?

229
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,760
All right.

230
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,220
Later.

231
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,200
Bye.

232
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,490
Hold on.

233
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,470
Hold on!

234
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,990
What the hell are
you doing in here?

235
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,580
Hey, you beatin' off?
- Man, shut up.

236
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,940
I'm just trying to
finish my paper.

237
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,780
Look, I'm going to--

238
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,810
I'm going to go to the library.

239
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,880
It's too noisy in here.

240
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,020
Yeah.

241
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,100
You know it was another late
night at the gym for me.

242
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,240
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,970
Who was she tonight?

244
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,160
And now wait, wait till
I point her out to you.

245
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,590
Then you can really
congratulate me.

246
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,890
What a body.

247
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,480
But she's nothing special
in the sound of it,

249
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,910
you know, she kind
of just laid there.

250
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,820
But, uh, I will break her in.

251
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,110
Yeah, but you
know I could teach

252
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,890
you a few things if you'd like.

253
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,550
Oh, by the way,
how is your, uh--

254
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,400
how's your sister doing?
- She's fine.

255
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,290
She's uh-- just a little freaked
out about those two girls

256
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:53,990
dying.

257
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,860
I'll see you later.

258
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,600
It's open.

259
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,250
So you live near here, or what?

260
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,470
I go to school around here.

261
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,120
Oh, yeah?

262
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,660
I'm trying to get back
to school, myself.

263
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,530
Sitting on some money.

264
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,220
That's not mine.

265
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,040
It's my cousin's.

266
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,120
He had to stash it here.

267
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,950
He's coming back to get
it in a couple of days.

268
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,020
It's something really important.

269
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,180
He hooks me up, so I
don't ask any questions.

270
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,200
So what are you into?

271
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,610
I'm not sure.

272
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,420
We can figure it out.

273
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,050
Oh, you got lucky dicking me.

274
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,190
I'm going to be worth the price.

275
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,290
I've even been in
adult movies before.

276
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,750
You don't get that from
those other cracked

277
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,860
out hustlers out there.

278
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,630
We're going to have a good time.

279
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,830
I thought
I could do this.

280
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,360
You know, just sort of like--

281
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
sort of like an experiment,
since this being my last year

282
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,190
in college, and I just--

283
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,490
god, I just figured I would
get this all out of my system.

284
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,160
But now I'm here, and I
don't think I can do this.

285
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,780
This isn't me.

286
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,590
This isn't you?

287
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,090
Yeah, that's right.

288
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,000
Listen, man, that's cool.

289
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,930
As long as I get paid.

290
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,030
You know what I'm saying?

291
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,480
I just changed my mind.

292
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,110
Cool.
But you know?

293
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,970
A lot of guys get scared--

294
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,310
especially their first time.

295
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,830
I'm not scared of shit.

296
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,530
I just said I changed
my mind, all right?

297
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,800
Comprende, amigo?

298
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,910
Yeah, I understand you, man.
I got you.

299
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,000
Your closet-caged yuppy
ass is a chickenshit.

300
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,880
Whatever.

301
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,740
Just go back to your
ghetto family's dirt life.

302
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,020
What did you just
say to me, man?

303
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,530
I said, I'm getting out of
this shit hole, all right?

304
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,530
Forget you, man.

305
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,410
But you know-- you don't
know what you're missing.

306
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,550
That's just a sample.

307
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,460
No-- no--

308
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,450
no-- no--

309
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,090
Yo, Jason!

310
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,030
Jason, you all
right in there, man?

311
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,560
Oh, dude, man-- what happened?

312
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,820
Are you all right?

313
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,840
What the hell happened
to you in there?

314
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,110
Where do you think
you're going, dude?

315
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,480
Yo, Jason, get back
here with my money, man!

316
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Mother fucker!

317
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,900
Cassidy Blood.
Shit.

318
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,160
The aromatic kind
are often used in dyes

319
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,170
that can be carcinogenic.

320
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,470
And often they're the cause
of unpleasant sticky odors,

321
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,870
given off by decaying
animal and human matter.

322
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,700
Means this
ammonia-based groups go

323
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,460
through, in which NH bonds are
replaced by alkyl substitutes.

324
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,940
Ah, uh, amines?

325
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,870
Right again.

326
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,310
I have to say, this
is kind of surprising.

327
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,950
- Why?
- I don't know.

328
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,700
It's just you seem kind of
into partying and stuff.

329
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,770
Cassidy never mentioned
that one of his friends

330
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,200
had such a broad
range of knowledge.

331
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,510
Well, I--

332
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,890
I guess I have a
steel trap memory.

333
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
Well, we could definitely
use a fourth for college bowl.

334
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,100
But, I mean, do you
really want to do it?

335
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,270
There are all these
practices you'd

336
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,840
be required to attend, not to
mention the actual tournaments.

337
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,450
Wait, well what
are you saying?

338
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,980
Saying I'm just some
irresponsible jock,

339
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,370
who's only into chasing
women and drinking beer?

340
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,030
I'm sorry-- I really
didn't mean to offend you.

341
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,730
Well, I am.

342
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,750
But that doesn't mean
that I don't want to help

343
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,240
my school's college bowl team.

344
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,800
You seem a little tense, Jess.

345
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,740
You know Cass told me that
you were, um, a little freaked

346
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,260
out by these campus murders.

347
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,070
Maybe we can go get
something to eat tonight?

348
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,860
Maybe downtown.

349
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,170
You know, I actually
have this exam tomorrow

350
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,050
that I need to study for.

351
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,920
It's really big.

352
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,790
But maybe some other time.

353
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,990
What is that?

354
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,440
The killer strikes again!

355
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,230
Who is it?

356
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,480
Sheila Evans.

357
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,550
Did you know her?

358
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,200
Me neither.

359
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,580
Did you know Carol
Glackman or Tiffany Lee?

360
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,740
No, who are they?

361
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,340
The two other murder victims.

362
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,720
I have freshman comp with Carol.

363
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,070
She was a major suck-up.

364
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,790
That's a terrible
thing to say.

365
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,430
Am I suppose to lie about
her just because she's dead?

366
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,600
Apparently, the killer raped his
victims before he killed them.

367
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,420
People say all
kinds of things.

368
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,970
You will not
believe what I got.

369
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,570
When I was being questioned
in the dean's office,

370
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,110
I swiped a copy of the
files on the murders.

371
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,100
Police reports, crime
photos, any tense stuff.

372
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,800
Look.

373
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,530
This is nasty.

374
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,580
You could get in trouble.

375
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,010
Maybe so, but if I
were you, I'd be careful.

376
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,080
He only attacks blond girls.

377
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,370
That's not true.

378
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,920
Look at the pictures,
read the reports.

379
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,620
It also says this guy likes
to deflower his victims

380
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,970
before he kills them.

381
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,790
He prefers virgins,
so watch out.

382
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,720
What makes you
think I'm a virgin?

383
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,670
Anyway, three
blond girls doesn't

384
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,950
necessarily make a pattern.

385
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,310
Well, the dean
seems to think so.

386
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,780
He's put together a list of
girls he thinks may be at risk.

387
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,260
And you're on it.

388
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,370
Hey.

389
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,360
I was hoping I'd see you today.

390
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,260
Yeah, just wanted to
make sure everything's OK.

391
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,150
So, how is your roommate?

392
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,950
Ann?

393
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,980
Oh, she's fine.

394
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,400
I think she finds
all this amusing.

395
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,230
You're doing OK, right?

396
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,230
Yeah.

397
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,620
Although, I'm kind
of embarrassed.

398
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,980
Why?

399
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,340
I don't know.

400
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,990
I know that psychics and
Tarot aren't actually real.

401
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,260
I don't even know
why I got a reading.

402
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,410
I guess it just made me feel
more comfortable, you know?

403
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,000
Reminded me of high school.

404
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,120
Look, I'm sorry I came down
on you so hard yesterday.

405
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,550
No, I know I
needed to hear that.

406
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,330
I mean, how long can I stay
a silly little girl, right?

407
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,360
But I'm starting to
feel a little better.

408
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,850
I like Ann, college bowl's fun.

409
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,670
Good.

410
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,590
That's good.

411
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,780
I'm glad to hear that.

412
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,500
Oh, your friend
Michael just joined.

413
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,260
He did?

414
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,400
Yeah, he's really smart.

415
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,120
You never told me
one of your friends

416
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,520
have such a photographic memory.

417
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,100
Listen, I gotta get
to lab dissection.

418
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,670
Hey, be careful around campus.

419
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,610
Hey, don't worry about me.

420
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,240
I'm all grown up.

421
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,120
Yeah, right--
seriously, though,

422
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,440
you know, if you're going to
go somewhere at night, call me.

423
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,790
I'll walk you.

424
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,840
OK.

425
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,830
Bye.

426
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,230
Is this the psych test?

427
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,560
Yo, Cass, what's you problem?

428
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,730
Stay away from my sister.

429
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,360
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yeah, you do.

430
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Come on, man, what did you do?

431
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,050
Steal the college bowl
practice questions?

432
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,420
Huh?

433
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,090
Look at her answers when
she went to the bathroom?

434
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,060
Relax!

435
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,660
Dude, I know what your
fucking tricks are, all right?

436
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,300
See?

437
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,060
What's this?
Huh?

438
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,260
Flash cards is how everybody
studies for college bowl.

439
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,620
Look, I'm going to tell
you this once, all right?

440
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,000
Don't be using your pick-up
games on my sister, all right?

441
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,780
OK, Cass.

442
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,460
Who's there?

443
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,280
There is no
friend like a sister

444
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,660
in calm or stormy weather.

445
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,180
I've seen blood.

446
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,160
So you don't recognize me?

447
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
You're following me.

448
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,040
That's right.

449
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,410
We need to talk.

450
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,490
No, I'm getting security.

451
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,460
I have seen your sister bleed!

452
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,340
He steals her youth.

453
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,790
Who are you?

454
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,420
I know it's been
a while, Cassidy.

455
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,130
Don't you recognize
your Aunt Helen?

456
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,510
We should talk.

457
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,340
I've kept close watch
on the development

458
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,470
of you and your sister.

459
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,870
So why haven't I heard
from you since I was like 10?

460
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,030
Uh, it's complicated, Cassidy.

461
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,870
Your mother never liked me
to be around her family.

462
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,370
And then about a week
before her accident,

463
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,090
she called me and
she told me that if--

464
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,390
if something were to
happen, I was to keep

465
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,890
away from you and Jessica.

466
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,690
I was furious with
her for saying that.

467
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,380
And then she did die.

468
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,330
And I was so angry,
I couldn't see it.

469
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,790
That doesn't sound
like my mother.

470
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,650
Of course it does!

471
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,440
She loved you dearly.

472
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,310
And she was disgusted
by my occupation.

473
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,420
Psychic?

474
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,070
I'm not your additional
psychic, Cassidy.

475
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:25,750
My abilities only appear
under certain circumstances.

476
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,960
I don't know what you mean.

477
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,980
I engage in a process
of full release.

478
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,130
I sleep with my clients.

479
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,680
You mean you're a prostitute.

480
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,920
My clairvoyance only
manifests itself during moments

481
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,210
of sexual intimacy.

482
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,800
I see the future
when I have sex.

483
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,860
Yeah, yeah, I think--

484
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,250
I think you need some help.

485
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,440
Your mother's gifts
were astounding.

486
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,190
My mother wasn't some sex
freak like you, all right?

487
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,230
Look, just because you're
going through some weird crisis

488
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,550
in your life, don't
think that you

489
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,030
can force your way back into my
life, or into Jessica's life.

490
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,010
Now, I don't want to see
you around here anymore.

491
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,850
Understand?

492
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,630
OK, see, now, you don't
have to help me do this.

493
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,250
Watch-- see?

494
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,510
I can do it myself.

495
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,650
I know.

496
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,960
I like to.

497
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,120
You know, I thought I'd be
seeing a lot more if you

498
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,580
when I decided to go here.

499
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,240
Our schedules are so
full, I feel like I

500
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,740
hardly ever see you anymore.

501
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,710
Yeah.

502
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,320
Also, you seem kind
of distant lately.

503
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,640
Is everything OK?

504
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,140
Yeah.

505
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,090
Yeah, it's fine.

506
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,860
You know you can always
talk to me if you want to,

507
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,020
if anything is bothering you.

508
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,960
How are things
with you and Sandy?

509
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,410
Do you remember anything
about mom's sister, Helen?

510
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,370
Yeah, vaguely.

511
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,830
I think I remember an Aunt
Helen taking a bee stinger out

512
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,840
of my hand at a barbecue.

513
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,270
Hmm, I remember the bee sting.

514
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,080
That's right, I remember
laughing at you,

515
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,240
while you were
dancing around crying.

516
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,380
Yeah, I
remember that, too.

517
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,360
Why the sudden curiosity?

518
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,110
No reason.

519
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,420
If you think
about mom and dad,

520
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,600
you should look through
their stuff in storage.

521
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,690
It's where I go when
I'm thinking about them.

522
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,790
There's photo albums and
dad's books and stuff.

523
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,240
There's of them there
than in their graves.

524
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,650
I can't look at that stuff.

525
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,990
It's too painful.

526
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,960
Sometimes, I wonder, Jess--

527
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,180
I mean, is it easier or
worse for you to have fewer

528
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,770
memories of them than I do?

529
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,270
I don't know, I mean, I--

530
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,550
I guess sometimes I
just feel like I've

531
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,260
never been as happy as
I was those first 10

532
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,360
years of my life.

533
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,310
Maybe everyone feels that way.

534
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,200
We'll never know.

535
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,840
Yeah.
I guess not.

536
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,970
Anyway, I'm not trying
to get all heavy.

537
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,900
I just-- I'm just trying
to remember Helen.

538
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,580
You know, what she looked like.

539
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,500
You should definitely look
at the pictures in storage.

540
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,920
It's not that big of a deal just
to fidget with some old things.

541
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Shit.

542
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,750
Your
mother's gifts were astounding.

543
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,130
Your mother was always
ashamed with her gift--

544
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,880
but in her teens, she
experimented with it rampantly.

545
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,960
She'd come out of the bathroom
with flecks under her nose,

546
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,180
and I'd taunt her.

547
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,440
She'd throw a fit.

548
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,280
But at night, she would
tell me what she saw.

549
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,630
Clear and precise visions.

550
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,370
Better solo than I've
ever had with a partner.

551
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,610
I think it was out of jealousy
that I would tease her.

552
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:55,770
It was because of me that
she felt like such a misfit.

553
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,640
After she married,
she buried it.

554
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,410
And then she became standoffish.

555
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,370
I just--

556
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,440
I find this hard to
believe about my mom.

557
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,430
You must believe it.

558
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,880
If she had trusted her visions,
she would never have gotten

559
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,000
on that plane with your father.

560
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,940
I made a promise to
protect you and Jessica,

561
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,430
and I have also
been tempted to make

562
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,880
sure that you understood your
gift when the time was right.

563
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,460
Now, if you have the
ability, you must have

564
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,730
already had several episodes.

565
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,980
You have, haven't you?

566
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,170
You've seen--

567
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,150
No.

568
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,120
You've seen bloody
visions of your sister.

569
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,670
I don't know, no.

570
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,990
Now, think, Cassidy.

571
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,590
My ability fades with age.

572
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,730
But I did have
the distinct image

573
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,960
of Jessica covered in blood.

574
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,880
Does any of this mean
anything to you at all?

575
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,350
Yeah, I may have seen
something like that.

576
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,320
Like a daydream.

577
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,670
No, no, not a daydream.

578
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,500
Well, I can't remember!

579
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,510
I know.

580
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,660
I know this is an awful
lot for you to handle.

581
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,940
This is going to sound strange--

582
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,930
the next time you have
an intimate experience,

583
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,730
pay close attention.

584
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:44,550
Let it be a pure, assented
sexual experience.

585
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,090
Open your mind to its--

586
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:59,730
oh, your sister made this
when she was very young.

587
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,800
I've always liked it, and
I keep it close for luck.

588
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,170
You take it now.

589
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:25,890
Remember-- you must lose
yourself in the sexual moment.

590
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,140
Your sister's life
may depend on it.

591
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,910
Thanks for waiting.

592
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm sorry to bring
you in here, Jessica.

593
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,520
Sometimes I'm compelled to
do things I find unpleasant.

594
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,450
Do you know this is?

595
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,180
It's that girl who got killed?

596
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,560
Have you seen
this picture before?

597
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,590
Jessica, a dean is
powerless against the forces

598
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,900
of campus scandal mongers.

599
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,400
I don't want to scare you, I'm
going to have to talk to all

600
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,790
the female students on campus.

601
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,080
Not all of them, actually, just
a few of a particular type.

602
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,830
There's someone wondering
about this campus.

603
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,240
I don't know if
he's been stopped,

604
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,040
or if he will strike again.

605
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,410
But this disturbed
individual has

606
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,960
chosen this university
as his arena

607
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,180
in which to prey upon students.

608
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,320
It would seem that
this man, this--

609
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,760
this half-crazed
criminal prefers

610
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,610
young women with blond hair, and
an overall innocent appearance.

611
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,280
Young women like yourself.

612
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,980
Do I transfer or
dye my hair black?

613
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,340
No, no, nothing that drastic.

614
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,040
I just need you to
be extra cautious.

615
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,740
That's all.

616
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,510
I've asked security
to keep a close eye

617
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,220
on you and the other girls.

618
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,110
Just be aware of any
strange behavior.

619
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,110
And remember, sometimes
those you trust

620
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,140
can hurt you the most.

621
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,510
I'm sorry, Jessica.

622
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,070
I know this is hard for you.

623
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,880
The world is a dangerous place.

624
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,680
And sometimes being as young
and beautiful as you are,

625
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,590
attracts the wrong
kind of attention.

626
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:24,300
This will all blow over in time,
it will be stopped somehow.

627
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,350
- So was I right?
- What?

628
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,660
I know the dean met with you.
What did he say?

629
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,780
Was I right about the victims?

630
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,530
Yes, Ann, you were right.

631
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,000
The police are watching
us blond girls.

632
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,170
I knew it.

633
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,040
I told you.

634
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,870
And they're virgins, too.

635
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,440
Look at this-- broken
hymen, tearing--

636
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,360
doctors can tell if
you're a virgin or not.

637
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,310
Whatever.

638
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:19,490
Ah, this guy must be
some real sexual deviant.

639
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,900
I'm glad I don't fit into
any of the victim criterion.

640
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,710
Jess, please, I've had sex.

641
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,460
- Who?
- Peeta.

642
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,430
You know we're
more than friends.

643
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,000
Anyway, you have to stop
handing out these Xerox photos.

644
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,580
The dean had a copy,
and he was not happy.

645
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,210
He had a copy?

646
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,880
Oh, my god, this is crazy!

647
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,740
What else did he say?

648
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,370
Nothing, just be aware
of strange men on campus.

649
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,240
Hey, what's up, guys?

650
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,160
Um, can one of you tell me
where I can find Cassidy Clarke?

651
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,130
The number 13 was used
because it represented witches'

652
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,800
covens, and the worship
of mother goddess, as

653
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,230
well as the Last Supper.

654
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,960
All types of media and
techniques were employed,

655
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,420
and before it was
finished in 1979,

656
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,780
400 workers were
employed in its creation.

657
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,630
Name this feminist
work of art, featuring

658
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:37,050
place settings for 39 important
women, created by Judy Chicago?

659
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,180
Oh.

660
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,980
Think food.

661
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,290
The Dinner Party.

662
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,160
Damn.

663
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,380
You're good.

664
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,580
OK, all right,
here's another one.

665
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,810
You know, maybe
we should hold off.

666
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,710
I mean, I'm nearly
50 minutes late.

667
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,940
OK.

668
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,850
Hey Rachel where are you?

669
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,240
Oh, he did?

670
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,410
No, sure, that's fine.

671
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,070
We can reschedule
any time this week.

672
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,640
Just give me a all, OK?

673
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,610
Bye.

674
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:10,740
She said you canceled.

675
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,830
She's She is right.

676
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,760
Michael-- college
bowl's in a few weeks.

677
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,460
We have to study.
- I know, Jess.

678
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,400
I-- I just think that you
and I make a good team.

679
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,120
Well, despite what
you think, the rules

680
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,180
stipulate that we need
four team members, not two.

681
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,470
Do you want to know the real
reason why I joined the team?

682
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,790
Put your mind to good use?

683
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,510
Eh!

684
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,980
Wrong answer.

685
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,500
Minus 10 points
for Jessica Clarke.

686
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,650
I have no idea.

687
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,480
You're a smart girl.

688
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,380
Think about it.

689
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,710
I actually have a paper
I have to do by tomorrow.

690
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,370
You know, I think we should
get to know each other better.

691
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,740
Look you don't have
to run away from me.

692
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,870
I won't bite.

693
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,010
I'm sorry.

694
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,650
I have to go.

695
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,990
Hey ladies, what's up?

696
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,360
I'm looking for this
guy, Cassidy Clarke.

697
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,240
Have you seen him?

698
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,700
Sorry, I haven't seen him.

699
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,120
That's his sister right there.

700
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,550
That blond girl.

701
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,370
Do you know where
your brother is?

702
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:05,900
Sorry, I haven't
seen him all day.

703
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,190
Do you have any
idea where he's at?

704
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,330
I'm sorry, no.

705
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,350
Are you a student here?

706
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,780
Do you know when he's
going to come back?

707
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,240
Just call security, Michael!

708
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,150
Michael, are you OK?

709
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:55,380
So, you never told me
what the occasion is.

710
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,480
There's no occasion.

711
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,940
It's just-- I've been
preoccupied lately,

712
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,600
and I figured you deserved it.

713
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,920
Do you think you deserve it?

714
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,480
I don't know.
You tell me.

715
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,760
Cass, I'm so glad we're here.

716
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,120
I thought I was losing you.

717
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,960
Hey, don't say that.

718
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,450
I was getting desperate.

719
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,860
I thought I was going to have
to knock on your door dressed

720
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,940
in Saran Wrap.

721
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,790
Mm, that wouldn't
have been too bad.

722
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,180
Hold that thought.

723
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,870
OK.

724
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,720
I'll be right back.

725
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,290
Come on, come on.

726
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,120
Let it be a pure,

727
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,150
authentic, sexual experience.

728
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,150
Open your mind.

729
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,350
Your sister's life
may depend on it.

730
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
OK.

731
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,940
What's wrong?

732
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,400
Nothing.
Nothing.

733
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,990
I have something
important I have to do.

734
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,760
Important?

735
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,980
I'm sorry.

736
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,670
Cassidy, if you walk out
that door, don't call me again.

737
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,310
Yeah?

738
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,200
Hi.

739
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,370
You probably didn't
expect to hear from me.

740
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,470
You must've heard what
went down on campus today.

741
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,290
Wait a minute, you
were up on campus?

742
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,360
Look man, I don't have time
for your bullshit, all right?

743
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,510
Wait, wait, please,
just don't hang up.

744
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,380
Have you got my money, or not?

745
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,540
I, uh--

746
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,820
I want to see you again.

747
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,050
After all the
bullshit you pulled

748
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,380
the last time you was here?

749
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,340
Look, I'll pay the money I
owe you from the first time,

750
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,490
plus double the price
this time, all up front.

751
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,400
No I
don't know, man.

752
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,510
You that hard up?

753
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,190
Please.

754
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,930
I-- I have to do this.

755
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,440
I want to do this.

756
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,620
You're not going
to be all like,

757
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,020
this just isn't me, and start
that bullshit again with me,

758
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,860
are you?

759
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,560
No.

760
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,160
I always got off
on you first-timers.

761
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,620
Yeah, so can I--
can I come over now?

762
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,720
Yeah, I guess that'll work.

763
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,610
All right.

764
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,790
Wow, it's all here.

765
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,510
I'm surprised.
- Why?

766
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,430
What, you thought I
was going to scam you?

767
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:19,220
I've seen it all, I've
heard it all, shit happens.

768
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,030
So you really take
a chance letting

769
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:28,170
strangers into your apartment.

770
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,730
Better than flipping burgers.

771
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,310
Look, about the
other night that I--

772
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:37,290
Shh, forget it.

773
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,760
We all got our
baggage to deal with.

774
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,430
I see it all the time.

775
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,230
Been through it, myself.

776
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,120
Actions speak louder than words.

777
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,820
Friend like a sister in
calm or stormy weather.

778
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,950
Michael.

779
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,650
Fuck!

780
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,150
OK.

781
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,140
OK.

782
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,620
Michael.

783
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,340
Kind of dressy
for a study date.

784
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,450
Well, we're not
going to the library.

785
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,300
We're going somewhere else.

786
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,110
He won't tell me where.

787
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:58,170
I think you like him.

788
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,500
No, I just think he's sweet.

789
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,840
I don't know, maybe it's
like a date or something.

790
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,460
Well, I've seen the
way he looks at you.

791
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,590
There's definitely
something going on.

792
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,220
So where do you
think we'll go?

793
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,270
Probably to the gym.

794
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,730
No, it's a good thing!

795
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,950
I hear he takes all the
girls he likes to the gym.

796
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:21,640
He has all access, and thinks
it's romantic, or something.

797
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,520
Speak of the devil!

798
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,150
Hello there, Ann.

799
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,550
You're looking
lovely this evening.

800
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,250
Right.

801
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,290
Wow.

802
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:46,440
You-- you look incredible.

803
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,440
Thanks.

804
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,830
So, you ready to go?

805
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:58,490
Yeah, yeah, but I have
something for you, first.

806
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,040
It's a-- it's a college
bowl question I--

807
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,000
I thought you'd like.

808
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,880
It ends with the praise
of sisterhood, including

809
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,610
the lines, for there is
no friend like a sister

810
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:13,460
in calm or stormy weather.

811
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,160
Now, it was viewed
as a children's work,

812
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,380
despite the lines, "She
sucked, and sucked,

813
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,840
and sucked the more fruits
which that unknown orchard bore.

814
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,800
She sucked until
her lips were sore."

815
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,660
Name this work, centered
around the encounter

816
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,090
between the sisters
Lore and Lizzie,

817
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,920
and the title creatures--

818
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,070
the most famous poem
of Christina Rossetti.

819
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,440
Goblin Market.

820
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,430
Damn.

821
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,430
You're good.

822
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,350
Oh, come on.

823
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,280
Fuck!
Fuck!

824
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:03,430
I guess you're wondering
where we're going?

825
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,080
Well, I am curious.

826
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,130
You know, I work
at the gym, so--

827
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,160
I do have full
access, day and night.

828
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,900
It's quiet, it's private.

829
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,410
Sometimes I go there
to study, you know?

830
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,910
I usually don't bring
anybody with me, but uh--

831
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:30,680
only people that
are very special.

832
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,500
Well, I'm glad
you're asking me.

833
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:44,830
Jessica!

834
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,800
Jessica!

835
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,590
Hi, Cassidy.

836
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,700
Jessica's not here.

837
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,730
She's studying with Michael.

838
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,240
The library, thanks.

839
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,300
Actually, I'm pretty
sure they're at the gym.

840
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,600
This goddamn lock
always gives me trouble.

841
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,320
You got that?

842
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,600
Goddamn lock always
gives me trouble.

843
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,600
I didn't know they
had sauna in here.

844
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,250
Yeah, it's cosy.

845
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:35,940
It's like a-- like a log cabin
in the middle of the city.

846
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,690
Well, I'm glad that
you brought me here.

847
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,500
Since the moment
I first saw you,

848
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,580
I knew you were my kind of girl.

849
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,030
I like you, too, Michael.

850
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,600
Since the moment
I first saw you,

851
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,840
I knew that you were
my kind of girl.

852
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,330
Well, I like
you, too, Michael.

853
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:56,610
Get the fuck off her!

854
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,610
What did I fucking
tell you, huh?

855
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:01,100
What the fuck is wrong with you?

856
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,600
What are you--

857
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:27,930
No, Michael, no!

858
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:28,930
No!

859
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,420
No, Michael, no!

860
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,370
Michael, no!
No!

861
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,440
No!
No!

862
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,810
No, Michael, no!
No!

863
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,310
Michael, no!

864
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,100
No, Michael!
No!

865
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,680
No, Michael!

866
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,930
Come here, let me help you up.

867
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,400
No, Michael!

868
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:06,800
Jessica!

869
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,250
- No, Michael, no!
- Move, move!

870
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,600
I told you to stay away
from her, you psycho!

871
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,520
I told you, stay away
from her, you psycho!

872
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,720
Oh, god!

873
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,320
Hey, Jess, how you feeling?

874
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,650
Yeah, that's what they said.

875
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,160
Sorry you had to miss
Cassidy's funeral.

876
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,150
It went, you know, smoothly.

877
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,180
I think he would have approved.

878
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,590
Things get pretty crazy on
campus, but we all miss you.

879
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,310
Well, I guess I
should let you rest.

880
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,020
They said they'd call
me if you wake up

881
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,660
or freak out or something.
Bye.

882
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,010
Hi, Jess.

883
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,540
I didn't know if I should
actually come and see you.

884
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,710
But I figured I
owed you that much.

885
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:48,550
Been trying to get away
from it all, but it's been--

886
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,530
it's been kind of tough.

887
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,180
God, you're beautiful.

888
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,380
I guess I should go.

889
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:38,680
I hear the
rock song, to some song

890
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,480
it keeps reminding on the radio.

891
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:49,680
Right now, it's my soul
that's playing on the radio.

892
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,380
Oh.

893
01:20:54,580 --> 01:21:01,480
You asked me to
remind you because you

894
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,780
knew that I'd forget.

895
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:08,680
But now that you're
all over the FM,

896
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:13,180
I never will ever forget my bet.

897
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,880
Look where we've gone--

898
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:27,880
I hear the rock
song, to some song

899
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,380
keep reminding of the radio.

900
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:38,980
Because right now it's my soul
that's playing on the radio.
