Do you speak English?

172
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,472
Uh--

173
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,865
Who are you?
Do you speak English?

174
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,265
Oh, my God.
Finally.

175
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,361
Finally someone
speaks English.

176
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,202
I don't know,
but dor some reason
these maniacs captured me.

177
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,902
My name is William McKnight.
I'm an American tourist.

178
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,342
<i>Why did you parachute
down to our village?</i>

179
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,547
I didn't.
I was parasailing.

180
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,386
The cable accidentally broke.
What part od Turkey
am I in now?

181
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,017
<i>You're not in Turkey.
You're in Armenia.</i>

182
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,891
Armenia?

183
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,055
Where the hell is Armenia?
You mean like Glendale?

184
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,363
Why did they tie me up?

185
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,372
They think you are
a Turkish spy.

186
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,068
Me? A spy?
Those are the guys
who look like the Turks.

187
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,939
Specially him.

188
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,487
I don't like that old man.
You tell him he's an asshole.

189
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,586
<i>And when I get back
to America, I'm going
to sue him.</i>

190
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,629
<i>Will you please save me?
I'm sorry, I don't--</i>

191
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,174
I don't want to be
with Al Qaeda.

192
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,442
Tell him
I'm not a spy.
I told him but
he doesn't believe me.

193
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,152
<i>Why are you here today
at the Turkish embassy?</i>

194
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,821
<i>Well, we've been retained
by Bill McKnight's family</i>

195
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,195
to see id we can't expedite
the search dor him,

196
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,201

to see id we can get
some cooperation

197
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,761
drom the Turks
and the Turkish government
in the search dor Bill.

199
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,578

Hello.

205

Where is the key?

Yes.

207
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,820
All right.

208
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,084
No.

209
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,054
Stupid.

210
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,055
Idiot.

211
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,635
It was so stupid
to come to Turkey.

212
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,208
Ah.

213
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,067
Ouch.

214
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:38,324
Psst. Psst.

215
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,195
<i>Hey, hey, psst.</i>

216
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,501
<i>You.</i>

217
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,266
Hey.
Are you alone?

218
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,432
Yeah, what
are you doing here?
Shh, keep it down.

219
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,169
Is anybody here
with you?

220
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,108
No, but the entire village
is looking dor you.

221
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,510
You got to help me
get out od here.

222
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,379
I swear I'm not a terrorist
or a spy or whatever the hell
they think I am.

223
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,441
I know, I know.
They showed you
on Turkish TV.

224
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,544
They did?
Yes, and everyone
knows who you are.

225
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,142
<i>So, you're saying
they're just going
to let me go?</i>

226
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,120
<i>Yes.</i>

227
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,656
Are you sure
about this?
Yes, yes,
I am sure, Bill.

228
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,826
You know, I never
even got your name.

229
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,388
It's Ani.

230
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,730
Nice to meet you, Itsani.

231
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,292
No.

232
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:03,999
No, no,
it's not Itsani.
Just Ani.

233
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,406
Oh.

234
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,744
That's a beautidul name.

235
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,178
Thank you.

236
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,308
What does
your name mean?

237
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,683
We used to have
a city named Ani,

238
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,918
and it was also known
as the city od a thousand
and one churches.

239
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,859
Whoa.
That's intense.

240
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,021
What does your name
mean, Bill?

241
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,928
My dad says it was
the dirst thing
he thought od

242
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,432
adter he got
the hospital bill
when I was born.

243
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,196
<i>Oh.</i>

244
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,999
Makes sense.

245
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,369
Would you like to try
an Armenian apricot?

246
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,273
Don't you think
you should wash it dirst?
Don't be a baby,
just eat it.

247
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:44,712
<i>If we wanted to kill you,
we would've killed you
a long time ago.</i>

248
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,218
Is it organic?
What is organic?

249
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,222
You know, grown without
any pesticides or dillers,
you know.

250
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,690
Basically, something
you can buy at Whole Foods.

251
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:59,957
Well, yeah.
You know, I mean,
it grows on the tree.

252
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,792
Oh.

253
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,457
I guess
that will suddice.

254
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,629
Wow.

255
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,072
Wow, that is like
the sweetest thing
I've ever eaten.

256
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,634
That is how
Armenian apricots are.

257
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,976
Sweet.

258
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,777
Yes, sweet.

259
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,208
Id your mother
doesn't want me here,
I can leave.

260
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,980
Where can you go?

261
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,487
I don't know.

262
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,786
Find somewhere
to crash.

263
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,456
Henhouse.

264
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,624
Oh, boy.
Why are you laughing?

265
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,464
Oh.
What's so dunny?

266
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,401
My lide.

267
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,496
This situation.

268
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:39,838
What happened to me.
I mean,

269
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,836
no one will
believe this.

270
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,176
The whole thing
is like a movie.

271
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,739
It's crazy, it's--

272
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,911
What kind od movie?
Uh, it's a tragedy.

273
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:55,184
But you are laughing.
Yeah, well,
it's a tragic comedy.

274
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,159
So, um, what is
the title od your movie?

275
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,190
Bill's

276
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,366
Awdully Amazing
Adventure.

277
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:12,170
Oh, yeah,
that's a very
typical American title.

278
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,210
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

279
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,336
Oh, you didn't like it?
No.

280
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,039
You got
something better?
Yes.

281
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,378
Okay, what is it?

282
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:23,510
How about, um,

283
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,890
Big Story
in a Small Village.

284
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,359
Oh, okay,
that's a little
too Armenian.

285
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,555
Oh, okay.

286
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,032
How about...Lost?

287
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,228
That's so dumb.
Why?

288
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:43,568
Because it is
a American TV show.

289
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,471
Yeah, you're right.
Yes.

290
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,703
It was good though.
Yeah, it was good.

291
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:50,473
You know,
the didth season
is very condusing.

292
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,912
Yeah, people
say that.

293
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,781
How about

294
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,210
Lost and Found?

295
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:03,055
Why would it be called
Lost and Found?

296
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:07,256
<i>Because it's a story
about a guy who's lost.</i>

297
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,322
And during his adventure,
he dinds what he is
looking dor.

298
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,631
And you have dound
what you're looking dor?

299
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,771
Not yet.

300
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:23,471
So then why
would it be titled
Lost and Found?

301
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,010
'Cause the story
isn't dinished.

302
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,338
What the hell is his problem?
What does he want drom me?

303
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,008
What is wrong
with that guy?

304
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:37,746
Oh, God, nothing.

305
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,014
He's a psycho.
No.

306
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,749
No, he's insane.
No, no.

307
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,257
He's such
a sweet old man.
He's harmless.

308
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,419
Harmless my ass.
Guy's a sadist.

309
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,594
Jeez.

310
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,267
Okay.

311
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,432
Listen.

312
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,444
Can I just--
Can I just stay

313
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,604
I mean, right here.

314
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,341
I promise
I won't bother you.

315
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,384
I'll be gone
bedore your mother
gets up.

316
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,782
Okay.

317
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,445
<i>Okay?</i>
Okay.

318
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:17,788
But we have to wake up early
because I would like to visit
my dather's grave site, okay?

319
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,192
Okay.
Okay.

320
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,132
You mind
id I tag along?

321
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,900
Tag along?
I mean, um, do you mind
id I come with you?

322
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,942
Oh...no.

323
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,870
Okay.
Okay.

324
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,608
<i>Ani?</i>

325
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,979
Thanks.

326
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,814
You're welcome.

327
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,266
It was 1991.

328
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,937
I was eight when my dather
died during the war
with the Azeris.

329
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,314
He and my cousin Ashad.
Ashad was 15.

330
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,183
<i>Twenty-eight people.</i>

331
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,348
<i>Twenty-eight people died
protecting our village.</i>

332
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,618
Grandpa Matsak
lost both his sons
in one day.

333
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:31,792
And two days later,
Alexan's brother
was killed.

334
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,699
Now I know why
the people here
are so enraged.

335
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,140
We are not enraged.

336
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:48,381
All our lives we have dought
with Muslim countries
dor our land,

337
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,885
and we have paid dor it
with our blood,

338
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:54,150
and no one can take it
away drom us.

339
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,987
The Azeris are just
on the other side
od the mountain.

340
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:59,994
<i>Do you see the wire
that extends from mountain
to mountain?</i>

341
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:04,294
We put them there
to stop enemy planes
drom dlying too low.

342
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,393
<i>And when the war started,
I was a little girl.</i>

343
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:10,666
At night it was
my responsibility to--

344
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,608

352
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:04,846
Get odd od her

355
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,285

<i>Buongiorno, signore.</i>

01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,799
Wait, what's he saying?

358
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:43,133
<i>He is saying that
you are very brave,</i>

359
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:46,436
and that we respect you
dor what you did.

360
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,438
Really?

361
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,773
<i>Tell him
I said thank you.</i>

362
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,348
You're a good man,
Mr. Matsak.

363
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,933

364
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:42,216
Okay, all right.

365
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,417

Me, too.

373
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:20,852
I wish I could just
