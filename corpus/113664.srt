1
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:04,615
we certainly are.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,922
And you will be transferred,
the first opening we get, at another facility.

3
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:11,360
Look, I have a son of my own.

4
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:14,696
So I understand your pain, I do.

5
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:20,062
If there is anything you need, let me know.
I'll see what I can do to help.

6
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,597
There's one thing, ma'am.

7
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,970
When I was in County, I got into art.

8
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,347
Ceramics and that sort of thing.

9
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:34,444
- And you'd like to continue it here?
- Yes.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,045
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:47,490
Jesus, what the fuck, man!

12
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,928
I'm straight, man.

13
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:51,960
On what planet?

14
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:54,837
Demerol.

15
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,365
It's Mathematic and Gutter.

16
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:00,468
Figured out Clever helped you get to Razor,
didn't like the loss.

17
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:02,411
So they took the book.

18
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:05,644
They're probably coming after you next.

19
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:07,345
They came after me first.

20
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:11,651
I'd be laying right here next to him or worse
if Pierce hadn't come through.

21
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,252
So Pierce has got your back?

22
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:18,422
Amber ain't never come through
with the paper.

23
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:22,562
So if it's gonna happen,
it's gonna have to happen, right?

24
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,628
You guys have to leave now.

25
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,425
What's up?

26
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:56,557
You waiting for me to do something?

27
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,766
- Ask you to dance?
- You tell me.

28
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:06,442
Look, man, I got this appeal going for me,
and I don't need nobody fucking it up.

29
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,680
So don't start no shit, won't be no shit.

30
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:15,920
Toure Smalls.

31
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:20,325
- Folks call me Smalls.
- Right, Smalls.

32
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:33,665
Can you tell me what this says?
I got a reading disability.

33
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,798
- What kind?
- The type where I can't read.

34
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,302
What are the glasses for?

35
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:46,277
- Makes me look smart.
- Right.

36
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,153
All right, let me see.

37
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:55,123
It says your appeal's been filed...

38
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,088
and a judge is reviewing it.

39
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,926
- That's it?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:08,267
I just got married before I caught this case.
Locked up six months later.

41
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:11,465
I wouldn't be up in here
if I had a real lawyer.

42
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,568
Punk-ass public defenders.

43
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:17,012
Anybody knows anything
with the word "public" in it ain't worth shit:

44
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,279
public bathrooms, public schools,
public housing.

45
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:24,788
You know who becomes public defenders?

46
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:28,054
Motherfuckers who get D's and F's
in law school.

47
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:31,654
I had a better chance of getting
that bald, black brother on The Practice.

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,062
And he ain't even a real lawyer.

49
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,099
Eddie Mathematic want to see you.

50
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:39,466
- Who?
- Eddie Mathematic, he's the man.

51
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:41,869
Nothing go down up in here
without him touching it.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,909
So he want to see me.
Why? I win a contest or something?

53
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,535
Shit, you're like a celebrity. Killed a cop.

54
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:50,605
Look, I did not kill anybody.

55
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,680
You tried. That's good enough for him.

56
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,715
Come on.

57
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,136
Fuck.

58
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:31,250
Jesus.

59
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:37,318
All right, just be cool, all right?
Don't speak until he talks to you, it's cool.

60
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,954
Hey, what's up, y'all?

61
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:42,364
This the guy?
The one that had the thing with the cop?

62
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:45,267
- This is the guy.
- C., watch out.

63
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,272
Have a seat, brother.

64
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,381
- I'm Mathematic. How you?
- Michael.

65
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,781
We good people.

66
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:03,218
I wanted to meet you,
make sure you settled in right.

67
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,452
Nothing personal...

68
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,688
but if I wanted to meet good people,
I wouldn't be in here.

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,059
You want to make your time in here easy?
Get with us.

70
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,765
We'll get you a hustle, anything you need.

71
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,564
I'd be your daddy. You'd be one of my sons.

72
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,306
Make your six months feel like a vacation.

73
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,973
- Your son?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,940
I don't know, man.

75
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,973
What do you mean, "I don't know"?

76
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,510
I get with you, and all of a sudden...

77
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:39,853
my six months
turn into a lifetime subscription.

78
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,758
So what do you think?

79
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,022
You think you gonna just waltz up in here...

80
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,297
do Durty Curt,
and waltz out when your bid is up?

81
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,864
Ain't gonna happen.

82
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:58,568
We got plans for Durty,
and it ain't nothing nice.

83
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,980
Well, you know what they say:
If you want to hear God laugh...

84
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,280
tell him what you got planned.

85
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:10,845
God don't run this motherfucker. I do.

86
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,191
Let me think about it.

87
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,357
I'll get back to you.

88
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,534
Your boy don't understand the rules in here.

89
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:27,435
Let me talk to him, all right?
He ain't quite figured it all out yet.

90
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,565
All right, you go handle that.

91
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:38,382
- Antonio, I'm so glad you could make it.
- I came here as soon as I could.

92
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,650
I was just making David a snack.
Got some taquitos. Are you hungry?

93
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,217
No, I'm good.

94
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,525
- Can I see him?
- Sure, give me a minute.

95
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:00,998
You can come on back.

96
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:04,965
Here, I'll take your jacket.
He's looking forward to seeing you.

97
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,971
Hey, Wade. Sit down, man.

98
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:13,978
Check this out.

99
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:17,886
I couldn't watch cartoons when I was kid
because we couldn't afford a TV.

100
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,925
- I love them cartoons.
- You don't mind me smoking?

101
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:26,230
I'm sorry,
but this location must remain secret.

102
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,156
Dave, how you doing?

103
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,631
You know me, Wade. I'm doing good, man.

104
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,803
I'm a grown man and I got diapers.

105
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:39,469
That way, when I shit in my pants,
my wife can change me.

106
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:44,282
Takes a lot of love and loyalty
for a woman to do that.

107
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:48,949
Especially for a man who can't even fuck her
no more, you know what I'm saying?

108
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:52,615
She's strong, though.
She's a hell of a woman.

109
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,686
Did you stop seeing your psychiatrist?

110
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:57,818
This is my psychiatrist.

111
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,259
Every day I take her out,
I put her in my mouth.

112
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,960
You know why I don't pull the trigger?

113
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,299
'Cause I'd rather use it on
the motherfucker who put me in this chair.

114
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,704
- Man, you can't talk like that.
- What am I supposed to say?

115
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,106
I read the Bible, bro.

116
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:17,009
You know what Matthew says
in Chapter 5, Verse 38?

117
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:21,009
"An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."
Mano para mano.

118
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,446
That guy took my life, Wade.

119
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,847
He deserves a bullet between his eyes.
You and I both know that.

120
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:30,053
- Let me take the gun.
- Get the fuck out of here!

121
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,995
All right.

122
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,507
All right, inside.

123
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:05,629
Goodnight, cocksuckers.

124
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,118
What up, man?

125
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,096
You Curtis Craig?

126
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:52,435
They call me Durty Curt.
Durty Curt from Detroit.

127
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:57,376
- Who are you?
- Michael. People call me Mike.

128
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,281
So what up, Mike? You want something?

129
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,954
This guy, Razor, somebody did him in here.

130
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,423
Yeah, I might've heard
a little something about that.

131
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:10,359
It just reminded me
of when my son was murdered.

132
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,952
You got kids?

133
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:16,895
- Yeah, man. A daughter.
- So you know what I'm talking about.

134
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,297
- Somebody shot my son.
- Look, it wasn't me, all right?

135
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,236
Nobody said it was.

136
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,475
Don't play with me, son.
I'm who you think I am, you heard?

137
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,517
I'm telling you right now,
I ain't killed your son.

138
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:36,213
But if by chance I did have
something to do with it, I'm sorry.

139
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:40,254
- Lf there was something I could do...
- Shoot yourself in the eye!

140
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:46,259
Then you'll know exactly
what my son experienced...

141
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,462
- Right before he died.
- So it's like that?

142
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:51,864
Would make us about even.

143
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,804
But I didn't kill your son.
My nigger, don't make me kill you.

144
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:57,603
Is there a problem?

145
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,511
No, Officer, no problem.

146
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,247
No, everything's great.

147
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,821
So, listen, I talked to my people.

148
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:22,890
And if that bitch shows one hair
of her pale ass on the street...

149
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,593
she's over with.

150
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:28,270
- You'd do that for me?
- I ain't doing this shit for you.

151
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:31,406
I'm doing it for Tori. We need that money.

152
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:34,177
Thanks, anyway.

153
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,739
I know we ain't been kicking it
the way you thought we ought to...

154
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,977
but I'll change all that
when I get out of here.

155
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,020
- Okay, what you want?
- Why I gotta want something?

156
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,886
'Cause you always start
with that "I'm gonna change" shit...

157
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,084
when you want something.
Then when I do it...

158
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,219
your ass ain't nowhere to be found,
changed or otherwise.

159
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,595
All right, fuck it then.
I ain't gonna try to play you.

160
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,760
- You too bright for that.
- I know that's right.

161
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,137
This is the deal.
I need you to see this man outside.

162
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,402
He gonna give you a package
to bring up in here...

163
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:06,637
Hold up, you want me
to smuggle drugs up in here?

164
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,679
Say it louder. The guard ain't hear you.

165
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:12,274
- What the fuck for?
- 'Cause if you don't, I'm a dead man.

166
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:17,218
And a live baby daddy in jail
is better than no daddy at all.

167
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:19,783
You know what? This is some crazy shit.

168
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,294
You got the white girl running shit
when everything is going cool.

169
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,922
But when shit gets fucked up,
you want to run to the sister.

170
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,195
"Hold me down, watch my back."
Risk going to jail?

171
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:40,873
But through all the bullshit
you put me through...

172
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,606
I still got faith in your black ass.

173
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,507
So you gonna do it then?

174
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:50,053
Yeah. Fuck me, man.

175
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,908
Hell, nigger, whose dick you suck
to get all this shit here?

176
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,776
I asked Miss Shepard.

177
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,173
What the hell did you say?

178
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,544
We have a bond, all right?

179
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:30,024
Speaking of bonds, Mathematic
want to know what you gonna do.

180
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,996
- What did you say?
- I told him you were thinking about it.

181
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:35,794
- I'm not.
- Yeah, but he don't know that.

182
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:43,596
How long before you think he figures out
you're jerking him off?

183
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,199
Man, my appeal goes through,
it won't even matter.

184
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,074
It'll be somebody else's problem.

185
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:51,946
- And if it doesn't?
- We'll deal with it when we get to it.

186
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:56,117
But in the meantime between time,
can you read this letter?

187
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:58,485
Mitchell, you've got a visitor.

188
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:26,345
Mathematic, I need to holler at you, man.

189
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:30,246
What went down between me and Razor,
that's between us.

190
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:31,788
I know he was making you money...

191
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:35,257
so I got a connect
gonna bring some product up in here.

192
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:39,492
So 50% of the profit is yours,
if it'll make things right between us.

193
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:42,397
You take the castle with your knight, man.

194
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:47,162
I'm trying to make some peace up in here.
You heard me?

195
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:50,105
Nigger, is you crazy? Dead men don't talk.

196
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:52,171
Ladies.

197
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,278
All right, motherfucker.

198
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,717
Remember though,
to kick some ass, you got to bring some.

199
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,357
Bitch me, you nigger.

200
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,891
How you doing?

201
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,333
You're asking me how I'm doing?

202
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,909
You're one of the smartest brothers I know.

203
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,205
I made a mistake. I'm doing my bit.

204
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,838
You don't end up in a place like this
by accident.

205
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,280
- You brought the boots I wanted?
- Yeah.

206
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,816
Robin's been asking about you.

207
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,949
- She wants to come to see you.
- Not an option.

208
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,552
What you mean, that's not an option?
The woman loves you.

209
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:47,029
I'm sorry she feels that way, okay?

210
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:50,158
And it must hurt like hell,
but I can't love her.

211
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,103
My wife won't allow it.

212
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:12,486
Let him by.

213
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:23,898
You're gonna kick down 25% of your profit
if we take out Mathematics.

214
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:27,026
What, you scared? I'll give you 35%.

215
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,204
"Scared?"

216
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,373
We ain't scared, man.

217
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,275
There's nothing we enjoy more
than killing niggers.

218
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,974
So what's up, man? We got a deal or what?

219
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,643
No.

220
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:44,482
Why should I risk one of my guys...

221
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:48,514
when all I gotta do is just kick back
and watch you niggers kill each other off?

222
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,083
No risk to us.

223
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,725
That shit's better than watching cable.

224
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,400
What the fuck you doing in here, man?

225
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:10,413
I know the game, nigger.
Down one, drown one. Courtesy flush.

226
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,281
Besides...

227
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:18,254
it's too small in here to let it float, anyway.

228
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:20,314
Welcome back, my nigger.

229
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,589
Welcome home, boy.

230
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,180
- You think you can help me out here?
- I'm busy.

231
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:49,549
I got a real problem, Mike, all right?

232
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,316
Now that Clever's out,
Mathematic put me on the book.

233
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,017
He doesn't know you can't read?

234
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,253
I don't know what we owe
or who owes what.

235
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,421
Look, I got your back.
I been watching your back, right?

236
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:03,433
- All I ask is that you help me out with this.
- Let me see that.

237
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,337
They're shitting you, you see?

238
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:10,831
That's the first thing the police tell you:
You have the right to remain silent.

239
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:14,400
That is the first thing a nigger give up.
See, we can't hold nothing back.

240
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:18,210
The only thing white folks say is,
"Can I call my lawyer?"

241
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:19,882
End of conversation.

242
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,715
Unless you a celebrity.

243
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,288
They treat them motherfuckers
totally different.

244
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:28,086
They call them up like,
"Hi, this is the Chief of Police.

245
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,593
"I know you're busy,
I've seen your motion pictures...

246
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,721
"but if it's not too much trouble
can you stop by the station...

247
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:37,495
"say on Tuesday,
so we can arrest your motherfucking ass?"

248
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:40,935
Yeah, and then they be arrogant
with their shit. They like:

249
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,939
"Does it have to be Tuesday?"

250
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,475
See, Snoop Dogg,
he ain't gonna get that call.

251
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:48,341
They gonna have helicopters,
SWAT unit kicking his door in...

252
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,574
while he on the toilet trying to take a shit...

253
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:53,139
and put him in the car
before he can wipe his ass.

254
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,209
If you could fuck anybody,
who would you fuck?

255
00:18:57,622 --> 00:19:00,557
Man, I got 10 years.
So, yeah, I'm prison-gay.

256
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,287
But it ain't about the sex.
It's about the power.

257
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,125
And the look on that fool's face
when you running up in him.

258
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:09,257
Yeah, we know all that.
Now, who would you fuck?

259
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,265
Mike Tyson.

260
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,894
Take his manhood, and I'm the champ.

261
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,439
All right, what about you, Clever?

262
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,240
- POTUS.
- Who?

263
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:24,372
- POTUS?
- The President of the United States.

264
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,817
Figure he been fucking the shit
out of America...

265
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:31,719
it only seems appropriate
he gets a taste of his own medicine.

266
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:33,854
Grudge fuck.

267
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:37,361
You got to tame the beast
before you make him a house pet.

268
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:40,989
All right, ladies, you've had your fun.
The party's over.

269
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,737
- All right, we'll see you.
- Come on.

270
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,739
Please put your seats
in their full and upright position...

271
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:01,645
because tomorrow, it's gonna get ugly.

272
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:03,539
Two of them chocolate milks.

273
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,821
What's up?

274
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,850
Been waiting to hear back.

275
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:20,160
- He's in.
- Is that a fact?

276
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,892
He helped me with the books last night.
Ain't that right, Mike?

277
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:29,038
That's cool. You help Smalls with the books.

278
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,973
But I think you need a hustle of your own.

279
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,378
Getting kind of cozy
with that Counselor Shepard.

280
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:40,040
Got you a bunch of art supplies and shit.

281
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:42,881
I'm thinking, we see what else
she could get for you.

282
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:45,184
Yeah. That's a good idea, Mathematic.

283
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:48,453
Nigger, shut the fuck up.
I'm talking to this man.

284
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,956
I want you to get a cell phone.

285
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,291
$50 dollars a call.

286
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:56,962
Clear $500 to $600 a day. $20,000 a month.

287
00:21:58,135 --> 00:21:59,762
You make a third.

288
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,033
You are fucking dreaming. Wake up.

289
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:08,376
Who the fuck do you think you talking to?

290
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,477
This nigger? Nigger, that's my nigger.

291
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,484
If I want him to,
he'll break your little fucking pretty ass up.

292
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:18,716
You think you can tell me no?
I run this motherfucker. I tell...

293
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,126
We've just lost cabin pressure.

294
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,193
No!

295
00:22:31,736 --> 00:22:34,102
A faggot killed you, motherfucker!

296
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,168
We've got a situation here!

297
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,010
Stay down, motherfucker, god damn it!

298
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:49,877
Revenge don't mean shit...

299
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:54,186
unless the motherfucker you're doing
knows it's you.

300
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,189
God!

301
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:01,325
All available guards to the cafeteria!

302
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,577
Stay down!

303
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,712
Fuck off, man. Get the fuck off of me!

304
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:28,050
Fucking motherfuckers, man!
Suck my dick, bitch!

305
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,559
Fuck you, bitch!

306
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,164
Fuck all of y'all, man!

307
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,782
Once upon a time, long ago...

308
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:34,313
there was a bird.
A big black bird from Detroit.

309
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:40,124
And one day,
he went soaring through the sky.

310
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,530
He tried to land on this telephone wire.

311
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,068
But when he came down for his landing...

312
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:52,637
he kind of missed a step and he fell off.

313
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,473
He lost his balance.

314
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:57,109
Why did he fall, Daddy?

315
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:59,342
- He lost his balance, baby.
- Why?

316
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,545
I don't know. Happens to everybody.

317
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:05,122
Like when you was first starting to walk...

318
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:09,319
when you first learned how to ride a bike,
you had to find your balance, remember?

319
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:12,590
I get it. Like when Mama talks about you.

320
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:14,155
What?

321
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:17,325
She says you can't balance us
with the streets.

322
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:22,131
- She said that?
- That's what Mama said.

323
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,761
What is it? Come on.

324
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:52,765
Okay, relax. I'm gonna give you a hint.
What do you want to be when you grow up?

325
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:54,497
Daddy.

326
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:57,163
- Okay, give it to him, Daddy.
- All right.

327
00:25:57,274 --> 00:25:59,299
Here we go.

328
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,510
Just what I wanted!

329
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,605
- Do you like it?
- Let me get y'all.

330
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:07,674
Look through here.
Put it to your eye. There you go.

331
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:10,083
- All right, did you press...
- Lights, camera, action!

332
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:37,080
Bounce. Someone's good.

333
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,913
Takes out a defender.

334
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:43,086
Going up. Jumps!

335
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:45,111
It's in! Yeah!

336
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:50,123
Crowd going apeshit!

337
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:58,995
Women throwing themselves at him.
What's up, baby? See you at the bar?

338
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,831
- Yeah, to the ticker-tape parade.
- Fine black nigger.

339
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:10,743
Comes off the podium.

340
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,483
He walks into the sunset.

341
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,682
And he's met by two police officers...

342
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:23,291
who arrest him for cheating on his wife.

343
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,588
For fucking a white woman.

344
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,804
What've we got here?

345
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,978
One, two...

346
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,979
- There's three there.
- Three kilos.

347
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:47,211
You know this puts you
in the business of distribution, Chris?

348
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:49,946
I got a problem.
I'm trying to see if I get help...

349
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,682
I'm trying to talk, then you can talk.

350
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,051
If you can convince me
that you're just a consumer...

351
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:59,152
you'll do seven months, tops.

352
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,527
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm a consumer.

353
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,228
I love the shit.
I'll do whatever you guys want me to do.

354
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:09,602
I don't like cops, sorry. I'm nervous.
You can fuck me if you want, dude.

355
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,950
It's been three weeks
and we've interviewed everyone...

356
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,552
including our own people.

357
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,030
About 80% said
they don't know what happened.

358
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,932
20% said Clever, Mathematic,
and Gutter did it.

359
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,561
Convenient how all the cons responsible
are dead.

360
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:44,503
- Which means nobody catches a case.
- Yeah.

361
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:47,842
Not to mention,
the cons that informed on the dead...

362
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:51,244
want all the prison details
and the stuff that we promised them.

363
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,079
- Same shit, different bowl.
- Yeah.

364
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,445
What do you want to do
about Mitchell and Craig?

365
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,148
We can't keep them in segregation
if we can't charge them.

366
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,885
- Return them to general population.
- All right.

367
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,449
What you doing tonight?

368
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:07,293
Well, if I can get a babysitter,
I'm gonna meet with this mortgage guy...

369
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:10,458
and talk about getting a second
on my condo. What about you?

370
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:13,196
My ex got a plumbing problem
she wants me to take a look at.

371
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,771
A little sex with the ex. Good for you.

372
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:48,800
I don't give a fuck what he said.

373
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:51,306
Don't ever bring me back
a book that's short!

374
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,242
I want it to ring out loud and clear
for this motherfucker!

375
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,609
Smalls don't be taking no shit!

376
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:02,244
- Hey, Mike, what's up? They let you out?
- Yeah, just now.

377
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,051
What the fuck y'all still doing in here?
Get the fuck out!

378
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:07,813
Hurry up, man.

379
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:14,659
They took all your shit, man.

380
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,501
Doesn't matter anymore.

381
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,471
What was that all about?

382
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:24,236
I had Shepard read this to me.

383
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:28,972
They denied your appeal.

384
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:33,346
But with Mathematic gone,
I got the gambling, I got the dope.

385
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,281
I got the whole barnyard, man.

386
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,820
I got room up in here
if you want some of this action.

387
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:40,118
You think my position changed
'cause it's you?

388
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,988
You ain't no different
than any nigger up in this piece.

389
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,790
You've committed blood crimes
without prejudice or remorse.

390
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:49,560
Once you've lost everything,
you're free to do anything, nigger.

391
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,965
Yeah, that philosophical shit is all cool.

392
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,004
But what this shit is really about,
is revenge.

393
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,404
This from a man who can't read or write.

394
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:01,037
Well, some things ain't written on paper.

395
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,942
But I do know, for every number one...

396
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,072
there's a number two
waiting to make his move.

397
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,607
And that's how you get back
at Durty Curt from Detroit.

398
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,180
- Are you here to see Michael Mitchell?
- Yes, ma'am.

399
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:17,784
I need to have a word with you, ma'am.

400
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:45,384
- You saw the man outside?
- Yeah, I brought it, but...

401
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:48,049
- I know, I was in segregation.
- No shit.

402
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:50,553
You know you could've called me.

403
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:52,390
Rayvon, I was in segregation.

404
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:55,954
So? Would it have killed you
to make one damn phone call?

405
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,900
And I wasted a whole tank of gas
coming all the way up here.

406
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,335
- The word "segregation" means "solitary."
- What?

407
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:04,840
Don't worry about it. Forget it, all right?

408
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:07,468
I'm sorry. It's my bad. I should've called.

409
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,602
So what's up? You got that?

410
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,912
Yeah, it's at the house.
You want me to bring it tomorrow?

411
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:20,347
No.

412
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,387
But you told me to...

413
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,021
I know what I told you to do, but I'm sorry.
It's for your own good.

414
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:29,327
See, this is one of your tricks.

415
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,493
You're saying it's for my own good, but it's...

416
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:36,164
Come on, Rayvon.
Just stop, all right? Please, just stop.

417
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,664
I know I can't blame you, honey.

418
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:41,903
Ain't like I been the most trustworthy
motherfucker on the planet.

419
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:44,379
But this right here is about our daughter.

420
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,245
Think about what's gonna happen to her...

421
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:49,080
if you get caught
bringing that shit up in here.

422
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,710
What I did, I did. I'm in here.

423
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:53,847
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna take you
down the hole with me.

424
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:57,917
I need you to go to my mom's house
and get some insurance papers.

425
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:01,226
In case some shit go down in here,
you and Tori will be all right.

426
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,995
Hey, baby,
ain't nothing gonna happen to you.

427
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,136
You are a strong black man.

428
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,776
- You know I love you, Rayvon.
- I love you, too.

429
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:42,038
- How you doing?
- That's my question, isn't it?

430
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:44,670
How I'm doing
isn't really much of a question.

431
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:46,174
It is to me.

432
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:48,737
- Did you see the lady?
- Yeah.

433
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:52,577
But it doesn't matter.
I'm just glad you called.

434
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,441
Armand told me you wanted to see me.

435
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,646
- Don't think I don't love you, all right?
- I know you love me.

436
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,748
I can feel it in my heart.

437
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:06,955
The problem is that you can't stop loving
your wife and your son.

438
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,999
I'm a good woman, but I can't compete
with the memory of them.

439
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,932
You shouldn't have to.

440
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:19,108
- Are you seeing someone?
- Yeah, I guess. I mean...

441
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:23,410
- He's a good man and he loves me, but...
- But what?

442
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,675
He can't compete with the memory of you.

443
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:29,116
They say time heals all wounds.
I know it's a cliché.

444
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:32,649
But it's gotta come from somewhere.

445
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:36,017
Look, in time, you'll forget about me.

446
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:38,986
Tell me something, Michael.

447
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:42,293
How come time hasn't healed your wounds?

448
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:46,300
I gotta go.

449
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,579
It's time to get up.

450
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,454
What the fuck, man.

451
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,091
- Chow line's not for another hour...
- Get your sorry ass up!

452
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,924
You be where I tell you to be
and when I tell you to be there.

453
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:54,767
- Capt. Pierce know about this, ma'am?
- Capt. Pierce is off.

454
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:58,470
Don't make me get ugly up in here.
Get your ass up!

455
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:02,136
Now!

456
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:14,918
Come on, you can move faster than that.

457
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:46,951
I gotta tie my shoe.

458
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,429
Get your ass in there.

459
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:03,804
Turn around.

460
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,500
- I didn't kill your son.
- Turn around.

461
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,875
Whatever you got to do, just do it,
'cause I ain't helping you.

462
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:11,777
Turn the fuck around!

463
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,420
What the fuck you want, man?

464
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:33,383
Come on.

465
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:41,894
It's over, man. Come on, Mike.

466
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,345
This is for Officer Teal.

467
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:18,587
Mike. Hold on, man.

468
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:21,061
- Why?
- I don't know. Hold on.

469
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,421
Hold on, please.

470
00:41:24,534 --> 00:41:26,661
There's nothing left to do.

471
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,776
I forgive you.

472
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,140
Hold on, Mike.

473
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,048
Guards! Somebody help me!

474
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,605
I need help!

475
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:06,808
Help!

476
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:48,512
You know, life is funny, Mike.

477
00:42:48,585 --> 00:42:51,110
This happens, that happens.

478
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:56,488
All of a sudden, you find yourself in this life
you never thought you'd have, you know?

479
00:42:56,793 --> 00:42:58,784
You never planned for it.

480
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:01,391
Shit is just there.

481
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:04,727
And the life you thought you'd have...

482
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:09,167
that shit seems so far out of grasp,
you'd do anything to get it.

483
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:20,077
But my word to God, man,
I wish none of this never happened.

484
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:24,045
Call me crazy...

485
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:29,252
but it's like you're where you want to be.

486
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:38,525
And I'm where I need to be.
