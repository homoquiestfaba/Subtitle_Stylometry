John?

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,773
[John] Yes.

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,643

Stand up, please.

[John]
Okay.

00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,881
[Woman]
What's the square root of 225?

8
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,283
[John] I don't know.

9
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,286
[Woman] John, we have been
talking about this

10
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,353
for the last...

11
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,557
Come closer.

12
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:57,959
Closer.

00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,360
[John]
Okay.

14
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,262
[Woman]
And stop saying okay.

00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,533
- Okay.

Take a look at this.

You understand it?

Yes.

- [Woman] John.

20
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,047
[Woman]
What's the square root of 225?

21
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,081
I don't know.

Yes, you do, John.

23
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,524
- Fifteen.
- [Woman] Fifteen?

24
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,325
- Are you sure?
- No.

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,260
Yes, fifteen.

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,297
[Woman] How did you arrive
at that conclusion?

27
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,701
I don't know.

28
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,768
[Woman]
You don't know?

29
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,471
Fifteen is correct.

30
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:46,908
Can I sit?

31
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,977
[Woman]
Yes.

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115

Good night, Dad.

47
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,141
I have to stop by
the office tomorrow,

48
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,443
but if I don't come back late,
maybe we can go hit some balls.

49
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,112
Practice that
two-handed backhand?

50
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay.

51
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,549
Good.

you looked under your bed?

Can you pass me the water?

You take the drone for a flight?

Yeah.

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,198
I hope you read
the instructions.

95
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,900
Always read the instructions.

96

Yes.

What?

118
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,029

You found the bunker?

122
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,904
What bunker?

123
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,540
The hole...

- A bunker?
- Mm-hm.

Sometimes people...

129
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,622
They build these
underground homes.

130
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,688
Why?

131
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,526
In case something bad happens.

132
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:01,862
Something bad?

133
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,898
Yeah, like a big storm.

134
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:09,403

underneath the earth

135

from a big storm.

138
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,581
When was this?

139
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,849
- But after a week...
- A month.

140
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,318
They worked on it for
at least a month.

141
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,886
I don't think so.
There's almost nothing there.

142
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,154
No, they worked on it
for a month,

143
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,722
and then they ran out of money
or something.

144
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,758
They didn't get
their permits approved.

145
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,693
How long ago?

146
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,031
- Hmm, a few years.
- Five, at least.

147
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,966
Five, already?

00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,067
My God!

149
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,403
They're gonna finish it?

150
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,174
I don't know. I'm pretty sure
they still own the land.

151
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,045
Who owns the land?

152
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,947
I don't know, buddy.

00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,886
Yeah.

Watch it.

166
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,482
Knees bent, John, c'mon.

167
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:29,783
You know this.

168
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,088
Okay, finish that swing,
follow through.

00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:58,445
Why?

175
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,247
What do you mean "why"?

176
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,518
- Stop!
- Why?

177
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,918
It's annoying.

178
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:05,986
Okay.

00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,594
- Okay, what?
- I'll stop.

Don't be an asshole, John,
I'm trying to read.

- What what?

182
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,499
What are you trying to read?

183
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,602
A biography,
Alexander the Great.

184
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,836
How many pillows do we have?

185
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:24,905
What?

186
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:25,973
Why are you reading that?

01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:21,809
[♪♪♪]

738
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:42,830
[laughing]

739
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:47,602
Oww!

740
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:10,791
Is there anything you need?
Anything I can help you with?

741
01:03:10,824 --> 01:03:12,192
- No.
- Are you sure?

742
01:03:12,226 --> 01:03:13,628
Yes.

743
01:03:13,662 --> 01:03:15,929
I mean, they've been gone
for a while now.

744
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:16,997
I'm fine.

745
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:22,637
Is someone coming
to clean the house?

746
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:26,473
Yes.

747
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:28,108
When?

748
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:30,679
Next Wednesday.

749
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:33,347
At two.

750
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,087
Okay then.

751
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,155
Wait.

752
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:43,257
Don't go.

753
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,491
Is there anything
you need, John?

754
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:45,794
Yes.

755
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,961
- What?
- Stay.

756
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,731
Stay a little while.

757
01:03:49,764 --> 01:03:51,332
I don't have much time.

758
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:52,399
Just a little while.

759
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:54,669
Okay.

760
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:55,737
- What do you...
- Sit.

761
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:09,684
I'm 13 years old.

762
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:11,586
I know.

763
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:13,420
How old are you?

764
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,623
You don't ask that to a lady.

765
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:17,991
- Why not?
- You just don't. It's rude.

766
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:19,561
Okay.

767
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:23,665
My mom is 50.

768
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:25,999
I know.

769
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:28,703
We had a big party
in this house.

770
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:30,772
I was here.
Don't you remember?

771
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:34,908
Are you also 50?

772
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:38,045
What's with you today?

773
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:39,113
Nothing.

774
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:42,617
Are you?

775
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:45,587
Yes.

776
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:49,957
How does it feel?

777
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:52,527
- What?
- To be 50.

778
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,397
Not that bad, I must say.

779
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:59,166
At first I was terrified,
but now that it happened...

780
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,234
Don't you want the banana?

781
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:03,070
It's all right,
I already had lunch.

782
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:05,906
[sighing]

783
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:08,175
I have to go.

784
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:09,711
- Don't.
- John!

785
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,311
Please tell me
if you need anything.

786
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:12,379
I need something.

787
01:05:12,413 --> 01:05:14,014
- Okay. What?
- I need you to stay.

788
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:15,215
Stay?

789
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:16,283
Sleep here.

790
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:19,052
We can watch a movie.

791
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,288
We have butter-flavored popcorn.

792
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:23,892
I can't stay here, John.

793
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,093
I have a family, things to do.

794
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,231
You know what?
Let me call your mother.

795
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:33,434
- Don't
- Yes, this is crazy.

796
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:35,703
They can't just
leave you here like...

797
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:36,838
Don't call her.

798
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,107
[cell phone ringing]

799
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:44,913
John.

800
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:47,916
She left her phone here.

801
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,423
They left in a hurry.

802
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:05,265
[car starts, drives away]

803
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:12,139
[insects chirping]

804
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,016
[Brad] Hey.

805
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,319
- What happened?
- What?

806
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:28,121
- What happened?
- When?

807
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,990
- Between you and John?
- What?

808
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,627
- Are you...
- Tell me what happened.

809
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,328
I don't know what you think
that you are...

810
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:35,797
You can tell me, Anna.

811
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:37,632
Turn that thing off.

812
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:39,233
- Just tell me.
- Turn it off!

813
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,169
- [Laurie] Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

814
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:43,972
Go back to sleep.

815
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:49,677
I need to know what happened
because something had to happen.

816
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,378
[Laurie] I'm thirsty.

817
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:56,818
Don't drink it all.

818
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:34,889
Nothing... happened.

819
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:43,196
[flashlight clicks off]

820
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:49,537
[footsteps approaching]

821
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,607
- Lily.
- What?

822
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:56,143
- I'm leaving.
- Where?

823
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:58,078
It doesn't matter.
I'll be fine, I just...

824
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:01,583
I want you to know that
you are on your own now.

825
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,284
- On my own?
- Yes.

826
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:08,488
I'm leaving
and I'm not coming back.

827
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:13,995
There's money for you
in a shoe box under the bed.

828
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:16,965
It should last you ten months,

829
01:08:17,532 --> 01:08:19,067
maybe a year,
if you don't misuse it.

830
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,368
- Can I come with you?
- No.

831
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:22,770
Why not?

832
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:24,906
Because you're old enough
to be on your own now.

833
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,608
I'm 12.

834
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,911
- I thought you were 13.
- I'm 12.

835
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:31,646
Well...

836
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,617
You know Grandma
was 15 when she had me.

837
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:38,185
- I never met Grandma.
- Here, eat that.

838
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,088
You told me
we were having chicken.

839
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,154
We're not having chicken.

840
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:44,458
There's no time to cook
a chicken. I'm leaving soon.

841
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:45,727
- Don't.
- I have to.

842
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,562
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

843
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:49,262
They're picking me up, Lily.

844
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:50,531
Who's picking you up?

845
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:51,599
That's none of your business.

846
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:53,166
- Dad?
- No.

847
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:56,236
- Stop it!
- Take me with you!

848
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:57,972
There is no room in the car!

849
01:08:58,606 --> 01:08:59,874
I can ride in the trunk.

850
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:01,408
I can hold my breath
for almost a minute.

851
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:03,310
- Okay, promise me something.
- What?

852
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:07,214
Promise me
you will not quit school.

853
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:08,750
I can go to school
wherever you're going.

854
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:10,018
- You promise me.
- No!

855
01:09:11,019 --> 01:09:12,319
You promise me or
I'm taking the money.

856
01:09:12,352 --> 01:09:15,422
- Take it, I don't need it.
- Yes, you do.

857
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:17,125
- I have the house.
- What house?

858
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:18,225
This house.

859
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:19,827
You don't have this house, Lily.

860
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:21,361
Yes I do,
and I'm going to sell it.

861
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:24,532
We don't own the house, Lily.

862
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,301
We pay rent every month and
the money that I've left you

863
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:30,672
is enough so that you can
continue to pay rent

864
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,406
every month for the next year,

865
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,575
if you don't misuse it,
as I said.

866
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,476
- I'm going to misuse it.
- Well...

867
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,312
Do whatever you want,
it's your money now.

868
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:41,115
- And where will I go?
- When?

869
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:42,182
When the money's gone.

870
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:43,818
That's not my problem.

871
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,287
This is your life.

872
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,923
You get to make
your own decisions now.

873
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:50,490
I don't want to make
my own decisions.

874
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:51,559
Well, you have to.

875
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,064
Okay.

876
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,199
Enough.
That's enough.

877
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:01,869
You are not gonna stop me
from going.

878
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:04,005
I can work for you.

879
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,708
- What?
- I can do whatever you want.

880
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:07,875
I can be your assistant.

881
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:11,879
You are no assistant, Lily.

882
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:15,750
My daughter is
nobody's assistant.

883
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,129
You're nobody's assistant, Lily.

[Man] You got this.

896
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:34,322
Let's go.

897
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:37,592
You're not.

898
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:39,827
- I am.
- You're not.

899
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:40,895
I'm ready.

900
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:43,598
How's your mother?

901
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,533
Good.

902
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:47,335
Still waiting on the checks.
You owe me two weeks.

903
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:49,270
I can pay you.

904
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:51,873
Are you following the diet?

905
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,574
Yes.

906
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:55,576
What'd you have for breakfast?

907
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,778
Low fat yogurt with cereal.

908
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:00,915
Everything okay at home?

909
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:03,150
Yes.

910
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:04,886
Let me know if you need
anything, I can help you.

911
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:06,621
Okay.

912
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,292
- You don't need to.
- I want to.

913
01:13:12,093 --> 01:13:13,127
- Okay.
- Okay?

914
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:16,330
- You don't need to.
- I know I don't need to.

915
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:17,665
Just let me know how.

916
