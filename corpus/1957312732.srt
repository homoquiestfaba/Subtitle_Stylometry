1
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,706
Put your hands up!

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,207
Put your hands up!

3
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,000
Higher!

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,255
Okay, so I'm confirming

5
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,507
I can get rid of that last...

6
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:53,136
Do you still need that...

7
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,345
I'm still working on it but you can

8
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,889
close it out on
an arrest report.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,475
That's fine, if you still need it,

10
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,309
I can keep it for you.

11
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,562
No, that's fine,
go ahead and close it out.

12
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,568
Transfers may be made here

13
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,029
for lines destined
to the Federal Center

14
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,032
and Jetco Government
Center golden stations.

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,034
Next stop, 10th and Osage.

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,378
This is the 10th
and Osage station.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,841
Thank you for riding
RTD Light Rail.

18
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,719
Next stop, 18th and Stout.

19
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,943
- Morning, everybody.

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
How are you?

21
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,070
Sorry I'm late.

22
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,949
Gonna pass out the
syllabus this morning.

23
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,995
Would you mind helping me
a little bit here, please?

24
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,542
All right, everybody, welcome
to the foundations class,

25
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,461
Design Fundamentals.

26
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,255
We're gonna be meeting
every Thursday.

27
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,174
This is an 11 week course.

28
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,762
You get three credits
and I'm your instructor.

29
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,347
My name is Larry Dexter.

30
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,975
The course description, this is,

31
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,353
take a look at your syllabus
here and follow along.

32
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,898
It's an introduction to the
basic principles of design

33
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,234
using a variety of materials.

34
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,819
- That's where it all began.

35
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,197
- What do you mean?

36
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,242
That's when you decided
to become a street artist?

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,706
- I mean, when I,

38
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,541
you know, where it
began was where I wanted

39
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,210
to follow my dream
and go to college

40
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,754
to the study the art
that I wanted to pursue.

41
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,758
- So you would say that college
and studying art in school

42
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,843
was the first step
that started it all.

43
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,638
- You know, at the time,
everyone just wanted me

44
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,140
to make them happy
and try to fit in

45
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,395
but when I filed the
divorce and cut everyone off

46
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,772
and went to school for my
art, I felt like at that point

47
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,066
I was really finally
becoming an artist

48
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,318
or at least taking
the path of one.

49
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,613
- So when you decided
to follow your dreams,

50
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,408
as an artist, how'd
that change your life?

51
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,416
- You know, my dad used
to take me to school.

52
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,835
Elementary, like
fourth or fifth grade.

53
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,965
I remember on the way
I'd always tell him

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,136
what's going on at our
class for today and

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,430
we were doing something,
drawing horse hair

56
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,349
or goldfish scales, something,

57
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,267
and I remember
telling him about it

58
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,519
and he was like, Just stop!

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,941
He was trying to tell me that

60
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
my dream of being an artist

61
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:25,033
was fun but it wasn't realistic.

62
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,535
What I needed to
do was find a job

63
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:32,373
or build up a career that
makes good money to be happy.

64
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,375
And I said, but Dad,

65
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,085
obviously money doesn't
make anyone happy.

66
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,591
He said that it's not the
money that makes people happy,

67
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,971
it's the stability from the
money that makes people happy.

68
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,518
I remember getting
out of the car

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,313
and being so upset
at him, you know.

70
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,649
Just feeling so let down
and not acknowledged.

71
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,153
I decided I wasn't gonna
let this ruin my day.

72
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,363
I wanted to turn around

73
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,947
and try to wave bye
to him, you know.

74
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,199
And by the time I had done that,

75
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,159
he was already halfway
down the street.

76
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,040
I tried to find
financial stability.

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,084
I tried to find someone
I was happy with.

78
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,837
But the moment I...

79
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,176
The moment I really
decided to follow my dream,

80
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,639
everyone treated me
like I was a bad person.

81
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,913
What's this?

82
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,123
- Our divorce papers.

83
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,417
Conveniently you decided
to not have a phone.

84
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,876
- Why, just because I don't
have a phone I'm given this?

85
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,378
- No but it's responsible.

86
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,004
You already missed our first
two mediation appointments

87
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,798
but I had to pay for your fees

88
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,383
and your dad keeps
calling me, bothering me,

89
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,843
asking me where you're at.

90
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,594
So I just gave him your phone
number and your address.

91
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,179
- You gave him my address?

92
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,764
- Yeah because I don't
wanna deal with it anymore.

93
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,598
He's your dad.

94
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,477
- You know what, I really
don't wanna talk about this.

95
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,020
- You know what, we're
not done talking about it

96
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,231
until you understand that
I need these papers signed

97
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,109
so I can move on with my
life, do you get that?

98
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,610
- Yeah, I get it.

99
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,612
But don't you get that I'm
trying to go to school right now

100
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,449
to make a living and to
make something of myself?

101
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,535
I'm happy doing and
pursuing what I love.

102
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,164
I'm not a coward anymore
afraid to chase it, okay?

103
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,749
I was miserable working
for you and your dad.

104
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,084
I really was.

105
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,253
But I'm happy now
doing what I love

106
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,422
and I'm probably gonna
make a living out of it.

107
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,633
Doesn't that even make you
the least bit proud of me?

108
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,885
- I mean,

109
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,428
I feel like I was the
best thing you ever had

110
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,638
and you lost that and you
didn't work towards that.

111
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,308
So I hope you have a great time
with the rest of your life.

112
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,331
- Jesus Christ, man, it
took you long enough.

113
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,750
- I know.
- Come on, let's go!

114
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,295
We've got shit to do today, man.

115
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,426
- This is the third time
you guys have been late

116
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,677
in the past two weeks.

117
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,678
- Not me, him!

118
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,473
- I don't have money for a car.

119
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,682
I have to take the Light Rail.

120
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,601
- Ronnie, Zach has
been doing you a favor

121
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,020
by picking you up at Light Rail.

122
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
- Well, I'm sorry.

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,856
I took the Light Rail
this morning, I was late.

124
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,441
It's not even my fault, okay?

125
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,026
I can't control what the
train conductor's gonna do

126
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,486
or how fast he goes.

127
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,656
- You've got two more stops
added to today's route.

128
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,575
You must have them done
by 6 p.m., understand?

129
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,826
- I got you.

130
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,661
- Really?

131
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,539
- I could sue you for that.

132
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,373
- Oh.

133
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,208
With what money, Ronnie?

134
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,293
- Dumbass.

135
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,127
Let's go.

136
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,548
You know, man...

137
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,219
Your legs must be snails
or something, man.

138
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,012
You're slow as
fuck all the time.

139
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,391
- Faster than you.

140
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,768
- Yeah, maybe.

141
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,602
Probably.

142
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,564
Fuck.

143
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,205
I know you're probably
just gonna say no

144
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,332
but do you wanna take
a drag off of this?

145
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,208
- No, I'm okay.

146
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,630
I'm really sorry about
upsetting your dad

147
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,173
back at the warehouse.

148
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,259
You know that wasn't my intent.

149
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,969
I just was late
from the Light Rail.

150
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,137
You know I can't control that.

151
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,305
- It's just...

152
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,807
If we fuck this up,

153
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,601
if I lose this job,
I'm fucked, man.

154
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,561
I need this money, you know?

155
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,401
- Well, I kinda need the job
pretty bad too, you know?

156
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,528
Despite everything and me
being late, I do need it

157
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,157
because, you know, I've gotta
keep up living at my motel

158
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,409
and going to art school.

159
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,703
- Why're you going to
college for art anyway, man?

160
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,912
It's not like you're gonna be

161
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,205
rolling in dough
when you graduate.

162
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,374
- I can.

163
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,751
I mean--
- Yeah?

164
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,919
- Yeah, like I could
definitely do that, you know?

165
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,212
I mean, there's just
so many different ways

166
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,964
that you can draw or
do your art, you know?

167
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,507
- How?

168
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,217
- I mean, like, for example
like one's about comic books.

169
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,596
So you learn how to do
paneling and symbolism

170
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,098
and everything in
close up, so...

171
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,602
I just thought, you know,
why not just study up on some

172
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,521
of this art and see how
I can change my own, so.

173
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,106
- Whatever makes you happy, dog.

174
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,068
Me,

175
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,694
I'm trying to get this new thing

176
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,613
at a postal service.

177
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,782
It's way better than
a newspaper place.

178
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,950
My dad says he has an in

179
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,620
but I gotta go for an
interview and a drug test.

180
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,164
- Maybe if you stopped
smoking so much weed

181
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,957
in general, or
smoking, you know,

182
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,626
maybe you can get
it a lot sooner.

183
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,172
- Yeah, about that.

184
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,841
Whatever, man.

185
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,053
- But,
hey, I still think

186
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,638
you'll get the job regardless.

187
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,431
- Thanks, man.

188
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,839
- You asshole!

189
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,890
- That's the one you
already threw at, dumbass!

190
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,243
- So, you said that you were
studying your college art books

191
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,953
while you were on
your newspaper route.

192
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,956
Now, I wanna know is
what was the point

193
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,666
at which you
actually figured out

194
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,585
what kind of art you
wanted to create?

195
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,213
Or when was it that you
figured out the kind of medium

196
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,758
that you wanted to explore
and give me the details.

197
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,930
- I mean, I like to sketch,

198
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,266
I definitely like to paint.

199
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,687
I reference Picasso a lot.

200
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,732
I like to study and use
a lot of his pieces.

201
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,527
You know, at the time,
I really just had

202
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,322
this tiny little laptop
that I would just do

203
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,241
all my color and designings
for my projects, you know?

204
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,369
Take it to Walgreens
and have them print it

205
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,746
on paper and poster.

206
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,417
And I actually got in
a lot of trouble for it

207
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,252
with my college professor.

208
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,087
Hi, my name's Ronnie Carlone

209
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,882
and I'm doing the
Cyanotype Process.

210
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,555
Sir John Herschel introduced
the Cyanotype Process in 1842.

211
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,977
It was adopted by amateur
photographers and draftsman

212
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,730
as it provided a simple
and inexpensive way

213
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,401
to reproduce negative
and/or drawings.

214
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,321
Scientists,
particularly botanists,

215
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,533
also loved this process
for its ability to render

216
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,077
intricate details
of plant structures

217
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,330
in a scientifically pure way.

218
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,456
Um...

219
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,045
The skeleton with a lit
cigarette in its mouth

220
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,464
is a juvenile joke

221
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,593
because Van Gogh
painted it in early 1886

222
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,138
while studying at
the art academy

223
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,473
in Antwerp.

224
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,311
The painting shows that he
had a good command of anatomy

225
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,525
as well as his letters
and anecdotes from others

226
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,528
record that he sparred
with his drawing

227
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,406
and painting teachers
and was scornful

228
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,158
of conservative
academic practice.

229
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,744
His time at the academy

230
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,666
lasted only weeks.

231
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,711
He felt he was learning
nothing and later proclaimed

232
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,048
academic training damned boring.

233
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,759
- Ronnie, unfortunately we're
all out of time for today.

234
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,595
I'm gonna have to
stop you right there

235
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,431
and we're gonna pick up with
the next set of presentations

236
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,142
at the beginning of next week.

237
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,978
Read chapters six and seven.

238
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,273
Please email me
your chapter reviews

239
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,150
prior to next's week's class.

240
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,988
Thank you, everybody.

241
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,499
Hey, Ronnie, your art
piece is cool and all

242
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,210
but that was not
really the assignment.

243
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,757
The assignment was to recreate
a piece of art in any medium,

244
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,344
photography, design and
present it to the class.

245
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,554
- Mr. Dexter, that's what I did.

246
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,722
I did the Cyanotype Process.

247
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,350
It's the same printing
and everything.

248
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,436
And I made it my own, I used
a medium just like you asked.

249
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,604
So I don't understand.

250
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,064
- Ronnie, what I
really want you to do

251
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,108
is focus on your portfolio

252
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,612
so you can get a paying gig
when you get out of this class.

253
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,283
No one's gonna pay you for a
cyan blue piece of artwork.

254
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,078
- Okay but...

255
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,290
I don't care about
getting paid for it.

256
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,876
I just wanna be able to get
good at what I wanna do.

257
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,086
So if I wanna do this again,

258
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,504
I wanna know that I
can do it properly

259
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,255
and better than I
did it this time.

260
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,800
I mean, I just don't
understand why you think

261
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,386
it has to be something
people will pay for.

262
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,638
That shouldn't be the standard
of what you're teaching,

263
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,889
in my opinion.

264
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,558
- Well I want you
to get a paying gig

265
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,227
when you get out of college.

266
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,437
You'll get a passing
grade this assignment

267
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,898
but I really want you to focus

268
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,025
and come back
stronger next time.

269
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,654
Focus on your portfolio
to get a paying gig.

270
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,782
- All right.

271
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,783
All right, whatever.

272
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,869
- See you
next week, Ronnie.

273
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,830
- Yeah, whatever.

274
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,956
"The Potato Eaters"

275
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,292
is his first
knockout masterpiece.

276
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,878
It's a resume

277
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,756
of everything he's felt
and thought up till now.

278
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,051
Everything that would make
him a revolutionary artist

279
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,803
is already here.

280
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,644
The dark, thick color was chosen

281
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,605
not just for
pictorial effect but,

282
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,568
you might say, philosophically
to say something.

283
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,865
And that something isn't
meant to be charmingly rustic.

284
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,117
I mean, how brown can you get?

285
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,371
This is manure brown, the
gray brown as he explained

286
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,666
of dusty spuds before
they've been rinsed.

287
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,712
Lost in total identification,

288
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,506
Van Gogh paints like clod,

289
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,428
the heavy, loaded brush
doing its own manual labor.

290
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,226
The picture seems troweled
and dug rather than painted.

291
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,647
The total union between
painter and subject,

292
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,776
it's all in the hands.

293
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,527
- I'm trying to
bring out the idea

294
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,197
that these people
eating potatoes by the
light of their lamp

295
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,948
have dug the earth with
the self same hands

296
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,700
that they're putting
into the dish.

297
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,868
Manual labor!

298
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,496
A meal honestly earned.

299
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,373
Anyone who wants to paint
peasants looking namby-pamby

300
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,583
had better shoot himself.

301
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,128
It's almost as if he's--

302
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,172
- What's going on?

303
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,715
- Nothing.

304
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,846
- What the hell's going on?

305
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,515
I've been calling
your phone every day.

306
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,558
You don't answer your fucking
phone, now it's disconnected.

307
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,935
- It's because I
don't have a phone.

308
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,269
I only have a motel phone.

309
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,064
You probably just called
when I wasn't here.

310
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,482
- What're you doing?

311
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,943
You're a smart kid,
you've always been smart.

312
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,988
You had a good job but you
make some fucked up decisions.

313
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,907
- What, I didn't wanna be
married to that bitch anymore.

314
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm going to school now and
I'm getting an education.

315
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,245
I don't see what the problem is.

316
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,538
I'm an artist.

317
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,081
- Painting, drawing.

318
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,998
- Yeah.
- Do you know how hard it is

319
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,250
to sell paintings and art?

320
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,627
How're you gonna

321
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,837
make a living?
- It's not that hard.

322
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,046
- How're you gonna
put food on the table?

323
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,964
- It's not that
hard if you're good

324
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,006
and I'm trying to get good now.

325
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,720
It'll probably get put on the
table when I turn 33 or 35.

326
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,265
It'll take awhile but I
will get there, I know I am.

327
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,017
- You had a good job, you
were making good money.

328
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,394
That's how life works.

329
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,479
You get married, you have kids.

330
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,605
You build something.

331
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,108
- Dad, I wasn't happy with her.

332
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,694
She just wanted to
control me for her dad

333
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,195
so he could just
use me at his work.

334
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,115
I wouldn't have been anyone
special or meaningful.

335
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,118
- I drove three hours
over here to talk to you

336
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,704
and you look like you have
your fucking mind set on this.

337
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,499
- I don't wanna work nine to
five like you at a warehouse

338
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,293
working with the
same eight people,

339
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,628
inspiring only the
same eight people.

340
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,758
I want to inspire a hundred
people, thousands of people

341
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,302
to think, oh wow,
he's doing something

342
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,180
really impressive and creative,
I wonder if I could do that.

343
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
And then they give it a
shot and they be great at it

344
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,225
or even better than
me, which is amazing.

345
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
- I'm fed up with this shit.

346
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm tired of trying.

347
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,317
- Then stop
trying, I didn't ask you to.

348
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,488
- Do what you want.

349
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,032
At least get the hell
out of this place.

350
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,117
Go fucking interact with people.

351
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,368
Don't sit at a place like this

352
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,870
all fucking night by yourself.

353
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
Go do something with yourself.

354
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,738
- All my dad ever cared
about was a paycheck.

355
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,614
My paycheck.

356
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,909
Make sure that it
was big and stable

357
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,119
for everything I wanted
and needed, you know?

358
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,708
I think,

359
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,919
no,

360
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,048
I know he only liked my
ex-wife and her father

361
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,633
because they had a lot of money.

362
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,303
You know, he offered
me a high paying job

363
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,763
within his company and...

364
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,643
You know, my dad and
school weren't anything

365
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,353
what I thought
they were gonna be.

366
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,360
The next day at work
I was so frustrated

367
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,237
that I fucked up
my delivery route.

368
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,868
Oh, hey.

369
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,786
- Hey, what's up, dude?

370
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,748
So, I kinda got a
favor to ask of you.

371
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,583
So...

372
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,088
I got the home bro
and I was hoping to

373
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,965
spend some time with him today.

374
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,093
Can you take the papers and

375
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,261
do the delivery for me?

376
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,015
I'll even give you the keys

377
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,058
and you can take the car.

378
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,519
These are the routes that
you'd have to hit today.

379
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,146
All right?

380
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,441
It's easy, we've done it before.

381
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,109
- Okay.

382
00:21:59,109 --> 00:21:59,943
- You good?

383
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,278
- Sure.

384
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,195
- Thanks dude.

385
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,697
I knew I can count on you.

386
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,781
All right.

387
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,444
Hey, thanks again, bro.

388
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,280
Yo, what's good, man?

389
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,115
- Nothing.

390
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:28,949
- Good.

391
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,908
Yo, yesterday was fun.

392
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,576
Thanks again for helping me out.

393
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,538
You got my keys anywhere?

394
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,747
We're running a little bit late

395
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,834
but if we get going
right now we could get

396
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,960
the day started.

397
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,461
Oh, hold on a second, one sec.

398
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,381
Hey, Dad, what's up?

399
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,882
- What the hell happened
yesterday with you guys?

400
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,883
- What do you mean?

401
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,512
- Don't act
stupid with me, Zach.

402
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,348
You guys missed half of
your route yesterday.

403
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,393
Four different residential
areas had complaints.

404
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,312
This isn't funny anymore, guys.

405
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,314
I gave your routes to
different drivers today.

406
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,483
- What, I'm sorry.
- That way we can pay people

407
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,861
who are willing to do their job.

408
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,239
I want you to take the day
and think about priorities

409
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,032
and I hope you realize

410
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,242
that you both--
- Yeah.

411
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,744
- Need to start acting
like mature adults.

412
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,579
- Yes, sir.

413
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,706
I understand.

414
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,419
Goddamn it, goddamn it!

415
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,174
- Sorry.

416
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,426
- What happened, man?

417
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,554
- I left the map.

418
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,182
- You left the map?

419
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,602
I mean, that's like numero
uno, besides the papers.

420
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,150
- Sorry, I slept in a little
bit and I forgot the map.

421
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,280
- These people are paying
for our service, man.

422
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,448
Like--

423
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,908
- That is true.

424
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,119
But some people who didn't know
about your newspaper company

425
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,037
now know about it

426
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,872
- Jesus Christ.

427
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,293
You know what, fine, fuck it.

428
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,586
Whatever, whatever.

429
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,964
We've got the day off now.

430
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
Give me a sec.

431
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
Now we can do better shit.

432
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,097
All right,

433
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,766
just chill for a moment, man.

434
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,600
Yo, what's up, bro.

435
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,477
- Hey, what's up, man?

436
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,436
Check it, check it, ready?

437
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,147
So, it's "boobs," right?

438
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,106
- Yeah.
- But it's "boobs"

439
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,733
from the top.
- Uh-huh.

440
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,818
- And then it's
"boobs" from the front.

441
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,154
And then it's "boobs"
from the side, man.

442
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,989
- Damn, dude.
- Because titties.

443
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
- Hell yeah!
- Right?

444
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,659
- Titties, bro.
- What's good with you, man?

445
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,826
It's good to see
you, what's going on?

446
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,495
- Not much, man,
just kicking it.

447
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,000
- Who's your buddy
you brought with you?

448
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,002
- Uh, well, this is Ronnie.

449
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,505
Ronnie, he goes to school
for art and shit, so--

450
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,298
- Hey, Ronnie, come on
in here, you wanna tag?

451
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,633
- Ronnie?
- Sure.

452
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,175
- Come on, bro.
- You go to school for art,

453
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,343
yeah?

454
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,135
- Let's go, art boy.
- Come here!

455
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,679
Come express yourself.

456
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,305
You wanna play
around a little bit?

457
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,139
- Just right here?

458
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,057
- Yeah, come on, dude.

459
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,308
- The whole world's your canvas.

460
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,101
Whatever inspires
you, man, dude.

461
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,269
- Give it a shot.

462
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,562
- Just like "boobs"
and "titties."

463
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,522
- Titties.

464
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,568
Titty king.

465
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,745
- Can I borrow
your white really quick?

466
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,205
- Yeah, sure man.

467
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,039
Here.

468
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,021
Shit's inspiring.

469
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,314
- Dude.

470
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,523
- That's cool, brah.

471
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,400
- Hell yeah.
- I like it.

472
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,087
- Now,

473
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,841
I'd like to take a second
to talk about the first time

474
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,301
that you actually
tagged something.

475
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,054
I think that's a
monumental moment.

476
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,891
- I mean, yeah, it was
the moment I got hooked.

477
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,477
You know, the instant
gratification of
putting your art on

478
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,020
the ultimate canvas.

479
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,355
- The ultimate canvas.

480
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,149
Can you elaborate on
that a little bit?

481
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,653
- Yeah, I mean nothing
beats it, it's the best.

482
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,739
I mean, you just put your
art piece up on the wall

483
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,784
and everyone who passes
by kinda has to look at it

484
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,036
and if in some way
they relate to it

485
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,287
then you just reached
someone in the world

486
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,789
that doesn't even know you.

487
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,000
- So,

488
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,839
so this whole situation,
it made you lose your job?

489
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,341
- No.

490
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,760
I mean, I feel bad that I
fucked up the delivery route

491
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,637
but me and Mr. Satton
talked about it

492
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,180
and cleared everything up.

493
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,557
And as far as Zach and I,
we hung out plenty of times

494
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,309
and he even invited me
out to a party with him.

495
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,186
- A record
of the delightful piece

496
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,729
they're going to
play this evening.

497
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,150
Ladies and gentlemen.

498
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,485
Ladies and gentlemen.

499
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,903
Ladies and gentlemen.

500
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,742

00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,119
Ladies and gentlemen.

502
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,579
Ladies and gentlemen.

503
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,415
Your attention please.

504
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,836
And now the moment we've
been waiting for is here.

505
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,472

- Let's do it!

534
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,118
- Let's go.

535
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,932
- Hey.

536
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,267
- Hi.

537
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,769
- Hi.

538
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,854
You're really
passionate about art.

539
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,274
- Yeah but I'm also
kind of a coward

540
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,776
when it comes to art as well.

541
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
- Why do you consider
yourself a coward?

542
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,574
- I mean,

543
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,868
I knew it would make me
happy almost all my life

544
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,955
but I still never did
anything about it.

545
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,582
- But you're following
your dream, aren't you?

546
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,461
- I mean, yeah, but...

547
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,005
It just doesn't feel the same

548
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,092
because I haven't been
doing it until now, so...

549
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,302
I'm getting there but
I'm just not there yet.

550
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,806
- So what's holding you back?

551
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,936
- For starters, definitely the
number one problem would be

552
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,812
my ex-wife.

553
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,107
I know, it's weird to say.

554
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,279
- Do you miss your ex-wife?

555
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,864
- No.

556
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,365
Uh-uh, uh-uh, nope.

557
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,286
- What happened?

558
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,789
- Well, her and her
dad, they both wanted me

559
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,958
to just be this guy who made
a lot of money, you know?

560
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,752
And that's just not
what I wanted to do.

561
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,212
You know, I wanted to do art.

562
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,964
I wanted to do something
that I could feel was valued

563
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,924
and was impressive,
you know what I mean?

564
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,342
- Yeah.
- So then I would like

565
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,677
wow people, you
know what I mean?

566
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,678
- Three round!

567
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,263
- Oh, shit!

568
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,100
- Well, are you
financially stable now?

569
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,190
- I mean, if you can call
living in a motel stable.

570
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,693
- Sometimes I wish I
lived in a motel, come on.

571
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,071
- Sure.

572
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,699
- So,

573
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,703
do you think that

574
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,749
you might wanna be in
a relationship again?

575
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,835
- Yeah, for sure.

576
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,340
But it would definitely
have to be with a girl that,

577
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,967
you know, is happy
that we're together

578
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,136
because we're together.

579
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,221
Not because the
materialistic stuff.

580
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,307
- That's what love is.

581
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,934
Everyone deserves to be happy.

582
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,520
- Well, maybe everyone but me.

583
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,775
- Look, you can have your
art and be happy too.

584
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,902
Everyone deserves that.

585
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,736

- I own that same
book, actually.

601
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,963
I remember getting it
after being inspired

602
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,423
by Zach and his friend
when they took me

603
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,633
to do graffiti
under the overpass.

604
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,052
- See, that's what
I'm trying to get you

605
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,303
to talk to me about.

606
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,265
I want you to talk about
spray painting graffiti.

607
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,057
Now,

608
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,936
I really want to,
in the documentary,

609
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,649
put together a montage
with these pages

610
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,443
and have you talking
about graffiti over it.

611
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,196
Now, am I asking the
wrong questions here?

612
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,407
Like, when did you start
studying this book?

613
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,491
- Look, I'm just trying
to tell the story

614
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,993
how I wanna tell it.

615
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,662
- So you went and did graffiti
with Zach and his friends

616
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,831
and then you never
thought to do it anymore?

617
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,043
You just wanted to hang
out and party and get high?

618
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,502
- No, I mean, see,

619
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,212
you're not even listening
to the whole story.

620
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,214
This is the first time
I've gone to even a party

621
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,716
since I got married.

622
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,344
That party that I did go to
though was were I met Khyanah.

623
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,180
- Tell me
what happened with Khyanah.

624
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,350
- You know,
after I met Khyanah,

625
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,935
like a little after,

626
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:26,230
was when I actually
first did my graffiti.

627
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,358
Like tried it for the
first time and everything.

628
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,930
I don't know.

629
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,515
I mean,

630
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,809
I feel like a part of
me wanted to get caught.

631
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,604
At first my nerves were
up and I was really afraid

632
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,981
but it felt amazing
to do it, you know?

633
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,235
- You wanted to get caught.

634
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,570
- I just really didn't
have anything going for me.

635
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,864
You know, and to me
graffiti is just like

636
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:21,869
this fuck it kind
of movement and

637
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,413
you know, whenever I do it,

638
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,749
it feels like nothing
else really matters and

639
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,211
that first time doing it
was when I first felt that.

640
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,587
- So,

641
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,673
whatever happened
with those first tags?

642
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,800
Do they still exist?

643
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,011
- I don't know, I
couldn't even tell you.

644
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,513
Probably nothing.

645
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,349
- I just recently found these
surfacing themselves online.

646
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,353
- Oh, wow.

647
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,954
Hey.

648
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,290
What're you doing here?
- Hi.

649
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,337
I spoke to Zach and I asked
him if I could get your number

650
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,590
and he said that you
didn't have a phone

651
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,761
and told me that the only
way I could talk to you

652
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,679
was if I came by
your motel, so--

653
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,681
- Okay.

654
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,100
I just haven't really
had the chance to clean

655
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,645
but you can just
wait if you want.

656
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,479
- Okay.

657
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,859
I was hoping that
you were gonna be

658
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,861
at the get to together tonight.

659
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,988
I was looking forward
to seeing you.

660
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,324
- I don't think I'm
gonna be able to tonight.

661
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,992
I just have a lot of school work

662
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,494
and I got work in the morning.

663
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,707
But if you want to reach
me outside of tonight,

664
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,378
then you could try taking
my motel phone number.

665
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,255
- Yeah, that would be great.

666
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,882
Here.

667
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,716
- Um...

668
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,931
- So,

669
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,729
you maybe wanna grab some
dinner or lunch sometime soon?

670
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,023
- Um...

671
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,486
I'm not in a really
solid place right now.

672
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,157
I mean, you saw this
place when you walked up.

673
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,742
It's really shitty.

674
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,412
- Look,

675
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,122
I don't think you're a mess.

676
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
In fact,

677
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,418
I think you're one of the
first people that I've met

678
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,003
whose got it all figured out.

679
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,800
And it's not your place to
tell me who or what I deserve.

680
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,636
- That night during the party,

681
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,307
I felt like I wasn't gonna
see Khyanah ever again.

682
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,439
When I did those first RC tags,

683
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,692
I felt like I was slowly
becoming someone else.

684
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:49,618
I just wanted to do this to let
this someone I was becoming,

685
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,039
this persona,

686
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,501
I wanted to let it manifest--

687
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,922
- So, did you have a plan for
what you were going to paint?

688
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,425
Where, what, why, when?

689
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,761
I mean, tell me
details like that.

690
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,307
- I wanted to be organized.

691
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,893
I wanted to do everything
the right way I needed to.

692
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,946
- Why did people
carve the rocks?

693
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,907
You know, I mean, put the
president's faces on there

694
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,866
on Mount Rushmore?

695
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,326
Why'd they do that?

696
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,244
They got a big kick
out of doing big faces

697
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,205
or did they wanted
to leave a mark?

698
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,498
They wanted to leave a mark.

699
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,999
See, these people right here,

700
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:41,170
they are our founding fathers,

701
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,548
so we're gonna put their
big faces on this mountain

702
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,342
and fuck who don't like it.

703
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,678
So the fucker got up there
and started chiseling out

704
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,014
his fucking nose and the
eyes and all that shit.

705
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,016
Who gave him permission
to mark that shit up?

706
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,267
You know what I mean?

707
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,228
Maybe Indians had
a problem with him

708
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,355
putting that dude's
face on a mountain.

709
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,148
How come he didn't get arrested?

710
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,608
It ain't no different, man.

711
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,236
That his fucking mountain
that you scribed that name on.

712
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,326
It's not like an addiction
but more like a sickness.

713
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,620
You cannot control
yourself once you start.

714
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,956
If you really understand
what you're doing,

715
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,582
the minute you get
that first tag,

716
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,043
you feel like, I
could've done that better

717
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,545
and you gotta keep moving.

718
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,213
- The
repetitiveness of it

719
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,714
gets really addicting.

720
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,299
Every time you do it,

721
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,176
you're like one step
closer to your goal,

722
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,553
whatever that may be.

723
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,012
Graffiti is about

724
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,014
being loved, hated, whatever,
just being recognized.

725
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,350
The egos, the
beef, the jealousy,

726
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,353
the law, the sicknesses,
the injuries,

727
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,690
the hatred, the violence.

728
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,941
That's graffiti.

729
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,900
Instead of looking

730
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,235
at the person doing graffiti,

731
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,528
maybe they should
look at that cause

732
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,362
of why that person
started, you know?

733
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,704
- Good.

734
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,381
So,

735
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,426
I write poetry.

736
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,890
I don't really read
it to people or

737
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,894
really show what I've written.

738
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,071
- You're really good.

739
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:36,905
- Really?

740
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,075
I want to have them
published in a volume.

741
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:40,909
- Yeah?

742
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,122
- My favorite poet is this
woman, Karyna McGlynn.

743
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,081
- Mm-hmm?

744
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,416
- I wanna buy her work but

745
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,585
I've been reading
her poems online

746
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,964
and they just speak to
me in a haunting way.

747
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,843
Like they're about
transformation and moving on

748
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,095
and letting go in
life, you know?

749
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,765
- Letting go of what?

750
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,063
- I kinda had a
really hard year.

751
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,065
I...

752
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,859
I had a miscarriage.

753
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,445
So,

754
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,531
poetry's just helping
me get through that.

755
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,283
I can express myself through it.

756
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,495
- I am so sorry.

757
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,329
That's...

758
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,123
Wow, I'm sorry.

759
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:28,957
- No,

760
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,127
I don't want anyone in my life

761
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,463
who pushes me away from poetry.

762
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,966
- I think you should definitely
enter those competitions

763
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,636
you talked about, for poetry.

764
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,970
- Thank you.

765
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,805
So,

766
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,183
how's your art career going?

767
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,478
- It's going pretty
well, actually.

768
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,064
Doing a lot of experimental
things, you know.

769
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,149
Kind of seeing what sticks.

770
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,694
- You should do more
than just try though.

771
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,945
Don't worry about it.

772
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,738
Just do it.

773
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,492
You should do
something big, huge,

774
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,327
so everyone can see it

775
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,914
and then you'll know what
direction to go into.

776
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,423
- So,

777
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,757
this is it.

778
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,342
It's how it all started.

779
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,053
This is how everybody
got to know you

780
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,304
as the great street artist

781
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,973
that you are known
as today, right?

782
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,768
- From studying and researching

783
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,312
all the videos about
the graffiti artists,

784
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,606
you have to blast
your name everywhere

785
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,192
and all over everything
that you can.

786
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,070
- Did you feel like
Picasso about to create

787
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,572
a bunch of cubist paintings

788
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,867
or Jackson Pollock about to
drip some color on canvas?

789
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,538
- I'm not sure, I just
know I had to do something.

790
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,415
Because I told my dad I
was gonna be an artist

791
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,668
and Khyanah seemed to
see something in me

792
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,213
and she told me to do something
so big that, you know,

793
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,215
as many people as
possible could see it.

794
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,844
And I wanted to do
the hard work of

795
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,430
tagging everywhere
that I possibly could.

796
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,726
- You can see the
center's real tight

797
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,686
but the op is faded
and the bottom is faded

798
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,564
and that's an up and down fade.

799
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,815
- And I still do.

800
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:17,983
I just kept doing it and
doing it and doing it.

801
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,819
You know but no one knows you.

802
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,238
Except for, you know, the
few who know why you are.

803
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,949
It's like some superhero
shit, you know?

804
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,659
Like, you just fucking
fly up, do your shit,

805
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,827
come back like you're just some

806
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,370
mild-mannered
reporter, you know?

807
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,831
- For me,
writing was a release.

808
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,459
It was an escape from my parents

809
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,669
bitching and complaining
in the house,

810
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,171
it was an escape from my block.

811
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,256
I started writing to
get away from all that,

812
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,425
to assume another identity,

813
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,928
to have a good
time with my boys,

814
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,847
to be down with some
rebellious shit.

815
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,975
You stay anonymous
is who you are

816
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,603
and that's the
whole point of it.

817
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,771
- They're
all like the wind, you know?

818
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,856
You can't see 'em but
you could feel it.

819
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,107
- You
could have this sort of

820
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,193
anonymous thing about
it where you could like

821
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,154
have one kind of view,
portray yourself as one thing

822
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,199
and then like change
into my other costume

823
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,325
and I'm this other guy.

824
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,118
Super hero.

825
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,921
- I mean,
graffiti's basically this.

826
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:25,050
It's one, creating some kind
of letter or message, right?

827
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,385
So we gotta design.

828
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,972
Two, getting the supplies.

829
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,099
Three, getting the spot.

830
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,309
Four, getting to the spot.

831
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,855
Five, attempting it, pull it off

832
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,150
and then coming back
and documenting it.

833
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,944
And that's it, you know?

834
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,826
- The first time I make
certain graffiti was some rats,

835
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,620
some small rats, you
know, like a shadow

836
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,164
running around the
sidewalk of the city.

837
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:01,169
This is the first rat
that I did in 1981 too.

838
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,173
I wanted to invade
Paris with my images.

839
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,259
- Yeah, it's just like
walking and breathing.

840
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,053
If I'm out and I'm anywhere,

841
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,305
I'm stickering.

842
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,975
- I think that
putting up a sticker

843
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:19,146
there's a, not show of
force, but a show of defiance

844
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,356
and a show of self identity

845
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:26,361
that I need to impose who
I am on the social system,

846
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,864
which is what graffiti is.

847
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,825
- You know, leave
your identity or DNA,

848
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,327
a little touch of it
wherever you were.

849
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,039
- And that was part of the
whole sticker community

850
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,540
and that's how it got built up.

851
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,208
People had the same idea I had

852
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,210
of just I wanna make stickers.

853
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,087
- And
it's kinda like my mark.

854
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,048
This is where I crush.

855
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,216
- It probably,

856
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,260
in a lot of ways, it probably
saved my life, you know.

857
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,680
Who knows what I would be doing
if it weren't for graffiti.

858
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,640
- You don't
really choose the arts,

859
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,558
the arts choose you.

860
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,644
You don't pick to
choose the triangle,

861
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,062
the triangle picks you.

862
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,397
You don't choose to
paint watercolors or oil.

863
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,816
Your medium picks you.

864
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,068
I don't know, man.

865
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,903
I didn't paint, I
picked spray paint,

866
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,071
so it picked me.

867
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,490
- I've done a lot
around here, you know?

868
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,409
I felt something and I
will be something, why?

869
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,495
Because I made myself something.

870
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,913
- They're just
out there risking their life

871
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,040
to paint something that
hopefully a few people

872
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,583
might be able to
appreciate and that's it

873
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,419
and I think there's something
to be said for that.

874
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,712
I think that's
definitely something

875
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,297
that's worth taking note of.

876
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,468
- So we've got the
red paint, two letters

877
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,430
and it's gonna be the
first time the entire city

878
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,764
has seen all of this.

879
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,309
Now, would you say that
this was the moment

880
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,644
where you first hit that
artistic expression?

881
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,691
- The biggest thing was
figuring out my organization

882
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,696
and how to achieve my
graffiti and get it done.

883
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,364
- How did you feel as an artist?

884
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,824
Was it different?

885
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,453
Did you feel like you were
gonna get into something big?

886
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,498
- I feel like sometimes
things happen to artists

887
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,667
whether it's success
or failure and it comes

888
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,337
when they least expect
it or deserve it.

889
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,797
- Hold on, are you saying that

890
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,051
you think that some of the
recognition you received

891
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,178
was not what your
artwork deserved?

892
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:48,058
- In the end, it's really
the audience who matter

893
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,227
and it's the audience
who has the power

894
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,897
to make us who we are when
it comes to being artists.

895
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,775
- All right, so,

896
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,403
I'm just gonna go over this
first part for you guys.

897
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:04,783
I want you to list two ways
to create a visual weight.

898
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,534
Two ways.

899
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:10,538
I need you to draw an
example of containment.

900
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,959
It could be any
sort of containment.

901
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,878
Come up with that theory.

902
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:21,383
Now, number three, multiple
choice as well as number four.

903
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,511
All right, everyone
has a pencil.

904
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,097
You have 25 minutes
starting now.

905
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,849
- Hey, man.

906
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,934
Do you have a pencil?

907
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,269
- What?
- Pencil.

908
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,152
- Hey, have you been
on Instagram lately?

909
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,570
- No, why?

910
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,365
- There's this graffiti artist
that's been going viral.

911
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,742
I've been seeing him
on like every post.

912
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,952
- Yeah.

913
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,245
- He keeps putting
like "RC" everywhere.

914
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't know, nobody
knows what it means.

915
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,748
Or like on Twitter,

916
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,709
so many people are
like tweeting about it.

917
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,254
Even Graffiti links, like,
it's getting really popular.

918
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,505
- Jeez.

919
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,424
- And he's like putting
these stickers around.

920
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,341
- What's going on?

921
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,761
- Have you heard of the
new like graffiti artist?

922
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,596
He's been going viral.

923
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,557
Look, so he's on Instagram.

924
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,434
Graffiti Mash posted it.

925
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,061
I don't know, he just keeps
putting like "RC" everywhere.

926
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,105
But like I don't
know what that means.

927
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,315
But...

928
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,567
Look, see, there's the same "RC"

929
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,153
and then he also is putting
like stickers up everywhere.

930
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,112
- They're pretty tight.

931
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
- They're so cool, I'd buy one.

932
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,294
- All right, what're you
guys working on over there?

933
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,838
Everybody done with
their assignments?

934
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,173
Please pass them
up to the front.

935
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,884
We're about out of time.

936
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,013
- You know, I don't
even have to look

937
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,224
through all these to tell you.

938
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,935
When I first saw these,
my first thought was,

939
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,648
the whole world is
my canvas, literally,

940
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,235
and I could just spray,
spill all my frustrations

941
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,861
all over it if I wanted to.

942
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,949
- Tell me more about what you
mean by that, by frustrations.

943
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,701
- I mean,

944
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,120
isn't that why we're here?

945
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,496
The lights,

946
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,914
the camera,

947
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,998
all your questions?

948
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,420
What's that for?

949
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:08,299
- You have not paid for
three fucking weeks!

950
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,093
I'm getting tired
of this shit, man.

951
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,472
- I get paid tomorrow.

952
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,348
- Tomorrow?

953
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,558
- Yeah.
- What?

954
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,435
It's always fucking
tomorrow with you guys.

955
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,353
I'll pick up the
garbage tomorrow.

956
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,896
I'll pay my rent tomorrow.

957
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,523
I'll suck your dick tomorrow.

958
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,732
No!

959
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,276
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do tomorrow.

960
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,403
I'm gonna come back down
here, if I don't get paid,

961
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,530
I'm gonna kick this
fucking door in

962
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,240
and I'm gonna gather
up all your shit

963
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,491
and I'm gonna sprinkle it

964
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,660
across the fucking
parking lot of tomorrow.

965
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,745
You get it?

966
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,038
- Yeah, I get it.

967
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,001
- This is a no smoking room.

968
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,502
- I'm not smoking in here.

969
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,921
- I can fucking smell you from
the parking lot of tomorrow.

970
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,132
So, wrap up a towel,

971
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,758
put it under the door

972
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,428
or fucking smoke your
doobie somewhere else.

973
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,762
All right?

974
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,597
Tomorrow.

975
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,891
And if I don't get it,

976
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,144
I already fucking told you.

977
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,293
- All right, guys,
this Seth Williams.

978
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,711
I'm right here.

979
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,045
Hold on man, whoa, whoa,
whoa, don't move, don't move.

980
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,172
This is Seth Williams.

981
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,507
This is crazy,
we're with the guy.

982
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,550
This is the guy, I found him.

983
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,718
I'm the one that found him.

984
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,719
He's crazy!

985
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,220
Crazy!

986
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,972
So, he's over here, he's doing
his new latest art piece.

987
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:51,726
Hey, it looks like it
says, "We live paycheck..."

988
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,519
It says, "We live
paycheck to paycheck."

989
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,271
So, hold on, man,
don't go anywhere.

990
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,981
Everyone wants to
know who you are.

991
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,483
Everyone, you're all
over the internet.

992
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,942
What's going on?

993
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,902
Everyone wants to understand
what're you doing here?

994
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:01,819
What does this all mean?

995
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,070
Why do you have a mask on?

996
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,405
What're you, some
Batman out here

997
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,616
doing just art
pieces or whatever?

998
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,242
Tell us a little
bit about yourself.

999
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,662
Okay, all right, if
you're not gonna tell us

1000
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,164
a little bit about
yourself, what does it mean?

1001
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,332
Why are you sending
these messages?

1002
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,333
What is RC?

1003
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,626
What the hell are you wearing?

1004
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,252
What does RC mean?

1005
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,754
What does the RC stand for?

1006
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,922
There's fan theories.

1007
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,423
Everyone's asked the question.

1008
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,425
I have my own fan theory,
I've said it on this channel.

1009
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,510
I said it first.

1010
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,636
So, what does it all mean?

1011
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,054
What does...

1012
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,473
What does RC stand for?

1013
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,891
Does it...

1014
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,351
Does it stand for Rattle-Can?

1015
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,937
It means Rattle-Can?

1016
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,979
You know what it means?

1017
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,232
There he is, guys, RC.

1018
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,566
You heard it from me
first, it's Rattle-Can.

1019
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,859
His name's Rattle-Can.

1020
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:42,985
I coined it for him.

1021
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,862
This is Epic Newsroom,
Seth Williams.

1022
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,657
Your boy is out here, he's
out here in the tunnels,

1023
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,908
he's figuring it out.

1024
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,327
He knows all about
the latest graffiti.

1025
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:55,081
This is the latest art piece
from RC, now named Rattle-Can.

1026
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,375
It says, "We all live
paycheck to paycheck."

1027
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,293
Come on, guys, we say it first.

1028
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,754
You saw it here, right here
on this channel from me,

1029
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,797
Epic Newsroom.

1030
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,632
Be sure to like and subscribe.

1031
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,551
Share it, tell your
mother about it,

1032
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,261
tell your father about it
because we're out here,

1033
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,470
I'm out here.

1034
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,931
Your boy, your boy's out
here talking about it.

1035
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,307
We live paycheck to paycheck.

1036
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,141
What do you guys think?

1037
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,059
Like and subscribe.

1038
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,030
- I was just so constantly
frustrated about,

1039
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,201
you know, about how our society
is just all about money.

1040
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:37,957
But then that whole YouTube
video changed everything.

1041
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,379
It was ridiculous.

1042
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,840
Everyone was talking
about Rattle-Can non-stop.

1043
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,760
- All right, who's ready to
give their presentations?

1044
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,554
Ronnie?

1045
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,722
You look like you're ready.

1046
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,765
Go forward with yours.

1047
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:58,811
Thank you.

1048
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,399
- What I did was, at
first I drew it on paper

1049
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,319
with a sketch pencil
and then I used a marker

1050
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,820
for a little more detail

1051
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:11,574
and then I used a computer
and a scanner here at school,

1052
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,409
up in the library,

1053
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,371
and pretty much I put
this into a picture file

1054
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:20,041
and used photo editing
and digital illustration

1055
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,211
software to detail
most everything.

1056
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,714
And also to color the photo.

1057
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,467
These are also
really commonly used

1058
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,677
techniques in graphic design

1059
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,971
and by modern comic
book colorists.

1060
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,182
And this particular
work actually
demonstrates progression

1061
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:40,269
of Van Gogh's artistic style
after his arrival in Paris.

1062
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:43,356
As you actually look
above Tanguy's hat here,

1063
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,983
it's actually a
really great painting

1064
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,737
of Mt. Fuji

1065
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:53,783
and it's also interesting
to note down here with

1066
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,451
Kabuki actors...

1067
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,620
actresses, down here
in the bottom right

1068
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,246
and the left near his shoulder.

1069
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,583
And although he was heavily
influenced by Japanese prints,

1070
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,627
he does not at all veer from

1071
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,629
his own personal style
of portrait painting,

1072
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,797
which I really admire.

1073
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,937
- Look, Ronnie, I
have to tell you

1074
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,940
that you're in jeopardizing
of failing this course.

1075
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,985
I wanna see how you
wanna utilize your
talents as an artist

1076
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,445
to get a job once you graduate.

1077
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,824
No one's gonna pay you to
recreate a Van Gogh painting.

1078
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,659
- You said for the
assignment you wanted us

1079
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,036
to recreate and/or reproduce

1080
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,122
a famous piece of
art in our own way.

1081
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,581
That's all you said.

1082
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,626
You didn't say, recreate,
reproduce a famous piece of art

1083
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,837
and after you get your
A or B grade on it,

1084
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,755
go try to sell it and
make sure that it sells.

1085
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,215
Like, that wasn't the
point of the assignment,

1086
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,467
so I did exactly what you asked
of recreating or reproduce--

1087
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,719
- What makes you happy?

1088
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,180
I mean, why don't you
try to find a way to be

1089
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,100
like this guy, RC, the
local street artist.

1090
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,478
RC, he's blowing up now, he's
on YouTube, he's on Instagram.

1091
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,605
He's gone viral.

1092
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,025
Just find a way to
take what's yours

1093
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,735
and turn it into pop culture.

1094
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,570
- Okay, well first
off, I don't think,

1095
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:17,324
from what I've seen at least,
RC doesn't do pop culture art

1096
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:21,829
and I'm not RC, so I'm not
looking to do anything relevant

1097
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,998
or equal to pop culture art.

1098
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,668
- Look, I just want you to
make what makes you happy

1099
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:30,379
and then turn it into
something bigger.

1100
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,799
- All right.

1101
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,009
Can I get my grading paper?

1102
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,636
- Of course.

1103
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,532
- Ronnie.

1104
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,581
Oh my gosh.

1105
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:12,671
Wow.

1106
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,217
It's a book from
my favorite poet.

1107
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,053
- Why, do you
already have a copy?

1108
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,806
- No, I never got
around to buying it.

1109
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,640
- Oh.

1110
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,477
- Speaking of artists,

1111
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,062
there's something I
wanted to show you.

1112
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:28,896
- Yeah?

1113
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,067
- Have you seen this guy?

1114
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,361
He's all over social
media right now.

1115
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,862
Look.

1116
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:40,282
How come you don't look up
any of this on the internet?

1117
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,576
- I actually don't have
internet, honestly.

1118
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:43,410
- What?

1119
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,620
- Yeah, I kinda...

1120
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,704
Where did I put it?

1121
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,921
I kinda just do
all my work on here

1122
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,297
but I still don't have wifi.

1123
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,759
I draw some of my
drawings in here

1124
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,594
and I'll edit it in here.

1125
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:03,180
Then I'll print it

1126
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,641
and it'll come off
like that poster.

1127
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,102
- Wait, that's your work?

1128
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,395
- Yeah, I did it on here.

1129
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,564
There's "Deep 6, High 5."

1130
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,691
- If you would just
get a cellphone,

1131
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,902
not only could you keep
up with the art world

1132
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,280
but I could talk to you everyday

1133
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,407
and then I wouldn't
miss you all the time.

1134
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,620
- Well, if I got a phone you'd
probably be the only one,

1135
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,955
only number I dialed.

1136
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,043
- Well, baby, my number's
the only one you need.

1137
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:33,878
- You're right.

1138
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,552
- Fuck you.
- Oh, by the way.

1139
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:06,971
- What up, homie?

1140
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,808
- You know that girl
I've been talking to?

1141
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,892
Khyanah?
- Oh yeah.

1142
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,560
That Khyanah.

1143
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,603
- Yeah.

1144
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,105
So,

1145
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,650
we're actually going to
talk to each other more.

1146
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,318
So I got this cellphone

1147
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,361
but I don't really
know how to set it up.

1148
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,529
So I was wondering

1149
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,947
if you could help me.
- What the fuck?

1150
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,950
You with a phone?

1151
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,660
- So, let me stop you there.

1152
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,247
While we're talking
about cellphones.

1153
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,415
- Yeah.

1154
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,333
Fucking cellphones,
what about it?

1155
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,793
- You know I have
to bring it up,

1156
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,004
you know I have to address it.

1157
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:44,258
Is it true that you made the
painting "Cellphone Society?"

1158
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,969
Now, there are rumors that
there was an imposter involved

1159
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,638
and that he may have done
the painting himself.

1160
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,599
The public doesn't have
an actual truth on this.

1161
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,019
Now, we have some
people saying that...

1162
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,437
that you did did the painting.

1163
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,813
We have other people
saying that you took credit

1164
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,982
for whoever didn't
do the painting.

1165
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,277
Now you have the chance to
give the truth to the people,

1166
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,361
right here, right now.

1167
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:09,325
- Yes, I made the
cellphone painting.

1168
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,121
But I make my art pieces
for many different reasons

1169
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,040
but I only do them for reasons.

1170
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,459
I don't just do them
just to make them.

1171
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,052
- Here we go.

1172
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,179
It just pisses me off because
she found my phone number.

1173
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,932
Yeah, she's found my phone
number and sent me this.

1174
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,475
I don't get it,

1175
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,936
why do cellphones have to
dictate everything we do?

1176
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:27,439
- How's everybody today?

1177
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:28,398
Thursday, right?

1178
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,279
This is the wrong test.

1179
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,157
I must have misplaced them.

1180
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,743
Give me one minute, I
have to go reprint these.

1181
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:45,999
How're you doing today?

1182
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:48,418
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

1183
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:51,547
- Yo, guys, did you hear
that Rattle-Can got arrested?

1184
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,048
- What?
- What?

1185
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,676
- Yeah, seriously, it's
all over my social medias.

1186
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,095
- That can't be right.

1187
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:01,515
I thought he was pretty
good at not getting caught.

1188
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,183
- Dude, I have no idea.

1189
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,476
Just Google it.

1190
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:06,061
It's gonna be there.

1191
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,190
- And
now he's in custody.

1192
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,441
The police department

1193
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,734
working on the case
since last month.

1194
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,361
- You didn't
do any of these?

1195
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,863
- I can't say I did,
I can't say I didn't, man.

1196
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,782
You know, you got
all them pics, man.

1197
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,200
You got all them answers.

1198
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,451
- All right,
that's why I'm asking.

1199
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,370
All right, stand up, man.

1200
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,372
Put your hands behind your back.

1201
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,207
Put your hands behind
your back.

1202
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,375
Put your hands behind your back.

1203
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,626
All right.

1204
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:32,713
Ma'am, can you step back
real quick, thank you.

1205
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:33,672
Nope.

1206
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:34,881
- 20 years old,

1207
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,049
is the man behind
multiple graffiti tags

1208
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,259
throughout the city.

1209
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,594
Take a look at this
video right here.

1210
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,345
They estimate the
total cost for damages

1211
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,680
and clean up for the incidents

1212
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,849
more than five thousand dollars.

1213
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,443
- Okay, here's the most recent
news apparently had to say.

1214
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,487
"This review today is
about his final art piece

1215
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,281
"and the artwork appears
to be of a zombie

1216
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,992
"with his head displayed
as a cellphone.

1217
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,410
"The statement with
the artwork proclaims,

1218
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,454
"We are a cellphone society

1219
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,415
"and we personally find this
contradicting art piece,

1220
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,584
"which lacks imagination,

1221
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:13,128
"and this statement
seems to claim

01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,590
"phone and the internet are
used to brainwash the public.

1223
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,176
"If the intent

1224
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,886
"awareness toward technology,

1225

"then maybe Rattle-Can
should consider that

1226
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,098
"we as a people
influence the media.

1227
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,895
"The media and social
world have been picked on

1228
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,064
"for spreading
ignorance in the past.

1229
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,482
"The real ignorance
is to believe

1230
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,026
"people don't have
independent thought.

1231
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,819
"But we say to Rattle-Can

1232
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,155
"as it is best to consider
one important fact,

1233
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:45,035
"technology, the
internet and phones

1234
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,287
"are literally
the only reason...

1235
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,503
"Are literally the only
reason that Rattle-Can...

1236
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,381
"was considered an artist.

1237
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,219
"This is a career short-lived
and we should all celebrate

1238
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,429
"another talentless
vandal behind bars."

1239
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,976
So, I don't know about you guys

1240
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:14,523
but that sounds like complete
and utter bullshit to me.

1241
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,191
And, I don't know...

1242
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,527
I don't know about you guys,

1243
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,487
but I think everyone's
getting a little too offended

1244
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,697
by such a little thing.

1245
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,824
It's just frustrating.

1246
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,191
- What's the matter with you?
- Come on.

1247
01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:59,818
- What did
you wanna talk about?

1248
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,282
- Have you heard
what's going on?

1249
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,120
This fucking stupid ass phone.

1250
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,000
- Yeah, it's all
over social media.

1251
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,545
But the guy was caught, his
art piece sucks, so what?

1252
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,339
What's going on
between you and me?

1253
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:24,342
- What are you and me?

1254
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,012
- What do you mean?

1255
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,597
- Like, what are we?

1256
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:31,349
- I don't know.

1257
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:35,854
- You know, Khyanah,

1258
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,732
I was doing really well
with my art career.

1259
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,942
I had people
appreciating my art,

1260
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,277
they were talking about it

1261
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,739
and people were actually
talking about me

1262
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,991
and who I was making it

1263
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,952
and now they're not because
I got a fucking cellphone

1264
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:55,165
like you asked and it just
completely ruined everything.

1265
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:55,999
Okay?

1266
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,169
- What are you talking about?

1267
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,338
- The phone, Khyanah,
the cellphone!

1268
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,589
Literally going
the polar opposite

1269
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,090
of what an artist should be.

1270
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:05,634
The fact that I don't have
an art career anymore.

1271
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:06,426
Bullshit!

1272
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:14,768
- It's you.

1273
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:16,019
You're him.

1274
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:18,814
It's been you this
whole entire time?

1275
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,440
- Yeah, it's been me

1276
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,983
but it's fucked now
because you had me

1277
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,401
get that fucking phone!

1278
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,197
My whole career's ruined now.

1279
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,910
- Look, Ronnie, I
know who you are

1280
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,495
and who you are is amazing.

1281
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,582
But those people that are
appreciating your artwork,

1282
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,667
they don't even
know who you are.

1283
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,876
You're hiding behind a mask.

1284
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,586
- You don't know who I am!

1285
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,049
- I'm falling in love
with you for who you are.

1286
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,095
But if you want to
hide behind a mask,

1287
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,723
I'm not gonna hold you
back, not for a second.

1288
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:55,976
Good luck with your life
and your art career.

1289
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,354
- Good luck
with your fucking poetry.

1290
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,657
- I'm sure that must've
been really tough.

1291
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:20,876
What was it that helped
you cope with everything

1292
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,336
after she wasn't around anymore?

1293
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:27,966
And what was it that
kept you moving forward?

1294
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:31,386
Was it the art that kept
on keeping you going?

1295
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,270
- Look, I...

1296
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:46,192
I pretty much just gave up
on everything at that point.

1297
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:14,354
- Hands up!

1298
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,939
Put your hands up!

1299
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,106
Higher!

1300
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:18,024
Don't move!

1301
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,534
Don't move.
