1
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,835
Nurse Evelyn! Nurse Evelyn!

2
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,714
I have a message for you. In English!

3
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,484
And here we go.

4
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,989
Now, look, here's the list of all the patients
we've had in the ward in the last month.

5
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,539
Thank you, Nurse.

6
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,859
-You're Alexandria?
-Yes.

7
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:05,155
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.

8
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,449
Couldn't even understand it.
It's written in gibberish or something.

9
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:12,287
You didn't understand it, didn't you,
didn't understand it, it's not for you.

10
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,126
My name's Roy.

11
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,798
-How'd you hurt your arm?
-I fell.

12
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,050
Me too.

13
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,968
I was picking oranges.

14
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,764
Is that so?

15
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,227
How do you go to the potty?

16
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,397
I don't. They let me go right here.

17
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,191
-In bed?
-Yeah, it's true.

18
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,859
I don't believe.

19
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,988
Hey, Alexandria.

20
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,617
Hey, do you know
you're named after Alexander the Great

21
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,495
who was the greatest warrior
who ever lived?

22
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,332
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish.
It's in English!

23
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,876
Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.

24
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,672
I can see you hiding.

25
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,341
Alexandria.

26
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,890
Hey, did you know
he was also looking for a message?

27
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,312
He was lost.

28
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,611
He almost died, separated from his army.

29
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,283
-Did he find the message?
-What?

30
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,036
Did she find the message?
Alexandria the Great.

31
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,873
All right, right, I'll tell you,
just come in here.

32
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,252
Now, come on, grab that chair right there.

33
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,799
All right, don't break your other arm.

34
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,182
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

35
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,315
-What's in your box?
-Things I like.

36
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,612
-Things you stole?
-No.

37
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,573
A photo.

38
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,243
Where'd you get the elephant?

39
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,705
My friend gave it to me at work.

40
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,709
He's from India.

41
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:28,131
Look, this is my horse

42
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,094
-and this is my father.
-Yeah?

43
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,599
He's got the same gap in his teeth,
must run in the family.

44
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,352
-Yeah, and here is my house.
-Oh, yeah?

45
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,938
-It was my house.
-What happened?

46
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,607
-They burn it.
-Who burned it?

47
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,984
Angry people.

48
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,446
I'm sorry to hear that.

49
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,533
I said, I'm sorry to hear that.

50
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,701
Angry people.

51
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,538
Yeah, I know,
I'm just sorry that your house got burned.

52
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,873
Why did Alexander

53
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,045
didn't go from that buildings on his horse?

54
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,423
-If him was lost...
-What?

55
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:16,513
Why did Alexander didn't go
from that middle of the buildings

56
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,641
from that buildings on his horse?

57
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,310
Well...

58
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:30,485
First of all, he didn't have a horse
because his horse was killed in a battle.

59
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,032
And he wasn't
in the middle of any old buildings.

60
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:42,455
He was lost in the middle of a vast desert,
full of orange sand

61
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,583
with only a handful of men

62
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,296
but they didn't have any water.

63
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,194
Look!

64
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,140
"My Lord, all hope is lost.

65
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,102
"It seems your mighty army
shall finally be conquered.

66
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:51,483
"Not by the Persians, but by our own greed
and gluttony for water.

67
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,569
"This helmet contains our last supply.

68
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,407
"Oh, King,
I believe your wisdom shall save us all."

69
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,335
-Why?
-Why?

70
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,503
What?

71
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,005
Why?

72
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,636
Well, because there wasn't
enough water for all of them

73
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,222
and it was Alexander the Great's way

74
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,849
of showing his army
that they were all equal...

75
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,768
It's stupid.

76
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,186
What would you do better?

77
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,855
Was Alexander throw the water

78
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,694
instead to give every soldier a little bit.

79
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,370
Hey, why don't you come back tomorrow
and I'm going to tell you a different story.

80
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,290
An epic tale of love and revenge.

81
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,668
-You know what "epic" means?
-No.

82
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,962
I still got this tightness here.
It's like I can't even...

83
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,382
It means a really long story,
and it's set in India.

84
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,842
...the elephant sitting on my chest.

85
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,844
-You should be fully recovered.
-All right, go on.

86
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,846
-I want you to examine me.
-Will you come back tomorrow?

87
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,682
You personally. I'm not very well.

88
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,525
The swelling seems down.

89
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,696
I know how much it hurts.

90
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,993
A sense of humor.

91
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:29,330
In the next couple of weeks the pain
should abate, then one more operation.

92
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,166
Like the last one?

93
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,252
This is going to take some effort
on your part, too, you know that?

94
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,462
See?

95
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,844
Come on, then.

96
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,618
-Be back before lunch.
-Okay.

97
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,806
Alexandria, get away from that ice.

98
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,851
I see you licking that ice,
you're gonna get sick.

99
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,894
I want you to go play, go!

100
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,106
Next time, I'll glue your lips to this
and carry you away.

101
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,198
You're lucky it was just a horse
that got killed.

102
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,286
I mean, jumping off a train bridge
was suicide, too.

103
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,454
And if you were trying to impress her...

104
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,458
Sinclair already did a better job.

105
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,294
You know, the actor,

106
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,506
-the leading man.
-I know who he is.

107
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,844
Every cloud has a silver lining,
that's for sure.

108
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,970
Take another card.

109
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,639
-You know, before my accident...
-That is the Queen of Hearts.

110
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,057
...nothing was happening for me.

111
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,728
Now I've had my leg hacked off by savages,

112
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,565
mangled by chariots,
sawed off by lumberjacks.

113
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,819
Hell, I've even had a harpoon through it.
I'm working all the time.

114
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,659
That is the two of spades.

115
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,704
-The studio is just trying to do right by you.
-Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.

116
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,915
Take the money.

117
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,251
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.

118
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,628
You're a college man.

119
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,754
Wasn't me.

120
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,505
One cripple to another...

121
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,926
I didn't throw orange at you.

122
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,094
...no woman is worth suicide.

123
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,514
Like the guy's a movie star, for chrissake.

124
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:57,038
Was your friend a pirate?

125
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,083
Sometimes.

126
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,963
Is that how he hurt his leg?

127
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,133
No, he... He does tricks for pictures.

128
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,970
You know, flickers.

129
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,972
Moving pictures.

130
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,059
-I never seen one.
-You're not missing much.

131
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,896
Is that what you do, like your friend?

132
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,149
Just once.

133
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,280
Will you tell me the story now?

134
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,909
-What story?
-The epic.

135
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,081
All right.

136
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,544
All right, close your eyes.

137
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,923
What do you see?

138
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,634
Nothing.

139
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,763
Rub them.

140
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,267
Can you see the stars?

141
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,061
Yes.

142
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,356
It was a starry night.

143
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:10,194
Four men waited impatiently
on a small island

144
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,239
surrounded by a calm sea.

145
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,534
But that calmness was deceptive.

146
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,708
For at that moment

147
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:28,212
an Indian with a bandaged thigh
swam towards them.

148
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,679
Tell me, Indian.

149
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,140
Is it true?

150
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,355
Luigi, is what true?

151
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,527
Governor Odious will execute
your twin brother tomorrow morning.

152
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,489
My poor brother.

153
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,623
In all, there were five of them.

154
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,375
They had only one thing in common,

155
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,378
a hatred of Governor Odious.

156
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,676
The first was an ex-slave, Otta Benga.

157
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,938
He and his brother were born into slavery

158
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,150
only to fill the coffers
of the evil Governor Odious.

159
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,073
One day while toiling in the fields...

160
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,174
Heartbroken at his brother's death,
he freed the slaves

161
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,679
and swore that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death.

162
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,767
I like him.

163
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,146
Then, there was the Indian,

164
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,066
who, whenever anxious,
always stroked his brow.

165
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:22,994
The Indian was supposedly married
to the most beautiful squaw in the world

166
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,705
yet nobody had seen her.

167
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:30,209
To verify this,
Odious disguised himself as a leper

168
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,297
but when he saw her reflection,
he was smitten.

169
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:43,139
Locking the doors to his wigwam,
the Indian stood guard.

170
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,185
Little did he know,
he was guarding an empty home

171
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:52,231
for his wife had already been kidnapped
by the evil Governor Odious.

172
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,986
But the squaw refused
to show herself to him.

173
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,948
So, Odious had her thrown
into the Labyrinth of Despair.

174
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,707
Eventually she realized
there was only one way out.

175
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,141
While mourning his wife's death

176
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,770
the Indian took a blood oath
never to look at another squaw

177
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,690
and that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death.

178
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,988
I like him, too.

179
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,159
Luigi was an explosive expert.

180
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,915
When Odious heard
about the power of his new bombs,

181
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,251
he had him publicly banished.

182
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:58,130
On his return, Luigi discovered
that everybody hid from him

183
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,635
because even speaking to him
was punishable by death.

184
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,056
But when his own priest refused
to hear his confession,

185
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,063
Luigi swore that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death!

186
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,154
Next was the English naturalist

187
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,783
Charles Darwin.

188
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,036
He loved all living things,

189
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,041
creatures, plants, everything alive.

190
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,006
Darwin was always accompanied
by his shy, brilliant colleague,

191
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,299
Wallace the monkey.

192
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,925
What is that, Wallace?

193
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,305
I don't know why flamingos are pink.

194
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,309
Even though they had developed
many theories together

195
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,895
they were still looking for something.

196
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,941
-What?
-Butterfly.

197
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,986
That's a good guess.

198
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,824
In fact, a very specific butterfly

199
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,328
called Americana Exotica.

200
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,166
One day, Odious sent them a dead one.

201
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,215
Butterfly Reef.

202
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:30,598
This Odious, it's bad man?

203
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,142
Oh, yeah.

204
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,103
Butterfly Reef.

205
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,941
That's where Governor Odious
chose to banish our heroes,

206
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,819
to mock them,

207
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:50,159
hoping that in their fight for survival
they would devour each other.

208
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,872
So, the buccaneers
were trapped on this island.

209
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,791
What means a buccaneer?

210
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:02,380
Well, it's like a pirate. Pirate and buccaneer,
it's like the same thing.

211
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,840
But I don't like pirate stories.

212
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,595
You're the one who asked for a pirate story.

213
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,056
-No.
-Yes, you did.

214
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,895
I just wanted to know
if your friend was a pirate.

215
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,774
-Why?
-Because he has just one leg.

216
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,568
Oh, right.

217
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,324
Well, yeah, it's not a pirate story.
It's a story about bandits.

218
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,412
In fact, our masked hero
couldn't even swim.

219
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,124
I need to learn to swim.

220
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:47,341
Finally, very little was known about
the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.

221
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,511
-Like my father?
-Yes, your father.

222
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,809
Except that he and his twin brother,
the Blue Bandit,

223
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,688
had escaped execution
from the Spanish Governor Odious.

224
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,734
Knowing that their chances of survival
were better apart

225
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,279
the two brothers separated

226
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,866
swearing that
they would kill Governor Odious.

227
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,706
We must conceive a plan!

228
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,544
I need to get off this island,
and rescue my twin brother.

229
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,887
What? What?

230
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,974
All elephants?

231
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,361
I say, we...

232
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,620
I have an idea.

233
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,865
Darwin! That was a great idea!

234
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,717
Come on, Otta Benga!

235
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,192
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!
Have a nice swim!

236
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:20,160
Darwin, you are a genius!

237
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,745
Much obliged!

238
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,290
Where do you get these ideas?

239
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,122
What is it, my friend?

240
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,921
How sad. The tortures of this world
have driven the poor man mad.

241
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,715
Not true.

242
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,718
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult

243
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,891
to help us against Governor Odious
and his Spanish henchmen.

244
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:13,607
This region was once a lush forest
alive with birds and sacred trees

245
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,530
but Odious had them all burned down.

246
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:24,993
He also says the birds are safe
inside his belly

247
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,747
but we must take care
for only the fittest shall survive.

248
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,917
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.

249
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,256
We are on a dangerous mission.

250
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,678
We need to hurry to the fort
to save my twin brother.

251
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,805
He will only slow us down.

252
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,812
Fish, señor!

253
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,075
Stand aside, my friend.

254
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,204
Before you say kaboom,
I have this door open.

255
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,543
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.

256
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,130
Undoubtedly, you have a flair
for war-mongering.

257
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,802
It would be my honor
if you consider joining us

258
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,345
on our quest.

259
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,726
We must save your brother!

260
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,028
First,

261
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,658
a little test.

262
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,410
You can't stop there.

263
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:58,290
I just wanna play a little game. I want you
to go outside and touch one of my toes.

264
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,085
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the Blue Bandit?

265
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,837
It won't take long.

266
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,090
-Just go outside and touch one of my toes.
-Okay.

267
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,431
-I'm touching your little toe.
-No!

268
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,685
Please don't tell me
which toe you're touching. I gotta guess.

269
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,688
That's the whole point of the game.
All right.

270
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:30,739
I'm touching one.

271
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,993
You're touching my big toe?

272
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,248
Are you telling the truth?

273
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,755
Look.

274
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,510
Really.

275
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,263
Oh, I got that?

276
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,099
What happened?

277
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,059
What happened with his brother?
Did he save him?

278
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,020
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?

279
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,066
No, no, no.
Were you telling the truth just now?

280
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,277
No. I was telling the truth.

281
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,488
No. You just said no,
you weren't telling the truth.

282
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,156
No, I tell you it.

283
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,867
-Were you telling the truth?
-Yeah.

284
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,203
When you just touched my toe?

285
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,250
-You little liar.
-No.

286
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,130
Alexandria, were you lying to me?

287
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,800
I touch your big toe.

288
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,262
We need to hurry!

289
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,057
Do you want me to finish the story?

290
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,187
The Masked Bandit arrived
at the Chandelier Hall too late.

291
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,609
Odious had already
tortured his brother and crew

292
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,194
and hung them.

293
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:14,092
All right, that's it! It's not a circus.
It's not a playground for all your...

294
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,553
Please! Are you listening to me?

295
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,722
Get out of here!

296
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,349
-You leave her alone.
-Come here, baby.

297
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,226
Get off! Goddamn!

298
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,274
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here,
come here. Come on.

299
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,125
Dad?

300
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,794
-Dad? Dad?
-I'm not feeling real well.

301
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,045
-What do you want?
-He's doing it again.

302
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,214
Will you stop that? Leave him alone!

303
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,663
-What's that?
-Food.

304
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,124
-Where'd you get it?
-The chapel.

305
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,882
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

306
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,468
I was angry.

307
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,928
No problem.

308
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,933
Are you trying to save my soul?
Are you trying to save my soul?

309
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,563
-Do you understand me?
-What?

310
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,774
-Did you understand what I meant?
-What you said?

311
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,611
I said, are you trying to save my soul?

312
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,864
-Giving me that.
-What mean that?

313
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,283
The Eucharist. It's a...

314
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,869
What?

315
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,164
The Eucharist.
The thing you gave me. It's a...

316
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,000
It saves your soul.

317
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,171
The thing I gave to you, what?

318
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,175
The little piece of bread
that you just gave me.

319
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,968
It saves your soul.

320
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,223
-What? What? What?
-Are you worried about me?

321
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,892
Saves your soul.
Do you know what "soul" means?

322
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,478
-No.
-It's like strength.

323
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,735
Why does the old man
keep his teeth in a glass at night?

324
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:25,242
It's where he keeps his strength, his spirit.

325
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,163
His spirit is in those teeth.

326
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,417
Yeah.

327
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,671
Oh, you're missing a little strength

328
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,341
right in the front of your mouth.

329
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,763
The chapel's in the main block, isn't it?

330
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,391
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?

331
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,061
I'm sorry.

332
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,356
It's okay.

333
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,904
They keep the medicine in the main block,
don't they?

334
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,239
Yes.

335
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,638
That which has been taken from me
can never be replaced.

336
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,808
My brother...

337
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,728
-Why he speaks like this?
-Because he's your father.

338
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,688
But my father is dead.

339
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,024
What?

340
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,529
Okay, how do you want me...
How do you want him to speak?

341
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,448
I think of all the joys we had.

342
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,742
Normal, like you.

343
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,411
I could've saved you, but I was weak.

344
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,916
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.

345
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,087
I'm stronger now.

346
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:09,429
I will search the four corners of this Earth,
find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!

347
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,852
By the Blue Bandit's honor, I swear

348
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:20,106
I will annihilate him
and everything that he loves!

349
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:31,368
I will destroy him! I will destroy him!

350
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,746
Destroy him! I will destroy him!

351
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,379
And every Spanish thing.

352
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,757
I thought he was Spanish.

353
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,801
No.

354
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,221
He was French.

355
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,306
Are you with me, bandits?

356
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,791
Darwin! Which way to Governor Odious?

357
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:25,380
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.

358
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,924
Are we lost?

359
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,134
Sorry, Capitaine.

360
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,303
Hey! No!

361
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,852
Hey! You can't eat it, it's poisonous!

362
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,195
What's he saying?

363
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,616
He says we should follow him
to greener pastures!

364
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,495
-What?
-He say it's greener down there.

365
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,623
Green? Down where?

366
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,791
I don't know.

367
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,002
To greener pastures!

368
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,587
Slow down!

369
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,884
The birds in his belly
crave greener pastures!

370
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,013
Hey! It is greener down there.

371
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,724
Greener pastures.

372
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,227
Slow down!

373
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:35,658
Please don't run!
The poison works faster if you run!

374
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,666
Slow down.

375
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,553
It's poisonous.

376
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,063
What?

377
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,412
He's giving us directions.

378
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,569
Go!

379
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,916
Slaves!

380
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,263
Odious's flag.

381
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,438
We must free the slaves.

382
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,289
Tell me, Alexandria, do you read English?

383
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,503
You always stop at the same part
when it's very beautiful

384
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,089
and interesting.

385
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,342
I just wanted to know
if you can read English.

386
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,760
Can you?

387
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,389
-Can you read English?
-Yeah.

388
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,058
-What's this?
-Paper.

389
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,936
No. What's this? This.

390
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,441
M-o-r-p-h...

391
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,569
Three.

392
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,446
-What's that?
-Three.

393
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,905
That's good.

394
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,912
I'm having a hard time sleeping
and I can't remember that story.

395
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,209
I need some pills.

396
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,380
I need pills in a bottle
that has this written on them.

397
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,592
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three?

398
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,636
Yes. And it's in the main block.

399
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,184
In that room in the main block.

400
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,647
You understand?

401
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,276
-Ask the head nurse.
-I'm asking you as a friend.

402
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,863
-But it's stealing.
-No, it's not. Not if you need it.

403
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,202
It's no different
than stealing bread from a church.

404
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,081
-I'll ask them for you.
-No.

405
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,710
It's a bandit secret.

406
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,757
I need the pills
to finish the story. Understand?

407
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,052
-I can't get it...
-I'll do it.

408
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,471
Thanks.

409
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,068
You look beautiful.

410
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,198
Why do you put red on your cheeks?

411
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:13,454
Because it makes you look pretty

412
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,336
and healthy, too.

413
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,175
-Remember, back before lunch.
-I know!

414
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,970
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?

415
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,597
No. Thank you! Bye!

416
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,320
One bite maybe. But a pit of snakes?

417
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:37,038
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three. M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

418
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,003
M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

419
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:18,788
Maybe you got...
I know it's important that you listen to me.

420
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,873
You've gotta think of your other children.

421
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,709
I'm so sorry.

422
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,546
You have to warn your other children
about the sounds of rattlesnakes.

423
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:32,468
This isn't a good time.
There are snake pits all over this area.

424
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,812
Wake up! Wake up!
You better get up or they'll chop you.

425
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:47,149
You get up! You better get up
and show these people you are sleeping.

426
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,653
These men will chop you if you don't get up.
Get up!

427
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,239
Get up. This isn't funny.

428
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,659
Please, let's leave this place.

429
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,757
Come on. Come on!

430
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,017
I do that all the time.

431
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:26,022
All you have to do is change your clothes
and hide the wet ones until they're dry.

432
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,695
You know what I do
when something frightens me?

433
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,655
I say the magic words.

434
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:41,162
Googly, googly, googly, begone.

435
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,543
Let's practice together.

436
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,295
The magic words.

437
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,174
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

438
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,726
-Did you get what I sent you for?
-Yes.

439
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,480
-This it is.
-Yeah?

440
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,442
There's only three in here.

441
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,612
-You asked me for three.
-No, I asked you for a full bottle.

442
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,074
-But, you wrote...
-Was this bottle full of pills?

443
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,660
-Were there more pills in here?
-Yeah.

444
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,995
What did you do with them?

445
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,706
I throw them in toilet.

446
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,419
But I throw them away because you wrote

447
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:35,299
m-o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

448
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,763
Will they help you sleep?

449
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,018
A nap perhaps.

450
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,068
We must free the slaves.

451
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,153
Did they free the slaves?

452
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,816
Come out, Odious.

453
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,966
Just like a butterfly.

454
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,725
Why the mask again?

455
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,603
He doesn't want to scare her.

456
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:57,691
She doesn't know anything about him,
but he knew everything about her.

457
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,988
The color of her eyes.

458
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,574
Brown.

459
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,036
Her favorite food.

460
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,412
Orange?

461
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,581
Her favorite book.

462
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,832
Bible.

463
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,003
Boys, she's mine.

464
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,134
-What about the bomb?
-What?

465
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,511
The bomb.

466
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:39,400
The bandits kidnapped the princess,
leaving behind her little nephew.

467
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,867
They rode down
from the high mountain deserts

468
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,703
to a place he loved.

469
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,251
He had played as a child with his twin.

470
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,047
A palace in the middle of a lake.

471
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,924
What's the matter with that poor fellow?

472
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,471
Ever since the Indian’s misfortune

473
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,599
he took a vow
to never look at another squaw.

474
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,686
But a man cannot show what's in his heart
when he hides his face.

475
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,566
Who, may I ask, are you?

476
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,694
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.

477
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,988
The Scourge of the Southeast?

478
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,368
That's the one.

479
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,417
But that's only when I wear the mask.

480
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,760
Who are you?

481
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,266
Nurse Evelyn.

482
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:44,191
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt,
and now I am simply called...

483
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,194
-Sister Evelyn.
-She is not a sister.

484
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,364
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.

485
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,201
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.

486
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,247
No, she's a nun, like these nuns out here.

487
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,295
And she turned from the Masked Bandit,
and she said...

488
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,424
-May I be frank with you?
-Of course.

489
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,219
Although I've dedicated my life
to God and goodness

490
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:16,682
I secretly love throwing oranges
at our priest.

491
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,268
Take two turns to the left
and go to the bathroom.

492
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,727
No, you read my note.

493
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,147
What are you talking about?
Go to the bathroom.

494
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,023
No.

495
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,443
How do you know
about the priest and the orange?

496
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,987
Everybody knows
you like throwing oranges at the priest.

497
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,241
Even the priest knows, but I didn't
find that out from your gibberish message.

498
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,076
It's not gibberish.

499
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,024
She wants to ask you
how much days I have to stay here.

500
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,943
Well, I want you to stay here
until you get better.

501
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,782
Her cast will come off in a few days

502
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:20,037
but I'd like her to stay here
until she's completely recovered.

503
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,882
She wants to say
that we are spend here too much times

504
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,800
and we have to leave the city.

505
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:38,096
No, well, you just tell her
that you shouldn't be working in the groves.

506
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,890
That at your age it's dangerous

507
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,935
and you'll spend
the rest of your days picking fruit.

508
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,646
And then she'll fall. She surely will fall.

509
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,465
Thank you.

510
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,636
-What did she say?
-She says okay.

511
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,430
-Really?
-Really.

512
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,558
Alexandria, she asked me something,
didn't she?

513
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,518
No, that how we speak.

514
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,980
-You sure?
-Sure.

515
00:59:45,832 --> 01:00:18,196
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

516
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,616
It's a very generous offer.

517
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:25,621
If you look over here at the number,
it's more money than I actually make a year.

518
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,372
I want to add something to it.

519
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,374
Don't start adding stuff to this.

520
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:33,128
You know, the studio's got
a building full of lawyers.

521
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,256
Jumping, falling, crashing.

522
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,884
I mean, cowhands are getting all the glory.

523
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,804
Whose idea was it anyway?

524
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,724
Jumping onto a horse from a train bridge?

525
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,147
Add the screening to the contract
and I'll sign it.

526
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,441
What happens to the money if I die?

527
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:58,862
Roy, you need to get off this suicide thing.

528
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,575
Let the doctors finish what they started.

529
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,245
Problem is not his back.

530
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,749
It's a broken heart.

531
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,378
He needs to get over her.

532
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,589
I mean, he's not the first guy to lose a girl.

533
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,634
I'm sorry.

534
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,596
You are someone famous.

535
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,141
So they tell me.

536
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,559
Hey, kid!

537
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,907
I made this for you.

538
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,999
Who's in the mask?

539
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,961
You in the wheelchair.

540
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,633
It's beautiful.

541
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,220
I'll keep it forever.

542
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,723
I hope I never get better.

543
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:14,688
-Why?
-Because I want to stay here with you.

544
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,116
-Hey, this came for you today.
-Really?

545
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:31,246
-You like chocolate?
-I like it.

546
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,462
-Do you want me to finish the story?
-Yes.

547
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,675
-I need a favor.
-What kind of favor?

548
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,052
You know our friend Walt?

549
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,222
-He's not my friend.
-He's not my friend either.

550
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:54,853
I retrieved this key from him
because I think he's been stealing my pills.

551
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,107
I think he's got them in his cabinet there.

552
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,736
I want you to go check
and see if he's got them.

553
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,322
Why? I got you the bottle.

554
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,534
There weren't enough in there
for me to go to sleep.

555
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,625
Come on. Be a good bandit.

556
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,088
I don't want to be a bandit.

557
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,383
That's too bad.

558
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,890
Because Odious's castle
is surrounded by a big blue city.

559
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:39,397
And that's where the bandits are headed
for their final encounter.

560
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,238
It's the best part of the story,
and since you're leaving soon

561
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,575
I'd hate for you to spend your whole life
wondering how it turned out.

562
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,165
-What's in the drawer?
-Stuff.

563
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,877
-What kind of stuff?
-Stuff Walt's been stealing from me.

564
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,839
What?

565
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,924
I won't know until you go look.

566
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,261
-Promise you'll finish the story?
-Yeah.

567
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,037
It's that brown bottle.

568
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,667
-This one?
-That's the one.

569
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,087
I think he stole it from me.

570
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,970
That's mine.

571
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,474
Where did we leave off?

572
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,435
They were telling secrets each other.

573
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:01,187
I'm looking for the man
who murdered my father.

574
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,732
The Black Bandit said.

575
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,817
My brother, the Blue Masked Bandit...

576
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,987
-He said.
-...tried to avenge our father's death.

577
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:13,783
I've been on a quest for revenge.

578
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,035
Tortured and hung.

579
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:20,415
He told her everything about his life
except for the name of Governor Odious.

580
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,417
You need to leave.

581
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,802
You should go.

582
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,222
But you promised you'll tell me the story.

583
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,688
You've captivated my heart, Evelyn.

584
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:49,027
That's why
I can no longer keep you in captivity.

585
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,781
I've fallen in love with you.

586
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,868
But I am consumed with revenge.

587
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,290
I'm not a man who can be loved.

588
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,752
When I fall asleep, you gotta go.

589
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,424
And don't come back tomorrow.

590
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,052
Okay.

591
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,016
Thank you.

592
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,734
-I'm sorry about this.
-Why?

593
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,740
I'm sorry.

594
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,661
Why?

595
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,791
I don't want you to see me like this.

596
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,090
You think you took me captive?

597
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,514
In fact, you're my savior.

598
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:08,273
I was like a bird in a golden cage.

599
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,196
By freeing me, you captured my heart.

600
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,958
Make them kiss.

601
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,627
No, I don't want to make them kiss.

602
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,589
Why?

603
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,967
Because what they're about to find out.

604
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,809
She should have not come with us.

605
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:50,440
-Why?
-It is too dangerous.

606
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:55,028
If we are captured,
Governor Odious shall surely kill her.

607
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,990
You mentioned Odious?

608
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,243
He is my sworn enemy.

609
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,579
And my fiancé.

610
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:33,983
No.

611
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,697
I want to look at you until I die.

612
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,037
What a mystery this world.

613
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,581
One day you love them

614
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,544
and the next day
you want to kill them a thousand times over.

615
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,882
God forgive him.

616
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,517
I'm glad I never kissed you.

617
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,859
She can't die.

618
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,906
She's still alive!

619
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,000
The solid gold locket stopped the bullet.

620
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,845
"My dearest daughter,

621
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:49,517
"never marry for money, fame,
power or security.

622
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,814
"Always follow your heart.

623
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,566
"Your ever-loving father."

624
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,444
It says all that on that little locket?

625
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,407
I've never been able to open it.

626
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:08,077
No one's been able to open it.
You're the first.

627
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:16,377
And he knew that she was the woman
he was supposed to love.

628
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:20,006
Please. Please. Now they can kiss-kiss?

629
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,467
Yes.

630
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,305
But first, marriage.

631
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,354
And then they can kiss.

632
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,500
The ring.

633
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,611
The Mystic spies danger in your palm.

634
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,990
You've taken too many pills. Death is near.

635
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,285
Danger?

636
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,704
Suicide is not the answer.

637
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,334
He says he also knows of a secret chant.

638
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,044
Whenever we're in trouble...

639
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:45,133
Something about "googly-googly?"

640
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:50,221
He says if you fall asleep,
you will never wake up.

641
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,333
The Mystic was right.

642
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,252
The stony-faced priest had betrayed them.

643
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,654
And then they were saved?

644
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,822
No.

645
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,038
There was no one left to save them.

646
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,677
Wallace?

647
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:58,099
Wallace, is that you? Wallace?

648
01:13:58,183 --> 01:13:59,684
No, it's me.

649
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,443
No wonder the bag was so heavy.

650
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,295
Shoot!

651
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,553
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot them, Daddy!

652
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,056
Shoot them!

653
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:47,315
Daddy, don't you recognize me?

654
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,108
Don't you? It's me!

655
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,738
Don't you recognize me?

656
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,078
-Who are you?
-It's me, Da-da.

657
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,164
-Who?
-Me!

658
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:06,083
-My daughter?
-Yes! You recognize me.

659
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:11,005
Yeah. My daughter
from a previous marriage.

660
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:12,507
Yes.

661
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,721
I didn't recognize you
because you have teeth.

662
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,018
You must be stronger now.

663
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,106
Not the time to sleep now.

664
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,902
Not the time to sleep.

665
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,450
It's not time to sleep.

666
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,681
Wake up.

667
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,733
Wake up. It's not time to sleep now.

668
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,155
Wake up.

669
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,534
Don't pretend to sleep.

670
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,329
Wake up. Laugh, laugh.

671
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:32,837
Not the time to sleep.

672
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:36,359
Americana Exotica.

673
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,157
Does Dr. Snider know about this?

674
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,587
He was under observation,
but I thought he was getting better.

675
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,755
Hey!

676
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,967
Alexandria, go inside! Go on!

677
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:04,720
All right, carry on. Sorry about that.

678
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,409
Roy, wake up. Wake up.

679
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,412
Roy, wake up.

680
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,668
They're going to cut you up.
Gonna chop you up. Wake up.

681
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,087
-Go on! Shoo!
-Wake up.

682
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,884
Oh, no, no, no.

683
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,887
He was his usual self, you know,
smiling away, playing with his teeth.

684
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,682
I just don't feel very well, Doc.

685
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:52,977
I don't know
what the hell's wrong with me. Cough.

686
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,564
What, am I going delirious
from the medication?

687
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:58,858
I don't know what the hell...

688
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,822
Roy!

689
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:10,536
Roy, I thought you were dead.

690
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,415
Saw two men,
and they were carrying the body away.

691
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:17,376
And then I tried to pinch your toe.

692
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,507
I run after you,

693
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:29,597
and after that one of the doctors told me,
"Shoo!" and I had to go away.

694
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:33,350
I'm sorry. I promise, but you...

695
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,859
-I bring you more medicine if you want.
-Sugar.

696
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,153
-I promise...
-They're giving him sugar.

697
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,738
Come here!

698
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:51,202
Oh, well, that's great, you're awake.
I brought your x-rays...

699
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,537
-Hey, you wanna take a look...
-Doc, the old man's dead and you're...

700
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,289
-Hey. Roy!
-That's it!

701
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,709
-Will you shut up, already?
-You shut up!

702
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,129
Get out of here! You're not really sick, Walt!
They're feeding you sugar!

703
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,423
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
-I've had enough of you!

704
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,508
Nurse!

705
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,259
What do you mean, they're giving me sugar?

706
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,637
-Here you go, Doctor.
-She's wet herself.

707
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,555
Get her out of here.

708
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,644
Go back to your room. Orderlies!

709
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,450
You should be in bed, Alexandria.

710
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,036
There's more fires in the field.

711
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:23,794
It's kerosene.
The kerosene stops the fruit from freezing.

712
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,548
No, it's Mystic.

713
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,593
He's coming out of that tree to help Roy.

714
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:36,432
I think it's bedtime, young lady.
No more time for funny talk.

715
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:38,976
Into bed now.

716
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,395
And maybe one day

717
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:45,357
you can take me downstairs
and introduce me to your friend Roy.

718
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,403
We go downstairs and say good night?

719
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:52,281
No. He's not allowed any visitors.

720
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,993
Your friend, Roy, needs to rest.

721
01:21:56,077 --> 01:22:00,289
He's very sad. He's lost his girlfriend.
He needs to sleep.

722
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:04,793
But he can't. He needs medicine to sleep,
but he doesn't have any.

723
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,086
That's the problem.

724
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,757
I'm sure
they're taking very good care of him.

725
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,843
Now, it's time for bed.

726
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,639
Little girls need to go to sleep, too.

727
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,433
-I'm not little. I am five.
-Of course.

728
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,685
I forgot.

729
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:29,628
Googly, googly, googly, go away.
Googly, googly, googly, go away.

730
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:38,971
Googly, googly. Go away.
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

731
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,367
Googly, googly. Go away.

732
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,663
Googly, googly.
Googly, googly, googly, go away.

733
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:39,865
Papa, they steal our horse.

734
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:42,242
Papa,

735
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,457
they steal our horse.

736
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:52,503
Papa, angry people burn our home.

737
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:55,756
They burn our house. Don't go outside.

738
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,882
Thieves.

739
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,094
Angry people kill.

740
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,721
Thieves!

741
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:36,505
The x-ray seems fine.

742
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,901
-Mommy!
-Were you taking medicine to Roy?

743
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,533
That is your responsibility
and this is how you treat it.

744
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:07,703
To get better, you gotta have the will

745
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,415
and your own desire to live.

746
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,455
I fell again.

747
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,249
I heard. Everybody's heard.

748
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,878
You're famous.

749
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,551
Are they angry?

750
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,928
Yeah,

751
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:09,848
but not at you.

752
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:14,603
I try to take more pills, but I fell.
It was the wrong thing, and...

753
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:19,107
-What?
-I put my foot on it when I went up

754
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:25,822
and later on the thing made me go like that
and I fell.

755
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:36,667
I didn't tell anybody about our secret.

756
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,422
Even when they tortured me with needles.

757
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:47,177
Is that a pirate's flag?

758
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,056
Is that yes or no?

759
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:54,017
Tell me the story.

760
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,895
I should go. You need your rest.

761
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,563
But I want to talk.

762
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,899
-I know you do.
-You promised.

763
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,113
The story was just a trick
to get you to do something for me.

764
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,198
-What?
-I was...

765
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,661
But I need the story.

766
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,873
You should ask someone else.

767
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,711
There's no happy ending with me.

768
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,299
I still want to know.

769
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,636
Ask your friend, Nurse Evelyn,
she'll tell it better than I will.

770
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,972
I don't want her in the story!

771
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,473
She's okay.

772
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:38,603
Oh, she doesn't really
love Governor Odious.

773
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:42,899
She's just pretending.

774
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,320
I saw her with one of the hospital men.

775
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,947
She was just pretending to love you.

776
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,662
Just like your girlfriend.

777
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:56,955
I see.

778
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,713
Governor Odious with Nurse Evelyn!

779
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,801
She's right.

780
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:24,941
She's right!

781
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,287
We don't need her.

782
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,122
She can't be trusted.

783
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:46,004
You give them your heart,
but all they really want is your wallet.

784
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:51,218
Sooner or later she's gonna leave him
for a richer man.

785
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,552
Is a trap.

786
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,972
-I understand.
-I don't like it.

787
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,100
Thank you for telling me.

788
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,979
Is a suicide. For all of us.

789
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:06,942
We're going.

790
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:15,534
Hey, Indian, what means suicide?

791
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,632
Wallace? Wallace!

792
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:19,139
Wallace!

793
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,225
Wallace, what are you doing?

794
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,853
Wallace, please will you come down?

795
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:29,274
Please, this really isn't the time.

796
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,818
Wallace, please!
Wallace, will you come down?

797
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:43,955
Wallace!

798
01:31:48,377 --> 01:31:50,420
Wallace, what did you do?

799
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:06,436
Americana Exotica!

800
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,272
It's beautiful!

801
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:22,452
Does he really died?

802
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,924
Let's go!

803
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,343
I'm all washed-up!

804
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:41,304
-Uncle Darwin, there's angry people.
-Don't leave me, my friend.

805
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,349
I'll tell everyone they were your idea.

806
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,936
They're going to find out I'm a fraud!

807
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,900
Go on! Shoot, you animals!

808
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,531
They'll pay you well for Darwin's hide.

809
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,837
He died, too.

810
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:17,007
And Wallace, too?

811
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:20,010
Did he really died?

812
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:23,722
Yeah, and in Wallace's case, happily so.

813
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,767
It was the natural order of things.

814
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:40,155
All things must die.

815
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:53,793
Damn it all!

816
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:21,404
Back! Get back!

817
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,447
Kaboom.

818
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,401
If you want something done...

819
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,069
Get down there!

820
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,946
...you have to do it yourself.

821
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:47,365
Get down there, you animals!

822
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,325
And bring them up here!

823
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:00,837
I don't like this! I don't like this story.

824
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:04,674
Why are we running away?

825
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:18,480
Why did Luigi kill himself?

826
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,483
Why did not he come with us?

827
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:23,359
And live as half a man?

828
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,947
He couldn't do that.

829
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,657
He gave up.

830
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:33,453
It's not very satisfying, is it?

831
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,663
He didn't think so either.

832
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,091
Please, the Mystic.

833
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:50,512
Why? Why are they killing the Mystic?

834
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:54,933
We need to go help him.

835
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,148
Mystic!

836
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,651
-Hey!
-Mystic!

837
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:08,780
Googly, googly, googly, googly,
googly, googly.

838
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:52,115
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

839
01:37:54,660 --> 01:38:00,999
I'm sorry!

840
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,631
I'm sorry.

841
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,636
Googly, googly, googly!

842
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:22,520
It's okay.

843
01:39:15,866 --> 01:39:17,200
Indian!

844
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,625
Up!

845
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:26,876
Help!

846
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:45,645
No, no, no, no, no.

847
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:47,355
No, no, no, no!

848
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:57,073
Why are you killing everybody?

849
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:02,161
Why are you making everybody die?

850
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:03,871
It's my story.

851
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,289
Mine too.

852
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,920
Bring them up here!

853
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:15,508
Alive!

854
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:17,010
We are here.

855
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,015
Alive.

856
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:26,728
Roy!

857
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:30,565
Don't look at her.

858
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:33,860
-She is also with Odious.
-Quiet.

859
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,657
-Just like your girlfriend.
-Shut up.

860
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,409
No!

861
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:45,121
Your girlfriend came with Odious
to see you...

862
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:47,040
The bandit entered Odious's garden...

863
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:50,126
But she stood in the car and she...

864
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:54,213
-But Odious was nowhere to be seen.
-And Odious...

865
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:59,093
As the bandit ran past Odious' hiding place,
Odious cracked him in the nose!

866
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:06,726
No, but wait a little. Wait, please!

867
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:17,653
So he sank to the bottom of the pool.

868
01:41:18,989 --> 01:41:21,157
He didn't even try to swim.

869
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:24,994
-You are making this up.
-No, I'm not.

870
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:28,372
And he started to sink and he was dying.

871
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,667
Let him live.

872
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:34,921
Get up!

873
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:37,006
Roy, get up and fight!

874
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,050
Get up!

875
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,764
Oh, what a shame! Look, God damn it!

876
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:46,099
Get up!

877
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,436
Look at him! Look at him!

878
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:51,521
Get up!

879
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:54,649
-I want you to see how pathetic he really is.
-I can't get up!

880
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:56,442
-Get up!
-I can't get up!

881
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,569
-For God's sake, the water's only waist high.
-Get up, Daddy!

882
01:41:58,654 --> 01:41:59,779
I'm not your father.

883
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:03,658
How pathetic! Look at him!
He's a drug addict!

884
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:05,952
Your father is a coward.

885
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:08,287
A useless good-for-nothing!

886
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:09,872
Dad, get up!

887
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,666
He can't win!

888
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:14,418
That's because
our Masked Bandit's a coward!

889
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,797
Yeah, he never took an oath.

890
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:21,801
-A fake, he's a liar and a coward.
-You're lying!

891
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:24,554
No. He had his fingers crossed.

892
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:26,931
He has to die.

893
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:29,642
I don't believe you.

894
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,272
He was dying.

895
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:36,691
Don't kill him.

896
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:41,654
-I'll bring you more pills if you want.
-Dad, get up!

897
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:44,699
-Don't kill him.
-There's nothing left for him.

898
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:45,950
His daughter.

899
01:42:46,034 --> 01:42:48,244
He wasn't her father, either.

900
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:50,705
She loves him.

901
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:55,543
She'll survive. She's young.

902
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,712
I don't want you to die.

903
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:09,974
Don't kill him.

904
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:26,699
Let him live.

905
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,160
Don't kill him.

906
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:44,717
Promise? And don't cross your fingers.

907
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:46,427
I promise.

908
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,721
Show me your hands.

909
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:53,726
See?

910
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:02,985
No more fighting.

911
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:08,658
He needs to go to his daughter. It's okay.

912
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:11,619
It's okay. It's all right. It's over now.

913
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,249
Give me a kiss.

914
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:37,186
Roy,

915
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:42,525
you do realize it was all a test
to see if you truly loved me, don't you?

916
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,206
We're finally free to follow our hearts.

917
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,299
By all means.

918
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,096
Follow your heart.

919
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,563
I'm not feeling very well.

920
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,704
We're a strange pair, aren't we?

921
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:54,764
Action, action, action, action.

922
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,620
So, this is the kind of trash
we're gonna be making now.

923
01:46:59,704 --> 01:47:04,250
People jumping off buildings,
bridges, horses.

924
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:39,368
Did I just miss something?

925
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,247
That was it?

926
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:45,291
That was his big stunt?

927
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:48,586
He didn't even use that horse thing.

928
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:42,681
I put old man's teeth there
because I think that

929
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:47,853
the Mystic comes out of the tree
and it will grow a special orange tree.

930
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,356
Alexandria! Alexandria!

931
01:48:55,362 --> 01:49:00,366
And we'll have oranges inside with teeths,
with teeth inside.

932
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:20,344
When I get out from the hospital,
I miss Roy very much.

933
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:25,808
My mother told me that he plays in pictures

934
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:29,311
and he does things
that the other actors cannot do

935
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,314
like falling and hitting

936
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:38,070
and when they climb on something,
when they...

937
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:44,618
I didn't believe my mother,
but then I saw him.

938
01:49:53,169 --> 01:49:58,173
I watch the picture again
and again and again

939
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:01,927
and to make sure that was Roy,
and was Roy!

940
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:09,476
And then, I like the action
from all the pictures

941
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:16,191
because I know that Roy is making
all the falling and hitting and climbing

942
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:17,776
and he was on the stairs

943
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:21,572
and he was going up and down
and up and down.

944
01:50:21,656 --> 01:50:27,745
And he was falling from the train
and he was taking the car...

945
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:03,197
And he was falling from the bicycle
and from a big house.

946
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:04,365
It was Wallace!

947
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:06,033
He was falling with the rope

948
01:51:06,117 --> 01:51:08,661
and he was hit and he was going...

949
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:14,249
"Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much!"
