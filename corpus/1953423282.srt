00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,539
You have bad opinions.

178
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,480
<i>You know I'm sorry I brought it up</i>

179
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,049
Proves my point.

180
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,380
I talk too much.

181

♫Electronic Music♫

182
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,695
Shit!

183
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,898
Shit!

184
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,062
I'm not a loser.

185
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,943
Baby, get back in the car.
Come on.

186
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,445
[Crying] I'm not a loser.

187
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,614
Baby get back in the car. Please.

188
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm not a loser.

189
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,429
I'm not a loser.

[Heavy Breathing]

191
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,505
Look at me.

192
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,940
It's ok.

193
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,607
Baby I'm ﬁne.

194
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,979
I'm ﬁne.

195
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,819
Some people are afraid of death.

196
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,828
Sometimes, I think waking up
alive seems worse.

197
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,634
Whatcha doin?

198
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,971
Writing.

199
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,336
Bout what?

200
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,705
Writing something
for my English class.

201
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,381
Hmm.

202
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,416
And you hope this will
lead you to what kind of job?

203
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,818
See, that's the thing.

204
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,255
I'm not searching for a job.

205
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,987
I already got one of those.

206
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,100
...searching for a life.

207
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,669
Ok.
What does that mean?

208
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,274
What does that mean?
- What's that mean?

209
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:41,974
What does that mean...
it means that if this is all I thought there was to life...

210
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,917
think I'd rather just put
a gun to my head right now.

211
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,717
So... no life is better than this life.

212
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:57,457
No. No, maybe not for everybody,
but I can't speak for everybody.

213
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,693
I can only speak for myself.

214
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,738
That's kinda sad, Eddie.

215
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,342
I never want to die.

216
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,377
Ever.

217
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,311
What I need you to do is tell me
the marriage is over.

218
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:21,513
What? Honey, I can't say that.
I don't know what's going to happen

219
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,057
Why don't you just be honest and
say you don't love me any more?

220
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,423
I do love you!
I still love you.

221
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,563
You love me!?
- Yes!

222
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,462
You said you loved me
like you loved the dog.

223
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,534
Honey, I really loved that dog.

224
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,941
You gave the dog away.

225
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,754
Hey! Eddie! The usual.

226
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,793
Yes Sir- The Usual
for Superhero.

227
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,000
So how's it goin', Man of Steel?
- Good.

228
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,570
You know there's a lot of crime out there ...Sheila

229
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,140
Can I get my coffee to go? Also?

230
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,208
Sure. Large to go.

231
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,396
I used to keep a journal.

232
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,468
Wow. Really.

233
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,177
Hmm.

234
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,313
So what is this? Old German?

235
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,214
Not at the time.

236
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,616
[Laughs]

237
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,656
"Not at the time..."
Ah, I just got that.

238
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,411
You know, I feel much safer
with you here up at the counter.

239
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,636
I'll be around.

240
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,680
I hope so.

241
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,890
[Cluckles] Really.

242
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,097
Do you want to know
why I quit keeping it?

243
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,839
Because...
it didn't matter any more.

244
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,735
I had nothing new to say.

245
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,808
Boy- you're gonna make me cry.

246
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,582
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

247
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,722
And how is that my fault?

248
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,290
It's just...

249
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,692
I'm tired.

250
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,732
I'm so tired.

251
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,744
Hungry Baby?

252
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,295
[Laughs]

253
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,534
I'll be right back. -Where you going?
- Just wail here.

254
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:58,435
Babe! -Just stay here, all right?
- Babe, What are you dong? Babe!

255
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,484
Why can't is just be simple?

256
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,789
I mean, why am I here?
And she's here.

257
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,195
But we're not together.

258
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,564
Why are they together...

259
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,604
and we're not?

260
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,586
Can we please go in now,
I'm starving.

261
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,622
Grab my sweatshirt.

262
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:09,768
So what is it, exactly,
that you want me to do?

263
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,210
Just let it all end.

264
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,281
Just like that.
Badda-boom.

265
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,018
It doesn't seem fair.

266
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,589
What does it have
to do with fair?

267
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,657
Without fairness,
life is capricious.

268
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,963
I just want to end this.

269
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,466
You want out that bad, huh?

270
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,071
I want to grow up.

271
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,106
I want to be 18 and
19, and 30 and 50.

272
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,143
I want a boyfriend.
A husband.

273
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,982
I want a love.

274
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,278
I want kids that won't be older than me
by the time they're able to vote.

275
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,354
Wow. That sounds
really boring.

276
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,954
Not to me.

277
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,022
Hi, just sit anywhere.

278
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,446
We're on the late night menu.
It's on the back.

279
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,419
Can I get some water also?

280
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,491
Sure. How about you?

281
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,425
No, I'm good.
Where is everybody?

282
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,191
Oh, it's about normal
for Wednesday night.

283
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,266
Let me get you some water.
- Thank you.

284
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,171
We're gonne eat ﬁrst, right?

285
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,107
So like the two of them
over there. Hmm?

286
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:55,944
What possible reason could either of them
ﬁnd to get out of bed in the morning?

287
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:01,146
That's what I want to know.
I want a life.

288
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:05,225
Donuts. Bet the only reason he
gets up every day is donuts.

289
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,765
Wow, that's fuckin' terrible.

290
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:17,770
What kind of idiot do you have to be
to fuck up a cup of coffee? Jesus.

291
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,806
We didn't need his money.

292
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,313
It wasn't about the money.

293
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,345
He was fuckin' with me.

294
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,278
He was waving to you.

295
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,180
Shut up.

296
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,287
Look at the menu,
order when she gets back.

297
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,322
Hand me my cards.

298
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,162
Thank you.

299
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,495
Look at the menu.

300
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,174
You said you were hungry, right?
You want to order when she gets back.

301
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,673
Look at the menu.

302
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,933
Stop it.

303
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,044
What do you want?

304
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,910
Not everything in life is easy.

305
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,983
Don't be such a dick

306
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,019
Whatever. You love it.

307
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:07,311
OK.

308
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,053
OK.

309
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,689
Do you see that clock on the wall?

310
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,796
Which one?

311
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,901
That's a good point.
That one. Right there.

312
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,039
It's 23 minutes to the hour.
- OK

313
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:33,045
If you can ﬁnd someone in this room
to take your place in the next 23 minutes,

314
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,275
I will give you
what you want.

315
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,543
Tick- tick- tick-
tick- tick- tick...

316
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,586
Tick...

317
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,486
Tick...

318
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,753
You all right honey?

319
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,326
Can I get you anything?

320
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,397
She's all right.

321
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,627
I wasn't talking to you.

322
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,703
Let me show you where the restroom is.

323
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,273
Tick tick tick tick...

324
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,346
Go to hell.

325
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:15,089
Now that's funny.
That's funny.

326
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:51,082
I know it's none of my business,
but what are you doing with that guy?

327
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,695
A pretty girl like you...

328
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,263
It's not what you think...

329
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm only thinking you
can do a lot better.

330
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,377
I made a mistake.

331
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,317
Hey-

332
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,053
We've all made mistakes.

333
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,318
You can ﬁx it.

334
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,996
I don't think I can.

335
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,434
I should've just died

336
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,103
What is with everyone tonight?

337
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,705
Thinkin' that they'd rather die.

338
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,739
Why's everyone in
such a hurry to die?

339
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,310
I never want to die.

340
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,572
Don't say that

341
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,976
It's true.

342
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,480
No it isn't.

343
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,516
Think about it,

344
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,247
being what...
30 years old forever.

345
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:59,325
I'd like to try that
Who wouldn't?

346
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,224
I better get
back out there.

347
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,266
Don't let that guy push you around

348
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,703
He doesn't control you.

349
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:20,212
You've got to live your life the way you want to live it.

350
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,078
You got anybody to help you out?

351
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,059
You've never met
someone so alone.

352
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,095
Mom?
Dad?

353
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,495
Dead.

354
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,865
I'm so sorry.

355
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,905
It's okay.

356
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,940
I'll help you.

357
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,575
You don't even know me.

358
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,979
Maybe not.

359
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,711
But I can't stand to see a young girl
like you taken advantage of.

360
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,754
It's just not right.

361
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,496
What if I take advantage of you?

362
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,564
Then Super Hero out there will protect me.

363
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,135
What about Eddie?

364
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,567
How do you know Eddie?

365
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,470
I don't.

366
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,373
I've just been
watching the two of you.

367
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,473
Yeah, Eddie'd protect me.

368
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,489
That's nice to have.

369
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,392
I've gotta go.

371
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,449

372
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,128

373
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,768
What the fuck?

374
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,396
Are you fucking kidding me?

375
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,061
I guess they're out of paper towels.

376
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,836
Read something to me
from your notebook.

377
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,139
Nah- you'd...
it's boring.

378
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,576
You really wouldn't like it.

379
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,752
Oh, I see.

380
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,923
So you think a simple waitress is too stupid
to understand your deep thoughts?

381
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,591
No, No, come on.

382
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,487
Come on. You know
it's not like that.

383
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,285
Well then then
read me something.

384
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,689
Anything

385
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,126
I just want to hear
you read something.

386
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,163
For me.

387
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,734
I feel weird about it.

388
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,405
Let me read it then.

389
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,613
The ﬁrst person I killed.

390
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:32,557
As I went up to his still form, I could see
the holes that had accomplished my purpose.

391
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:39,969
He wasn't much more than a teenager, with that wispy
beard you try to grow to prove you're old enough.

392
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,543
He still had his
weapon in his hand.

393
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,611
Has he met God, Allah, Jesus?

394
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:55,480
Did he die for a good
cause, a just cause?

395
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,523
Does it matter to him now?

396
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:05,624
Maybe he is in paradise and all the terrible rotten
things that happen in life are forgotten.

397
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:10,362
Or maybe he's just
dead and that's all..

398
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,973
just dead and gone.

399
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:19,011
I saw death, face to face, in
the ﬁrst person I killed.

400
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,200
I've never read anything
like that before.

401
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,598
This is your basic blackjack.
You've got 3 hands here, ok?

402
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,676
Dealer's showin' a cowboy.
So you gonna hit- ...not good. Too many.

403
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,005
Too many.

404
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,046
Well, that's an excellent
poker hand but, too many.

405
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,221
And dealer ...20.

406
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,481
You know, in Vegas, they,
they deal from a 4 deck shoe.

407
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:07,753
It's... well, it's just like
this, only different. But- um...

408
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,863
Anyways, uh, as soon
as we get settled in,

409
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,365
Bobby said, he can get us
a job at the Frontier.

410
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,199
I'll deal therefor, I
don't know, six months,

411
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:22,241
and then move to the Luxor,
the MGM or some other place on the Strip

412
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,970
Can we ﬁnally get married?

413
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,586
Yeah.

414
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,188
Sure thing.

415
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,417
Soon as we get a little bit of
money, we'll get married.

416
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,687
It'll be just like that movie

417
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,559
what's that movie I
like... that one about Vegas?

418
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,565
It's got like, the ﬂying Elvises?

419
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:52,571
Jumpin' out of the airplane, the guy's
like yellin' "The Flying Elvises!"

420
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,605
That one.

421
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,105
You like cards?

422
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,370
Yeah. I'm going to be a dealer.

423
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,980
You? Really?

424
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,945
Yeah, me.

425
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,552
What, does that fucking
surprise you or something?

426
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,016
No. Uh...

427
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,724
You just... you look young.

428
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,594
Relax- ok?
She didn't mean that

429
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,465
You know what?
Fuck that.

430
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,642
I don't have to
put up with this shit.

431
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,037
I've had to put up

432
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,074
with shit my whole life-

433
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,075
from my old man, my boss,

434
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,076
every other asshole who

435
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,077
thinks they can just

436
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,783
walk all over me.

437
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,042
I'm not puttin' up
with any shit any more.

438
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,788
Look- look at me.
She didn't mean it like that.

439
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,650
Relax- hey...
She's not like that

440
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,759
She just thought you looked too young.
- Yeah, well,

441
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,893
I'm old enough...

442
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,631
I promise you that.

443
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,663
I'm old enough.

444
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,501
Look at me...
You OK?

445
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,536
Yeah.

446
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,201
I'm old enough.

447
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,022
Eddie...

448
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,594
I know you.

449
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,764
Don't I

450
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,434
Of course you do, Eddie.

451
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,228
Why are you here?

452
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,369
<i>I don't think you realize
how lucky you are.</i>

453
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,274
So few people actually meet
me more than once And look-

454
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,984
You're here. I'm here.
Together again.

455

457
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,344
She's busy.

458
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,515
Not your personal secretary, bro.

459
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,223
Yeah. Yeah, I'll
give her the message.

460
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,896
I said I'd give it to her.

461
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,958
Who was that?

462
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,932
Prince charming.

463
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,539
What'd he want?

464
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,640
He's comin‘ by.

465
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,073
Said he wants you
to meet him outside.

466
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,077
Why?

467
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,443
Didn't say.

468
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,983
When?

469
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,689
Couple of minutes.

470
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,020
Why can't he just leave
me alone at work?

471
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:05,963
Why don't you just tell him to stay away?
Hell, blame it on me.

472
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,863
Yeah.

473
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,267
He already thinks we
got something goin' on.

474
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,169
Then I'll tell him then.

475
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,138
No.

476
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,813
That'll just make it worse

477
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,583
What are you doing here, Ken?

478
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:02,448
Gimmie my money.

479
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,182
I gave you money this morning.

480
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,258
Gimmie my money!

481
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,018
This? You think this is

482
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,628
your money?

483
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,229
Give me my fucking money!

Gel off of me! Stop it!

486
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,637
Take it!
- Get out of my fuckin' car!

487
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,240
You know, you're not worth it.

488
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,274
Hey! Take it easy on the door.

Did he hurt you?

493
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,758
I just need to use
the little girls' room.

494
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,467
Hey... hey.

495
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,102
Do you want me to give you
a ride home tonight?

Never touch Sheila again.

Did your wife send you
over here to tell me that?

00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,245
Does it bother you?

Well? Is he going to stop?

512
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,540
Well, he said he'd quit if you got your
boyfriend to go over there to ask him.

513
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,212
Now, I don't believe him
why don't you ﬁnd out?

Well, I can see that this conversation
isn't going much further.

515
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,224
I need more time.

516
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,826
I've given you 250 years.

517

521
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,799
I have no family.

522
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,375
I can't ever let someone
know who I really am.

523
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,047

Maybe Eddie?

528
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,065
I don't think so.
He's already checked out.

529
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,770
How do you know that?

530
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,768
How do I know anything?

531
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,338
Does he know who you are?

532
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:14,701
He knows.

00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,539
He doesn't seem
to remember but ...he knows.

534
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,563
You OK?

535
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,262
No.

536
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,301
There's not a lot I can do
about that right now.

537
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,416
You know, there is something
really wrong with that guy.

538
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,845
The one with the little girl.

539
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,619
She is in some sort of big trouble.

540
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,847
And he is it.

541
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:10,254
If she's with him, then
she's bad news too. Trust me.

542
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,933
Do you know them?

543
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:20,131
I've met him before, but that's not even the point.
The point is I need you to trust me.

544
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,538
Stay away from them. OK?

545
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,974
Wait a minute-

546
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,683
What do you mean?

547
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,409
Listen... I just need you
to trust me.

548
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,951
Just stay away from them.

549
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,622
I can't explain right now, but

550
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,053
just trust me.

551
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,124
OK.

552
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,843
Does this change things?

553
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,981
More than you'll ever know.

554
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,377
I hope so.

555
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,188
Look- it's not gonna happen, ok?
We're not going back there.

556
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:21,726
What am I supposed to do?
Walk around naked all the time?

557
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,295
Look, come on

558
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,363
You don't have to come in.

559
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,626
I'll run up to my room really quick
throw the stuff I need into a bag.

560
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,170
and be back down in 5 minutes.
Please?

561
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,969
Yeah, well, what if he's there?
What then?

562
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,840
Well, if he is,
I'll skip it, ok?

563
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:43,414
I told you if I see that bastard
again I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

564
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,677
He would never be awake this time of night.

565
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,320
Listen.
- Please try?

566
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,354
Baby, baby, listen.

567
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,689
We're not goin' back there.

568
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,296
Not for anything,
and not for anybody.

569
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,332
This is it for us.
Don't you understand?

570
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,298
Hey.

571
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,339
It's me and you. Ok?

572
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:15,114
Look. We'll stop somewhere tomorrow and
we'll get you a new outﬁt, allright?

573
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:21,084
And anyways, when you get to Vegas,
you're going to want a new look, right?

574
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,221
OK.

575
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,460
It's going to be ﬁne, babe.

576
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,491
Got you.

577
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,875
Hey Eddie.

578
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,540
You need something.

579
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,808
I'll get the waitress for you.

580
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,451
No, Eddie, I don't
need the waitress.

581
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,711
Let's talk.

582
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,455
About what?

583
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,684
I'm kind of busy over here.

584
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,466
Do you know my friend out there?
He says you know him.

585
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,304
Yeah. I think so.

586
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,942
Why?

587
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,010
So you know who he is?

588
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:26,411
Maybe. Look, I have a lot of work
I need to ﬁnish here, ok?

589
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,456
So whatever the two of you have planned,
please just leave me out of it.

590
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,054
I have a proposition for you.

591
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,733
I really can't afford a
piece of ass right now.

592
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,266
You don't look like the
kind of guy who needs to pay.

593
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,302
What do you want from me?

594
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,390
I have a special gift

595
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,006
You're lucky enough to
survive a plane crash.

596
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,808
Sort of.

597
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,482
Good for you.

598
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,844
Look at them Eddie.

599
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,383
All of them.

600
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,385
"Body never found."

601
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,057
"Police failed to
locate the body."

602
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,921
"No body. No body... No body."

603
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,153
It's more than luck.

604
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,060
I don't die.

605
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,769
I'm happy for you.

606
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,030
Look at the date. 1956.

607
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,806
Look at me Eddie.

608
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:04,314
How old do I look to you?
- What is it that you want from me?

609
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,647
Do you want to
live forever Eddie?

610
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:12,690
Gel out of my kitchen.
Go. Now. Gel out of my kitchen.

611
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,831
Eddie, I can give you this gift.

612
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,227
Would you and your friend go
ﬁnd someone else to mess with.

613
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,800
It's true, Eddie.

614
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,369
It's true.

615
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,303
No, it's not. Would you please
leave my kitchen now! Now.

616
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,586
What are you doing with that knife?

617
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,059
Put the knife down.

618
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,809
[Yelling] What the fuck!

619
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:37,237
All you have to do is say yes.

620
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,276
Gel out.

621
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,385
Just think about it Eddie.

622
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,748
You can have it all.

623
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,707
Mind your own business.

624
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,648
Who would do that?

625
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,098
Perfect.
hot sauce

626
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,297
Oh my god Eddie, what happened?

627
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,836
Are you hurt?

628
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,269
I'm ﬁne.

629
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,841
It's not my blood.

630
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,512
What?

631
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,941
I don't wanna do this.

632
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,706
Hey, come on.

633
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,782
You're ﬁne. You're ready.

634
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,010
I promise. Look-

635
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,917
Can't I just wait in the car?

636
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,021
No.
- Please?

637
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,590
You're not waiting
in the car. Look-

638
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,488
You're just going to follow me,
you can have the bag,

639
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,097
Nobody is gonna come near you
because if they do,

640
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,733
I got this.

641
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,801
This isn't my ﬁrst rodeo. Ok?

642
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,047
[whisper] I love you.

643
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,079
Me too.

644
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,359
We're closing early.

645
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,070
You and me, we're leaving.

646
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:48,606
Ok, Let's go get a cup of
coffee... breakfast.

647
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,242
Something.

648
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,812
Eddie, what about those
folks out there?

649
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,744
Give 'em their checks.

650
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,146
Better yet, tell 'em
it's on the house.

651
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,788
I don't care, just...
just get 'em outta here.

652
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:06,493
What the heck, Eddie?
Now you're scaring me

653
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,655
When I was in the Army -

654
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,367
over in the Middle East-

655
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,704
my buddy and me
were on patrol.

656
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,567
As we were walking along a road,

657
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,214
I saw someone run
behind a building.

658
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,519
I left my buddy to
go check it out.

659
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:38,657
As I was walking around the
corner of the building,

660
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,153
somebody started shooting at me.

661
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:49,596
I dove in behind the building,

662
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,273
and my buddy Billy took off
to go ﬁnd cover.

663
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,037
He jumped behind a car and
started to return ﬁre.

664
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,217
When the enemy ﬁre stopped

665
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,923
I started to run
where Billy was.

666
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,218
I got about 30 feet from the car
when the whole thing just...

667
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,823
just went up.

668
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,694
An IED.

669
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,167
The explosion was so big,

670
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,210
it blew me
back on my ass,

671
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,307
but I really wasn't hurt.

672
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,411
But I knew Billy was.

673
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,692
I scrambled over
to where he had been.

674
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,254
And I saw.

675
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,633
Dead.

676
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,331
The IED had just
ripped him apart.

677
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,048
And then I saw something else.

678
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,684
I saw a man.

679
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:19,724
He was dressed in fatigues,
but no stripes, no insignias.

680
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,229
Nothin.

681
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,328
He was just
standing there,

682
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,004
staring at Billy.

683
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,366
And then he looked at me.

684
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,937
He looked right through me.

685
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:46,485
Then he just turned
and walked away.

686
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,519
And it was like he just

687
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,227
faded into the smoke.

688
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,832
That's the same guy out there.

689
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,764
That's crazy, Eddie.

690
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,113
I knew you would say that.

691
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,874
But it's true.

692
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,587
You even said it.
There's something about that guy, right?

693
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,249
You're serious aren't you?

694
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,974
I'll do whatever you say, Eddie.

695
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,878
Whatever you say.

696
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,962
You care more about your hair twining
than you care about me.

697
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,138
Whatever.

698
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,169
Can I sit down?

699
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,009
Would you like
to live forever?

700
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,340
Hell no.
Wait- wail.

701
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,381
Does she have to live
forever with me?

702
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,318
What do you mean?

703
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,650
Would you like to live forever?

704
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,055
What am I going to look like
when I'm 500 years old?

705
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,161
Just like you do today.

706
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,229
So I never age.

707
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,298
No.

708
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,862
Can I be 21 again, forever?

709
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,932
No.

710
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,412
You'll look just as
you do today.

711
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,818
I don't think so then.

712
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:10,196
That was the worst display
of vanity I've ever witnessed.

713
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,864
Surprise, surprise.

714
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,932
Another stupid opinion.

715
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,831
[crash] How's that for
a stupid opinion!?

716
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,727
Allright everyone,
shut the fuck up!

717
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,264
Allright everyone,
shut the fuck up!

718
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,410
You, get out here!
Empty the cash into a bag.

719
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,241
You- get over there, now! Move!

720
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,576
Hey! Didn't you hear me?

721
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,448
I said get over there. Now!

722
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,212
All right everyone,

723
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,755
it's just going to take a second,
and then we'll be out of here.

724
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:43,987
I need all your purses, cell phones
wallets, any cash you have...

725
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,700
and give me that jewelry.
That's right. There you go.

726
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,305
I'm trying, I'm trying
- Baby, hurry up.

727
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,436
Babe, grab the cash.

728
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,314
[whispering] How'd
you do over there?

729
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,384
Hey, did you not hear me!'.I

730
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,448
Give me your fuckin' wallet!

731
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,661
I don't have a wallet.

732
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,055
Then you give me your cash!

733
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,925
[chuckles] I don't
have any cash.

734
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,829
You see what I have here?

735
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,401
Sure. I do indeed.

736
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:28,097
That's a Glock 19.
Semi-automatic hand gun,

737
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,504
Weighting in at 30 ounces
when fully loaded,

738
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,646
6.85 inches long, and
a favorite with military,

739
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,545
law enforcement
and Holl-lee-wood.

740
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,186
These things usually
retail for 600 bucks,

741
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,914
but I suspect,
you did not pay retail.

742
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,956
Ow!

743
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,257
Aw, kid...

744
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,968
Don't spoil a good time

745
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,002
Babe, baby, I have
everything, let's go.

746
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,941
Gel back!

747
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,310
Who locked the fuckin' door!

748
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,480
You!

749
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,911
Get over here and
unlock this door now!

750
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,380
Get over here.
- I didn't do anything

751
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,487
Don't bullshit me!

752
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,214
Open the fucking door!

753
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,188
It's jammed.

754
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,022
There's a back door. Just go out the back.
The back doors right there.

755
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,064
Fuckin' lying to me...
You lying to me? I'm watching you...

756
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:32,570
Go to the door.
Go to the door baby.

757
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:33,966
Open the door baby.

758
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:37,006
I'm trying!
[bashing]

759
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,450
What the fuck is going on here!

760
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,519
[sobbing] What do I do?

761
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,053
You messin' with me?

762
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,590
Don't fuck with me!
You fucking with me?!

763
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,455
Huh? You fuckin' with me?

764
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,963
[police radio chatter]

765
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,692
[Crash]

766
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:07,396
You don't want to fuck with me,
'cause I will bring these fuckin' walls down.

767
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,405
The fuck.

768
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,442
Yeah, I'll take a look at it.

769
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,542
Gel down!
Gel down!

770
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,581
Quiet!

771
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,990
Just stay back baby.
Oh fuck.

772
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,337
Shit!

773
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,708
[gunshot]

774
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,804
I shot you!

775
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,815
Nope, nothin' there.

776
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,886
Damn, they had good coffee.

777
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,953
7 minutes.

778
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:19,905
You...

779
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,582
you're doing this aren't you!

780
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:30,489
You're doing this!

781
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,693
Hey, kid, I hate
to spoil your fun,

782
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,758
but if you can wail like
ﬁve more minutes,

783
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:39,194
we will do
whatever you want to.

784
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,163
Who the hell do
you think you are, man!

785
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,201
For I will blow
your fucking head off!

786
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,442
Four minutes.

787
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,115
Gel up.

788
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,820
Open the door! -I don't know how.
- Open the door!

789
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:08,085
It should open.
I don't know why...

790
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,853
You! Open the door now.

791
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,590
Just let her go.

792
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:14,994
Open the door.

793
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,670
I'm not in charge, he is.

794
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,812
I'm going to count to three...

795
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,711
I can help you.

796
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,150
Just say yes and
you'll live forever.

797
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:40,190
Don't say yes. Don't trust
them. Don't say yes.

798
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:43,556
Eddie, I don't want to die.
- Shut up!

799
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,824
If you say yes, he can't hurt you.
- Shut up!

800
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,695
No one can. You'll never die.

801
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,462
Don't say yes

802
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,401
I don't want to die, Eddie.

803
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,509
I know, just don't say yes. Don't!

804
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,473
One minute.

805
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,112
Alright everybody shut up.

806
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,409
I'm counting to three; if this
door doesn't open, she dies.

807
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,585
OK-

808
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,913
One

809
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,623
Take the gift

810
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,688
Don't say yes

811
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,360
Two!
- Say yes.

812
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,758
Look - I'll take it
I'll take the gift.

813
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,695
Just open the god damn door.

814
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,664
Eddie!
Wow, you'd do that for her?

815
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,234
How sweet.

816
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,270
Shut up!
- He said yes. You heard him.

817
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,305
[whisper] I like her better.

818
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,045
Three!
- Please Eddie, help me.

819
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,214
Open the fucking door, now!

820
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,882
Open the door!

821
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,720
[gunshot]

822
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,390
[coughing]

823
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,631
I need you, I love you.
Oh god...

824
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,786
[sobbing]

825
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:18,037
I'm sorry...

826
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,713
I killed him.

827
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,995
♫♫

828
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,695
Hello.

829
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,830
Hello. Who the fuck is this?

830
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:12,896
It's Eddie

831
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,328
Fuck you.

832
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:19,004
Listen, um, you gonna be
home for a bit?

833
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,734
You show up at my door
and I swear I'll kill you.

834
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,347
I'll be right over.
