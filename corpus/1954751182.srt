1
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:16,867
- They say that if you move something, even just a little
bit Sand, you are risking the alteration of history.

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:52,694
Of gods and men

3
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:37,916
- Yeh, you look into the galaxy, the
journey to new Worlds, they have said to me.

4
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:42,902
Ph, I feel like a robot
in front of this box.

5
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:48,597
What is it?

6
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,087
Hey, what do you do ...?

7
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,617
- Where is Kirk? Where can I find him?

8
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:07,457
- I do not understand.
- Answer me!

9
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:11,235
- Captain Kirk? From the Enterprise?

10
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,883
He has been killed. Four years ago.

11
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:21,702
- No! How?

12
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:28,504
- He died when he and hundreds of
the Enterprise Survivors rescued.

13
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,042
- Saved? Show it to me!

14
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:43,624
-Yeh - Yes, it is not difficult,
the information get. - Ready

15
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,624
- Look!

16
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:56,119
- He died in the rescue of hundreds of people.
- Billions - trillions of people, whole planet.

17
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,631
I do not think that you are so in his own person interested because you do not know?
- He did not want me to save

18
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,633
I did not wait 40
years to now be cheated.

19
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:41,172
- Captain's Personal Log: Stardate 6712.4
- I was reactivated by Starfleet. My powers have been issued with restrictions again, as I boarded returned.

20
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:50,155
I feel like my reactivation 40 years ago when I saw my first
service on the Enterprise took under Captain Kirk's command.

21
00:03:50,655 --> 00:04:02,660
Even my representative role in the subsequent star
- Fleet, I have exercised with full commitment, and that already for 12 years. It was a really colorful time.

22
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:20,668
My dear friend Scotty is missing and no one can he . help Sulu is on its way to the Gamma Quadrant for the next 3
years. McCoy and Spok want and they are probably also capable enough, a way for cooperation be found with the Klingons.

23
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:44,679
All this led me to Erkentnis that I am in my Life something is missing, especially the old friends and
their Broadcast on me and a very special ship. All This is exactly what I need. It is for us all Need.

24
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:05,689
Is this a life here! -Nayota
Captain Uhura. Welcome aboard.

25
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,691
Do you like the ship?

26
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:14,694
Commander Kirk! I must say I'm
overwhelmed. -Because I have to agree.

27
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:22,698
It is the perfect replica. It is exactly the same, so as we know it. All of us would
be thrilled especially Captain Kirk. -Thank you. Your presence here is an honor to me.

28
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:33,702
-The. This one gives me a feeling like back then.
-Pavel, sure, you are often told me recently, that you want to come here to sit again, to work there.

29
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:37,704
Captain Pavel Chekov, as a
special guest, if you want?

30
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:47,709
-Go over there! I do
know that you want.

31
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,712
Captain Uhura!

32
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:56,714
-Oh, no thanks. So
I've spent enough time.

33
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:08,719
-John! How fortunate that I see you
again. -You see, as always, great. -Oh!

34
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Charmer!

35
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:17,723
-Hello Pavel.
-Oh, Sady. I've just remembered something.

36
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,725
Hello, Commander. I'm John
Harriman. -Well, you see.

37
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:32,230
-What was so wrong? 6 months have passed, since we saw each other.
-What can I say. The safety of Starfleet has fully utilized me as no other task.

38
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:36,733
-Tell me about it. What
about your transportation?

39
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:46,737
Policy is not so easy. I think the whole
thing is to a lot and takes a long time.

40
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:52,740
-Is not that huge?
-A little.

41
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,744
-I can not help it, these are living legends. My Uncle told me everything about them.
-To her uncle.

42
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:07,747
-Do not worry. He did it and enjoyed it.
He has lived and died, just as he wanted.

43
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:21,753
-I think the Star Fleet was the reason. As it happened Chekov was on board. He then has the injured people medical
care. How is your uncle and he helped me not in itself to think for themselves. Since then, he's my best friend.

44
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:24,755
Status report.

45
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:34,259
-We have deciphered the code. It is armed at - Neten counsel asked. The news comes
from a Probe. It is located in the orbit of the planet ... . The designation is M-622.

46
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,761
-M
-622? But that's ... !

47
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:43,764
-The code is from the star ships have long since
longer used and the probe is not in a museum?

48
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:48,766
-A famous man once told me: The risk is always
with the person who commands a spaceship.

49
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,768
Helmsman, set a course!

50
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,770
Deja-vu. Everything is back nocheinmal.

51
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:50,795
-I can not say that I missed this place have.
-Any sign of life?

52
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:03,801
-We do not need them.
And not that either.

53
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:08,803
Charlie! Charlie Evans?

54
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:12,805
-I see the lady says.
-You know this man?

55
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:20,809
-I have known him since he was 17 But he has such a makantes appearance that he must be.
-This is better than I expected.

56
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:30,813
-Your Captain I was not very appreciated. I looked up at him, but he gave me nothing back.
It is for this responsibility that I am 40 years a prisoner of Thasianer was. Very long.

57
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:34,815
- Charlie! You had taken over the ship.

58
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:38,817
'He should help me.

59
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,818
Captain Kirk had the responsibility
of the ship and the crew.

60
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:51,823
Wait! You do not know what the time
portal is capable of. -And if I know.

61
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,826
-The Earth!

62
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:12,833
-What happened?

63
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:20,837
-Oops! The traveler is en route. Nothing
in history is more to be like it has been.

64
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,843
-The shuttle refuses to fly
into the hangar, Captain.

65
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:04,858
-I have it covered with a tractor beam.

66
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,859
-Let it be destroyed.
It would be a pleasure.

67
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:16,863
Och-start trading, typically Klingons, first - then
to think. It's like a game, if something can destroy.

68
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,864
-It does not matter,
that is the Galactic law.

69
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:26,867
Captain, verification of identity was found
exactly what we have suspected and searched.

70
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:32,871
-That could be very good for you. Catrick
- the fox will surely find the most and is used by all hunted.

71
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:38,873
-The Command Center: Share this woman, she should
shut up and then remove their Jagtbeute from here.

72
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:45,877
-Koval, you do not think so, as you say it.
-What should I do? She is a slave!

73
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:50,879
-Yes, but she is my slave, and
it is better that you remember.

74
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,882
They Beamt directly to the bridge!

75
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:04,886
- Is that wise?
- Oh well, you're scared.

76
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,887
Weapons!

77
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,889
Beam 'it over!

78
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:24,895
-Catrick.

79
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:32,899
I'm glad I did it. Finally,
the fox by the fox was caught.

80
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:46,905
And ... I was sure that I do get. " -It 's like
a gift that we face compared to face possible.

81
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:51,907
-My way, I went to I was the right thing
and not as terrorists like you Terrorists?

82
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:58,910
We are fighting for our freedom!
Freedom? What is freedom versus security?

83
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:10,916
Nothing! The Galactic law contains this security. -I get a bad feeling I get sick
If people like you talk about your freedom and safety. The victim of her will.

84
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:25,924
'But none of us hiding behind boulders. The truth is, you're
the loser. Gurret Prime has ordered, such as you destroy them.

85
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,925
-We will see.

86
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:39,930
-That you will now see as my prisoners. In four hours it is ready. Then you will see what
it does not mean to be on our side. Bring them into custody and give them time to Reflection.

87
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:45,933
-With pleasure.

88
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:11,945
-Fill in the tables supplied.
-Yes it is ...

89
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:19,948
Children, you must always remember
that the logic the only one ...

90
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,951
-The introduction of this technique is in contrast to Surak's
teachings and involves a confrontation with that what we praise.

91
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:34,955
Uhura-ma'am! Need Help?
-No. Ah, thanks, I'm fine.

92
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:44,960
Consultant Stonn. Is it for you in order that
we Topic of discussion change? 'I'm for it.

93
00:14:45,961 --> 00:15:05,970
-The final test of the last volcanic era showed that not a lot has evolved. It is lived according to what is old
and outdated. I provezeie, lies in those principles, a large Danger. I believe that. I've also always heard again.

94
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:15,974
-It is probably better to postpone this discussion,
we, with Stonn's consent, in our next session.

95
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:34,983
-Madame Uhura. I know the facts, which you Spok found on the volcanic life, and with the galactic conflict with the
law. But the amount in time we need to transform ourselves and the Price to defend themselves against it very high.

96
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:52,992
-Ie, we need leadership and it is important that we must look at everything differently, and it
is particularly important that we have the rights of all in the first place must be considered.

97
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:58,995
-If I have understood you correctly, that
is, representing a entitled to, is at all?

98
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:22,006
-I just said that only a few first Place standing and the historical development has shown, that they do not want to share. The result is a slave
- rei. So it will come. Do not believe me? Then look You galactic in the law.

99
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:48,017
-We need to find something. The van has the same
Components. -I will find a way. -We will, my friend.

100
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,019
We will!

101
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:06,026
Uhura-ma'am! Feel
good? -Of course.

102
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:29,037
I had a very bad dream. I have pictures and seen faces, and I think I know
the everything. This had such an extraordinary attraction force on me. I am ...

103
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:36,040
-Maybe it's stress caused by the galactic events.
-Maybe ...

104
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:42,043
-You need to rest until we meet Spok.

105
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:47,046
-Grandmother!
-Oh, my dears. Oh, I'm happy to see you, I love you.

106
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:51,047
-Nayota.
-Oh, husband.

107
00:17:51,048 --> 00:18:00,051
Nut. -Sevar, my son, good to see you. Nice
to see you ge - have been coming. T'Bir.

108
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:12,057
-We had to work, but the children have always your name on the list and wanted to see you.
-Oh, that's cooperation, I wanted to hear.

109
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:21,061
-It is logical that we have arrived at this time. -Of course. -It
is only logical reasons, very many, and certainly not Pleasant.

110
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,064
-I see you safely later.

111
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:39,070
Mir is come to some ears. -Well, it's nothing,
son. I'm just a little by - each other. That is all.

112
00:18:39,071 --> 00:19:02,080
-You have said anything against the government and how to galactic law stands.
-No, that's it, you can imagine that I'm illogical, but I think the law is not that what it is possible should. It is not right here, and has no validity.

113
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:11,085
-These are trifles. Our technology is up to date We will not
let us stand as you guided by emotions, which We do not accept.

114
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:24,090
-You have ships and technology that are aged over 40 years and the weapons are not much better. How do you
yourselves distribution . competent And I've heard that it is a dangerous weapon have built to destroy everything ...

115
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:45,100
Parent who will kill anyone, the do not shoot at us. -You do not know! -I am
sure our government is right. -I am sure that you are doing the right thing.

116
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,116
Captain, the weapon is
activated and ready for firing.

117
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,118
Planet in range.

118
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,120
-On screen!

119
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:52,131
Captain, the entire defense fleet is destroyed
been. -Now we are poised for the final blow.

120
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:57,134
-Not now. Bring us in position
to 2 million kilometers.

121
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,137
-2 Million km, yes sir!

122
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:23,146
Volcano. -Yes, I am planning a first by example, to
to see how the new weapon. I thought it interests you.

123
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:31,150
-I can not bear Vulcans. They refuse to stand
against it, but It is probably the same effect.

124
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:43,156
-That is all anyway, even if they refuse
do not care. Captain, why do not you shoot?

125
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:50,159
-Remember Gurret Prime's
command, now is the best Time.

126
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:59,163
-I live to serve.

127
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:06,166
Fire!

128
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:50,215
-Oach, glorious! Now you can see what the chatter of the new Ideas and peace is worth it. Only in this way,
the increases understand interrelationships. You've got to learn. You must prevail, or you will be controlled.

129
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:15,226
- Captain, a few foreign
vessels have escaped.

130
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:17,209
-Shall I bring in them?

131
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:24,895
N ... no, let them go. They will
be witnesses to what happened.

132
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:29,379
-Remarkable, you show more emotion.

133
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:34,900
- The shuttle is scanned. On
board, a Vulcan, and are A Terran.

134
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:41,733
- Well, Vulcans and humans together? Get them on board!
- Yes, sir!

135
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:30,476
- Do not make it too easy for you, Vulcan! The captain will come to the
decision that You my friend, will be executed. Together with the Others.

136
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:44,111
-Tuvok! Stonn and the children, think that they have done.
Do you think that they have achieved and Stonn a ship?

137
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:54,918
- Madame Uhura. Shuttles have hundreds of planets surface to leave.
I know that Stonn and Brought your family to one of the boats.

138
00:25:56,197 --> 00:26:03,710
-You see, there is no other alternative,
it is essential to fight against it.

139
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:16,239
- We know people like you. They kill just for their own Ideals. Exactly as
prescribed by the galactic law and so do her, too. Since your no better, sir!

140
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:20,811
-We reject the law. We
kill the To gain freedom.

141
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:27,806
-This is idle talk. Murder
is murder! And a new Me ...

142
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:39,287
You ... They trigger in me an
idea. I would like a mind-meld.

143
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:44,794
-It is always the same. We also
fight for and who do not understand.

144
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:48,791
-Because they do not want
to understand what we do.

145
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,308
- I like the Vulcans do not. All his
gestures. I think that could be a problem.

146
00:26:55,785 --> 00:27:01,780
-He will not interfere. For this,
I worry that this is not happened.

147
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:12,274
Vulcans Hey! Hear my words! You immediately interrupt,
if something goes wrong, or I shall personally kill.

148
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,771
-Maybe this is the only way. I'll
make it so as if it were my sister.

149
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:18,769
-I do not know how you
do it, but do it quickly.

150
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:23,765
-Do not touch me when you're ready.
I'll do no harm. I am your friend.

151
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:31,760
'I leave it because you are my friend.

152
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:47,748
-My mind to your mind, my
thoughts to your thoughts.

153
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:55,743
The time-changes ... ...

154
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,740
-Yes!

155
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:02,738
Friends ... The guard! Aah!

156
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:08,733
-Yes! What have you seen?
Tell me, Tuvok what you saw.

157
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:13,730
-A ship ... Other crew members.
-Yes!

158
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:19,725
-You should only help her, Instead, make They are still confused with your volcanic
-Stupid sinn.

159
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:28,717
-Include events that are in my mind two time lines and other memories come from the true time line, I think.
-Yes!

160
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:48,703
Yes, that's it! At the time of the volcano. I am not sure what we have there
geshehen. I did not know what was wrong with me. That was real Tuvok, it was real!

161
00:28:56,699 --> 00:29:04,690
-I know it. Pavel! This
is your name, or not?

162
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:14,683
-How do you know this name?
-I have pictures of you. And this name is always thus possible.

163
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:19,181
-I have not heard that name 20 years.

164
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:32,671
-Pavel, listen to me. There's so many things not
the way You think. You and I, we have a common Past.

165
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:51,657
-Listen to me very carefully! I am Catrick. I am a freedom
fighter. No idea what you are talking, you verschohnen me with it.

166
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:58,652
-You are wasting too much time with her.
-Let us now focus only on our problem.

167
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:05,646
-I have found that eight of the twenty Contacts
are secured. -Can you destroy it? Non-alone.

168
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:19,637
-Can you pierce it? -With a lot of energy,
only for a short time. With all together? -No!

169
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:28,631
-In order to startle them all? -We wanted to
but later on the bridge. -No, in the engine room.

170
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:39,623
-The machine room is too big, too many entrances. 'But you can from there everything better
-controlled . lose From there, you have access to all Marine systems.

171
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:43,120
-How do you know?
-I just know it.

172
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:48,616
-Time!
-Let us make it so!

173
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:55,612
-What does this mean here? If the guard?
Be Instructions followed? Your weapons!

174
00:30:55,613 --> 00:31:02,605
-Go your Quatier into your waiting for your
Punish! Created a report to the 1700s. Buy!

175
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:12,599
-Exellent.
-But I do not know how long I stay in this form can.

176
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:21,591
-We will be preceded by a prisoner and you will come afterwards. -If
it does not really look like an execution? -It is up to you yourself

177
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:40,578
Commander Guarantee! What are you going to do with
the prisoners? -They should be promptly executed. -Yes.

178
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:48,573
'But after request from the Captain, I know only from the People
and the Vulcans. -But I got another order from him. 'But sir!

179
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:56,567
-You doubt me? -No, sir. But .... -The Captain
does not like it at all, if he must wait. -Yes, sir.

180
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:10,556
Commander Guarantee! Where is the
fourth prisoner? The fourth-prisoners?

181
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:15,553
-He r. ..
-He is not with us!

182
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:27,544
-Let us go.
-Hurry!

183
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:44,532
-Where to now? Eight
-decks below.

184
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:53,526
-The Vulcans do not believe in hell.
-We do not do. Whenever. If we someone attacks, we defend ourselves only.

185
00:32:53,527 --> 00:33:02,517
-Made by me. I hope for you that this is not Error. -I am excited about what we
on the other side expect when we walk through the door. -They have miscalculated.

186
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:08,513
-The air is clean.

187
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,500
-Seal the doors!

188
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:37,491
-Oh God! He needs help!
-I am a freedom fighter, not a doctor.

189
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:44,487
-How can people be so inhuman!
-The takeover of the ship's control is important.

190
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:48,485
-Oh, Tuvok.

191
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:05,472
-The prisoners have occupied the engine room and
assumed control. The guard is dead, think I do.

192
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:10,469
-And how do you imagine, the Energy Control get back to my ship?
-It is very simple.

193
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:22,459
-We will enter forcefully into the engine and take control again. The hole out
of there. I dare you not to come back here come until the matter is resolved.

194
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:33,452
-Are you ready?
-For the most part.

195
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,451
-The self
-destruct sequence is initiated.

196
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:40,447
-What are you doing? -What
must be done. -But the mission!

197
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:43,446
-I changed the mission.
-Catrick!

198
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:52,438
-It is the only way out.
-You want to destroy everything, what we have achieved. We have control of the vessel at any time.

199
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:55,436
The self-made in 45
seconds. -Catrick!

200
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:58,434
-Let me go!

201
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:07,428
-Everything is out of function.
-How did he do it? -I do not know.

202
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,425
The self-made in 30 seconds.

203
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:18,420
-Catrick! What do you want? -I want nothing. -So
you want to not blow up my ship, or see I disagree?

204
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:27,411
The self-made in 15 seconds. -What
do you want? -I want to die, we do.

205
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:37,406
The self-made in 10,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,

206
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:55,392
-Have you realized what you did?
-Yes. I want to give everyone a chance for freedom.

207
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:58,389
-This was the only way!
-What has the murder of all of us to do with freedom?

208
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,386
-These people must be stopped! These
killers and butchers? Things worth dying for.

209
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:10,381
-Tuvok and I will be murdered!
Nevertheless, we do not want to die a death.

210
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:15,879
-What have you done in your past life? They have
watched passively as freedom fighters died for freedom.

211
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:23,847
-None of us has the idea of the people to kill on star ships.
-I will kill if necessary.

212
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:32,810
-What kind of a peace, if you have
only fear must. That is not necessary.

213
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:42,768
-I am not one of those. I
also once thought this way.

214
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:53,721
-Why is stopped? -I do not know. I can
not do anything. -What was going on?

215
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:07,664
-Look at it, what you have done. That
was the only chance for those to come.

216
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:25,590
-Catrick.
-It is true, if it must be for our cause die. I am ready to die in battle.

217
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:34,552
-Tuvok. Tuvok! You need to
hold out, my friend. Please.

218
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:54,469
-You must be connected. It is too big for
encryption close. There's nothing I can do.

219
00:37:55,464 --> 00:37:57,457
-Chekov.

220
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,424
-What are you doing?
-That's fine.

221
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,402
-Take your mind back to you, Vulcans.

222
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:20,361
-You remember me.

223
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:45,257
Tuvok. What have you done? They need
your knowledge, or they need your list?

224
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:52,228
-My life, my choice.

225
00:38:57,346 --> 00:39:02,353
-Live long and successful ...

226
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:14,367
-Oh, Tuvok. Peace be
with you, my friend.

227
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:34,389
Captain. As yet, no progress can
be seen, to do with what we do.

228
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,395
Then fiber a set or something.
Fetch me my Ship back.

229
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:42,399
-Yes, sir.

230
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:47,404
-We take the control menu on the machine control.
-I set course for Narkos.

231
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:57,417
-Pavel. I know that we must go. But not after Narkos.
-You can not stop me.

232
00:39:57,418 --> 00:40:09,431
-I know it just like you, we need a course a planet that
is known as M-622nd -I have no time for such nonsense.

233
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:25,449
-Pavel, please. On this planet there is a time portal that Ver
- make changes in time and space can. -No, I know your folly.

234
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:34,460
-Pavel. Please. -All right. I scan the room for
temporal Ano - . malien But that will bring nothing.

235
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:44,471
-No, there are no records from the planet M
-622.

236
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:55,482
Stop. Since temporal shifts
are shown. In a small system.

237
00:40:55,483 --> 00:41:03,491
-This is it. Pavel, that's it! -That means
nothing. -How many lives need to be eliminated.

238
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:14,503
-All right. We fly.
N. .. Leave me alone!

239
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:23,514
-Catrick. It costs a lot more in time.
-We have lots of energy. We do it anyway.

240
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:41,535
-Sir, we're going to warp six.

241
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:50,546
Captain. The engine is still not available.
And Commander Garan is not continue come.

242
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:59,557
-We have to try to
control my ship to get. Go!

243
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,565
-Placed the coordinates for the flight to M
-622.

244
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:21,582
-Pavel, there is something else. It's about Harriman.
He is connected with the here. 'I've heard enough.

245
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:29,592
-No. We know exactly what we need him and the what was going on here.
-No!

246
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:40,603
I hunt these butchers for 20 years. -Why? Because
the galactic law as it wants? Or not enough?

247
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:43,608
-Because he has wiped out my family!

248
00:42:48,614 --> 00:43:32,665
Irina and me. We found a paradise. We found it in New Eden. We had a son. Piotr. We were happy. And when Harriman
I've lost everything. My wife, my son. And by now I have a Vulcan streamed a trick to get his mind when he died.

249
00:43:37,672 --> 00:44:11,711
-Can you not imagine that I am at Volcano that has happened to my family the same? My
whole family. But I know that we need it. We need Harriman. I know it and you know it.

250
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:24,725
Captain. I have a message from Prime Gurret
received and asked why we fly this course.

251
00:44:29,732 --> 00:44:34,734
-I did not at all said I was just so
giving up control of the ship is intended.

252
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:38,739
-It also believes no one,
but you do not mind done.

253
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,747
-Remember. A living is
better than a fox Dead.

254
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:57,762
-So now we come to that Harriman and Gurret Prime must
be placed on the same site. This is better than I thought.

255
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,766
Is O Cat, do not forget
how dangerous things.

256
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:08,775
-We can create together. 'You've never seen him.
-What?

257
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:13,781
-You Gurret Prime never seen
and do not know who he is?

258
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:37,810
Wait a moment. At the point where the time portal was A man so far as I know. He was your will kontrol
- . lose Somehow it seems to me that as if he thus to and so what we do has happened.

259
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:58,834
-Catrick. It has now lasted long enough. Too long a time. Listen,
we should discuss our differences in order to eliminate much of this.

260
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:04,840
-Remember, we need it.

261
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:16,854
Sun-Captain Harriman. You want to entice me, enable your people to kill
me. -No. No, but of course we can not do otherwise daily operations.

262
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,858
-Is that all?

263
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:30,871
I have a better idea. Why do not you come down here and make me self
- handed to?

264
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:40,881
-Take it to attack, we are 5 minutes on the ground.
-I have waited long enough. Do it yourself

265
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:51,895
-Probably a trap.
-No, really?

266
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:57,903
Posted and if you are behind the door is open, one
takes it. Is not that crazy? -You shall not kill him!

267
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:03,909
I only want to know everything about what
he and his friends Have heard Gurret Prime.

268
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:18,925
-Immediately come! Remains on standby. If we want to be
successful, we will submit ourselves to Koval's command.

269
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:25,935
-You can add me to scan with the tricorder. You see, I 'm alone and armed.
-This is excellent.

270
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:28,938
-Join the front door.

271
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:46,959
-Impressive! When did you learn that?
-You think, something that only your volcanic Friends.

272
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:06,982
-Apology. I think we are attacked from behind been.
-I know. It was a shabby trick. I will I rely on you and so will you protect me?

273
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:15,991
-We had everything under control. -What did I say? Go
back to the bridge and say it's all Order. -Yes, sir.

274
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:27,002
-Wa ... wa ... wake up! Wake up!
-Pavel!

275
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:44,023
-Do you know what you did? Do you know what you owe me?
-Pavel, it is enough!

276
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:58,039
-Excellent. What will I be doing?

277
00:49:10,053 --> 00:49:16,062
-So, Sir, the ship has entered the standard orbit. Helmsman.
-Still no control here.

278
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:25,071
-We are making progress, it takes only a few Minutes.
-Uhh, Ph.D.

279
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:50,100
-Do you really think that you can run away with us? My crew
will get me, that's for sure. 'Maybe they need that any more.

280
00:49:56,106 --> 00:50:02,115
Commander. Three people have beamed to the surface.
-The prisoners? -Someone must have helped them.

281
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:12,126
Harriman? Computer! Captain Harriman Locate!
Captain Harriman is not on board the ship.

282
00:50:14,129 --> 00:50:19,134
Transporter room!

But I do not how it works.
-Only I can operate it.

285
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:49,169
Please. You do not need it.

286
00:50:55,176 --> 00:51:03,186
I am surprised to see you three here. Oh, you can not

-Uhura. Chekov.
-John. How did you come here?

288
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:23,208
'I'm just, I do not know here.

289
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:41,231
-It is very strange. I remember that we Friends are. You feel the same way as I

290
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:43,232

Captain Kirk was so great, why could He did not help me when I was 17 years old.

293
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:14,266
-I made use of the guard and killed Kirk's mother, before he was born.
-How was it possible to play with the guards?

294
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:25,279
-It was a mistake that I know now. But I did changed. I have reversed it.
-This will help the hundreds of billions more not, who must live with the torment of the law.

295
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:35,290
-Can a man be so involved in the story that it is dependent on him will not change?
-That is possible.

296
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:48,305
-The story was changed around 70 years ago. Charlie, bring the back in order.
-It is impossible. All tests, the time line is just ...

00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,559
-It probably looks like
that we're still alive.

306
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:45,560
-You probably habst a small insignificant Planet called
New Eden forgotten. I was not. My family has lived there.

307
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:57,561
-The truth is, I've only ausgefurt commands. That Firing of
torpedoes from the bridge was so easy. I have seen no faces.

308
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:09,563
-What have I done wrong? I was
bitten at about this terrible game?

309
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:19,564
I assume that I and it was
so. Pavel Chekov died that day.

-Still better than if they are covered now.

361
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:40,641
-Bruce, Cortran! Bring your
boats out of the firing line.

362

the ship. Destroyed because both of them!

363

to the skin. But they are irons.

364
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,650

increases at the destroyer.

-Yes you can do it, Charlie. Yes you can. You are very responsible for many lives.

378
01:13:02,668 --> 01:13:08,667
Only you can change it
again. You can do it.

Remember. Remember Charlie, our first Coincidence? Charlie is my darling. My
sweetheart. My darling Charlie is my darling. Oh, Charlie, you can do it. You have to.
