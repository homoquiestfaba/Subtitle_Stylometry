1
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,725
<i>Earth-That-Was... </i>

2
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,926
<i>could no longer sustain
our numbers, we were so many. </i>

3
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,633
<i>We found a new solar system:</i>

4
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,905
<i>Dozens of planets
and hundreds of moons. </i>

5
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,979
<i>Each one terraformed,
a process taking decades... </i>

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,212
<i>to support human life. 
To be new Earths. </i>

7
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,152
<i>The central planets
formed the Alliance. </i>

8
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,583
<i>Ruled by an interplanetary
parliament... </i>

9
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization. </i>

10
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,922
<i>The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened... </i>

11
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,022
<i>and refused Alliance control. </i>

12
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,065
<i>The war was devastating. </i>

13
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,064
<i>But the Alliance's victory
over the Independents... </i>

14
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,003
<i>ensured a safer universe. </i>

15
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,402
And now, everyone
can enjoy the comfort...

16
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,774
and enlightenment
of true civilization.

17
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,880
Why were the Independents
even fighting us?

18
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,916
Why wouldn't they look
to be more civilized?

19
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,577
I hear they're cannibals.
That's only Reavers.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,780
Reavers aren't real.
Full well they are.

21
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,686
I heard they attack settlers
from space...

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,190
and kill them,
and wear their skins...

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,419
and rape them
for hours and hours...

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,425
It's true
that there are dangers
on the outer planets.

25
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,035
So with so many social
and medical advancements...

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,196
we can bring
to the Independents...

27
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,102
why would they fight
so hard against us?

28
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,265
We meddle.

29
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,831
River?

30
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,602
People don't like
to be meddled with.

31
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,806
We tell them what to do,
what to think.

32
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,473
Don't run, don't walk.

33
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,441
We're in their homes
and in their heads
and we haven't the right.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,885
We're meddlesome.

35
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,453
River, we're not telling
people what to think...

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,288
we're just trying
to show them how.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,660
She's dreaming. Got that?
Off the charts.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,262
Scary monsters.

39
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

40
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,866
See, most of our best work
is done when they're asleep.

41
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,501
We can monitor and direct
their subconscious...

42
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,272
implant suggestions.

43
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,173
It's a little startling
to see at first,
but results are spectacular.

44
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,717
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

45
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,151
I've heard that.

46
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,120
She'll be ideal
for defense deployment...

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,987
even with the side effects.

48
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,585
Tell me about them.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,151
Well, obviously,
she's unstable.

50
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,027
The neural stripping
does tend to fragment...

51
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,657
their own reality matrix.

52
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,861
It manifests as borderline...
What use do we have...

53
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,631
for a psychic
if she's insane?

54
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,604
She's not just a psychic.

55
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,233
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

56
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,904
She has her lucid periods.
We're hoping
to improve upon the...

57
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,581
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to ask.

58
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,141
Is there a reason
for this inspection?

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,114
Am I making you nervous?

60
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,647
Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject.

61
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,624
I was told that
the Alliance's support...

62
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,160
for the project
was unanimous.

63
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,595
The demonstration
of her power...
How is she physically?

64
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,426
Like nothing we've seen.

65
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,895
All our subjects
are conditioned for combat,
but River...

66
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,838
she's a creature
of extraordinary grace.

67
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,874
Yes.

68
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,104
She always
did love to dance.

69
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,344
River, it's Simon.

70
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,790
Please, it's Simon.

71
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,615
It's your brother.

72
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,390
Simon.

73
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,497
They know you've come.

74
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,170
We can't make it
to the surface from inside.

75
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,045
Find out.

76
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,879
A subject is loose,
security breach. Shaft 7.

77
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,191
Stop.

78
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,939
Backtrack. Stop.

79
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,514
Excuse me...

80
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,578
no one is allowed
in the records room...

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,419
without my express permission.

82
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,722
Forgive me, but I prefer
to see the event alone,
without...

83
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,885
bias.

84
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,262
I need to see your clearance.
And you are right
to insist.

85
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,399
<i>Parliamentary override. 
Full access. </i>

86
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,831
Apologies.

87
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,169
An operative of
the Parliament...

88
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,607
will, of course,
have full cooperation.

89
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,635
I'm not sure what...

90
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,110
I see no listing
of rank or name.
I have neither.

91
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,282
Like this facility,
I don't exist.

92
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,351
Let's talk about the Tams.

93
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,654
I assume you've
scanned the status logs...

94
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,820
River was your greatest
success. A prodigy.

95
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,093
A phenomenon.

96
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,495
Until her brother
walked in here
and took her from you.

97
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,397
It's not quite so simple.
I'm well aware of that.

98
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,304
There was no way
that I could...
No. No. Of course.

99
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,365
The boy spent
his entire fortune
developing...

100
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,137
the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

101
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,736
Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

102
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,077
It's madness.
Madness?

103
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,679
Have you looked
at this scan carefully,
Doctor?

104
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,079
At his face?

105
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,589
It's love, in point of fact.

106
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,389
Something a good deal
more dangerous.

107
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,621
Why are you here?

108
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:43,328
Because the situation
is even less simple
than you think.

109
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,264
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?

110
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,405
I wonder if...
It's pride.

111
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,214
<i>Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject. </i>

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,013
<i>I was told that
the Alliance's support... </i>

113
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,585
"Key members of Parliament. "

114
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,889
Key.

115
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,129
The minds behind
every military...

116
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,760
diplomatic,
and covert operation...

117
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,498
in the galaxy,
and you put them...

118
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,006
in a room with a psychic.

119
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,374
If there was some
classified information
that she...

120
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,447
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

121
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,573
Nor do I.

122
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,618
And judging by
her deteriorating
mental state...

123
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,947
I'd say we're both
better off.

124
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,648
Secrets are not my concern.

125
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,823
Keeping them is.

126
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,522
Whatever secrets
she might have
accidentally gleaned...

127
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,065
it's probable
she doesn't even
know she knows them.

128
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,863
That they're buried
beneath layers of psychosis.

129
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,837
You know, in certain
older civilized cultures...

130
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,099
when men failed as entirely...

131
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,667
as you have,
they would throw themselves...

132
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,971
on their swords.

133
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,641
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

134
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,584
I would put that down
right now, if I were you.

135
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,681
Would you be killed
in your sleep
like an ailing pet?

136
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,103
Young miss...

137
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,572
Young miss, I'll need
all the logs on behavioral
modification triggers.

138
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,079
We'll have to reach out
to River Tam...

139
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,580
and help her
to come back to us.

140
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,810
No matter how
far out Simon has...

141
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,948
This is a good death.

142
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,321
There's no shame in this...

143
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,594
in a man's death.
A man who has done fine works.

144
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,863
We're making a better world.

145
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,665
All of them...

146
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,963
better worlds.

147
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,514
Young miss,
I need you to go to work now.

148
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,450
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

149
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:28,425
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

150
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,055
What was that?
Did you see that?

151
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,725
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

152
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,063
It did seem to resemble...
Did the primary
buffer panel...

153
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,104
just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,064
Looks like.

155
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,699
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

156
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,767
I've a clear memory of it.
If she doesn't get us...

157
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,405
extra flow
from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

158
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,108
this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

159
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,117
Define "interesting. "
"Oh, God,
we're all gonna die?"

160
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,812
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

161
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,983
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

162
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,425
slight turbulence
and then explode.

163
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,019
Can you shave the vector?
I'm doing it!

164
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,758
It's not enough.
Just get us on the ground!

165
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,232
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

166
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,536
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

167
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,197
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

168
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,173
You only got two arms.
I just get excitable...

169
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,142
as to choice.
Like to have my options open.

170
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,542
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

171
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,208
What you plan
and what takes place ain't
ever exactly been similar.

172
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,683
No grenades.

173
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,013
We crashing again?
Talk to your husband.

174
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,316
Mule prepped?
Good to go, sir.

175
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,378
Just loading her up.

176
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,481
Those grenades?

177
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,957
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

178
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,551
Jayne, we're robbing
the place. We're not
occupying it.

179
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,464
Kaylee!

180
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,933
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

181
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,976
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right...

182
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,307
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

183
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,843
You told me
those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

184
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,909
That was six months ago,
Captain.
My ship don't crash.

185
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,415
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

186
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,216
Doctor.

187
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,023
Guess who needs
to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

188
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,292
Bit of a rockety ride.

189
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,833
Nothing to be worried about.
I'm not worried.

190
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,159
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

191
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,831
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

192
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:26,072
Well, kind of hard to tell
one from the other,
face like yours.

193
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,445
Well, I imagine
if it were fear,
my eyes would be wider.

194
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,281
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

195
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,647
You're not taking her.

196
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,585
No, no, this is not
a thing I'm interested
in talking over with...

197
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,952
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

198
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,992
I hear the words
"that's final" come
out your mouth ever again...

199
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,527
they truly will be.

200
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,659
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

201
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,293
Guests?

202
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,899
Now, I earned my passage,
Captain...
And it's time...

203
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,767
your little sister learned
from your example.

204
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,068
I have earned my passage...

205
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,974
treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

206
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,807
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

207
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,848
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

208
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,076
Didn't say "want. "
Said "will. "

209
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,812
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

210
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,446
She's a 17-year-old girl.

211
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,417
A mentally
traumatized 17...
She's a reader.

212
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,826
Sees into the truth
of things.

213
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,624
Might see trouble
before it's coming.
Which is of use to me.

214
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,063
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

215
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,125
Honestly, Doctor,
I think we may really
crash this time anyway.

216
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,529
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

217
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,039
to keep River away
from the Alliance?

218
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,668
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

219
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,302
enough to keep
to our own selves.

220
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,507
Are you threatening to...
I look out for me and mine.

221
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,448
That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

222
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,682
You stuck a thorn
in the Alliance's paw.
That tickles me a bit.

223
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,554
But it also means
I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

224
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,093
and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

225
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,526
Even honest ones.

226
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,227
Put this crew together with
the promise of work...

227
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,494
Which the Alliance makes
harder every year.

228
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,798
Come a day there
won't be room
for naughty men like us...

229
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,394
to slip about at all.

230
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,666
This job goes south,
there well may not be another.

231
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,140
So here is us,
on the raggedy edge.

232
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,708
Don't push me,
and I won't push you.

233
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,955
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten
this boat out before
we get flattened?

234
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,561
Like a downy feather, sir.
No one flies like my mister.

235
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,736
River.

236
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,015
I know.
We're going for a ride.

237
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,430
Hey, little one.

238
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,003
Understand your part
in all this?

239
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,404
Do you?

240
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,946
This is what I do, darling.

241
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,020
This is what I do.

242
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,991
Let's move, people.

243
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,763
Quit fiddling.
Want the boat running
smooth when we get back.

244
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,458
Have faith, Captain.
Not today.

245
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,368
Pair of clips
in the rear hatch.

246
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,198
We should hit town
right during Sunday worship.

247
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,604
Won't be any crowds.

248
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,973
If Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll...

249
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,103
this could look to be
a sunny day for us.

250
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,079
River, stay behind the others.

251
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,174
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

252
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,209
It's okay
to leave them to die.

253
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,013
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

254
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,587
If anything happens to her,
anything at all...

255
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,561
I swear to you
I will get very choked up.

256
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,621
Honestly.
There could be tears.

257
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,472
Don't mind
the Captain none, Simon.
I know he'll look out for her.

258
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,307
They'll be back
before you can spit.

259
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,452
Well, not that you spit.

260
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,654
What are we hoping
to find here...

261
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,160
that equals
the worth of a turd?

262
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,061
Security payroll. Alliance
don't have the manpower...

263
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,725
to "enforce the peace"
on every outer-rim planet.

264
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,065
They hire
out to the private firms,
who will not work for credit.

265
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,573
They get paid in cashy money,
which once a month rests here.

266
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,665
Don't that lead back to
the Alliance, anyhow?

267
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,610
No private firm
would ever report the theft
of their own payroll.

268
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,842
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

269
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,544
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.
Won't but rattle the floor.

270
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,783
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

271
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,916
Hands and knees and heads
bowed down! Everybody, down!

272
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,695
Looks like this is the place.

273
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,466
You all wanna
be looking very intently
at your own belly buttons.

274
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,806
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

275
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,907
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here...

276
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,143
but what we're after
is not yours.

277
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,876
So let's have
no undue fussing.

278
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,952
She's locked up.

279
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,203
Do you know what
the definition of a hero is?

280
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,100
Someone who gets
other people killed.

281
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,137
You can look it up later.

282
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,313
Big happy family.

283
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,216
At last.
We can retire and give up
this life of crime.

284
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,790
Hey!

285
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,270
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

286
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,399
Petty thieving
ain't exactly soldiers' work.

287
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,775
War's long done.
We're all just folk now.
Listen up!

288
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,209
We are coming down
to empty that vault!

289
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,149
You have to give me
your authorization password!

290
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,280
Okay.

291
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,537
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

292
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,875
Did sound somewhat
like gun blast. Maybe
you ought run tell Lawman.

293
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,342
What the hell is up?
You all right?

294
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,811
What's going on?

295
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,513
Reavers.

296
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,857
The leg is good. It'll bleed
plenty and we avoid
any necessary organs.

297
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,297
I was thinking
more of a graze.

298
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,197
No, you don't want it
to look like you gave up.

299
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,462
No, I get that.

300
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,901
Mal!

301
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,268
Every heist, he's got
to start yelling my name.

302
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,207
Mal! Reavers!

303
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,171
The girl's pitching a fit.
They're here
or they're coming soon.

304
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,645
Get on the Mule.

305
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,512
Does that lock
from the inside?
Yes.

306
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,075
Get everyone upstairs.
You get them down here
and you seal it.

307
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,713
As long as you got air
you don't open up,
you understand?

308
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,883
Get them inside the vault!

309
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,117
You see them?
Zoe, take the wheel!

310
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,560
Anybody see them?

311
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,264
Take me with you!

312
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,999
Get back in the vault with
the others.

313
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,008
I can't stay here! Please!
It's too many. Move ahead.

314
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,509
Please!

315
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,569
Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

316
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,218
How come
they ain't blowing us
out the air?

317
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,159
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

318
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,991
They want us alive
when they eat us.

319
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,425
Boy, sure would be nice
if we had some grenades,
don't you think?

320
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,099
Wash, baby, can you hear me?
We're moments from air.

321
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,472
You got somebody
behind you?
Reavers.

322
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,803
Kaylee!

323
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,677
<i>Heat her up. We got Reavers. </i>

324
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,812
We're not gonna
get to you in time.
Keep moving, honey.

325
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,481
We're coming to you.

326
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,193
Where's my clips?
Rear hatch.

327
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,181
I won't get ate!

328
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,922
You shoot me if they take me!
Well, don't shoot me first!

329
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,733
Get some distance on them.

330
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,608
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

331
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,914
We're gonna try
a Barn Swallow.

332
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,916
<i>Simon! Open her up!</i>

333
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,523
They're closing on us!

334
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,786
Those rocks,
give them a taste.

335
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,741
<i>Okay, baby,
we talked this through. </i>

336
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,605
Talking ain't doing.

337
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,359
River?
I swallowed a bug.

338
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,323
Are you okay?
Is he okay?

339
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,013
<i>We all here? What's going on?</i>

340
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,614
Hello?

341
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,382
No casualties.

342
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,180
<i>Anybody following?
Nice flying, baby. </i>

343
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,692
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

344
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:00,428
Set course for Beaumonde.
First thing,
I want this body...

345
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,488
Simon!

346
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,266
You son of a whore.
I'm a hair's breadth...

347
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,669
from riddling
you with holes, Doctor.

348
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,197
One simple job!
She'll be fine!
She is fine!

349
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,403
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

350
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,175
Wasn't for River,
we'd probably be left there.
She felt them coming.

351
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,442
Never again.
You understand me?

352
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,316
Seems I remember a talk about
you giving orders on my boat.

353
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,945
Well, we're off your boat.

354
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,490
Just as soon as River
gets her share of the bounty.

355
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,322
Let's not do anything hasty...
No, shiny!

356
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,186
We'll be on Beaumonde
in 10 hours' time...

357
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,130
you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

358
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,232
Meantime, you do your job.

359
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,694
Patch up my crew.

360
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,667
He didn't lie down.

361
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,104
They never lie down.

362
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,287
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us...

363
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,324
without River
and Simon on board...

364
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,791
but how long
do you think they'll last?

365
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,418
Doc made his call.

366
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,484
Yeah.

367
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,394
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

368
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,295
We sheltered them plenty.

369
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,699
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

370
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,369
Like that man back in town?

371
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,775
I had to shoot him.

372
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,835
What Reavers would've done
before they killed him...

373
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,404
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

374
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,219
But before that,
him begging us
to bring him along.

375
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,322
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

376
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,655
You know that for certain?
Mule won't run with five.

377
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,059
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

378
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,528
Oh, Jayne...

379
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,298
You could've
tossed the payload.
Tossed the...

380
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:50,270
Zoe, I got bits falling
off my ship, I got
a crew ain't been paid...

381
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,311
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need
to eat sometime this month.

382
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,440
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job...

383
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,504
what do think
they'll do to us?

384
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,284
We're close to gone out here.

385
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,888
We get a job,
we got to make good.

386
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,085
Sir, I don't disagree
on any particular point.

387
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,021
It's just...

388
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,430
in the time of war,
we would've never
left a man stranded.

389
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,566
Maybe that's why we lost.

390
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,609
That was close.

391
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,317
I do not get it.

392
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,984
How's a guy get so wrong?

393
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,547
Cutting on his own face,
raping and murdering.

394
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,453
I'll kill a man
in a fair fight...

395
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,790
or if I think
he's gonna
start a fair fight...

396
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,162
or if he bothers me,
or if there's a woman...

397
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:59,441
or if I'm getting paid.
Mostly only when
I'm getting paid.

398
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,308
These Reavers,
the last 10 years...

399
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,214
they show up like
the boogeyman from stories.

400
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,517
Eating people alive?
Where does that get fun?

401
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,455
Shepherd Book said
they was men who just...

402
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,893
reached the edge of space,
saw a vasty nothingness...

403
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,953
and went
bibbledy over it.

404
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,087
Oh, hell.

405
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,425
I've been to the edge.

406
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:29,004
Just looked like more space.

407
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,407
I don't know.

408
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,842
It can get awful lonely
in the black.

409
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,605
Like to get addlepated
ourselves, we stay
on this boat much longer.

410
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,875
Captain will drive
us all off, one by one.

411
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,511
Just like Simon and River.

412
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,758
Just like Inara.

413
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,894
<i>Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?</i>

414
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,521
<i>We got to have records
of everything, Inara. </i>

415
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,467
<i>A bona fide companion
entertained clients
on this very ship. </i>

416
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,370
<i>In this very bed. 
Well, I can't do my work here. </i>

417
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,465
<i>And I don't think
the Captain approves. </i>

418
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,134
<i>The Captain
wants you to stay... </i>

419
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,578
<i>That man doesn't
know what he wants. 
I don't have time to... </i>

420
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,273
Don't talk to the barkers,
talk to the captains.

421
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,752
You look the captain
in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

422
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,845
I wish there was...

423
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,521
You shouldn't
ought to be so clean.

424
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,454
It's a dead giveaway
you don't belong,
you always got to be tidy.

425
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,467
Don't pay anybody in advance.

426
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,627
And don't ride in anything
with a Capissen 38 engine...

427
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,696
they fall right
out of the sky.

428
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,740
Kaylee.

429
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,349
River, do you want
to stay with them?

430
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,549
It isn't safe.

431
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,284
No.

432
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,691
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

433
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,397
For them.

434
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,352
<i>... only survivors
of the massacre apparently... </i>

435
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,188
<i>locked themselves in
the train station vault. </i>

436
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,252
Kaylee,
this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when...

437
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,797
When he's
four worlds away?

438
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,197
Or the Alliance gets a hold
of him and River?

439
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,325
That ain't my worry.

440
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,699
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

441
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,601
Can't do that
carrying those two.

442
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,906
How can you be so cold?

443
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,136
Captain didn't
make them fugitives.

444
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,405
But he could
have made them family.

445
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,377
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

446
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,017
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've...

447
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,419
We're going on a year now,
I ain't had nothing
twixt my nethers...

448
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,047
weren't run on batteries.

449
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,354
Oh, God! I can't know that!

450
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,584
I could stand
to hear a little more.

451
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,924
If you had a care
for anybody's heart...

452
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,625
You knew
he was gonna leave.

453
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,496
We never been
but a way station
to those two.

454
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,195
And how do you know
what he feels?

455
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,239
He's got River to worry on
but he still could've
shown you...

456
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,570
If I truly wanted
someone bad enough...

457
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,237
wouldn't be a thing
in the 'verse could stop
me from going to her.

458
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,407
Tell that to Inara.

459
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,885
Domestic troubles?

460
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,918
Domestic troubles?

461
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,149
'Cause we don't
wanna interrupt.

462
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,387
A man should keep
his house in order.

463
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,928
Fanty. Mingo.

464
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,328
He's Mingo.
He's Fanty.
You're Mingo.

465
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,626
How is it you always know?
Fanty's prettier.

466
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,734
Feel to do some business?

467
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,668
Endeavors.

468
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,682
Quite a crew you've got.

469
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,848
Yeah, they're
a fine bunch of reubens.

470
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,325
How you keep them
on that crap boat,
is the subject...

471
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,191
of much musing
between me and Fanty.

472
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,595
We go on and on.
So I'm noticing.

473
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,794
Is there a problem
we don't know of?

474
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,060
You got a sweet take
kissing your foot.

475
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,231
How's about you take your 25%,
we can talk about
the next job?

476
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,298
Well, our end is 40,
precious.

477
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,344
My muscular buttocks it's 40.
It is...

478
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,180
as of now.

479
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,375
Find anyone around
going cheaper...

480
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,645
Find anyone
around going near...

481
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,210
a sorry lot like you
in the first instance.

482
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,017
You're unpredictable, Mal.

483
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,091
You run
when you ought to fight.

484
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,058
Fight when you ought to deal.

485
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,420
Makes a businessperson
a little twitchy.

486
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,263
Miranda.

487
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,352
Hey! A tussle!

488
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:25,821
Jayne.

489
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,141
Do you know that girl?

490
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,111
I really don't.

491
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,302
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!

492
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,807
May I see her?

493
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,408
I believe you've got
some storytelling to do.

494
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,476
What in the hell happened
back there?

495
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,421
Start with the part
where Jayne gets knocked
out by a 90-pound girl.

496
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,084
'Cause I don't think
that's ever getting old.

497
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,586
Do we know
if anyone was killed?
It's likely.

498
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,489
I know she meant to kill me
before the Doc put her out.

499
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,057
Which, how exactly
does that work anyhow?

500
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,003
It's a safe word.

501
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,635
The people who helped me
break River out...

502
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,007
had intel that River
and the other subjects
were being...

503
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,342
embedded with
behavioral conditioning.

504
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,380
They taught me a safe word...

505
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,483
in case something happened.
Not sure I get it.

506
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,379
It's a phrase
that makes her fall asleep.

507
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,851
If I speak the words...
Don't say it!

508
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,958
It only works on her, Jayne.

509
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,688
Well, now I know that.

510
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,958
"In case something happened. "

511
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,631
You feel to elaborate on
what that something might be?

512
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,398
They never said what...
And you never did ask.

513
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,129
Get your hands off...

514
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,836
Eight months. Eight months,
you had her on my boat...

515
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,468
knowing full well
she could go monkeyshit...

516
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,035
at the wrong word.
You never said a thing.

517
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,981
I brought her out here
so they couldn't get to her.

518
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,816
I don't even know what they...
My ship!

519
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,113
My crew!

520
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,279
You had a gorramn
time bomb living with us!

521
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,083
Who we gonna find in there
when she wakes up?

522
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,251
The girl?

523
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,326
Or the weapon?

524
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,999
I thought
she was getting better.

525
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,093
And I thought
they was getting off!

526
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,873
Didn't we have an intricate
plan how they was gonna
be not here anymore?

527
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,035
We couldn't leave them now.
No, now that...

528
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,545
she's a killer woman
we ought be bringing
her tea and dumplings.

529
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,111
In earnest, Mal,
why'd you bring her back on?

530
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,455
May I see her?

531
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,629
She goes woolly again,
we're gonna have
to put a bullet to her.

532
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,731
It's crossed my mind.

533
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,838
Can I make a suggestion
that doesn't involve
violence...

534
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,937
or is this the wrong crowd?
Honey.

535
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,540
We're flying a lot blinder
than usual here.

536
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,448
We need to get our bearings.

537
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,286
I think we need to talk
to Mr. Universe.

538
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,676
Oh, this is good.

539
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,351
You guys always bring me
the very best violence.

540
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,517
<i>You think
you're in a hot place?</i>

541
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,119
<i>That's what we're looking
to learn. Is there
any follow up, a newswave?</i>

542
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,494
There is no news.
There's the truth
of the signal.

543
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:05,597
What I see. And, there's
the puppet theater...

544
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,000
the Parliament jesters foist
on the somnambulant public.

545
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,442
Well, what about this?
Did this make
the puppet theater?

546
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,805
<i>No, sir. 
And no lawforce flags, either. </i>

547
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,813
<i>I had to go into
the security feed direct. </i>

548
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,782
You can do that?
Can't stop the signal, Mal.

549
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,351
<i>Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere. </i>

550
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,455
<i>Security feeds
are a traipse to access... </i>

551
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,184
<i>and I wasn't the first one in. </i>

552
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,557
<i>This has prints on it. 
So somebody else
has been fed this.</i>

553
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,522
<i>Zoe, you sultry minx,
stop falling in love with me. </i>

554
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,498
<i>You're just gonna
embarrass yourself. </i>

555
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,001
<i>I have a commitment
to my Lovebot. </i>

556
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,474
It was a very beautiful
ceremony. Lenore wrote
her own vows...

557
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,505
I cried like a baby,
a hungry, angry baby.

558
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,416
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

559
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,879
Can you go back?

560
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,820
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

561
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,017
Made any kind
of contact with her.

562
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,293
<i>Miranda. 
"Miranda"?</i>

563
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,634
Go back further.

564
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,125
No.

565
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,628
<i>Please. </i>

566
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,206
Mal, you're very smart.

567
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,881
Someone is talking to her.
The oaty bar?

568
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,082
Subliminal.

569
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,785
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

570
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,227
I've been seeing this code
pop up all over,
the last few weeks.

571
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,188
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

572
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,661
<i>They have gone
to enormous trouble
to find your little friend. </i>

573
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,574
<i>And found her, they have. </i>

574
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,600
<i>Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?</i>

575
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,943
They're afraid of me.

576
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,382
I'm sorry.
They should be.

577
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,119
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

578
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,726
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

579
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,264
Show me off like a dog.

580
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,963
Old men covered in blood.

581
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,839
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

582
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,677
I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

583
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,082
In the Maidenhead,
you said something.

584
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,420
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

585
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,119
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

586
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,159
Miranda.

587
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,754
Miranda.

588
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,329
Ask her.

589
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,168
Who is Miranda?

590
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,678
Am I talking to Miranda now?

591
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,606
No.

592
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,578
Not right.

593
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,416
But I think
when they triggered you...

594
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,230
it somehow brought this up.

595
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,857
This memory.
It isn't mine.

596
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,861
The memory, it isn't mine.

597
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,836
And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

598
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,504
Don't make me sleep again.
I won't.

599
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,364
I won't.

600
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,667
Put a bullet to me.

601
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,307
Bullet in the brainpan,
squish.

602
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,047
Don't say that. Not ever.

603
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,317
We'll get through this.

604
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,856
Things are going to get
much, much worse.

605
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,182
Thanks for taking us in again,
Shepherd.

606
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,184
You got a plan?

607
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,287
Hiding ain't a plan?

608
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,018
It'll do you for a spell.

609
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,219
And the folks
here'll be glad
of the extra coin.

610
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,319
But the Alliance
will be coming.

611
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,123
They're after this girl
with a powerful will.

612
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,767
I look to hear the tromp
of their boots any moment.

613
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,536
You won't.

614
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,605
This isn't
a palms-up military run, Mal.

615
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,809
No reports broadwaved...

616
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,709
no warrants.

617
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,584
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

618
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,087
That means closed file.

619
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,456
Means an operative.

620
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,552
Which is trouble
you've not known.

621
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,861
I could have left her there.

622
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,462
I had an out.

623
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,396
<i>Hell, I had every reason
in the 'verse... </i>

624
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,633
<i>to leave her lay
and haul anchor. </i>

625
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,336
It's not your way, Mal.

626
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,108
I have a way?

627
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,842
That better than a plan?

628
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,647
Only one thing is gonna
walk you through this, Mal.

629
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,610
Belief.

630
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,752
You know I always look
to you for counsel...

631
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,021
but sermons make me
sleepy, Shepherd.

632
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,061
I ain't looking for help
from on high.

633
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,529
That's a long wait
for a train don't come.

634
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,561
When I talk about belief,
why do you always assume
I'm talking about God?

635
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,707
They'll come at you sideways.

636
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,949
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

637
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,952
Sidle up and smile.
Hit you where you're weak.

638
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,525
Sort of man
they're like to send
believes hard.

639
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,753
Kills and never asks why.

640
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,702
It's of interest to me
how much you seem
to know about that world.

641
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,898
I wasn't born
a Shepherd, Mal.

642
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,237
Have to tell me
about that sometime.

643
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,635
No, I don't.

644
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,643
River?

645
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,480
River, you look tired.

646
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,553
I think everybody's
a little tired by now.
Why don't we all lie down.

647
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,561
A little peace and quiet
will make everything better.

648
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,288
River. Do as you're told.
No.

649
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,958
It's going to be fine.
Lie down.
No.

650
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,600
<i>Cut them down. </i>

651
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,242
<i>What?
Mal! You up?</i>

652
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,741
<i>I got a wave. I'm gonna
bounce it down to you. </i>

653
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,177
Inara.

654
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,990
<i>I... Is this a bad time?</i>

655
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,020
No, this...

656
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,756
good as any.

657
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,994
<i>How's your world?
Cold. It's autumn here. </i>

658
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,331
Still at the Training House?

659
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:00,436
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't...

660
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,406
<i>Well, you look very fine.
Oh. Thank you. </i>

661
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,579
<i>So, what was the... </i>

662
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,318
<i>I guess we're having
something of a problem
here with the locals. </i>

663
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,984
<i>And, I thought maybe... 
You could use a gun hand?</i>

664
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:20,223
<i>I'm hoping not. 
But if you happen
to be close at all, you... </i>

665
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:24,357
<i>The crew could take
your ease here for a while. 
And there'd be payment. </i>

666
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,235
Well, it would be...
I mean, I'd like to.

667
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,104
Kaylee's been missing you
something fierce.

668
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,841
<i>Oh, man.
I miss her, too. </i>

669
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,009
<i>I even miss
my shuttle, occasionally. </i>

670
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,177
Yeah, you left, um...

671
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,282
Got some of your
stuff in a trunk.

672
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,879
I never did get a chance
to drop it off.

673
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:51,223
<i>I didn't mean to leave stuff. 
I didn't look
through the stuff.</i>

674
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,758
I just...
Just sundries I expect.

675
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,466
So I'll send you a wave,
soon as I can.

676
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,364
<i>Thank you. </i>

677
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,182
Inara, nice to see
her again.

678
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,519
So, trap?
Trap.

679
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,718
We going in?
Only but a few hours out.

680
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,318
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

681
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,963
If that's the case,
then Inara's already
caught in it.

682
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,022
She wouldn't
set us up willing.

683
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,134
Might be we got a shot
at seeing who's
turning these wheels.

684
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,227
We go in.

685
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,637
But how can you be sure
Inara don't just
wanna see you?

686
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,975
Sometimes people
have feelings.

687
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,169
I'm referring here to people.

688
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,041
You all were watching,
I take it.

689
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,715
Yes.
Did you see us fight?

690
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,512
No.
Trap.

691
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,331
We're about 70 miles
from the Training House,
and nobody on radar.

692
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,869
If the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.

693
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,097
They're about.

694
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,196
Find us a home.
I'll take the shuttle
a little closer.

695
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,934
Zoe, ship is yours.

696
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,534
Remember. If anything
happens to me...

697
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,340
or if you don't hear from me
within the hour...

698
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,677
you take this ship
and you come
and you rescue me.

699
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:19,738
What?

700
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,682
Risk my ship?
I mean it.

701
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,850
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

702
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,073
Dear Buddha,
please bring me a pony,
and a plastic rocket, and...

703
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,043
Mal! What are you
doing here?

704
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,839
Well, you invited me.

705
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,473
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough
to come.

706
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,414
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

707
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,418
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

708
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,455
Which led me to conclude
that you must be
in some trouble.

709
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,286
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

710
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,792
For a woman schooled
in telling a man
what he wants to hear...

711
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,352
you ain't much of a liar.
Mal, you cannot
handle this man.

712
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,597
I have to say, Captain...

713
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,538
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

714
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,968
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

715
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,443
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

716
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,879
I've no doubt.

717
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,980
What are you doing?
I'm praying for you, Mal.

718
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,483
She's very thoughtful.

719
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,892
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

720
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,287
Speak your piece.

721
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,627
I think you're
beginning to understand...

722
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,665
how dangerous River Tam is.

723
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,830
She is a mite unpredictable.

724
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,002
Mood swings, of a sort.

725
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,595
It's worse than you know.
It usually is.

726
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:53,302
That girl will
rain destruction down
on you and your ship.

727
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,475
She is an albatross, Captain.

728
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,376
Way I remember it...

729
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,816
albatross was
a ship's good luck,
till some idiot killed it.

730
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,049
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

731
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,421
I've seen your war record.

732
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,952
I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

733
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,424
You really don't.
Fair to say.

734
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,998
But I have to hope
you understand,
you can't beat us.

735
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,797
I got no need to beat you.

736
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,737
I just want to go my way.
And you can do that...

737
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,599
once you let me take
River Tam back home.

738
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,838
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

739
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,645
You got to open with payment.
That is a trap.

740
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,346
I offer money,
you'll play the man of honor
and take umbrage.

741
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,184
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

742
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,784
I have no stomach for games.

743
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,286
I already know
you will not see reason.

744
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,922
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

745
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,194
they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

746
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,534
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

747
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,738
<i>We locked on
to Serenity's pulse beacon
the moment you hit atmo.</i>

748
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,906
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

749
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,679
to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

750
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,913
You do that...

751
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,889
you'd best make peace
with your dear
and fluffy lord.

752
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:19,890
Pulse beacon.

753
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:24,122
Advice from an old tracker.
You want to find someone,
use your eyes.

754
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,932
How long do you think
you can really run from us?

755
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,631
I never credited
the Alliance with
an overabundance of brains.

756
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,867
And if you're
the best they got...
Captain Reynolds...

757
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:34,740
I should tell you,
so that you don't
waste your time...

758
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,770
you can't make me angry.
Please, spend
an hour with him.

759
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,313
I want to resolve this
like civilized men.

760
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,286
I'm not threatening you.

761
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,122
I'm unarmed.
Good.

762
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,288
I am, of course,
wearing full body armor.

763
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,696
I am not a moron.
Wait, just let...

764
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,384
What, no backup?

765
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,093
Making an awful ruckus.
They'll come
when they're needed.

766
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,599
I'd start whistling.

767
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,898
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

768
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:26,051
Nothing here is what it seems.
He isn't the plucky hero.

769
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,849
The Alliance isn't
some evil empire.
This is not the grand arena.

770
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,721
And that's not incense.

771
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,930
Sir, can you hear me?

772
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,529
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

773
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,476
What have you done
to my shuttle?
It's not your shuttle.

774
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,714
Head east. Keep her low.

775
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,364
Okay, forget
the pulse beacon.

776
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,596
<i>There must be another way
to track the ship. </i>

777
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,070
Get a read
on the nav. Sat.

778
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,699
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

779
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,764
<i>Sir?</i>

780
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,708
Yes, have you found
a nav. Sat. Trajectory?

781
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,212
<i>Sir, we found seven. </i>

782
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,684
<i>We've every reason
to be afraid. </i>

783
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,082
Why, 'cause this guy
beat up Mal?
That ain't so hard.

784
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,685
He didn't beat me up.
Nobody said that.

785
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,526
Because he's a believer.

786
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:46,202
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief...

787
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,669
that killing River
is the right thing to do.

788
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,298
So no hope
of a reward, huh?

789
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,678
Did he say anything
about a Miranda?

790
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,537
What is that?

791
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,014
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

792
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,074
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

793
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,053
You think maybe it poses
some kind of threat
to the Alliance?

794
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,486
Do we care?

795
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,585
Are we caring about that?

796
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,320
You dumb-ass hogs,
the only people
she's a threat to is...

797
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,884
us on this boat.

798
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,793
Look, we get back
to Haven...

799
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:15,888
in a few
hours' time.
Oh, yeah.

800
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,262
Hiding under
the Shepherd's skirts...

801
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,357
that's a manful scheme.

802
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,460
You wanna run this ship?
Yes.

803
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,335
Well, you can't.

804
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,268
Do a damn sight
better job than you.

805
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,810
Getting us lashed over
a couple of strays.

806
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,036
No offense, Doc.
I think it's
noble as a grape...

807
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,342
the way you look to River.

808
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,883
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

809
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,317
Oh, and neither is she
exactly helpless.

810
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,212
So, where's it writ
that we got to lay down
our lives for her?

811
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,848
Which is what you've
steered us toward.

812
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,654
I didn't start this.

813
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,818
No, that's right.

814
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,326
Alliance starts the war,
and then you volunteer.

815
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,963
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

816
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,268
Besides Zoe here, how many...
Hey, I'm talking at you.

817
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,337
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

818
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,711
You wanna leave this room.

819
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,284
Damn right, I do.

820
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,656
This isn't
the war, Mal.

821
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,764
You telling me that
'cause you think I don't know?

822
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,963
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

823
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,938
I came looking for you.

824
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,710
I just want to know
who I'm dealing with.

825
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,439
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

826
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,946
I start fighting a war,
I guarantee
you'll see something new.

827
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,353
We'll get off.

828
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,053
River and I will
get off at Haven.

829
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,891
We'll find some...
Nobody's saying that.

830
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,794
Nobody besides Jayne
is saying that.

831
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,854
Mal.

832
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,429
I got no answers
for you, Inara.
I got no rudder.

833
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,474
Wind blows northerly,
I go north.
That's who I am.

834
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,102
Now, maybe that ain't
a man to lead,
but they have to follow.

835
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,269
So you wanna tear me down...

836
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,506
do it inside your own mind.
I'm not trying
to tear you down.

837
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,173
But you fog things up.

838
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,678
You always have.

839
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,753
You spin me about.

840
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,119
I wish like hell
you was elsewhere.

841
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,421
I was.

842
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,820
No trouble,
little crazy person.

843
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,194
We're going
for a nice shuttle ride.

844
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,512
She's out. Jayne's down.

845
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,242
The other way.
Find her and do not engage.

846
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:54,176
It's gonna be okay...

847
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:06,926
She's sealed off the bridge.
I do not like her there.

848
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,695
Check the shuttle.
She could have snuck in.

849
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:09,758
Captain.

850
01:02:55,816 --> 01:02:58,717
The government's man,
he says you're a danger to us.

851
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:01,346
Not worth helping.

852
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:05,117
Is he right?

853
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,859
Are you anything but a weapon?

854
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:15,126
I've staked my crew's life on
the theory you're a person...

855
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:18,399
actual and whole,
and if I'm wrong,
you'd best shoot me now.

856
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:21,504
Or we could talk more.

857
01:03:32,552 --> 01:03:33,644
Miranda.

858
01:03:37,757 --> 01:03:40,157
How can it be there's
a whole planet
called Miranda...

859
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:41,489
and none of us knowed that?

860
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:44,928
Because there isn't one.
It's a blackrock.
Uninhabitable.

861
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:48,492
Terraforming didn't hold,
or some such.
Few settlers died.

862
01:03:48,568 --> 01:03:50,092
Was it right before the war?

863
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:54,038
I had to show them.
I didn't know if you were
going to make me sleep.

864
01:03:55,742 --> 01:03:57,835
You could have asked.
Wait a tick, yeah.

865
01:03:57,911 --> 01:04:01,574
Some years back,
there was call for workers
to settle on Miranda.

866
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:03,411
Daddy talked about it.
Nothing about it...

867
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:05,508
on the Cortex.
History, Astronomy,
it's not in there.

868
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:07,917
Half of writing history
is hiding the truth.

869
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:10,923
There's something
on that rock the Alliance
doesn't want known.

870
01:04:10,991 --> 01:04:13,186
That's right at the edge
of the Burnham Quadrant,
right?

871
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,592
Furthest planet out?
It's not that far from here.

872
01:04:15,662 --> 01:04:17,391
Whoa. No. No. Honey...
That's a bad notion.

873
01:04:17,464 --> 01:04:19,830
...you show them the bad.
I got it, baby.

874
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,132
This is us, at Haven,
and here's Miranda.

875
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:30,904
All along here,
that empty space in between,
that's Reaver territory.

876
01:04:30,977 --> 01:04:33,673
They just float out there,
sending out raiding parties.

877
01:04:33,747 --> 01:04:36,045
Nobody ventures there.
Not even the Alliance.

878
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:38,380
You go through that,
you're signing up
to be a banquet.

879
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:41,079
I'm on board with our standard
run-and-hide scenario.

880
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:42,883
And we are just about...

881
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:44,646
Wait.

882
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:04,169
Doesn't look like Reavers.
Wasn't.

883
01:05:10,016 --> 01:05:11,005
Shepherd?

884
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:13,945
Shepherd?

885
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:16,550
Shepherd Book?

886
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,043
Get the Doc.

887
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,469
Shepherd.

888
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:45,516
Don't move.
Won't go far.

889
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:50,012
Shouldn't have been you.

890
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,452
Alliance should've hit us.
Should've hit me.

891
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:56,557
That crossed my mind.

892
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:04,229
I shot him down.
Yeah. I see.

893
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:07,031
I killed the ship
that killed us.

894
01:06:08,775 --> 01:06:10,743
Not very Christian of me.

895
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,735
You did what's right.

896
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:17,274
Coming from you,
that means almost nothing.

897
01:06:22,856 --> 01:06:25,416
I'm long gone.
No, Doc will bring
you around.

898
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:28,393
I look to be bored
by many more sermons
before you slip.

899
01:06:28,461 --> 01:06:29,723
Just don't move.

900
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:32,160
Can't order me
around, boy.

901
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:35,196
I'm not one
of your crew.

902
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:38,702
Yes, you are.

903
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,406
River...
Come on.

904
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:44,832
Hey.

905
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:50,572
I don't care
what you believe.
Just believe it.

906
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:54,049
Whatever you...

907
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,545
How come
they ain't waiting?

908
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:33,692
They knowed we was coming,
how come they only sent one?

909
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:37,160
They didn't know
we were coming here.

910
01:07:37,964 --> 01:07:39,659
Get on the Cortex.

911
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:41,631
Wave, Li Shen,
the Sanchez brothers...

912
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:45,193
anyone who has ever
sheltered us after a heist.
Tell them to get out.

913
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,499
Get out now.

914
01:07:57,684 --> 01:07:58,844
<i>I'm sorry. </i>

915
01:08:00,987 --> 01:08:04,753
<i>If your quarry goes to ground,
leave no ground to go to. </i>

916
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:07,917
<i>You should have
taken my offer. </i>

917
01:08:07,994 --> 01:08:10,554
<i>Or did you think none of this
was your fault?</i>

918
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,798
I don't murder children.

919
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:14,188
<i>I do. </i>

920
01:08:15,135 --> 01:08:17,160
<i>If I have to.
Why?</i>

921
01:08:19,038 --> 01:08:21,199
Do you even know
why they sent you?

922
01:08:21,975 --> 01:08:23,738
<i>It's not my place to ask. </i>

923
01:08:24,978 --> 01:08:27,503
<i>I believe in something
greater than myself. </i>

924
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:30,014
<i>A better world. </i>

925
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,481
<i>A world without sin. </i>

926
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:35,010
So me and mine
gotta lay down and die...

927
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:37,283
so you can live
in your better world?

928
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:39,884
<i>I'm not going to live there. </i>

929
01:08:40,293 --> 01:08:41,885
<i>There's no place
for me there... </i>

930
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:44,429
<i>any more than
there is for you. Malcolm... </i>

931
01:08:44,597 --> 01:08:45,859
<i>I'm a monster. </i>

932
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:48,831
<i>What I do is evil. </i>

933
01:08:48,902 --> 01:08:51,462
<i>I have no illusions about it,
but it must be done. </i>

934
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:53,005
Keep talking.

935
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:55,365
You're not getting
a location trace
off this wave.

936
01:08:55,441 --> 01:08:59,343
<i>And every minute
you keep River Tam from me,
more people will die. </i>

937
01:08:59,412 --> 01:09:01,903
<i>You think I care?
Of course you care. </i>

938
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:04,611
<i>You're not a Reaver, Mal. </i>

939
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:08,576
<i>You're a human man
and you will never
understand how... </i>

940
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:16,658
Get these bodies together.

941
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:18,494
We got time
for grave digging?

942
01:09:18,565 --> 01:09:20,055
Zoe, you and Simon
rope them together.

943
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:22,499
Five or six.
I want them laid out
on the nose of our ship.

944
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:23,695
Are you insane?

945
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,067
I won't desecrate
these bodies.

946
01:09:25,138 --> 01:09:27,003
I don't understand.
What do you mean,
the bodies...

947
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:28,506
I want you to muck up
the reactor core.

948
01:09:28,575 --> 01:09:30,600
Just enough to leave a trail
and make it read like...

949
01:09:30,677 --> 01:09:32,838
we're flying
without containment,
not enough to fry us.

950
01:09:32,912 --> 01:09:34,709
These people
are our friends.
Kaylee...

951
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:37,614
you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.

952
01:09:38,651 --> 01:09:42,917
Jayne, you and Wash
hoist up the cannon mount.
Goes right on top.

953
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:44,650
Piece or two
of the other ship,
stick it on.

954
01:09:44,724 --> 01:09:47,955
Any place you can tear hull
without inner breach,
do that, too.

955
01:09:48,795 --> 01:09:52,060
We're gonna need paint.
We're gonna need red paint.

956
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:53,554
Sir...

957
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:57,491
do you really mean
to turn our home
into an abomination...

958
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,367
so that we can make
a suicidal attempt...

959
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:01,464
at passing through
Reaver space?

960
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:02,871
I mean to live.

961
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:04,742
I mean for us to live.

962
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:07,405
The Alliance won't have that,
so we go where
they don't follow.

963
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,641
God's balls,
there ain't no way
we're going out there.

964
01:10:09,716 --> 01:10:11,411
Mal, think about
what you're asking.

965
01:10:11,484 --> 01:10:13,679
...those Reavers'll
eat us alive...

966
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,820
This is how it is.

967
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:18,952
Anybody doesn't wanna
fly with me anymore...

968
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:20,856
this is your port of harbor.

969
01:10:21,728 --> 01:10:23,753
There's a lot
of fine ways to die.

970
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:26,560
I ain't waiting
for the Alliance
to choose mine.

971
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:31,603
I mean to confound
these bungers.

972
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:33,332
Take my shot
at getting to Miranda.

973
01:10:33,406 --> 01:10:36,000
Maybe find something I can use
to get clear of this.

974
01:10:36,075 --> 01:10:38,976
So I hear a word
out of any of you
that ain't helping me out...

975
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:41,536
or taking your leave,
I will shoot you down.

976
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:47,783
Get to work.

977
01:11:13,313 --> 01:11:14,371
Sir...

978
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:16,278
Just tell me
when we're close.

979
01:12:23,483 --> 01:12:24,472
Wash.

980
01:13:29,115 --> 01:13:32,346
Define "disappeared. "

981
01:13:37,089 --> 01:13:39,353
Every reading
I'm getting says normal.

982
01:13:40,092 --> 01:13:43,425
Oceans, land masses.
No tectonic instability
or radiation.

983
01:13:43,496 --> 01:13:46,465
Yeah, but no power,
either.
Nothing at all?

984
01:13:46,532 --> 01:13:47,521
Wait.

985
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:49,293
Something.

986
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:52,837
It might be a beacon,
but it's awful weak.

987
01:13:53,506 --> 01:13:54,939
Find it.

988
01:14:03,249 --> 01:14:04,876
Gravity's Earthnorm.

989
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:07,781
O2 levels check,
pressure...

990
01:14:08,554 --> 01:14:11,352
If anything's wrong
the scanner's
not reading it.

991
01:14:17,196 --> 01:14:19,596
Well, something sure
the hell ain't right.

992
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:23,832
This ain't
no little settlement.

993
01:14:23,903 --> 01:14:26,701
We flew over
at least a dozen
cities just as big.

994
01:14:26,806 --> 01:14:29,036
Why didn't we ever
hear about this?

995
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:32,442
Beacon's up ahead.

996
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:56,490
Ho.

997
01:15:16,556 --> 01:15:18,922
No entry wounds,
fractures.

998
01:15:19,392 --> 01:15:20,586
Poison?

999
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:34,899
Got another one.

1000
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:42,175
They's just sitting here.

1001
01:15:43,883 --> 01:15:45,111
They didn't crash.

1002
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:01,257
Kaylee. Don't...

1003
01:16:07,006 --> 01:16:09,236
How come these ones
are preserved?

1004
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:11,936
Place must've gone hermetic
when the power blew.

1005
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:14,639
Sealed them.
What are they doing?

1006
01:16:15,848 --> 01:16:17,748
What's everybody doing?

1007
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:20,452
There's no unusual
discoloration.

1008
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,750
Nobody's doubled over
or showing signs of pain.

1009
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,488
There's gasses
that kill painless, right?

1010
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:29,192
They didn't fall.
None of them.

1011
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,324
They just lay down.

1012
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:38,298
Make them stop.
They're everywhere.

1013
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:41,365
Every city, every...

1014
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:44,576
Every house, every room,
they're all inside me.

1015
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:48,080
I can hear them all,
and they're saying nothing!

1016
01:16:49,115 --> 01:16:50,104
Get up.

1017
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,717
Please get up.

1018
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,788
Please, God,
make me a stone.

1019
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:02,858
She is starting
to damage my calm.

1020
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:04,418
Jayne.
She's right!

1021
01:17:05,464 --> 01:17:07,091
Everybody's dead.

1022
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:10,865
This whole world is dead
for no reason!

1023
01:17:13,305 --> 01:17:15,205
Let's get to the beacon.

1024
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:43,167
This is the source?

1025
01:17:46,505 --> 01:17:48,735
This ship's banged up
all to hell.

1026
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:08,789
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded. </i>

1027
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:11,487
<i>And you can see... </i>

1028
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:14,656
<i>it isn't what we thought. </i>

1029
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:17,758
<i>There's been no war here... </i>

1030
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:21,865
<i>and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable. </i>

1031
01:18:26,979 --> 01:18:28,378
<i>It's the Pax. </i>

1032
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:34,249
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added
to the air processors. </i>

1033
01:18:35,221 --> 01:18:38,952
<i>It was supposed to calm
the population,
weed out aggression. </i>

1034
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,687
<i>Well, it works. </i>

1035
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:45,996
<i>The people here
stopped fighting. </i>

1036
01:18:46,966 --> 01:18:49,594
<i>And then they stopped
everything else. </i>

1037
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:56,702
<i>They stopped going to work... </i>

1038
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:01,842
<i>they stopped breeding,
talking, eating. </i>

1039
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:07,948
<i>There's 30 million people
here, and they all just
let themselves die. </i>

1040
01:19:11,023 --> 01:19:12,456
<i>I have to be quick. </i>

1041
01:19:13,559 --> 01:19:15,220
<i>About a tenth
of a percent of... </i>

1042
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:17,626
<i>the population had
the opposite reaction
to the Pax. </i>

1043
01:19:18,264 --> 01:19:21,927
<i>Their aggressor response
increased beyond madness. </i>

1044
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:23,595
<i>They have become... </i>

1045
01:19:25,938 --> 01:19:27,599
<i>Well, they've killed
most of us. </i>

1046
01:19:28,707 --> 01:19:30,470
<i>And not just killed... </i>

1047
01:19:32,278 --> 01:19:34,041
<i>they've done things. </i>

1048
01:19:34,547 --> 01:19:37,675
Reavers. They made them.

1049
01:19:39,318 --> 01:19:43,448
<i>I won't live to report this,
but people have to know. </i>

1050
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:46,520
<i>We meant it for the best... </i>

1051
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:48,357
<i>to make people safer. </i>

1052
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:53,222
<i>God!</i>

1053
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,935
Turn it off.

1054
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,565
River.
I'm all right.

1055
01:20:35,574 --> 01:20:37,007
I'm all right.

1056
01:20:45,284 --> 01:20:47,718
<i>This report is maybe
12 years old. </i>

1057
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:52,623
Parliament buried it,
and it stayed buried
till River dug it up.

1058
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:56,660
This is what
they feared she knew.

1059
01:20:57,263 --> 01:20:59,128
And they were
right to fear...

1060
01:20:59,698 --> 01:21:02,667
because there's a whole
universe of folk
who are gonna know it, too.

1061
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,362
They're gonna see it.

1062
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:07,666
Somebody has to speak
for these people.

1063
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,442
You all got on this boat
for different reasons...

1064
01:21:13,512 --> 01:21:15,673
but you all come
to the same place.

1065
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:19,244
So now I'm asking more of you
than I have before.

1066
01:21:20,386 --> 01:21:21,717
Maybe all.

1067
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:26,886
Sure as I know anything
I know this,
they will try again.

1068
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,751
Maybe on another world,
maybe on this very ground
swept clean.

1069
01:21:30,863 --> 01:21:33,661
A year from now, 10,
they'll swing back
to the belief...

1070
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:35,892
that they can make people...

1071
01:21:38,637 --> 01:21:39,626
better.

1072
01:21:42,808 --> 01:21:44,833
And I do not hold to that.

1073
01:21:47,146 --> 01:21:48,579
So no more running.

1074
01:21:51,116 --> 01:21:52,811
I aim to misbehave.

1075
01:22:00,626 --> 01:22:02,890
Shepherd Book
used to tell me:

1076
01:22:02,995 --> 01:22:05,054
"If you can't do
something smart...

1077
01:22:06,565 --> 01:22:08,362
"do something right. "

1078
01:22:09,635 --> 01:22:12,331
Do we have a plan?
Mr. Universe.

1079
01:22:12,938 --> 01:22:14,963
We haven't the equipment
to broadwave this code...

1080
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,508
but he can put it
on every screen for 30 worlds.

1081
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:19,906
He's pretty damn close, too.

1082
01:22:20,446 --> 01:22:21,538
We still got the Reavers...

1083
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:23,877
and probably the Alliance,
between us and him.

1084
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:26,845
That's two armies against
our one bitty cannon.

1085
01:22:27,052 --> 01:22:30,044
It's a fair bet
the Alliance knows
about Mr. Universe.

1086
01:22:30,122 --> 01:22:31,589
They're gonna
see this coming.

1087
01:22:32,725 --> 01:22:33,714
No.

1088
01:22:35,794 --> 01:22:38,092
They're not gonna
see this coming.

1089
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:48,272
<i>No problem. Bring it on.
Bring it on. Bring it on. </i>

1090
01:22:48,707 --> 01:22:51,335
<i>From here to the eyes
and ears of the 'verse.
That's my motto... </i>

1091
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,810
<i>or it might be,
if I start having a motto. </i>

1092
01:22:53,879 --> 01:22:54,903
We won't be long.

1093
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,971
<i>You're going to get caught
in the ion cloud. </i>

1094
01:22:57,049 --> 01:22:58,676
<i>It'll play merry hob
with your radar... </i>

1095
01:22:58,751 --> 01:23:01,618
<i>but pretty lights
and a few miles after
you'll be right in my orbit. </i>

1096
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,917
You'll let us know
if anyone else comes at you?

1097
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:05,718
You'll be the first.

1098
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:12,957
There.

1099
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:15,530
Toss me my 30 coin,
but I got a newswave for you...

1100
01:23:25,611 --> 01:23:28,739
Call in every ship
in the quadrant.
We'll meet them in the air.

1101
01:23:30,382 --> 01:23:31,906
Destroy it all.

1102
01:23:58,644 --> 01:24:01,044
<i>Wash, we almost through?</i>

1103
01:24:23,035 --> 01:24:24,024
<i>Now!</i>

1104
01:24:29,575 --> 01:24:31,236
Go! Move!

1105
01:24:50,929 --> 01:24:55,093
I'm reading activity
in the cloud.
Lock and fire on my command.

1106
01:24:57,236 --> 01:24:59,534
You should have
let me see her, Captain.

1107
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:04,472
We should have done this
as men. Not with fire.

1108
01:25:04,877 --> 01:25:06,071
Sir.

1109
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:13,046
Vessel in range.
Lock on.

1110
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:22,893
Bastard's not even
changing course.

1111
01:25:28,033 --> 01:25:29,022
Sir!

1112
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:35,732
Target the Reavers.
Target the Reavers!

1113
01:25:35,807 --> 01:25:38,105
Target everyone!
Somebody fire!

1114
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:59,961
I am a leaf on the wind.
Watch how I soar.

1115
01:26:14,413 --> 01:26:16,108
Chicken's come home
to roost.

1116
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:19,642
The hell?
It's okay.

1117
01:26:19,885 --> 01:26:22,183
I am a leaf on the wind!
What does that mean?

1118
01:26:26,425 --> 01:26:27,892
We're almost through.

1119
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:47,010
No! No! No!
Yes! Yes!

1120
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:41,465
We're not alone.

1121
01:27:49,074 --> 01:27:50,132
EMP!

1122
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,971
Everybody, strap yourselves
into something!

1123
01:27:52,044 --> 01:27:53,033
Jayne.
Got it.

1124
01:27:54,379 --> 01:27:56,108
Kaylee, come on.

1125
01:28:08,894 --> 01:28:11,294
We're fried.
I got no control.
Where's the backup?

1126
01:28:11,863 --> 01:28:13,888
Where's the backup?

1127
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:22,638
Check! Check!

1128
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:48,423
Get up!

1129
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,797
Stop it!

1130
01:28:54,906 --> 01:28:56,999
Backup reads at 20%.
Can you get us down?

1131
01:28:57,075 --> 01:29:00,135
I'm going to have
to glide her in.
Will that work?

1132
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:56,662
I am a leaf on the wind.

1133
01:29:59,037 --> 01:30:00,834
Watch how...

1134
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:07,401
Wash, baby. Baby, no.
Baby, come on.
You gotta go. Come on.

1135
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:11,142
We gotta move. Baby, please.
We gotta move, baby, come on.

1136
01:30:14,486 --> 01:30:15,475
Zoe!

1137
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:18,484
Move out! Now!

1138
01:30:22,527 --> 01:30:23,551
Go. Go.

1139
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:25,560
Head inside!

1140
01:30:44,616 --> 01:30:46,208
Jayne, rearguard.

1141
01:30:53,859 --> 01:30:56,020
Zoe, what've we got?
Sir...

1142
01:30:58,029 --> 01:30:59,291
this is a good hold point.

1143
01:30:59,631 --> 01:31:01,258
We all stay together.
No.

1144
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:02,527
They have to come
through here.

1145
01:31:02,601 --> 01:31:04,501
They'll bottleneck,
we can thin them out.

1146
01:31:04,636 --> 01:31:07,400
We get pushed back,
there's the blast doors.

1147
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:09,837
I can rig them
so they won't reopen
once they close.

1148
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:10,965
Shut them
and hide until I get...

1149
01:31:11,042 --> 01:31:12,976
We need to draw them
till it's done.

1150
01:31:14,145 --> 01:31:16,511
This is the place.
We'll buy you the time.

1151
01:31:21,386 --> 01:31:23,820
All right, let's move
those crates back there
for cover.

1152
01:31:23,889 --> 01:31:26,357
Make sure they ain't filled
with nothing goes boom.

1153
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:28,750
Wait, Wash!
Where's Wash?

1154
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:31,453
He ain't coming.

1155
01:31:36,601 --> 01:31:38,660
Move the gorramn crates!

1156
01:31:56,354 --> 01:31:58,845
Tell me you brought them
this time.

1157
01:32:21,546 --> 01:32:22,808
Zoe?

1158
01:32:25,016 --> 01:32:27,610
Are you here?
Do the job, sir.

1159
01:32:30,188 --> 01:32:32,816
You hold.
Hold till I get back.

1160
01:32:36,895 --> 01:32:37,953
Captain's right.

1161
01:32:38,029 --> 01:32:41,055
Can't be thinking on revenge
if we're gonna
get through this.

1162
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:43,760
Do you really think
any of us are gonna
get through this?

1163
01:32:47,339 --> 01:32:48,363
I might.

1164
01:33:05,423 --> 01:33:06,412
No.

1165
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:28,968
<i>Mal. </i>

1166
01:33:29,848 --> 01:33:31,577
<i>Guy killed me, Mal. </i>

1167
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:35,147
<i>He killed me with a sword.
How weird is that?</i>

1168
01:33:36,054 --> 01:33:39,956
<i>I got a short span here. </i>

1169
01:33:41,426 --> 01:33:43,189
<i>They destroyed my equipment... </i>

1170
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:45,086
<i>but I have a backup unit. </i>

1171
01:33:45,163 --> 01:33:47,563
<i>Bottom of the complex,
right over the generator. </i>

1172
01:33:48,033 --> 01:33:51,161
<i>Hard to get to.
I know they missed it. </i>

1173
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:54,200
<i>They can't stop
the signal, Mal. </i>

1174
01:33:55,073 --> 01:33:57,473
<i>They can never
stop the signal. </i>

1175
01:34:01,713 --> 01:34:04,079
The Reavers.
They are all made up of rage.

1176
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:06,947
It's okay. It's okay.
I can't shut them up.

1177
01:34:10,755 --> 01:34:11,915
Stay low.

1178
01:34:12,457 --> 01:34:15,915
She picked a sweet
bung of a time
to go helpless on us.

1179
01:34:17,128 --> 01:34:18,254
Jayne and I take
the first wave.

1180
01:34:18,329 --> 01:34:20,854
Nobody shoots unless
they get past our fire.

1181
01:34:24,703 --> 01:34:27,331
I didn't plan
on going out like this.

1182
01:34:29,174 --> 01:34:31,369
I think we did right, but...

1183
01:34:32,444 --> 01:34:36,710
No. I never planned...
anything.

1184
01:34:38,717 --> 01:34:40,912
I just wanted
to keep River safe.

1185
01:34:44,656 --> 01:34:48,319
<i>Spent so much time on Serenity
ignoring anything...</i>

1186
01:34:49,294 --> 01:34:51,785
that I wanted for myself.

1187
01:34:56,534 --> 01:34:58,934
My one regret
in all of this...

1188
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:01,967
is never being with you.

1189
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:05,373
With me?

1190
01:35:07,178 --> 01:35:09,169
You mean to say, as...

1191
01:35:11,116 --> 01:35:12,242
Sex?

1192
01:35:14,486 --> 01:35:16,283
I mean to say.

1193
01:35:21,259 --> 01:35:24,387
Hell with this.
I'm gonna live.

1194
01:35:38,309 --> 01:35:41,676
<i>Mal. Guy killed me, Mal. </i>

1195
01:35:42,781 --> 01:35:44,442
<i>He killed me with a sword. </i>

1196
01:36:23,154 --> 01:36:24,746
"Hard to get to. "

1197
01:36:26,024 --> 01:36:27,719
That's a fact.

1198
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:36,489
Zoe, gorrammit!

1199
01:36:52,383 --> 01:36:54,715
Zoe, get your ass
back on the line!

1200
01:37:11,202 --> 01:37:12,897
You shot me in the back!

1201
01:37:14,572 --> 01:37:17,006
I haven't made you
angry, have I?

1202
01:37:17,075 --> 01:37:20,238
There are a lot
of innocent people in the air
being killed right now.

1203
01:37:20,311 --> 01:37:22,745
You have no idea
how true that is.

1204
01:37:24,182 --> 01:37:25,843
I know the secret.

1205
01:37:26,618 --> 01:37:29,086
The truth that burned up
River Tam's brain.

1206
01:37:29,854 --> 01:37:33,915
Rest of the 'verse
is going to know it, too.
'Cause they need to.

1207
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:39,193
Do you really believe that?
I do.

1208
01:37:39,597 --> 01:37:41,724
You willing to die
for that belief?

1209
01:37:44,135 --> 01:37:45,329
I am.

1210
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,169
Of course,
that ain't exactly Plan A.

1211
01:38:20,805 --> 01:38:22,932
Spine's intact.
Just give me a bandage.

1212
01:39:16,594 --> 01:39:18,027
Up high, left!

1213
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,203
Kaylee!

1214
01:39:39,851 --> 01:39:43,787
Fall back! Everybody,
fall back! Fall back now!

1215
01:39:53,398 --> 01:39:54,695
Jayne, grenade.

1216
01:39:56,034 --> 01:39:58,229
Very last one.

1217
01:40:04,275 --> 01:40:05,367
They're gonna get in.

1218
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,406
I can close it
from the outside.

1219
01:40:08,813 --> 01:40:10,804
No one's coming
back from that.

1220
01:40:13,818 --> 01:40:15,752
How much ammo
do we have?

1221
01:40:15,853 --> 01:40:19,755
Three, four max,
and my swinging cod.
That's all.

1222
01:40:19,824 --> 01:40:20,848
The lift isn't moving.

1223
01:40:20,925 --> 01:40:23,393
When they come,
try to plug
the hole with it.

1224
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:25,895
I'm starting to lose
some feeling here.

1225
01:40:25,963 --> 01:40:28,659
Lie still. I'm going
to give you something...

1226
01:40:30,701 --> 01:40:31,690
My bag.

1227
01:40:42,013 --> 01:40:43,537
Keep pressure here.

1228
01:40:45,316 --> 01:40:46,305
My bag.

1229
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:47,840
I need...

1230
01:40:48,686 --> 01:40:52,144
adrenaline and a shot of...

1231
01:40:52,657 --> 01:40:54,249
calaphar for Kaylee.

1232
01:40:56,961 --> 01:40:58,656
I can't.

1233
01:41:02,533 --> 01:41:03,522
River.

1234
01:41:08,606 --> 01:41:11,302
River, I'm sorry.
No.

1235
01:41:12,677 --> 01:41:13,803
No.

1236
01:41:20,985 --> 01:41:23,215
I hate to leave.
You won't.

1237
01:41:26,157 --> 01:41:28,751
You take care of me, Simon.

1238
01:41:31,829 --> 01:41:34,457
You've always
taken care of me.

1239
01:41:39,804 --> 01:41:40,930
My turn.

1240
01:42:35,826 --> 01:42:38,454
Do you know
what your sin is, Mal?

1241
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:42,397
Hell. I'm a fan
of all seven.

1242
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,703
But right now...

1243
01:42:51,776 --> 01:42:53,744
I'm going to have
to go with wrath.

1244
01:42:58,216 --> 01:43:00,684
We ain't got long.

1245
01:43:06,724 --> 01:43:08,589
You suppose he got through?

1246
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,828
Do you think Mal
got the word out?

1247
01:43:12,496 --> 01:43:16,899
He got through.
I know he got through.

1248
01:43:28,179 --> 01:43:29,168
I'm sorry.

1249
01:43:32,483 --> 01:43:35,281
You should know
there's no shame in this.

1250
01:43:37,455 --> 01:43:39,582
You've done remarkable things.

1251
01:43:40,825 --> 01:43:43,020
But you're fighting a war...

1252
01:43:44,228 --> 01:43:45,422
you've already lost.

1253
01:43:50,268 --> 01:43:52,168
Well, I'm known for that.

1254
01:44:01,078 --> 01:44:04,707
Piece of shrapnel tore up
that nerve cluster
my first tour.

1255
01:44:05,283 --> 01:44:06,614
Had it moved.

1256
01:44:08,219 --> 01:44:09,652
Sorry about the throat.

1257
01:44:10,254 --> 01:44:13,087
Expect you'd want to say your
famous last words right now.

1258
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:15,716
Just one trouble.

1259
01:44:20,464 --> 01:44:21,954
I ain't gonna kill you.

1260
01:44:25,436 --> 01:44:28,530
Hell, I'm gonna grant
your greatest wish.

1261
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,713
I'm gonna show you
a world without sin.

1262
01:44:44,555 --> 01:44:46,614
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded. </i>

1263
01:44:46,691 --> 01:44:47,680
<i>And you can see... </i>

1264
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:52,755
<i>it isn't what we thought. </i>

1265
01:44:54,465 --> 01:44:56,330
<i>There's been no war here... </i>

1266
01:44:57,034 --> 01:45:01,300
<i>and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable. </i>

1267
01:45:02,973 --> 01:45:04,736
<i>It's the Pax. </i>

1268
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:10,744
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added
to the air processors. </i>

1269
01:45:11,449 --> 01:45:14,043
<i>It was supposed to calm
the population... </i>

1270
01:45:42,646 --> 01:45:44,307
<i>We meant it for the best... </i>

1271
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,774
<i>to make people safer. </i>

1272
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:49,849
<i>God!</i>

1273
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,178
Sir?
It's done.

1274
01:46:18,349 --> 01:46:19,680
Report.

1275
01:46:21,852 --> 01:46:23,012
River?

1276
01:46:48,579 --> 01:46:49,568
Drop your weapons!

1277
01:46:49,647 --> 01:46:50,671
Do it now.

1278
01:46:50,748 --> 01:46:52,215
Weapons down.
Let it down, now.

1279
01:46:52,283 --> 01:46:53,875
I want to see
your hands in the air.

1280
01:46:53,951 --> 01:46:55,816
Stand down.
Do it.

1281
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:02,759
Targets are acquired.

1282
01:47:02,827 --> 01:47:04,226
<i>Do we have a kill order?</i>

1283
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:08,961
<i>Do we have an order?</i>

1284
01:47:17,107 --> 01:47:18,369
<i>Stand down. </i>

1285
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:22,274
<i>Stand down. It's finished. </i>

1286
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:27,415
<i>We're finished. </i>

1287
01:49:29,807 --> 01:49:31,672
It's not over,
you know.

1288
01:49:33,377 --> 01:49:36,073
I can't guarantee
that they won't
come after you.

1289
01:49:36,914 --> 01:49:37,903
The Parliament.

1290
01:49:38,782 --> 01:49:41,774
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1291
01:49:41,852 --> 01:49:46,221
They are not gone
and they are not... forgiving.

1292
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:49,258
That don't bode
especially well for you...

1293
01:49:49,994 --> 01:49:53,020
giving the order to let us go,
patching up our hurt.

1294
01:49:54,398 --> 01:49:57,834
I told them the Tams
were no longer a threat,
damage done.

1295
01:49:58,369 --> 01:49:59,893
They might listen...

1296
01:50:00,638 --> 01:50:04,039
but I think they know
I'm no longer their man.

1297
01:50:05,809 --> 01:50:08,903
They take you down,
I don't expect
to grieve over much.

1298
01:50:11,148 --> 01:50:13,582
Like to kill you myself,
I see you again.

1299
01:50:14,418 --> 01:50:15,407
You won't.

1300
01:50:18,355 --> 01:50:20,550
There is nothing left to see.

1301
01:50:26,263 --> 01:50:27,787
Sir, we have
a green light.

1302
01:50:28,198 --> 01:50:30,428
Inspection's pos
and we're clear
for up-thrust.

1303
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:39,033
Think she'll hold together?

1304
01:50:40,044 --> 01:50:42,672
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1305
01:50:46,984 --> 01:50:49,214
Make sure
everything's secure.

1306
01:50:51,088 --> 01:50:53,989
Could be bumpy.
Always is.

1307
01:51:01,398 --> 01:51:02,422
Taking her out...

1308
01:51:02,499 --> 01:51:05,059
should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1309
01:51:05,135 --> 01:51:06,295
Right.

1310
01:51:07,705 --> 01:51:09,935
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1311
01:51:10,007 --> 01:51:10,996
I, uh...

1312
01:51:15,779 --> 01:51:17,144
I don't know.

1313
01:51:19,149 --> 01:51:20,309
Good answer.

1314
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:48,067
So, you gonna ride
shotgun with me,
help me fly?

1315
01:51:48,312 --> 01:51:49,540
That's the plan.

1316
01:51:50,214 --> 01:51:51,772
Think you can work out...

1317
01:51:59,423 --> 01:52:00,412
Okay.

1318
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,920
Clearly some
aptitude for the...

1319
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:08,955
It ain't all buttons
and charts, little albatross.

1320
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:11,526
You know what the first rule
of flying is?

1321
01:52:12,035 --> 01:52:15,027
Well, I suppose you do,
since you already know
what I'm about to say.

1322
01:52:16,073 --> 01:52:17,540
I do.

1323
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:20,438
But I like to hear you say it.

1324
01:52:25,249 --> 01:52:26,238
Love.

1325
01:52:26,583 --> 01:52:28,483
You can learn all the math
in the 'verse...

1326
01:52:28,552 --> 01:52:30,577
but you take a boat in
the air that you don't love...

1327
01:52:30,654 --> 01:52:33,521
she'll shake you off
just as sure as
the turn of the worlds.

1328
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:39,556
Love keeps her in the air
when she ought to fall down...

1329
01:52:41,031 --> 01:52:43,363
tells you she's hurting
before she keels.

1330
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:47,398
Makes her a home.

1331
01:52:52,976 --> 01:52:54,841
Storm's getting worse.

1332
01:52:57,147 --> 01:52:59,843
We'll pass through it
soon enough.

1333
01:53:20,938 --> 01:53:21,870
