00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,594

Well, if we...

Thanks for asking,

46
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:18,280
Um, okay, no more business today.

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,582
We'll head home. What do you say?

48
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,963
Okay.

49
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,020
Look, mom, little tiny Christmas stockings.

00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,605
Oh, yeah, those are cute, honey.

00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:28,473
Come on.

52
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,457
They're two dollars.

53
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,309
Oh, no, thank you.

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,160
Merry Christmas.

55
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,744
Oh, Merry Christmas to you.

56
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:39,767
Hey, Judy!

57
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,135
Check it out.

58
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,037
I made a new list for Santa.

59
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,972
I emailed it this morning.

60
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:46,724
Wow, that's a lot of stuff.

61
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,510
I've been good.

62
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,193
Hello, Molly.

63
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,347
Oh, hi, Doris.

64
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,613
Merry Christmas.

65
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:52,814
Doing last minute shopping?

66
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,716
Oh, you know.

67
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:55,717
Me, too.

68
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,652
Don't you just love this weather?

69
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,254
They say it's going to be the
hottest Christmas on record.

70
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,138
It's different.

71
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,724
You'll get used to it.

72
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,393
Beats shoveling all that snow, huh?

73
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,195
Gosh, I love the sunshine.

74
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:11,098
Sunshine doesn't agree with me.

75
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,782
Why's that?

76
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:12,972
Well I burn.

77
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,469
I burn real badly.

78
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,337
Oh, dear.

79
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,321
Yeah.

80
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,440
Merry Christmas.

81
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,542
Okay, Brian, we've got to go get some charcoal

82
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,776
For our Christmas bar-b-cue.

83
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:22,777
Okay.

84
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:23,878
I'll see you around.

85
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,750
Bye, Judy.

86
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,280
Merry Christmas.

87
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,716
Do you think Santa gets a sunburn like you?

88
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,519
Well, he's suppose to be Scandinavian, isn't he?

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,237
I thought he was from the north pole.

90
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:34,055
Well, you know.

91
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:38,526
Scandinavian descent is what I meant.

92
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,930
Mom, does Santa have high cholesterol like dad?

93
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,782
Where do you come up with this stuff?

94
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,201
Well, if he eats milk and cookies

95
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:51,138
At every house in the
world, couldn't he be at risk?

96
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,275
But I think he probably has a great cardiologist.

97
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,076
Bill?

98
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,293
Yeah, hello, honey.

99
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,579
Are you still at work?

100
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,946
Ah! What?

101
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,716
Yes, I'm still here.

102
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,150
When are you getting home?

103
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,318
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

104
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,070
They have a company tradition

105
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,889
Of having a Christmas pool party.

106
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,191
I just wish someone would have told me.

107
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,226
I take it you're a little over-dressed.

108
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,507
Oh, that would be an under-statement.

109
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:16,798
Let me know when you're on your way.

110
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,934
I have a few stops for you to make.

111
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,569
Yeah, I remember.

112
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,070
I gotta get Judy's

113
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,880
Panda play-pal set, right?

114
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,842
I'll stop and get that on the way home.

115
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,176
Okay, thanks.

116
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:32,400
Bye.

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,363
Oh, oh, oh.

118
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:53,450
Welcome back.

119
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,671
I knew that wire tap would pay off.

120
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,006
I knew he'd come back.

121
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,542
You're good, chief.

122
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,626
Should I get the shotgun?

123
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,343
Nope.

124
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,446
That won't be necessary.

125
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,348
Just cover me.

126
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,325
Welcome to town, Max.

127
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:19,694
Is that you, Spivak?

128
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:21,829
It's Chief Spivak.

129
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,631
And you're under arrest.

130
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:24,749
What are you talking about?

131
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,450
What for?

132
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,068
Oh, I think you know.

133
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,037
Outstanding warrants.

134
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,859
What about my bike?

135
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,978
Don't you worry about that.

136
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,582
You won't be needing it where you're going.

137
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,924
Yeah, welcome back.

138
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,449
Mike!

139
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,473
Mikey, come on.

140
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,981
That your girlfriend?

141
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,964
So, are you making some new friends?

142
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,165
Mom!

143
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,000
Can we just go?

144
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,904
Mikey, did you ask Santa for a new skateboard?

145
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,178
Mike asked for an encyclopedia program

146
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,809
To help him with his homework.

147
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,046
Yeah.

148
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,182
Mister Emerson, the budget meeting has been moved

149
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,684
And the board of directors

150
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,185
Needs the revised expansion proposal.

151
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,855
Carla, Carla. It's Christmas Eve.

152
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:54,939
I'm going home.

153
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,957
And the city called.

154
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,491
They say there aren't enough proposed

155
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,198
Parking spaces for the New Year's celebration.

156
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,362
They won't give you a permit,
and they need to talk to you.

157
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,430
You would think for one day out of the year

158
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,482
I wouldn't have to take home piles of work?

159
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:06,333
That's not all.

160
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,268
The event staff said...

161
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,535
Carla, Carla

162
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,021
We'll deal with it on Thursday.

163
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,773
I'm sorry, Mr. Emerson, but I'm on vacation.

164
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:14,595
Merry Christmas.

165
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,889
Oh, Judy, those are beautiful, honey.

166
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,490
Good job.

167
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes, I was holding for Mr. Bailey.

168
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,597
<i>Mr. Bailey's in a meeting right now.</i>

169
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,664
I understand.

170
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:38,049
<i>May I have your name please?</i>

171
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,366
Molly Emerson.

172
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,818
<i>Hold on one moment.</i>

173
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,103
Thank you.

174
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,338
Now do we put them in the oven?

175
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,740
The oven, the sidewalk.

176
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:49,626
It's all hot.

177
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:50,845
Hey.

178
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:51,813
Daddy!

179
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,798
Hey, how's my little peanut?

180
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,883
Good. We're making cookies.

181
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,652
Mmm, yummy.

182
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,253
<i>Miss Emerson?</i>

183
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,288
<i>Mr. Bailey's got a flight to catch.</i>

184
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,771
Yes, I understand but if I could just...

185
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,576
<i>Yes, he's off to China on holiday.</i>

186
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,043
<i>I'll see that he's got your number</i>

187
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,478
<i>And that he calls you back.</i>

188
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,763
Okay, thank you.

189
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:09,596
Cheers.

190
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,526
Happy Christmas.

191
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,649
You, too.

192
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,169
Hi, honey. Who was that?

193
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,004
The Bailey account.

194
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,840
Oh, good news?

195
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,607
No news.

196
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:27,394
Dad, I was wondering, why does Santa wear red?

197
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,986
Um, probably so airplanes can see him

198
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,288
When he's flying around.

199
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,957
Oh.

200
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,927
So, how was the Christmas party?

201
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,236
Judy, honey, why don't you go find your brother

202
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:43,514
So mommy and I talk for a minute.

203
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,167
-Okay?
-Okay.

204
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,235
She's been obsessed about Santa all day.

205
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,371
Did you get the panda play-pal?

206
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,517
They were all out of pandas.

207
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,491
The new shipment didn't come in.

208
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,785
I went to three separate stores looking for him.

209
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:57,712
Oh!

210
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:00,581
All they had left was the talking Teddy.

211
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:02,684
The talking Teddy?

212
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,946
<i>[bear:] yo, whass-up, homey?

213
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,658
This is the "trash-talking Teddy."

214
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:14,261
I didn't catch that.

215
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,998
No wonder it was the only thing left.

216
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,700
Your Christmas bonus?

217
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,840
What's that?

218
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,743
That's my Christmas bonus.

219
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,313
It's a turkey!

220
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:34,298
It was a frozen turkey when I left work.

221
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,583
Oh, Bill, please tell me your joking.

222
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,184
Come on.

223
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,986
You’re joking, huh?

224
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,855
I wish I were.

225
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:42,423
No!!!

226
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,225
They move us out here,

227
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,910
Away from our friends and family.

228
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,894
Away from my job.

229
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,831
They work you like a dog, and this is?

230
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:54,135
This is your Christmas bonus?

231
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:58,599
Well, I got to go to the pool party.

232
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,609
<i>[phasers firing]</i>

233
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,079
Why didn't you ask Santa for a new skateboard?

234
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,597
Because I knew I wouldn't get it.

235
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,849
But you've been good.

236
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,184
Being good has nothing to do with it.

237
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,820
Maybe we made a mistake moving out here.

238
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,590
Honey, we both said we
were gonna give it a Chance.

239
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,827
Well, maybe we were wrong.

240
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,729
I mean, between your work, and the stress.

241
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,201
And my career is the ghost of Christmas past.

242
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,371
I know, I know.

243
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,240
And this unbearable heat.

244
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,777
No way can I feel any kind of Christmas spirit.

245
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,312
It doesn't feel like Christmas.

246
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:43,117
I need snow, and cold weather,

247
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:48,439
And Jack frost nipping at my nose.

248
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,325
I can nip at your nose.

249
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:54,428
But Santa always brings me what I ask for

250
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,563
When I've been good.

251
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:57,899
Man!

252
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,401
Look Judy, I'm getting an encyclopedia program

253
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,619
Because that's what mom and dad want me to get.

254
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,105
But if you ask Santa...

255
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:05,940
Santa's not real.

256
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,309
He's imaginary.

257
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,912
Look, Santa Claus is just made up.

258
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:12,396
For little kids like you.

259
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:15,720
Santa is real! I know it!

260
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,955
Mommy, mommy!

261
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,473
What's the matter, honey?

262
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:25,592
Mikey said Santa Claus is make-believe.

263
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:27,128
Oh, honey.

264
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,080
Mike's just teasing you.

265
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,799
I am not.

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,184
Mike!

267
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,339
She's old enough.

268
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,586
She might as well know.

269
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,138
What's the matter with you?

270
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,572
It's Christmas Eve.

271
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:43,077
So? It doesn't even feel
like Christmas around here.

272
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,579
I knew when I was her age.

273
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,982
Knew what?

274
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:54,168
Mommy, Santa is real, isn't he?

275
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:56,941
Of course he is.

276
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,303
-Honey.
No, no!

277
00:12:58,304 --> 00:12:59,811
Santa Claus is real.

278
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,078
I know he is.

279
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,197
Yeah, honey.

280
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,766
He is real in our imaginations.

281
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,734
No. He's a real person.

282
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,437
He comes down the chimney and delivers toys

283
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:13,107
To all the boys and girls in the world.

284
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:15,476
Judy, he's real

285
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,544
As long as you believe he's real.

286
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:18,301
No!

287
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,363
You're all wrong!

288
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:20,414
He is real.

289
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,236
And I'll prove it.

290
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,427
What?

291
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,250
You think I can depend on you boys

292
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,235
To uphold law and order around here tonight?

293
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,419
You can count on us, chief.

294
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,306
Have we ever let you down?

295
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,540
Lately?

296
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,077
I mean, not counting the
Thanksgiving day incident.

297
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,080
Ha, ha! That wasn't our fault.

298
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,749
We had no way of knowing that was mayor Davis

299
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,251
In that turkey suit?

300
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:02,823
Just keep the peace, all right, boys?

301
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:04,926
And don't bother me unless...

302
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,677
<i>[together:]</i> it's an absolute emergency.

303
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,162
Roger that.

304
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,396
10-4, chief.

305
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:12,799
<i>Oh, chief, about the prisoners?</i>

306
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,863
You want us to delouse 'em?

307
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,774
Nah. That won't be necessary.

308
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,459
Let Clifford stay until morning,

309
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,961
Let him sleep it off.

310
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,796
Max, on the other hand.

311
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,694
He's gotta stay until Monday morning--

312
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,683
Have a visit with judge burns.

313
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,385
You're gonna keep me locked up

314
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,287
On Christmas, Spivak?

315
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,888
That's right.

316
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,524
Don't I get something to eat, Spivak?

317
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:41,830
You can have breakfast in the morning.

318
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,743
Ho. Ho. Ho.

319
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:58,245
You have a merry Christmas now, sir.

320
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,416
Thank you. You too.

321
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,284
10-4, sir.

322
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,202
Looks like it's just me and you, partner.

323
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:06,087
Looks like.

324
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:07,488
Who knows.

325
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,206
Maybe we'll solve a big case

326
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,374
And get our picture in the paper.

327
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,293
Yeah, that'd be so cool.

328
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,894
Hey, Buckley--

329
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:16,330
How come we always gotta work Christmas Eve?

330
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,148
Yeah.

331
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,967
I wanna wait for Santa.

332
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,054
You know Santa won't
show up unless you're asleep.

333
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,105
I bet he will.

334
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,840
You willing to risk all those Christmas presents?

335
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,610
All right then, hit the sack, soldier.

336
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,031
Sleep tight.

337
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,218
Ha, ha.

338
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,530
Should I put these under the tree?

339
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,015
Oh, they can wait until morning.

340
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,434
It really doesn't matter anymore.

341
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:57,204
I feel bad for Judy.

342
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:01,007
Oh, these kids just grow up too fast.

343
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,277
I know.

344
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,347
Is seems like Christmas isn't what it used to be.

345
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,783
Well, what do you want to do?

346
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,567
Move back east?

347
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,810
Oh, I don't know.

348
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,497
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:28,251
I guess I'm just depressed.

350
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,537
About Christmas?

351
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:34,208
Yeah, that and the fact
that I used to be somebody.

352
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,345
A year ago I was an account
exec on Madison avenue.

353
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:42,483
And now I can't even get
anybody to return my calls.

354
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,485
Honey--

355
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:47,321
You'd probably feel a lot better if we were

356
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:52,393
Back east with a big,
huge, white blanket of snow.

357
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,978
Yeah.

358
00:16:54,979 --> 00:17:00,534
A white Christmas would be magic.

359
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:05,139
You know I could crank the
air conditioning way up high,

360
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,073
And we get out a comforter.

361
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:10,444
Pretend like we're back east?

362
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,446
Nah, it doesn't matter.

363
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,184
Christmas is just another day.

364
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,604
Well, merry just another day!

365
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,808
Very funny.

366
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,140
<i>[meow]</i>

367
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,072
<i>[meow]</i>

368
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,400
<i>Whoa, there.</i>

369
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,032
<i>Aaugh!</i>

370
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,735

It's Christmas Eve.

You were expecting the Easter bunny?

Yes, yes.

Hello, is this the police?

424
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:19,653
We have an intruder in our house.

425
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:20,604
No, no, no.

426
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,922
I'm not an intruder.

427
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,790
You left cookies and milk.

428

How'd you get in here?

429
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,729
How do you think? I came down the chimney.

430
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,131
Santa, Santa, I knew you'd come!

431
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,666
Merry Christmas, Judy.

432
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,150
Oh, and thank you for the cookies.

433
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:35,802
They were delicious.

434
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:37,971
Me and mommy made them.

435
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:39,823
Judy, stay back!

436
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:41,842

Oh, no Mike, this is no disguise.

How'd you know my name?

443
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,458
I know everyone's name.

I'm Santa.

445

449
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:04,247
Hey, just keep your hands

00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,982
Where I can see them, fat boy.

451
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,401
Oh, please, Bill. I'm not fat.

452
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:10,704
Just big-boned.

454
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:19,145
Have you been stalking us?

455
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:22,849
I know everyone's name.
It's in my job description.

456
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,035
Will you go upstairs, please.

457
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,086
No, mom!

458
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,420
I wanna see dad bop him.

459
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,272
Would you go upstairs!

460
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,041
I'm not gonna bop anyone.

461
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,443
Unless, of course, I have to.

462
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,594
Easy now, Bill.

463
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,278
Don't raise that blood pressure.

464
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,521
We all know where that can lead to.

465
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,003
What are you going to do with him, dad?

466
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,420
I'm sending him to jail.

467
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:45,889
Where he belongs.

468
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,840
Oh.

469
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:49,543
We'll hold him overnight and you can come by

470
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,645
In the morning and file a complaint.

471
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,247
Overnight! No, that won't do.

472
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:56,670
Quiet!

473
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,111

The one that's on your driver's license?

481
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,139
I don't have a driver's license.

482
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,007
Most people in these parts like
to refer to me as Santa Claus.

483
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,917
You got any id?

484
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:07,821
I don't usually need it, you know?

Evenin', chief.

00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:35,248
Buckley, this better be good.

489
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:37,000
Sorry to bother you, sir.

490
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,501
But we picked up a prowler

491
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,454
On a breaking and entering over on Navidad Lane.

492
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:42,756
Anybody hurt?

493
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,890
No, no, sir.

494
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,526
We got the perpetrator in custody

495
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,228
And it's all under control.

496
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,463
It's just I had a question, sir.

497
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:56,269
He has no id and he claims
his name is Santa Claus.

498
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,171
Santa Claus?

499
00:25:58,172 --> 00:25:59,205
Yes, sir.

500
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:02,042
Do you think that's funny, Buckley?

501
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:04,444
I mean he's got the beard and the suit.

502
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,179
It's not the mayor, is it?

503
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,514
Definitely not, sir. We checked.

504
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,416
But I've got to admit

505
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,887
He's the most convincing
Santa Claus I've ever seen.

506
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,639
But I am Santa Claus.

507
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,059
You be quiet.

<i>Unless its an absolute emergency.</i>

511
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,123
And I do apologize, sir.

512
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,962

And Buckley, do not call me again

518
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,347
Unless it's a life or death situation.

519
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:42,565

Brian, is that you?

528
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,165
Get off the phone and go to bed.

00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:46,749
Bill, speak to me.

559
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,034
Daddy?!

560
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,856
Sweet.

561
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,342
Honey, say something.

562
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:58,628
There.

563
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,364
There.

564
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,349
What is it?

565
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,817
What did you see?

566
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:06,019
Reindeer.

567
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,220
Santa's reindeer?

568
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,202
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,577
They were Santa's reindeer.

570
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,346
They just took off from our roof.

571
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,431
See? I told you.

572
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,633
Bill, we have to get you to the hospital, now.

573
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,085
No, no, no, I'm fine.

574
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:22,853
Look, look.

575
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,687
Honey, I know what I saw.

576
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,822
It was the most amazing thing.

577
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:28,841
I think you have a concussion.

578
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,326
No, honey, I'm fine.

579
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:31,177
Yes, I do.

580
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:33,079
They were waiting for Santa.

581
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,597
Yeah, that's right.

582
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,299
They were waiting for Santa.

583
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,517
I know.

584
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,002
Okay, daddy isn't feeling well right now.

585
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,871
Daddy's in shock and I'm calling an ambulance.

586
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,771
No, no, no, honey.

587
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:43,256
I'm fine.

588
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,691
Daddy, you've got to get Santa out of jail.

589
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:47,227
Santa.

590
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,278
She's right.

591
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,072
Santa.

592
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,030
Bill, Bill.

593
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:51,014
Oh, no, she's right.

594
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,682
I've gotta go to the police station

595
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,966
And bail out Santa.

596
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:56,436
Are you out of your mind?!

597
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,505
Bill, honey, I really think we
need to get you to the hospital.

598
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,441
The hospital?

599
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,126
No. Santa's down at the police station.

600
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,560
I gotta go down there and get him out.

601
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:06,947
Listen to yourself. You're talking crazy.

602
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,115
No, mommy, he's right.

603
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,286
Look. I'm just gonna go down there,

604
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,753
I'm gonna drop all the charges.

605
00:31:13,754 --> 00:31:15,771
And then I'm gonna be back in a jiffy.

606
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:16,426
Bill?

607
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:16,889
Wait.

608
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,458
Bill, Bill?

609
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,859
Cool, mom.

610
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,963
Dad's gone totally bonkers. Heh, heh.

611
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:32,805
A lot of bad Santas here.

Hello?

615
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:48,939
Boss, this is elf one.

616
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,706
You're way behind schedule.

617
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:52,759
What are your coordinates?

618
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,960
Who are you trying to reach?

619
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,079
Wait, who is this?

620
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,948
What are you doing on Santa's hotline?

621
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,133
This is officer Buckley of the...

622
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:02,676
Officer Buckley, hold on.

623
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:07,540
Oh, the same dufus that arrested
mayor Davis on Thanksgiving?

624
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:09,475
Hey, now. Wait a minute.

625
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:11,677
That was a mix up and it wasn't our...

Put Santa on the phone, now!

628
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,718
Can't do that, he's incarcerated.

629
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,887
You sure are a few nuts short of a fruitcake,

631
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:24,390
Hey, now, wait a minute, mister.

632
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:25,976
No. Unless you want to be

00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:32,032
You'll put Santa on the phone, now.

635
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,268
We'll see about that.

636
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,835
Hello.

637
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:38,637
Hello?

638
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:40,060
Who was it?

639
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:41,441
Some wiseguy.

640
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,843
Officer Buckley, was that for me?

641
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:45,945
Nope, wrong number.

642
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:50,609
Wrong number? That's impossible.

643
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,388
I've gotta get out of here.

644
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:58,091
If I don't make my appointed rounds tonight

645
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,959
It will ruin my perfect record.

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,927
Millions of children all over the world

647
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:04,130
Will lose Faith in me.

648
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,999
It will nullify my very existence, Max.

649
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,402
Look. I don't know you.

650
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,021
And you don't know me.

651
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,855
So how do you know my name is Max?

652
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:15,108
I know everybody's name.

653
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,434
Did you used to ride with the scorpions?

654
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:19,945
No, I ride with the reindeer.

655
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:23,489
I never heard of them.

656
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:32,358
Merry Christmas, Clifford.

657
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,994
Oh, no, there's two of you.

658
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:37,330
I'm seeing double again.

659
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,633
You've had too much Christmas cheer, Clifford.

661
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,151

Yeah, that's right.

663
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:01,921
I changed my mind.

664
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:04,557
Mr. Emerson, this low life perpetrator

665
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:06,292
Broke into your home.

666
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,462
You know, he didn't really break in.

667
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:13,065
I mean it was all kind of a misunderstanding.

668
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:17,237
I think I can help you get out of here.

669
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:20,206
Yeah. I'm supposed to be out of here anytime now.

670
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:21,657
Really, a friend of mine

671
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:24,210
Is suppose to come down here and bail me out.

672
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:26,846
You think you can fit into this?

673
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,215
Well, he has no proof of identity

674
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:32,385
And now we have the
question of the vagrancy charge.

675
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:35,327
I can vouch for him.

676
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:41,284
Can you tell me his name?

677
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,981
Uhh.

678
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,216
Ummm,

00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:49,602

680
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:52,906
He likes to be called Santa.

00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,644
Anyway, look, its Christmas Eve, guys.

682
00:34:58,645 --> 00:35:01,281
Let's just forget about the whole thing?

683
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,949
What about our picture in the paper?

684
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,568
<i>If I don't press the charges</i>

685
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,120
Then you can't really keep him here.

686
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:10,356
Am I right about that?

687
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:13,393
Maybe you should call the chief.

688
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,628
I don't think we should bother him.

689
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:18,090
No.

No, no, you don't...

702
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,433

Look what I got.

725
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,641
I got blueberry again and I asked for raspberry.

726
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:11,344
Sometimes when they don't have a sticky bun

727
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,212
I get a bear claw.

728
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:14,980
You can put the blueberry away for later.

729
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,015
I'll eat that.

730
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,677

00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,725
It was one of Santa's elves that did it, huh?

735
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,059

00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:42,908
Here, this way.

744
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,076
Okay.

745
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:46,646
Santa, why are you dressed in leather?

746
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,081
Oh, it's my new look.

747
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:50,950
I think I like the old look better.

748
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:53,152
Yes, me too.

749
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,388
Did you get the toys I asked for?

750
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,123
Now, Brian, you've got to wait until morning.

751
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:01,160
I've got some more stuff that I added to my list.

752
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:02,011
Oh, really.

753
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:03,713
Why doesn't that surprise me?

754
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,631
A baseball glove, a slot car track,

755
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:09,101
Game station 3, a pony...

756
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,971
Hey, look who I've got.

757
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:12,805
Daddy.

758
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:14,273
Santa!

759
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:16,041
Bill, are you all right?

760
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,277
Yeah, I'm fine.

761
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:21,614
I really think we should get you to a doctor.

762
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:23,215
That was quite a fall you took

763
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:28,080
No, I'm fine, honey. Look, I've got Santa.

764
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,290
Do you really think it's a good idea

765
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,293
To bring a stranger back into our house?

766
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:36,596
Honey, he's not a stranger.

767
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:38,864
He's Santa Claus.

768
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:41,767
Hey, Santa, cool biker ring.

769
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:43,436
Oh, thanks, kid.

770
00:38:43,437 --> 00:38:45,204
The reindeer left.

771
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:47,607
So, uh, are you gonna call
them back or something?

772
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:48,474
The reindeer?

773
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:50,809
They a biker gang?

774
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,845
Biker gang?

775
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,981
No, the reindeer on the roof?

776
00:38:55,982 --> 00:39:00,753
With the sleigh and presents.

777
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:03,255
Oh, those reindeer.

778
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:04,724
Santa's reindeer.

779
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:05,541
Yeah.

780
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:06,376
Your reindeer.

781
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:06,926
My reindeer?

782
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,752
Yeah.

783
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:09,364
So, you gonna call them back?

784
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:12,231
I'd love for you to show them to my wife.

785
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,266
She's a kind of a skeptic.

786
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:17,136
You know?

787
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,497
So, they coming back?

788
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:20,139
They'll be back.

789
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,475
Rudolf just went out to get something to eat.

790
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:25,077
By the way, you got any grub around here?

791
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,896
There's more cookies.

792
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,715
I'm talking about real grub, little lady.

793
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:32,251
Can I, uh, talk to you a minute?

794
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:33,486
Oh, yeah, sure.

795
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,688
There's plenty of food in the fridge, Santa.

796
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:36,939
Just, help yourself.

797
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,257
I'll show him.

798
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:40,192
No, Judy.

799
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:41,561
Mike.

800
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:43,496
Go get the 9 iron.

801
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:44,797
You gonna bop him, mom?

802
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:46,098
Just go.

803
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,768
Bill, if this is some kind of
practical joke or something.

804
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:49,885
Honey, honey, honey.

805
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:51,320
You gotta understand.

806
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:54,073
He's the real thing. He is Santa Claus.

807
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:56,341
<i>[crash]</i>

808
00:39:56,342 --> 00:40:02,247
Bill, there is no such thing as Santa Claus.

809
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,866
Uh-uh!

810
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,719
A football helmet,

811
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,855
A titanium space commando action figure,

812
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:11,824
A cd player...

813
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,843
That's quite a tall order there, Brian.

814
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,928
Oh, I'm not done just yet.

815
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,229
I didn't think so.

816
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,531
Let's see, where was I?

817
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:24,395
Oh, yeah, a cd player, a kite, an ant farm...

<i>[crash]</i>

819
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,832
Want some more cookies, Santa?

820
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,283
Sure.

824
00:40:56,036 --> 00:41:00,979
Um, he's got a tattoo.

00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,476

826
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:06,361
Not exactly the holiday sentiments

827
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:10,249
You'd expect from Santa Claus.

828
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,913
Here, mom. You gonna bop him now?

829
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:19,974
I think I've made a terrible mistake.

830
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,430
We've let the good chief down.

831
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,667
He entrusted us to keep the peace, and now look.

832
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:29,669
We've got us an escaped prisoner on our hands.

833
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,386
It was your idea to go for jelly donuts.

834
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,638
It wasn't jelly donuts

835
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,239
That forgot to lock that holding cell.

836
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,241
I'm telling you, that cell was locked.

837
00:41:36,242 --> 00:41:42,869
Yeah, well, all I'm saying
is we need to find him.

838
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,318
Maybe we should talk to that Santiago guy.

839
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,820
He shared the cell.

840
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:49,629
Maybe he knows something.

841
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,624
That's a good idea.

842
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,593
Now you're thinking, partner.

843
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,533
Let's go!

844
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:00,900
You're not Santa.

845
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:02,401
You're an impostor!

846
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:05,137
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, kid.

847
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:08,073
Obviously, there been a mistake.

848
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,709
They must have given me

849
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,244
The wrong Santa at the police station.

850
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,213
The wrong Santa?

851
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:14,897
Yeah.

852
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,015

Can you tell us where he is?

987

No, we don't know where he is.

988
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:39,238
He was here and then he... He left.

Is something wrong with your neck?

990
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:44,343

00:53:26,352 --> 00:53:27,402
Make-believe!

1108
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:28,770
<i>What are you, wacko?</i>

1109
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,672
You don't like presents?

1110
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:34,225
No, Brian, Michael is not wacko.

1111
00:53:34,226 --> 00:53:37,312
Lots of people think that I'm make-believe.

1112
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:39,798
<i>You might be able to fool these little guys.</i>

1113
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,801
But I'm too old for that kind of stuff.

1114
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,637
No one is too old to believe in Santa Claus.

1115
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:47,806
Not even you, Molly.

1116
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,007
Thanks.

1117
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:51,343
But we all have to grow up sometime.

1118
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:53,512
It has nothing to do with growing up.

1119
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:58,149
As you can see, I'm alive and well.

1120
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,319
What do you think he's going to do with us?

1121
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,453
Don't worry.

1122
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:03,322
Max is really a pussy cat.

1123
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,889
He just likes to act tough.

1124
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,953
Well, he is Santa Claus.

1125
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:10,194
Bill.

1126
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:12,163
Mom, why can't you believe?

1127
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:13,047
Judy, please.

1128
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:16,284
I don't believe in miracles.

1129
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,302
No offense.

1130
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:20,271
None taken.

1131
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:21,706
I'm sorry, Santa.

1132
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:23,207
It's all my fault.

1133
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:26,445
Now kids all over the world won't get any toys.

1134
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:27,228
No toys?!

1135
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:28,797
Hey, wait a minute!

1136
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,282
You sure you haven't been to my house yet?

1137
00:54:31,283 --> 00:54:32,384
That's right, Brian.

1138
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:33,968
Then we haveta get you going!

1139
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,520
Hey, mister.

1140
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:37,589
Do you know who you're holding here?

1141
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:38,740
<i>Yeah, a little spivo.</i>

1142
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,392
No! Santa Claus.

1143
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:43,762
He's got a lotta toys to deliver
and you're holding him up.

1144
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:45,864
Oh, I'm holding him up?

1145
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,034
Well, let me tell you something
about Santa Claus, buster.

1146
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,368
<i>[bullhorn:]</i> Max Hurst!

1147
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:54,105
Come out with your hands up.

1148
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:56,541
Max, we know you're in there.

1149
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:59,143
We've got the place totally surrounded.

1150
00:54:59,144 --> 00:55:01,245
But, chief, there's no one around back.

1151
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:02,708
Would you shh!

1152
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,349
Alright, come on, Max.

1153
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,185
<i>Give it up.</i>

1154
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:09,353
You'd better stay back, Spivak!

1155
00:55:09,354 --> 00:55:11,390
I got hostages.

1156
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,792
Including your snot-nosed kid!

1157
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:14,626
Snot-nosed?

1158
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:18,562
Hey! Who you calling snot-nosed?

1159
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:20,131
Okay, Max.

1160
00:55:20,132 --> 00:55:22,266
Look, don't do anything rash.

1161
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:23,652
We can work all this out.

1162
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,837
You just gotta show us some good Faith.

1163
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:27,772
Send out one of the hostages.

1164
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:30,575
No way!

1165
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:33,578
What is it you want?

1166
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:37,516
What is it I want?

1167
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:40,138
What is it I want?

1168
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,191
I'm sending out a list of my demands.

1169
00:55:47,192 --> 00:55:48,827
Demands?!

1170
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,394
Who does he think he is?

1171
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,813
Chief, do you want us to notify

1172
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:53,932
The state police, FBI, the media?

1173
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,099
No.

1174
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,868
We can handle this.

1175
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,186
What's going on, honey?

1176
00:55:58,187 --> 00:55:58,903
I don't know.

1177
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:00,321
Boss, standard procedure...

1178
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,073
This is not a standard situation, Buckley.

1179
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:05,243
You got a problem with that?

1180
00:56:05,244 --> 00:56:09,148
How did he get out, anyway?

1181
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:54,593
Whoa! Who are you?

1182
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:55,960
Elf ranger bob.

1183
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:57,345
North pole special ops.

1184
00:56:57,346 --> 00:56:58,797
Seek and recovery unit.

1185
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,398
You Buckley?

1186
00:57:00,399 --> 00:57:04,736
No, I'm just sleepin' it off.

1187
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:08,773
I don't have much time, so
please, be concise and factual.

1188
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:09,674
Santa?

1189
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:14,012
Why little guy, I'm Santa Claus.

1190
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,874
C'mere.

1191
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:20,719
Read it.

1192
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,687
I want my Harley back,

1193
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:24,823
With a full tank of gas,

1194
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:26,340
And all the charges dropped.

1195
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:27,659
That's it?

1196
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,993
And?

1197
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:30,729
And an apology.

1198
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,531
From your father.

1199
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,133
And you call yourself an outlaw?

1200
00:57:35,134 --> 00:57:37,068
Get out there, little spivo.

1201
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:38,703
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1202
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:41,740
There's a hostage coming
out with a list of demands!

1203
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,407
Brian!

1204
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:45,243
Come here.

1205
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,761
Son, are you alright?

1206
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:48,012
Yeah, I'm good.

1207
00:57:48,013 --> 00:57:50,354
I got the demands.

1208
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:56,054
Harley, full tank of gas, all charges dropped.

1209
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:56,871
Apologize?

1210
00:57:56,872 --> 00:57:58,156
Ha!

1211
00:57:58,157 --> 00:57:59,273
That's what he wants?

1212
00:57:59,274 --> 00:57:59,924
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:03,094
And this too.

1214
00:58:03,095 --> 00:58:07,365
Baseball glove, slot car track, game station 3...

1215
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:09,300
A pony?!

1216
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:11,002
Yup.

1217
00:58:11,003 --> 00:58:13,905
Max, may I ask you a question?

1218
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:17,141
What?

1219
00:58:17,142 --> 00:58:19,778
Why are they after you anyway?

1220
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:23,414
It's just an old personal grudge
between me and sheriff Spivak.

1221
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:26,484
He's always had it in for
me ever since we were kids.

1222
00:58:26,485 --> 00:58:28,753
Did you go to school with chief Spivak?

1223
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:31,790
Not exactly, but we did grow up near each other.

1224
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,792
Brian's daddy?

1225
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:37,028
You were quite the big bully
back then, weren't you, Max?

1226
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:38,112
It was just kids stuff.

1227
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:40,014
We were just fooling around.

1228
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:45,203
Max, what exactly are the charges against you?

1229
00:58:45,204 --> 00:58:47,806
<i>[mumbling]</i>

1230
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:51,590
W-what was that?

1231
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:55,246
Traffic violations.

1232
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:57,682
You're holding us hostage

1233
00:58:57,683 --> 00:59:00,251
Because of some speeding tickets?

1234
00:59:00,252 --> 00:59:01,119
No.

1235
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,354
Actually, they're parking tickets.

1236
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:05,657
<i>[together:]</i> parking tickets!

1237
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:08,660
Major titanium space commando action figure,

1238
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:10,712
Inline skates, a cd player?

1239
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,661
Cd player?

1240
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:14,065
Where am I suppose to find a cd player

1241
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:17,068
At 2:00 in morning on Christmas Eve?

1242
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:20,071
Mega mart on route 111's open 24/7.

1243
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:22,674
They got free candy canes and eggnog.

1244
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,075
Alright, that's it!

1245
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:26,778
People, go back to your homes, please.

1246
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:28,512
There's nothing else to see here.

1247
00:59:28,513 --> 00:59:30,448
Boys, lock and load.

1248
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:31,549
No, dad!

1249
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,217
Santa Claus is in there.

1250
00:59:33,218 --> 00:59:34,703
Brian, I'm sending you home.

1251
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,004
Somebody get my wife on the phone.

1252
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,221
No way, I'm staying.

1253
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:39,803
You can't shoot Santa!

1254
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:45,429
There's no sign of Santa

1255
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,598
Or officer Buckley at his place of employment.

1256
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,450
Let me tell you something about officer Buckley.

1257
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,871
It says here he loves jelly donuts.

1258
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:54,451
<i>Over.</i>

1259
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:58,442
Affirmative.

1260
00:59:58,443 --> 01:00:01,112
I'll recon the area.

1261
01:00:01,113 --> 01:00:02,847
Alright, Max.

1262
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:04,282
This is your last Chance.

1263
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:07,451
Either you're coming out or we're coming in.

1264
01:00:07,452 --> 01:00:09,487
What about my demands?

1265
01:00:09,488 --> 01:00:10,421
Forget it!

1266
01:00:10,422 --> 01:00:11,756
You're not getting a pony.

1267
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:13,825
Aw, c'mon, dad!

1268
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,807
Brian, please, daddy's working.

1269
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:18,453
Get in the car.

1270
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:23,167
I didn't say nothing about no pony.

1271
01:00:23,168 --> 01:00:25,970
Alright, Max, that's it.

1272
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:27,338
We're coming in!

1273
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:29,207
Hold on, Spivak.

1274
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,509
This is just between you and me.

1275
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,676
<i>Now look.</i>

1276
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:36,314
I'm sorry I gave you wedgies when we was kids.

1277
01:00:36,315 --> 01:00:38,149
But that was a long time ago.

1278
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,250
Get over it!

1279
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:40,001
<i><i>[laughing]</i></i>

1280
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:40,952
Wedgies.

1281
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:42,553
Like when you pull your underwears up

1282
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:43,988
All snug and stuff.

1283
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:45,757
Ha, ha, ha.

1284
01:00:45,758 --> 01:00:46,758
Wedgies.

1285
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:50,061
I don't know what you're talking about.

1286
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,797
But I'm giving you 2 minutes to give yourself up

1287
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:55,940
Or we're coming in.

1288
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,204
Okay, get right in his face.

1289
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:02,206
Got it.

1290
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:04,008
Are you chief Spivak?

1291
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:05,059
Who wants to know?

1292
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,444
Brook berry, KTAG news.

1293
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:09,480
Tell me, chief Spivak, is Santa
Claus being held hostage?

1294
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:10,498
Don't be ridiculous.

1295
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:11,653
It's Christmas Eve.

1296
01:01:11,654 --> 01:01:13,201
Don't you people have lives?

1297
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,354
Don't any of you have lives?!

1298
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:18,522
You gave chief Spivak wedgies?

1299
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:19,407
<i>[laughing]</i> humm!

1300
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:21,159
Mike.

1301
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,895
You came back for a
certain reason this Christmas,

1302
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:26,097
Didn't you, Max?

1303
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:29,000
You came home to see your mom.

1304
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:35,273
How did you know?

1305
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,776
Your mother lives here?

1306
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,277
Yeah.

1307
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:43,481
That's so sweet that you wanted to see her.

1308
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:45,316
Yes, and its not too late.

1309
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:46,885
You can still see her.

1310
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:47,986
Yeah?

1311
01:01:47,987 --> 01:01:49,270
Well how am I gonna get outta here?

1312
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,488
I can help.

1313
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:52,356
We can all help.

1314
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:53,958
Now you want to help?

1315
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:55,593
It's his mother.

1316
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:56,995
I have a plan.

1317
01:01:56,996 --> 01:01:58,529
But you've got to trust me.

1318
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,532
And help me deliver some very special gifts.

1319
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:03,802
<i>Please, Mr. Max biker, sir...</i>

1320
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:07,625
For kids and for Christmas everywhere.

1321
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:11,993
I ain't goin' back to jail.

1322
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,235
You won't. But I need all your help.

1323
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:22,497
What do you say, Max?

1324
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,657
<i>Okay, Spivak, you win.</i>

1325
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:28,999
<i>I'm coming out.</i>

1326
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,863
Alright, Max.

1327
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:33,848
Come out backwards with your hands in the air.

1328
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:37,435
And no funny business.

1329
01:02:37,436 --> 01:02:38,669
Alright, boys.

1330
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,813
Get ready.

1331
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,256
Here he comes.

1332
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:56,284
Hold on.

1333
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:04,462
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1334
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:07,244
Get him!-- Get him!

1335
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:18,175
Wait a second.

1336
01:03:18,176 --> 01:03:18,977
Wait a second.

1337
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:20,011
That's not Max.

1338
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:21,645
It's not the mayor, it is?

1339
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:22,816
It's Santiago!

1340
01:03:22,817 --> 01:03:24,315
No, it's Santa Claus.

1341
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:25,616
Hello, Brian.

1342
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:26,517
Hello, Santa.

1343
01:03:26,518 --> 01:03:27,785
He's still inside, boys.

1344
01:03:27,786 --> 01:03:30,648
Let's get him!

1345
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,578
Ow! Ow!

1346
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:40,798
Come on! He's getting away!

1347
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,739
Come on, cal.

1348
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:47,305
They're gettin' away, hurry!

1349
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:48,239
Hurry, go get em!

1350
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,941
Get em!

1351
01:03:49,942 --> 01:03:51,092
That's right, the Emerson house.

1352
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,426
With a tailwind I can make it,

1353
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:53,694
But we've got to hurry because...

1354
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:54,578
Oh.

1355
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:56,247
Santa?

1356
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:58,215
Are you there?

1357
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:02,553
Oh, they're out spreading Christmas Joy, Tom.

1358
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:03,988
Do I know you?

1359
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:05,856
Well, we met many, many years ago.

1360
01:04:05,857 --> 01:04:08,092
I'd love to stand here
and talk with you about it.

1361
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:09,878
But I don't really have time.

1362
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,998
Now can I please have my little phone back?

1363
01:04:11,999 --> 01:04:14,982
Oh, you thought you could
pull a fast one on me, didn't you?

1364
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:16,567
You're under arrest.

1365
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,702
Dad, you can't arrest Santa Claus!

1366
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,104
He's an accomplice, Brian.

1367
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:23,474
He aided, abetted, allowed my prisoner to escape.

1368
01:04:23,475 --> 01:04:24,792
Now hold on a minute.

1369
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:25,977
Tell it to the judge.

1370
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:28,719
Hey!

1371
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,515
Elf ranger, bob.

1372
01:04:31,516 --> 01:04:35,419
Santa just tried to call from
the Emerson house, copy?

1373
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:48,640
You can let me out anywhere around here.

1374
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:52,136
But you promised to help deliver Santa's gifts.

1375
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:54,055
<i>And he gave USA special list.</i>

1376
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,656
You got to come with us.

1377
01:04:55,657 --> 01:04:57,941
Santa saved you from going to jail.

1378
01:04:57,942 --> 01:05:01,061
You gave him your word.

1379
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:04,915
What would your mother say?

1380
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,650
All right.

1381
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:08,419
Where's the first stop?

1382
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,021
Memorial hospital.

1383
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,222
Step on it.

1384
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:13,684
Let's get this over with.

1385
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,515
You don't understand.

1386
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:13,084
If I don't make my deliveries tonight

1387
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:14,752
It will ruin a perfect record.

1388
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:18,156
I've been doing this job for a very long time.

1389
01:06:18,157 --> 01:06:21,024
It's a high pressure job and
it's not getting any easier.

1390
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:23,094
Uh-huh, I see.

1391
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:24,728
Do you realize that you're putting

1392
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:27,198
Thousands of elves out of work?

1393
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,700
Think what that'll do to the world economy?

1394
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:30,884
Hey, tell me where Max is,

1395
01:06:30,885 --> 01:06:32,853
You'll be on your way.

1396
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:35,639
You and I both know that you have nothing on Max.

1397
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,675
You're just holding a residual anger

1398
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:39,710
From the time you two were young.

1399
01:06:39,711 --> 01:06:41,412
That's the quickest way to get an ulcer.

1400
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:44,047
I happen to know you're on your way.

1401
01:06:44,048 --> 01:06:45,218
Wait a minute.

1402
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:47,651
How do you know my name?

1403
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:48,569
No, forget that.

1404
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,437
Forget that.

1405
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,822
Go back to the beginning.

1406
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:53,891
Where is Max?

1407
01:06:53,892 --> 01:06:58,195
I don't have time for this, Tom.

1408
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:09,173
Hey, who are you?

1409
01:07:09,174 --> 01:07:10,574
No worries, bro.

1410
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:11,875
Go back to sleep.

1411
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:13,511
What do you want?

1412
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,679
I'm here to deliver some presents.

1413
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,548
Yeah, right.

1414
01:07:17,549 --> 01:07:19,783
Who do you think you are, Santa Claus?

1415
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:21,519
Not exactly.

1416
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,754
But I guess you can say he sent me.

1417
01:07:23,755 --> 01:07:26,136
He sent you?

1418
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,143
Here, this is for you.

1419
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,610
Whoa!

1420
01:07:46,611 --> 01:07:50,148
It's the shred deck deluxe

1421
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,183
You kinda are like Santa Claus.

1422
01:07:52,184 --> 01:07:53,184
Hey.

1423
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:54,526
When you get better maybe we can go

1424
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:57,054
Ridin' together sometime?

1425
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,290
That'll be awesome.

1426
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,953
Yeah.

1427
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:19,510
Is everything all right?

1428
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,512
That's Kyle Fletcher.

1429
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:24,815
This is the Guy I replaced at work.

1430
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:27,050
This is the Guy whose workload

1431
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,653
You're supposed to live up to?

1432
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:31,422
Yup.

1433
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:32,390
<i>[sigh]</i>

1434
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:34,732
What happened to him?

1435
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:40,097
Heart attack.

1436
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:42,466
Stress related.

1437
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:44,402
Sounds like somebody I know.

1438
01:08:44,403 --> 01:08:47,184
<i>[sigh]</i>

1439
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:49,657
Not any more.

1440
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,540
Come on.

1441
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,253
Santa?

1442
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:20,404
Oh!

1443
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:23,206
Santa, is that you?

1444
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:24,908
Ho, ho, ho.

1445
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:26,877
Merry Christmas, little fellah.

1446
01:09:26,878 --> 01:09:29,513
Wow, it's really you!

1447
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:31,156
Listen you better get to bed

1448
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:33,451
So you can open your presents in the morning.

1449
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,352
Okay.

1450
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:39,156
I love you, Santa.

1451
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:41,392
Well, I.

1452
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:45,329
I love you, too, uh.

1453
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:46,664
Scotty.

1454
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:49,833
Off to bed now.

1455
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,569
Let's go Santa.

1456
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:54,472
We have a tight schedule.

1457
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:56,874
That was very good.

1458
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:01,019
Ho, ho, ho.

1459
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,658
<i>[Teddy:]</i> yo.

1460
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:17,127
Whass up, homey?

1461
01:10:17,128 --> 01:10:19,830
So, you're telling me that Max Hurst

1462
01:10:19,831 --> 01:10:22,533
Is out there delivering Christmas presents

1463
01:10:22,534 --> 01:10:24,037
To the less fortunate?

1464
01:10:24,038 --> 01:10:25,853
Oh, please. Don't make me laugh.

1465
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,905
Max Hurst is as mean as they come.

1466
01:10:27,906 --> 01:10:29,323
He's got a heart of Stone.

1467
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:30,941
Now wait a minute, Tom, please.

1468
01:10:30,942 --> 01:10:33,210

You think he'll finish his rounds tonight?

1654
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,454
Yeah, I bet he will.

1655
01:18:31,455 --> 01:18:33,373
I can't believe it.

1656
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:37,094
We had Santa Claus in our very own jailhouse.

1657
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:39,096
That would have made the papers.

1658
01:18:39,097 --> 01:18:41,431
And we didn't even get a picture.

1659
01:18:41,432 --> 01:18:43,066
That's it.

1660
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:48,131
Tomorrow, I'm getting with the program.

1661
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:55,478
<i>Come on, please?</i>

1662
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:56,914
Just let him go.

1663
01:18:56,915 --> 01:18:59,582
It's Christmas.

1664
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,518
We gotta get Max outta here.
-Please?

1665
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:02,369
I give up, Spivak.

1666
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,187
You win.

1667
01:19:04,188 --> 01:19:08,258
You really came to town to see your mom?

1668
01:19:08,259 --> 01:19:10,393
Yes, I did.

1669
01:19:10,394 --> 01:19:12,762
I got tired of spending Christmas alone.

1670
01:19:12,763 --> 01:19:14,264
I came to realize

1671
01:19:14,265 --> 01:19:15,748
We've only got a few of them left.

1672
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:18,076
And we'd better make the best of each one of 'em.

1673
01:19:18,077 --> 01:19:19,937
I couldn't agree more.

1674
01:19:19,938 --> 01:19:24,774
Well, I'm sure she'll be
real happy to see you then.

1675
01:19:24,775 --> 01:19:26,243
Not like this.

1676
01:19:26,244 --> 01:19:27,744
Behind bars?

1677
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:29,512
Anybody wanna press charges?

1678
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:30,680
Against Max?

1679
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:31,364
No way!

1680
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:32,349
We're friends.

1681
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,616
<i>Yeah.</i>

1682
01:19:33,617 --> 01:19:35,759
Well, alright then.

1683
01:19:39,473 --> 01:19:40,257
You're free to go.

1684
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:41,424
Go on.

1685
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:42,268
You mean it?

1686
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:43,093
Absolutely.

1687
01:19:43,094 --> 01:19:44,494
Merry Christmas.

1688
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:45,828
Well, thank you.

1689
01:19:45,829 --> 01:19:48,170
Same to you.

1690
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:52,102
You know, Spivak.

1691
01:19:52,103 --> 01:19:53,753
You've got a real good boy here.

1692
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:55,838
He sure looks up to you.

1693
01:19:55,839 --> 01:19:57,724
You oughta be real proud of him.

1694
01:19:57,725 --> 01:19:58,741
I am.

1695
01:19:58,742 --> 01:20:00,577
I am.

1696
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:04,447
Thanks, Max.

1697
01:20:04,448 --> 01:20:07,417
Well, I will never forget tonight.

1698
01:20:07,418 --> 01:20:10,153
Oh, it was special for all of us.

1699
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:11,321
Good luck, Max.

1700
01:20:11,322 --> 01:20:12,222
Thank you.

1701
01:20:12,223 --> 01:20:13,290
Later, dude.

1702
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,407
Hey, dude.

1703
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:17,827
I've got something for you, lil' dude.

1704
01:20:17,828 --> 01:20:19,596
Merry Christmas.

1705
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:21,098
Whoa!

1706
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:22,265
Thanks, Max.

1707
01:20:22,266 --> 01:20:23,133
Yeah.

1708
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:25,802
Thanks, Max.

1709
01:20:25,803 --> 01:20:27,470
Merry Christmas.

1710
01:20:27,471 --> 01:20:30,407
Merry Christmas to you sweetheart.

1711
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,709
Say hi to your mom for me, huh?

1712
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,244
I'll do that.

1713
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:35,946
Merry Christmas.

1714
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,717
Bye, Max.

1715
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:43,259
Merry Christmas.

1716
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:49,626
What do you say we hit the donut shop?

1717
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:51,294
You buying?

1718
01:20:51,295 --> 01:20:53,296
<i>Nah, its my treat this time, boys.</i>

1719
01:20:53,297 --> 01:20:55,015
And I hope you aren't busy tomorrow afternoon.

1720
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,268
Come over to my place for
my family Christmas barbecue.

1721
01:20:58,269 --> 01:20:59,736
Roger that, chief.

1722
01:20:59,737 --> 01:21:01,238
And thank you.

1723
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:03,673
That's a big, 10-4.

1724
01:21:03,674 --> 01:21:05,842
Merry Christmas, ya'll.

1725
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:08,111
<i>[together:]</i> Merry Christmas.

1726
01:21:08,112 --> 01:21:09,746
Merry Christmas.

1727
01:21:09,747 --> 01:21:10,680
Well.

1728
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:12,983
Guess I'll lock up the shop.

1729
01:21:12,984 --> 01:21:17,166
Meet you over there.

1730
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,406
Wake up, wake up!

1731
01:21:36,407 --> 01:21:37,525
Wake up, wake up!

1732
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:38,675
It's Christmas!

1733
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:42,859
It's Christmas!

1734
01:21:44,798 --> 01:21:45,748
Look.

1735
01:21:45,749 --> 01:21:47,334
Santa did not forget us.

1736
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,551
A new skateboard.

1737
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:50,453
Dakind!

1738
01:21:50,454 --> 01:21:52,622
Look at these clubs.

1739
01:21:52,623 --> 01:21:55,892
And panda play-pal!

1740
01:21:55,893 --> 01:21:58,561
Mom, what did Santa bring you?

1741
01:21:58,562 --> 01:21:59,796
Oh, honey.

1742
01:21:59,797 --> 01:22:02,065
Santa's brought me plenty.

1743
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:04,967
They don't deliver these things on Christmas.

1744
01:22:04,968 --> 01:22:07,203
Hum?

1745
01:22:07,204 --> 01:22:10,425
It's got your name on it.

1746
01:22:17,831 --> 01:22:20,183
The Bailey account.

1747
01:22:20,184 --> 01:22:21,584
I'm hired.

1748
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:22,785
I'm hired.

1749
01:22:22,786 --> 01:22:23,720
Yea, mom.

1750
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:25,902
That's great, honey.

1751
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,562
Whoa!

1752
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:34,281
Everybody, check this out!

1753
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:39,285
What is it?

1754
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,472
A white Christmas.

1755
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:43,840
A white Christmas--

1756
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:45,942
Just what you wanted, honey.

1757
01:22:45,943 --> 01:22:47,744
It's a Miracle.

1758
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:51,314
I thought you said you
didn't believe in miracles.

1759
01:22:51,315 --> 01:22:53,583
Well, I didn't believe in Santa Claus either.

1760
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:56,453
But I do now.

1761
01:22:56,454 --> 01:23:00,923
Merry Christmas, honey.

1762
01:23:00,924 --> 01:23:02,959
<i>[radio announcer:]</i> Merry Christmas, everyone.

1763
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,462
