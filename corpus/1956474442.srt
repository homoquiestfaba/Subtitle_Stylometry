1
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,963
Hey! Kid!

2
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,517
- Is that 422?
- Yeah, man. Good guess.

3
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:49,521
- Who you lookin’ for?
- I’m here. Willie Clark.

4
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:53,364
- Willie Clark, the actor.
- What do you want, Willie?

5
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:58,282
I’m here to do the commercial
for potato chips. Are they inside?

6
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,678
- We got potato chips inside?
- No, we got tortilla chips.

7
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,315
That’s really funny!

8
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,047
It says on the paper 422.

9
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:14,523
“Danzig Advertising Agency.
422 East 43rd Street.” This is West, not East.

10
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:19,124
Is my agent here, Nancy Clark?
She’ll sort it out. I don’t handle the business.

11
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:23,565
This is the west side.
You want the east side. We’re busy.

12
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:28,676
Yeah. Looks like hard work!
When do they give you a break?

13
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:35,361
- Oh, they gave me the wrong address here.
- Hey, Pop!

14
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,597
East is the other way.

15
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:41,840
Don’t tell me.
I’ve lived in New York all my life.

16
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,558
Uncle Willie, you’re 35 minutes late!

17
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,685
I was on time.
The address you gave me was late.

18
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,236
- Come in.

19
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:07,766
Hi. Sorry, everybody.
Thank you for waiting.

20
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:13,877
- Uncle Willie got held up in traffic.
- Yeah. They took $36 AND my wallet.

21
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:16,720
- This is Hal Jenks from the agency.
- Hi.

22
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,845
- And Ricky Gregg.
- Pleased to meet you. Hey, sonny.

23
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:24,239
Could you get me a cup of tea?
Any kind is all right.

24
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,875
Willie, Mr. Gregg is the director.

25
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,676
Oh, sorry.
I thought he had an after-school job.

26
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:35,197
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I used to watch you when I was a kid.

27
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,916
When was that? Ten minutes ago?

28
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:42,397
It shouldn’t take long.
Just read the line for us.

29
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,479
Whatever you say.
Where’s the camera going to be?

30
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:50,357
- There’s no camera. Read the line, that’s all.
- No problem.

31
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,241
You want my coat on or off?

32
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:58,320
I could leave the coat off
and keep the hat on. Whatever.

33
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,797
Keep your hat off,
so we can see your face.

34
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:06,483
- So I should take the coat off.
- I don’t really care about the coat.

35
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:12,836
- I just wanna see your face and hear the line.
- It’s better with just the hat.

36
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,085
- Any time you’re ready.
- Take your hat off, please.

37
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,715
Oh, you want it that way? Sure.

38
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,401
I’ve been eating Crumpies potato chips...

39
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:35,958
Chumpies. Chump...
It’s, er, Chumpies potato chips.

40
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,960
Look, I got a funny idea here.

41
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:43,484
I say “Crumpies potato chips”
and we hear some guy yell “Chumpies”.

42
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,276
So I say, “I’ve been eating
Thumpy’s potato chips.”

43
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:51,725
And the guy yells again,
“Crumpies! Crumpies potato chips.”

44
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:56,005
We get a laugh
and we get in Crumpies three times.

45
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:03,001
- What d’ya think?
- About what?

46
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,045
- The money. How much are they offering?
- Who?

47
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:10,280
The potato chips.
I’m not doing it unless the money is right.

48
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:16,079
You think they’ll hire you? You’re 35 minutes late.
You say Crumpies instead of Chumpies.

49
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:20,399
- You call the director sonny.
- What should I call him? Mr. Sonny?

50
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:25,601
- I’m late for my next appointment.
- He’s telling me what’s funny.

51
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,964
- How many years I’ve been in the business?
- 2.25!

52
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:34,884
Not 225. 44 years!
You learn what makes an audience laugh.

53
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:40,883
- Did I tell you what words are funny?
- 100 times. Words with a K in it are funny.

54
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:44,642
- I’ll tell ya. Words with a K.
- Alka-Seltzer’s funny.

55
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,275
- Alka-Seltzer’s funny.
- Chicken.

56
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,403
- Chicken is funny.
- Pickle.

57
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:54,118
Pickle is funny. It’s gotta have a K.
K is a funny sound.

58
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,755
Ls, Ms and Rs are not funny.

59
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:01,159
- It’s getting cold. Take a cab home.
- A cold cab is funny.

60
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,036
- Lettuce, melons and roses are not funny.
- Taxi!

61
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,243
Taxi is funny.

62
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:10,524
It’s got an X, but an X is like K.

63
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,680
- I’ll call you. I may have something else.
- Cockroach is funny.

64
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:19,363
- Not if you’ve got’em. Only if you say it.
- 78th and Broadway, please.

65
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:22,280
Goodbye, Uncle Willie.
Take care of yourself, OK?

66
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:35,404
I don’t need taxis. Give me my money.

67
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,807
- I hope this isn’t an imposition.
- No.

68
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:11,279
- I told Dad about our phone call.
- They haven’t spoken in eight years.

69
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:15,326
It’s a special opportunity,
unless your father’s dead set against working.

70
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:17,796
Oh, no. He still works, but alone.

71
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:23,087
- With your uncle, he just got tired of fighting.
- Maybe time has mellowed them both.

72
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,717
Dad, this is Nancy Davison.

73
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:32,039
Look, they’re selling a solid gold chain.
Retails at $190.

74
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:37,884
Their price $86.50. I got you
the exact same chain from Morty for $64.

75
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:42,404
He still makes a $32 profit.
Who’s gonna watch a show called "Morty’s"?

76
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:45,479
Dad, this is Nancy Davison, Willie Clark’s niece.

77
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,002
- I’m sorry. Nice meeting you.
- Hi.

78
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,681
- Whose niece?
- Willie Clark’s.

79
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,361
Oh, well, nice to meet you anyhow.

80
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:56,280
Here, why don’t you... grab a chair?

81
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,562
I will see you two later.

82
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:07,886
- Is the chair comfortable?
- The chair? Yeah, feels fine.

83
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,686
Retails on this show $140.

84
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:15,125
Their price $85.
I got the same chair for $12.

85
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,359
- Really? Where?
- The old lady across the street died.

86
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:21,360
- They had a garage sale.
- Are you interested in sales?

87
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:26,157
No, but I don’t like to see people
taken advantage of. See this watch?

88
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,478
- I paid $20 for that watch.
- Really? That’s incredible.

89
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,356
- How much is it worth?
- About $3. They saw me coming.

90
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:38,647
From a kid on the street.
It’s a genuine Rolex but spelt with two Ls.

91
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:43,597
The leather band is rubber. The other day,
the band broke, the watch snapped off.

92
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:49,956
It shot across the room, out the window.
It tells time perfectly, but only in Taiwan.

93
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:54,917
- Isn’t that something?
- Yeah. That’s why I don’t trust many people.

94
00:08:55,087 --> 00:09:01,083
Mr. Lewis, I have always thought of you as one
of the funniest comedians I have ever seen.

95
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,796
- That’s nice of you. Did he tell you to say that?
- No.

96
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:10,280
I remember watching you and Uncle Willie
when I was a girl. You were both wonderful.

97
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,998
You worked as a team.
Was it your idea to be the straight man?

98
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,239
No. He said the jokes before I could get ‘em out.

99
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:24,323
- He had the jokes but you were just as funny.
- Well, I know when to make a face.

100
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:31,279
- So, I suppose you know the reason I’m here.
- Yeah. Is there something else I should know?

101
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:36,237
Basically, I just wanted to talk about
Warner Brothers, the picture and the money.

102
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:39,080
The money’s not important.
The part is important.

103
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,125
- That’s what worries me.
- It’s a wonderful part!

104
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:46,599
The part about working with Willie again.
We didn’t get along too well.

105
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,840
Willie is a changed man now.
He’s not the same person.

106
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,886
I feel sorry for whoever he became.
He hates my guts.

107
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:58,926
- He never said that to me.
- And that’s when we got along.

108
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,762
All he told me was that
you had some occasional differences.

109
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:08,126
Every day was an occasion. He hated me
on holidays, on birthdays, on Tuesdays.

110
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:10,847
He didn’t take off the Fourth of July.

111
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,204
He was a little upset when you decided to retire.

112
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:20,397
I didn’t retire. I had my whole life ahead of me.
I didn’t want HIS whole life ahead of me!

113
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,876
- You know why I quit?
- Not really.

114
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,686
- You can ask me.
- Why did you quit?

115
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:29,283
Because comedy styles change.
We never changed.

116
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:34,840
He liked to do the same old jokes.
The audience said our act along with us.

117
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:39,762
- They laughed, didn’t they?
- It was cold out. What were they gonna do?

118
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:44,443
This time, they’ve written a script for you
by the two best writers in Hollywood.

119
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,840
He won’t say the lines.
He’ll throw in all those old 1963 jokes.

120
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:54,080
‘How’bout those Beatles?
Four bugs who sing and makin’a fortune!’

121
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:58,206
- The Smithsonian Institute has that joke on file.
- That’s not gonna happen.

122
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:03,043
These are young writers.
They started writing for David Letterman.

123
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:07,678
Your Uncle Willie never heard
of David Letterman. He’s too new.

124
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:13,205
Willie’s waiting for the 1942 re-run
of Bob Hope’s Christmas Special from Iceland.

125
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,962
Isn’t that what made you two so funny,
arguing on stage?

126
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:21,040
On stage I didn’t mind.
It started in the dressing room.

127
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:26,235
In 23 years he never once gave me a hello.
I finally figured out why.

128
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,479
- Why?
- Because he couldn’t remember my name.

129
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,196
Can I make a suggestion?
Why don’t you and Willie meet?

130
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:37,280
You can go over the script,
see if you two get along.

131
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,235
If it goes well,
I’ll tell Warner Brothers that we have a deal.

132
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:48,159
- How much money did you say it was again?
- $75,000 apiece.

133
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:54,717
- My agent died, so I don’t pay commission.
- That’s fine.

134
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:58,277
- Maybe I’ll buy you a little gift.
- It’s all right.

135
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:02,679
The money’s not for me.
It goes to my grandson’s college education.

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,600
- Oh, I’d like to meet him.
- Magic? Sure.

137
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,679
- That’s his name? Magic?
- No. His name’s David.

138
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:13,159
His favorite basketball player was
Magic Johnson so he likes to be called Magic.

139
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:16,364
- That’s very sweet.
- It’s better than Shaquille O’Neil.

140
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,964
- We watch sports, we play Nintendo together.
- You play Nintendo?

141
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:24,324
Not well.
A five-year-old comes in to teach me.

142
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:30,357
I think this is gonna work out just fine.
I’m gonna set up a date for you to meet.

143
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:38,600
- I have really enjoyed talking to you, Mr. Lewis.
- No matter how HE feels, I don’t hate him.

144
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,884
- I’m glad.
- I come close, but not all the way.

145
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,959
I must say, you still look so young.

146
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:51,965
Thank you. I lost ten years in the eight years
I haven’t seen him. Look! Loop earrings, $125.

147
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:56,200
- They’re nice.
- You want ‘em. I’ll get ‘em for you.

148
00:12:56,367 --> 00:13:01,487
- Not from this guy, from my friend Morty.
- OK. Well, thank you, Mr. Lewis.

149
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,444
Goodbye.

150
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,319
Hello. Who the hell is this?

151
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:39,004
Why didn’t you say it was the door?

152
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,203
<i>Uncle Willie? It's me, Nancy.</i>

153
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:45,645
Wait a minute!
I’ve been on the phone all morning.

154
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,444
<i>- What’s wrong?
- The door's stuck again.</i>

155
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,486
<i>It's not stuck. Just slide out the latch.</i>

156
00:13:55,647 --> 00:14:00,038
It’s broken. The lock is broken.
You gotta get a locksmith.

157
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:04,041
It’s not broken. It’s the latch.
Slide it out. Don’t force it.

158
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,117
I’m locked in again.
Call 911. They know me there.

159
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,996
Uncle Willie, just slide the latch gently.

160
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,519
Never mind!

161
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,243
You’ve gotta slide the latch gently.
I did it myself.

162
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,956
God, it’s cold!
Don’t they ever send up any steam?

163
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:29,005
In July, in the heatwave, they send up steam.

164
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,327
Did you bring me ‘Variety’?

165
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:37,003
What are you doing? Your doctor said
you’re not supposed to smoke cigars.

166
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,523
- Do you see smoke here?
- But it’s in your mouth.

167
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,565
Right, otherwise I’ll forget how to smoke.

168
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:49,324
- Uncle Willie, I have some very good news.
- The doctor died. I can smoke my cigar!

169
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:55,517
I’ve got you a job. More than a job.
I want you to listen with an open mind.

170
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,520
What is it? A laxative commercial?

171
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:03,807
It’s not a commercial. What have you been
asking me to get you for five years?

172
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:08,563
A 19-year-old red-headed roommate.
Oh, how do you like that?

173
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,366
- Saul Burton died.
- Who’s Saul Burton?

174
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:14,758
Hal Hickey, the comic.
He changed it from Saul Burton.

175
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:19,398
Un-funniest man I ever saw.
Went to Sing Sing to entertain the prisoners.

176
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:23,321
- They threw their Thanksgiving dinner at him.
- Will you please listen?

177
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:28,607
- I just left three clients to come over here.
- That’s four of us out of work.

178
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,281
- How’s Stephen?
- Who’s Stephen?

179
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,642
- Your husband.
- My husband’s Michael.

180
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,766
- Does Stephen know?
- Don’t do comedy routines with me.

181
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,441
- This is serious.
- I get names mixed up.

182
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,839
- One day I call your boy Billy. The next, Bobby.
- His name is Brian.

183
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:50,684
- I was right that he was not a Bobby.
- Why do I only get aggravated up here?

184
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:54,522
- I’ll meet you somewhere else.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

185
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,839
- I don’t think that’s funny.
- If you had a sense of humor you would.

186
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:04,639
- I have a terrific sense of humor.
- Like your father. He laughed once. 1932.

187
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:07,924
- Do you want a cookie?
- No. You shouldn’t either.

188
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:12,126
- They’re full of cholesterol.
- They were made before there was cholesterol.

189
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,317
- So what’s this good news you’ve got for me?
- It’s a movie. A picture.

190
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,559
A major film for Warner Brothers.

191
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,360
- You’re not excited?
- I haven’t heard the plot yet.

192
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,518
Maybe it’s a crowd scene.

193
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:33,124
I’m riding the subway, holding a strap,
all you see is my hand.

194
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:36,245
It’s a featured role, a comedy.

195
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:41,959
A funny sweet romantic poignant comedy -
their big Christmas picture for next year.

196
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,642
God, it’s for kids!
I’m gonna get oatmeal in my face!

197
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:50,483
Some kid making $6 million
is gonna put molasses in my glasses.

198
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:56,324
A featured role! There’s a scene in the hospital.
A little boy’s sick, his parents are divorced.

199
00:16:56,487 --> 00:17:00,639
And his dog got run over.
They’re gonna put the camera on me?

200
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:06,120
The nurses see if they can get a clown,
but all the clowns are working.

201
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:11,645
But there’s a comedy team who haven’t worked
in years, so they send the comedy team.

202
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,082
They do one of their old routines.

203
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:19,958
The head of Warner Brothers personally
asked for you. He saw you when he was a kid.

204
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,357
- The part is yours.
- With Lewis?

205
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:26,566
I read the script. It’s the best scene in the picture.

206
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:30,003
- With Lewis?
- It has to be familiar names,

207
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,317
someone the audience has heard of.

208
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:37,083
- In the ‘60s, nobody was funnier than you two.
- So it is with Lewis?

209
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,319
- Yes.
- Forget it. I’ll wait for the potato chips.

210
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,717
- Can’t we discuss this?
- I’m busy.

211
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,923
- Doing what?
- Not discussing it.

212
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:47,965
Warners is gonna spend a fortune on publicity.

213
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:51,676
- They’ll want you on every talk show.
- With the perverts.

214
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:56,318
With the mother who’s sleeping with their
15-year-old daughter’s husband, who’s 96.

215
00:17:56,487 --> 00:18:00,480
Think about the money.
They’re gonna pay $150,000.

216
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,559
- For me?
- No. You’d split it with Al Lewis.

217
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:09,484
Arnold Schwarzenburger gets $15 million
a picture and his suits don’t even fit.

218
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:12,559
If you turn it down,
they’ll give it to somebody else.

219
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:17,403
I’m not turning it down.
I’m turning it down with him. I told you.

220
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:24,359
I will never work with this man again if he lives
to be 100. If he does, I’m going to 110.

221
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:29,885
Willie, you hardly work at all. Work
is important for your health, your self-esteem.

222
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:34,165
I got so much self-esteem
I don’t have room for it.

223
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:39,959
I have to talk to Warner Brothers.
They want you with Al Lewis. What do I say?

224
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:44,837
- They could postpone the picture till he dies.
- That’s a cruel thing to say.

225
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:49,558
- I’m sorry. I should have whispered it.
- You were great together once.

226
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:56,075
And what did he do? He retired. He quit
to spend time with his family in New Jersey.

227
00:18:56,247 --> 00:19:01,196
If you’re born in New Jersey, you’re already
retired. He quit in the middle of my career.

228
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,518
- I’ll never forgive him.
- Just do this one picture.

229
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:09,203
- Then you can go back to not forgiving him.
- You’re my brother’s daughter.

230
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:15,715
You bring me ‘Variety’, things to eat,
things to throw up, but you mean well.

231
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:21,280
You’re nice to your uncle.
The only thing is, and don’t take this personally,

232
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,757
- you’re a lousy agent.
- Don’t say that, Uncle Willie.

233
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,760
I am one of the best agents in my office!

234
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:32,921
Stomach pains. I come here every Wednesday
and leave with stomach pains.

235
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:37,319
- So come on Tuesdays.
- You’re probably better off with another agent.

236
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:42,163
- I accept your offer.
- You can’t stay like this the rest of your life.

237
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,763
I just had this bath robe cleaned last week.

238
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,520
<i>The answer is still no.</i>

239
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:11,044
You guys see Letterman last night
with Robin Williams?

240
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,563
- God, they were funny!
- These kids today. So quick.

241
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:18,561
- Bing, bang! Everything works.
- Willie didn’t like it. I can tell.

242
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:23,198
- He can’t swallow his sandwich.
- Admit it. Kids today are quicker than we were.

243
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:29,476
- Robin Williams has 23 jokes in one sentence.
- Toilet jokes. Fairy jokes. Prostate jokes.

244
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:33,117
Hemorrhoid jokes.
I never did that stuff. I never will.

245
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:37,075
- Who’s making you an offer?
- The Warner Brothers, that’s who.

246
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,035
Oh! No kidding, Willie.
Which brother are you playing?

247
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,446
I gotta go, guys. Wardrobe fitting.

248
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:51,964
Do you hear, Willie? Murray’s got
a commercial - Chumpies potato chips.

249
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:57,724
I was up for that. They wanted me
to say Crumpies like it was a mistake.

250
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:00,640
I said no. Maybe I was wrong.

251
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:04,163
- Crumpies huh? Should I say it, Willie?
- Couldn’t hurt.

252
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:08,525
- I knew I’d find you here. Can we talk?
- You don’t say hello?

253
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:13,715
These are my friends from the Friars Club.
This is my brother’s daughter, Nancy.

254
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:18,438
She’s an agent. If you’re looking
to quit the business, she can arrange it.

255
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,998
- I’ll see you guys.
- This is important. Can we talk, please?

256
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,476
- Sylvie?
- Yeah.

257
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:31,995
Keep my corned beef sandwich warm. Don’t
lose my place. I know where I was eating it.

258
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,283
He wants to do it, Willie.

259
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:38,645
He wanted to be sure I told you
he carries no grudges.

260
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:42,595
He don’t need grudges.
He got other ways to kill me.

261
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,964
- What do you mean?
- He used to give me the finger.

262
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:50,086
- The what?
- The finger! The finger!

263
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:54,798
On stage. He would poke me
in the arm with his finger.

264
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:59,245
He would say, ‘Listen to me, Willie.’

265
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,682
‘I’m telling ya, Willie.’

266
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:05,157
- ‘Know what I mean, Willie?’
- Ow!

267
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:09,639
Hurts, doesn’t it?
How d’you like to have that for 23 years?

268
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:12,275
My arm was always black and blue.

269
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:16,759
My wife thought it was a tattoo of a finger nail.

270
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:21,045
If you take this job,
I will buy you a padded undershirt.

271
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:26,603
Willie, you shouldn’t eat hot dogs.
There’s tons of sodium in hot dogs.

272
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,361
So I’ll spit out the sodium. Oh!

273
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:33,600
Oh! Do you wanna hear
the other things he did?

274
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,406
He used to spit in my face.

275
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:40,640
On stage! The man would spit in my face.

276
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:44,163
- Not on purpose.
- She tells me not on purpose.

277
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:50,323
- If I could have saved the spit I’d show it to ya.
- He would just spit in your face?

278
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:53,797
You think he’s stupid? He’d work it into the act!

279
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:57,277
He’d stand with his nose on top of my nose

280
00:22:57,447 --> 00:23:01,963
and he would purposely say only words
that began with a T.

281
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:09,203
Tootsie Roll, Tinker Toys, typing on typewriters.
Some nights, I thought I would drown.

282
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:15,158
What if I put in your contract
if he spits at you he has to pay a fine?

283
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:20,560
- He doesn’t care. He’d spit at me for free.
- Then answer one question.

284
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:24,276
Why did you stick together for 23 years?

285
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,358
- Why?
- Yes.

286
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:30,725
Because he was terrific.
There’ll never be another one like him.

287
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:37,076
Nobody could time a joke the way he could
time a joke, or say a line the way he said it.

288
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:43,038
I knew what he was thinking. He knew what
I was thinking. One person was what we were.

289
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:47,439
Oh, no. Al Lewis was the best.

290
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:51,395
- The best, you understand?
- I understand.

291
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:55,082
As a comic, nobody could touch him.

292
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:59,279
As a human being,
nobody wanted to touch him.

293
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,680
Uncle Willie, people do change.
His wife died three years ago.

294
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:09,123
- Mine died ten years ago.
- She didn’t. She divorced you.

295
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:11,005
Same thing.

296
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:16,406
- I asked him to meet you.
- I know what he looks like.

297
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,604
To talk, read the script, see how it goes.

298
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:25,922
Out the window - first his script, then mine,
then he’ll poke me, spit in my face and leave.

299
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,636
He did it to me eight years ago.
He’ll do it again.

300
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,243
- What are all those keys for?
- So I don’t get robbed.

301
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:39,277
If I lost them it would take a burglar a week
to find the right one.

302
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:47,081
This no-good damn door.

303
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:51,320
I’m locked out again.
Go downstairs and get the handyman.

304
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,523
Let’s see if he’s handy.

305
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,803
OK. All right.

306
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:02,995
All right. It was nice seeing you, sweetheart.
Take care. Give my love to Benny.

307
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,957
Brian! And I’m not going anywhere
until you agree to meet with Al Lewis.

308
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,925
- It’s a bad time. I’m busy...
- Uncle Willie!

309
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:14,204
- I’ll meet him on the phone.
- Face to face.

310
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,757
- I’ll sleep on it.
- Then go to bed. I’m gonna call him.

311
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:23,365
We didn’t straighten out the money.
Split it 60-40. I get 60 per cent. He gets 40.

312
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:28,359
- What can he buy in New Jersey anyhow?
- How can you suggest that?

313
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:35,683
Tell him 60-40. I’m the one who’s harder to get.
He wants it so bad, he’ll take what he’s given.

314
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:42,765
- It’s ringing.
- Tell him I’m against this!

315
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:47,557
- That’s the only way I’ll do it, being against it.
- I hope he’s home.

316
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:50,878
- He’s in the garage, practicing spitting.
- Mr. Lewis?

317
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,766
Hi, it’s Nancy Davison.

318
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,963
Nancy, do...

319
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:59,005
- Willie Clark’s niece.
- He forgot already.

320
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:03,160
- His bald spot goes through his brain.
- It’s all right, Mr. Lewis.

321
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:07,445
- Willie said yes.
- Don’t forget the against it!

322
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:12,806
- He’s very anxious to see you again.
- Who’s anxious? He’s anxious, not me.

323
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:18,803
- 70-30. Tell him that’s what I get.
- Er... Monday, at his hotel?

324
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:21,435
Whatever time is convenient for you.

325
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:26,123
- Yeah, 3 o’clock is fine.
- I’m giving a comedy lecture at Columbia.

326
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:30,360
- Make it seven in the morning.
- They’re gonna send you a script.

327
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:36,363
- It’s the scene in the hospital, page 72.
- If he spits or pokes I’m taking him to court.

328
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:43,239
No toy telephones typing on typewriters.
I’m having my lawyer at the rehearsals.

329
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:49,685
Hello, Carol? I’m in the city.
I think I’m a couple of minutes late.

330
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:54,238
No, no. I’m not lost. I’m just trying to get lost.

331
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:59,640
He’s late. He’s purposely coming late
to aggravate me.

332
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:04,961
- He’s not late. It’s two minutes after three.
- What’s that? Early?

333
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:10,440
- You look terrible. Why didn’t you shave?
- For him? Stubble is good enough.

334
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,677
I feel sick.

335
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:21,524
- I think I got hepatitis. Look how green I am.
- You’re making me a nervous wreck.

336
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:27,842
- He chickened out. I get 100 per cent.
- Without him there is no 100 per cent.

337
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,402
That’s him.

338
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:38,244
Maybe you’re right. I think I need a shave.

339
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,762
Willie! Willie!

340
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:51,358
- Hello, Mr. Lewis. How are you?
- Well, we’ll see.

341
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:55,600
- Willie’s inside. He’s just washing up.
- I should hope so.

342
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:59,555
- Any trouble getting in from New Jersey?
- A little bit, yeah.

343
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:03,083
It’s the first time in three years
I’ve been in New York.

344
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:08,685
- Really? How did you find it?
- You pay a toll and go over a bridge.

345
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:12,283
- Is that the script?
- Yeah. I read this last night.

346
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:17,157
- What do you think of it?
- I liked it. Magic read Willie’s part.

347
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:20,239
- That’s sweet. Was he good?
- He was very good.

348
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:24,002
He doesn’t change any lines, so...
Here’s my coat.

349
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,362
I understand.

350
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:30,042
- Let me take...
- Yeah.

351
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,675
Excuse me. I’m just gonna...

352
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:38,322
- Willie, Mr. Lewis is here.
- He knows I’m here.

353
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:42,639
- He’s just trying to remember my first name.
- He’ll be right out.

354
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:46,561
I can’t express how excited I am
about this reunion.

355
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:51,596
Especially for the young people
who’ve not seen Lewis and Clark together.

356
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:55,999
- I wanna say thank you.
- I just hope they won’t be disappointed.

357
00:28:56,167 --> 00:29:00,638
- Oh, they won’t be.
- I know. I’m just saying that.

358
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:11,925
Oh! I didn’t know he was here!
You should have said something.

359
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:16,877
- Willie, you have shaving cream on your face.
- I know. I’m not finished.

360
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,562
- Another ten minutes.
- Wipe it off now. I have to go.

361
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:24,276
- Did you make tea?
- Yes. The kettle’s on the stove.

362
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:26,677
I’m sure it’s still hot.

363
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:34,198
Well, I wish I could stay and watch this.

364
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:37,803
Just the thought of you two working together
makes me laugh.

365
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:43,965
OK, so you have my number
if you need anything, right?

366
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,402
OK, well, goodbye.

367
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,558
Good luck.

368
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:51,161
L-I hope it goes...

369
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,283
OK.

370
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:56,038
Bye.

371
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:04,084
- I’m having tea. Do you want any?
- Tea would be nice, thank you.

372
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:08,320
- How do you take it?
- Without shaving cream.

373
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:20,117
- That’s where you’re gonna sit?
- Why? This is YOUR chair?

374
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:24,838
- They’re all my chairs.
- When I’m through, you can have it back.

375
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:28,044
- What happened to your maid?
- I don’t have one.

376
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:32,166
I can see that.
I just wondered what happened to her.

377
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,523
Say when.

378
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:45,725
- When. When. When.
- That’s all you want?

379
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,482
No, but it’s better than having scalding feet.

380
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:13,125
You don’t have that much water anyway.
You want sugar?

381
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:16,438
- I don’t take sugar. Sugar’s poison.
- Who says?

382
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:20,202
- The AMA.
- Who’s that? The Automobile Club?

383
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:24,838
They send a car for your body
when you die from sugar poisoning!

384
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:27,885
I guess you don’t want a cookie.

385
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:31,198
- What kind?
- Graham, chocolate, coconut, whatever.

386
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,643
- You don’t have a plain cracker?
- Yeah.

387
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:38,800
I have one left from the last time you were here.

388
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:45,315
- Just let me have a plain graham cracker.
- In the kitchen closet, on the top shelf.

389
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,637
Maybe later.

390
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,996
- I was sorry to hear about Dee Dee.
- Thank you.

391
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,761
- She was a nice woman.
- Thank you.

392
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:59,476
Was Dee Dee her name or her initials?

393
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:02,559
Both. Her name was Dee Dee Doris Davies.

394
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:07,762
And you, er... I see you never married again.

395
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,044
Why should I? I’m happy the way I am.

396
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:16,327
- Why would I want to give all this up?
- Shame for some lucky woman!

397
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,722
So, I guess you heard, Saul Burton died.

398
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,679
Really?

399
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:28,920
Oh, my God. I’m sorry to hear that.

400
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,796
- Who’s Saul Burton?
- You don’t remember Saul Burton?

401
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:36,676
Oh, yes, sure! He was the manager
of the Belasco Theatre.

402
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:39,759
Saul Bernstein. That was Saul Bernstein.

403
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:43,886
No, Saul Burton was the manager of the Belasco.

404
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,515
Saul Bernstein was the manager of the Belasco.

405
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:51,283
- And it was the Morosco.
- Sid Weinstein was manager of the Morosco.

406
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:55,281
Saul Burton was manager of the Belasco.
I don’t know who the hell Saul Bernstein was.

407
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:58,280
I just told you who Saul Bernstein was.

408
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:01,245
Saul Burton was Hal Hickey, the comic.

409
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:05,480
- Un-funniest man in show business.
- That Saul Burton? He died?

410
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:09,196
- Ah. Where?
- In ‘Variety’.

411
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:15,562
So you, er, you moved from the other place, huh?

412
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,845
- What other place?
- Didn’t you live in a big suite?

413
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:24,523
This is a big suite,
but they made it into five small suites.

414
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:31,035
For me, the city got too crowded. I live in
a beautiful room with my daughter in New Jersey.

415
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:35,246
- You live in your daughter’s room?
- Do you ever pay attention?

416
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:40,162
I have my own room, bathroom,
credit card, my own friends.

417
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:45,560
All right. I don’t want to hear about
your own underwear and socks.

418
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:51,836
What about this movie? You think we should do it?

419
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:54,840
It’s a nice part. It’s one scene.

420
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,966
The money’s good.
It’s a week’s work. I’m inclined to do it.

421
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:02,915
I’m against it, but if you’re inclined to do it,
I’ll incline too.

422
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,875
If you’re against it, don’t do it.
I don’t need any favors.

423
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:12,440
What do you care if I’m against it?
I want you to know why I’m doing it.

424
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:18,762
I don’t want to sit here, breathing ten-year-old
dust with hot water and a used teabag.

425
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:22,476
- Either you want to or you’re against it.
- How do you want it?

426
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:27,198
‘I’ll do it, but I’m against it?’
Or ‘I’m against it, but I’ll do it?’

427
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,323
Then I’m against it, too.

428
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,523
- But you’re doing it.
- Certainly.

429
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:35,680
- Then it’s a deal.
- And the money goes to my grandchild.

430
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:39,197
- The whole thing?
- Yes. But only if I die.

431
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:43,155
- If I don’t, it’s for my old age.
- Same with me.

432
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:46,842
- You don’t have a grandchild.
- My niece’s son, Baxtor.

433
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:50,926
But we’re wasting time.
Do you want to rehearse the scene?

434
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:54,238
- You’re not against rehearsing?
- I’m against doing the show.

435
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:57,285
Rehearsing is important.

436
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:02,316
- You got your script?
- Certainly. I was up with it all night.

437
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:04,762
Oh. What color is it?

438
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:08,441
It’s white with little black printing.

439
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,680
Where was I reading it? Oh. In the toilet.

440
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,042
I’ll be right back.

441
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,241
All right! OK.

442
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:27,677
OK. I got it.

443
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:36,558
- You wanna start from page one?
- We don’t come on till page 72.

444
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:40,436
- I want to know the story.
- I thought you read it.

445
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:44,998
- I did. It’s good to get a running start.
- You want to run?

446
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:49,638
Jog around your building for 20 minutes.
Come back, we’ll start on 72.

447
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:52,560
All right, all right. I’ll start.

448
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,521
Let’s see.

449
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,999
OK.

450
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,557
Right. Tell me when you’re ready. Are you ready?

451
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:12,323
You want me to shoot a pistol in the air?
Start to read!

452
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:15,524
OK. Here we go.

453
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:21,000
‘Diane, don’t you think I’m as worried
as you are? I’m his grandmother.’

454
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:25,524
‘I started thinking about a grandson
since I gave birth to you.’

455
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:30,238
Wait a minute. This doesn’t sound right to me.
What page are you on?

456
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,797
It doesn’t matter. It matters what page you’re on.

457
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:38,722
- I’m on page 63.
- There’s your trouble right there. Try 72.

458
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:46,804
Ah, there it is. It’s on 72.

459
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,923
Turn to page 72.

460
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:54,764
- I’ve been on 72 since you went to the toilet.
- All right. Page 72.

461
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:57,919
‘Int. A hospital room. Day.’

462
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:02,160
- What is ‘Int.’?
- You know, it’s short for ‘interior’.

463
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:07,321
- Interior what?
- Interior! You know, inside the hospital room.

464
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:10,160
Where else would a hospital room be? Outside?

465
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:14,843
Look, that’s for the cameramen and director,
so they know where it is.

466
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,521
They don’t know where the room is?

467
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:21,123
- Who hired these people?
- The same idiot that hired you.

468
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,643
- You never read a movie script?
- I never made a movie.

469
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:28,356
Me, neither, but I have a brain in my head.

470
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:34,796
- I can see it. It’s coming through your hair.
- Can you just read the part with your name?

471
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:38,403
I’ll read the part with my name.
You’re Phil and I’m Jack.

472
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,162
Phil knocks on the door. Jack says, ‘Come in.’

473
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:45,205
Why am I Phil?

474
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:49,997
Before we begin,
do you have Maalox or something?

475
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,682
Maybe the big extra-strength bottles?

476
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:57,157
- Why? Are ya sick?
- Yeah. In about ten minutes.

477
00:37:57,327 --> 00:38:00,922
The parts are equal.
We got the same amount of jokes.

478
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:04,841
Phil sounds more like you
and Jack sounds more like me.

479
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:08,124
Wait a minute. Let me read Phil.

480
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,721
Phil... Phil...

481
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:21,285
- Phil is crazy.
- I didn’t write it.

482
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:25,486
- You wanna play Jack, play Jack.
- All right. Let me read Jack.

483
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,478
Jack...

484
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:37,041
- Jack is a moron.
- You wanna be crazy or a moron?

485
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:41,325
- I want to be funny.
- It is. One’s crazy and the other’s a moron!

486
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:45,002
You think comedy’s about two Nobel Prize winners?

487
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,557
You’re teaching ME about comedy?

488
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:53,482
- I invented comedy.
- The same night you designed the Titanic!

489
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:58,721
I wanna show you something.
I wrote this after I got dressed this morning.

490
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:01,242
Read it.

491
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:07,521
‘This will never work out.
I give it, the most, 12 minutes.’

492
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:13,159
You wrote this this morning? You didn’t
have the decency to give it a chance?

493
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:17,525
- I could have made a lot of money.
- It’s been more than 12 minutes.

494
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:21,521
All right. Maybe 13.
I can’t tell unless I’m in Taiwan.

495
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:25,965
My daughter’s gonna call
to find out how things are going.

496
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:29,722
Tell her I’m gone. I just need tolls for the bridge.

497
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:34,915
Wait. I promised my niece I’d give it an hour.
We’ll work it out.

498
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:40,559
- It’s gonna happen again in ten minutes.
- You got a note in the other pocket? Sit down.

499
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,685
I won’t stop no more.

500
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:54,438
Do you mind if we switch roles?
I’m not comfortable with Phil.

501
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:58,043
I’m sure Phil will be delighted.
Play whoever you want.

502
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:00,675
All right. You’re Phil. I’m Chuck.

503
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:05,045
- Chuck? What happened to Jack?
- I changed it. Chuck is a funnier name.

504
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:09,439
They’re paying us a lotta money
to play Phil and Jack.

505
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:15,000
We’ll give them back $50. We’ll split it.
What does it say next?

506
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:19,481
Er... Phil is in the hall.

507
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:24,641
Jack is in the room
trying to make the little sick boy smile.

508
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:29,323
- Phil knocks. Jack says, ‘Come in.’
- Chuck says, ‘Come in.’

509
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:34,117
It’s funnier if it’s Chuck instead of Jack?
They don’t know our names yet.

510
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:37,484
It doesn’t make any difference. I FEEL funnier.

511
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:42,641
If you make one more change, I’m chucking
Jack out and Phil’s going home with Al.

512
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,719
Say it, for Pete’s sake. Knock on the door.

513
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:49,641
Knock, knock, knock. Chuck says, ‘Come in.’

514
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:55,962
Wait a minute! You’re not outside.
Go out and knock on the door from the hall.

515
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:59,676
- You can’t pretend that I’m outside the door?
- Sure.

516
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:03,203
I could also make-believe
I’m enjoying this! I’m not.

517
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:08,885
Go outside and knock on the door
like it says, from the hall.

518
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:15,202
OK, but if you change one more word,
I’m gonna publish those notes in a book.

519
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:20,076
<i>- Ready, Chuck?
- Ready. Go ahead.</i>

520
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:23,444
- Knock, knock, knock.
- Damn it!

521
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,917
Don’t say it. Do it.

522
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:31,638
- 80-20, that’s what I should be getting.
- Here it comes.

523
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:36,163
Come in.

524
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:48,320
- I can’t open it. It’s stuck.
- You can’t open a door?

525
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:54,119
Maybe you should be the crazy one
AND the moron. Wait a minute.

526
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:03,481
It’s stuck. You broke it.
Go downstairs, get the janitor.

527
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,525
He’s in the bar across the street.

528
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:17,445
- You probably had it locked from your end.
- Would you please go outside and knock?

529
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:23,079
- I hope I can get out.
- For good would be fine with me.

530
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:26,802
- Ready?
- Yes. I’m ready.

531
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:35,075
Enter!

532
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:41,958
- You’re supposed to say ‘Come in.’
- I like ‘Enter’. It has a ring to it.

533
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:47,599
If it has a ring, why am I knock, knock, knocking?
You weren’t gonna change anything.

534
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:51,476
- One little word. What’s the big deal?
- Jack becomes Chuck.

535
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:53,717
‘Come in’ becomes ‘Enter’.

536
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:58,244
Instead of a Christmas picture
you’ll turn it into a Western submarine musical.

537
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:03,037
- Say the words they’re paying us to say.
- We’re not a team any more.

538
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:07,997
It’s a request from my niece and your grandson.
We’re together but we’re separate.

539
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:12,445
Don’t tell me what to say
and I won’t ask what interiors are.

540
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:17,442
Don’t tell me not to tell you not to say ‘Enter’.
I’m tired of stopping every ten seconds.

541
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:22,283
- You’re starting again with the spitting?
- You’re telling me I can’t talk?

542
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:26,281
You look for words with T in
and spray it on my face.

543
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:30,838
- Words? I can’t even get a cup with tea in it!
- I’m not gonna argue.

544
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:34,124
When you go knock, knock, knock,
I’m saying ‘Enter.’

545
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:39,919
If you don’t like it, you can knock your brains out,
because I’m not gonna open the door.

546
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:43,682
I’ll tell’em to get somebody else to play Harry.

547
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:47,999
- Harry? Who’s Harry?
- I changed it from Phil. It’s a funnier name.

548
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,955
Is this a re-run of ‘This Is Your Life’?
This was my life.

549
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:57,997
- If you say ‘Enter’, I’m coming in with a lawyer.
- You gonna get a lawyer in New Jersey?

550
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:01,443
You’re lucky if a cow comes with ya. That’s funny.

551
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:07,477
Maybe on ‘Grand Ole Opry’ but not in New York.
I’m gonna give you one more chance.

552
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:12,437
- Are you talking to me?
- To Willie, Jack and Chuck. The three of you.

553
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:16,520
- You say ‘Enter’, I say ‘Goodbye’.
- Oh, another goodbye, huh?

554
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:22,045
- Every eight years I get another goodbye.
- Why don’t we make it every 50 years?

555
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,641
If I die, my son’ll say goodbye.

556
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:28,561
The finger? You’re startin’ again with the finger?

557
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:33,596
The next time you give me the finger,
say goodbye to the finger!

558
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,884
- You’re crazy! You can kill somebody with that.
- Somebody?

559
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,005
This is between you, me and the finger!

560
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:44,240
- You’re crazy! You’re a certified lunatic!
- I’m certified, huh?

561
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:47,285
- Any bank will give you cash for it.

562
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:51,804
- It’s my daughter. I told her to call me here.
- That’s my phone.

563
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:55,676
Touch my phone, you’ll touch it with four fingers.

564
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,557
- Hello?
- Is that my daughter?

565
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:02,287
- Oh, how are you?
- Is that my daughter?

566
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:05,996
Would you shut up? Can’t you see I’m talking?

567
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:12,606
Don’t you see that I’m on the phone?
Behave like a human being for five seconds!

568
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:18,717
Doesn’t it occur to you
that maybe I have a life and a family, too?

569
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:21,082
Hello. I’m sorry.

570
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:23,636
Certainly. Of course.

571
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:26,922
It’s your daughter.

572
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:30,682
Hello, Carol.
Oh, Carol. Look, I can’t speak to you now.

573
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:34,920
I can’t talk. Because he’s, you know, C-R-A-Z-Y.

574
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:38,443
Oh, I’m the crazy one, huh?

575
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:40,757
Hey! Hey, daughter!

576
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:43,487
Your father quit on me again.

577
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:47,845
Check his pockets when he comes home.
He’s taking notes on me.

578
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:51,920
You see? He pulled a knife on me. A kitchen knife!

579
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:56,524
It was filthy!
It had peanut butter and jelly stains on it.

580
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,359
What?

581
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,518
She wants to speak to you.

582
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:03,918
- Who is it?
- Princess Diana from England!

583
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:07,682
- You just said it was my daughter!
- I forgot her name.

584
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:11,362
- Carol. Don’t change it to Katie.
- What does she want?

585
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:16,806
She wants you to check the oil in her car!
How do I know what she wants?

586
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,605
Hello?

587
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:21,725
Hello, Carol dear. It’s Willie Clark.

588
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:26,199
- Tell her I’m goin’ home. Maybe in a helicopter.
- Unpleasantness? No.

589
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,165
Stupidity, maybe, but no unpleasantness.

590
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,876
Tell her to call my cleaner.
I want these clothes fumigated.

591
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:37,165
I hoped it would work, too.
I bent over backwards and forwards.

592
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:41,240
- He didn’t bend sideways.
- Tell Magic that he was better than you.

593
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,322
It’s a question of one word, sweetheart.
‘Enter’. That’s all it comes down to.

594
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:51,959
Tell her I’m never leaving New Jersey again.
I’m sorry they built the bridge and the tunnel.

595
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:55,642
Yes, I will. I’ll tell him myself. I promise.

596
00:46:55,807 --> 00:47:00,437
- It was nice talking to you, Clara.

597
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,885
- I said we’d give it one more chance.
- Not if you say ‘Enter.’

598
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:07,515
‘Come in’, I stay. ‘Enter’, I go.

599
00:47:07,687 --> 00:47:10,076
Say it from where you’re standing.

600
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,522
Just ask me knock, knock, knock.

601
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,797
I’ve known you too long, Willie.

602
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:21,720
- I don’t trust you.
- Al.

603
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:25,038
We’ve been friends 24 years.

604
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:28,358
Just ask me knock, knock, knock.

605
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:40,317
Knock, knock, knock.

606
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:43,320
Come in.

607
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:46,479
- Thank you.
- And... enter!

608
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:51,685
I hope you die and they bury you in the interior.

609
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:55,241
Enter! Enter!

610
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,524
This man’s dangerous. You should buy a big dog.

611
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:04,080
Nice seeing ya again.
If you come back, I’ll give you an ‘Enter’!

612
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:07,637
I wish there was reincarnation
and you come back as your roommate.

613
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:13,200
In New Jersey, you can come in.
In New York, you have to enter!

614
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:19,679
- Dad.
- One second. This is my favorite part.

615
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:22,600
- Nancy drove all the way from New York.
- Look.

616
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:28,239
Steve Martin and John Candy. That’s what I call
a team. They respected each other.

617
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:31,763
Look how much fun they have working together.

618
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:34,839
Mr. Lewis, I hate to intrude on you.

619
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:39,478
- I had a long, long talk with Uncle Willie.
- You’re the first one this century.

620
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:46,881
This clicker. $18 I paid. It can click off the
television from under the water in the bath tub.

621
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,641
- I want to apologise to you.

622
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:52,605
- This has been a very difficult day.
- No.

623
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:57,716
The day I swallowed a Szechuan spare rib
was a difficult day.

624
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:03,007
The day it was 12 degrees
and my eyelashes froze was a difficult day.

625
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:07,240
- Today was like the Hundred Years’ War.
- Would you like some tea?

626
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:11,559
Yes. Fill the cup,
and I want my own personal tea bag.

627
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:15,037
- Nancy?
- No, thanks. I’m fine.

628
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:25,163
I know that Uncle Willie
doesn’t always show a lot of tact.

629
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:29,798
If Willie had tact he’d nail it to my head
with a hammer.

630
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,800
I can’t get his voice outta my head.

631
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:38,678
I turned on the car radio, every voice was his.
There was a cat food commercial.

632
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:43,318
He was the cat. A headache commercial.
He was the headache.

633
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:46,320
On WQXR-FM he was singing Rigoletto.

634
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:52,197
Mr. Lewis, the director wants you and Willie
to come to the studio on Monday.

635
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:58,920
- What does he want to ruin a man’s life for?
- He wants to make a test on camera.

636
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:05,640
He’s a very patient man. Tell me what
it will take for you to give it a second chance.

637
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:11,962
An act of Congress. Maybe two
secret service men on the set, or a lion tamer.

638
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:16,439
Look, he was impossible to work with
eight years ago. Now he’s perfected it.

639
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:24,397
He would never tell you, Mr. Lewis. He wants
this job more than you know. He needs it.

640
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:29,038
Not for the money.
He needs to know somebody still wants him.

641
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:32,438
He’s never gonna find it
with a peanut-butter-covered knife.

642
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,919
Well, I tried.

643
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:41,759
I thank you for your patience.

644
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:45,556
I’m just sorry for all the young people
who aren’t gonna have an opportunity

645
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:47,922
to see you two work together.

646
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,796
I understand.

647
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:58,439
It’s just... It’s just, it would be such a shame
if this doesn’t happen.

648
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,121
What if I set up a meeting?

649
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:05,519
Informal - just you and your daughter,
me and Uncle Willie. A social thing.

650
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,837
A lunch at the Friars.

651
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:12,364
And then if nothing works out,
we’ll just say goodbye.

652
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:16,122
Just a lunch. And we split the check.

653
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:18,801
He pays 60 per cent. I pay 40.

654
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:27,598
<i>Wanna look over the menu?
I'm not eating.</i>

655
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,156
You have to eat something.

656
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:33,000
- How about a cup of coffee?
- I’m not drinking.

657
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:36,443
- Will you say hello to him?
- I’m not talking.

658
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:38,996
Maybe a nod. I’ll see.

659
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:44,082
- You’re just gonna sit there?
- I’m not sitting. I’m leaning on the table.

660
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:46,158
They’re here.

661
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:49,205
- Hi.
- I’m not looking.

662
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:52,757
- Hi, Carol. Hi, Mr. Lewis.
- Mr. Clark.

663
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:59,526
- Uncle Willie has a bad throat.
- I haven’t been to the Friars Club in years.

664
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:03,726
- Are you still a member?
- Yeah. Till I die. Then I’ll quit.

665
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,516
- Should we order some lunch first?
- No, we had lunch.

666
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:13,956
Because I thought if things didn’t go too well
it might be dangerous with food on the table.

667
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:16,880
What were you gonna say?

668
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:20,483
- You two wanna go and rehearse?

669
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:26,279
I’ll get to the point. I don’t think that
we should talk anyone into doing anything.

670
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:31,396
I got a call from Warner Brothers
saying that they hope this works out.

671
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:36,766
I told Dad his grandson tells all his friends
who he is, but they’ve never heard of him.

672
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:41,125
- Not to put any pressure on anyone.

673
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:45,724
But really it just comes down to one little word.

674
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:49,846
- Plain simple ‘yes’.
- Dad said he would leave it to me.

675
00:52:50,007 --> 00:52:52,362
Whatever I say he’ll agree to.

676
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:55,644
- So I say yes.
- So do I. I say yes, too.

677
00:52:55,807 --> 00:53:00,358
So, for my daughter, for my grandson,
I say yes, too.

678
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,199
Uncle Willie?

679
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:04,403
- No.
- No?

680
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:08,924
Nobody says yes for me. I say yes for myself.

681
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:12,318
- Yes.
- Good. It’s settled.

682
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:17,003
Tell your uncle that I’ll see him
at the studio on Monday.

683
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:20,876
If you’ll excuse me,
I have a Nintendo lesson at three.

684
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:44,356
- Good luck today, Mr. Clark.
- Thank you.

685
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:47,519
I’ll be here. They didn’t say how long it would be.

686
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:50,884
Maybe you’d better keep the motor running.

687
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:59,316
27 times on the Ed Sullivan show.
18 times on the Mike Douglas show.

688
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,682
- Remember Mike Douglas?
- No.

689
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:05,476
Did his show 18 times. Every hotel in Las Vegas.

690
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:08,844
We opened a show for Mitzi Gaynor.
Remember Mitzi Gaynor?

691
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:11,441
- No.
- We opened a show for her.

692
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:15,395
- Ever hear of Frank Sinatra?
- You opened a show for HIM?

693
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:17,797
No. We opened a door for him!

694
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:21,676
- He told us we were great.
- He is wonderful. Even today!

695
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:25,123
Said that he never laughed so hard
his entire life.

696
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:30,122
- I loved everything he ever sang.
- It’s not about him. It’s about us.

697
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:32,437
Sue, Mr. Clark is here.

698
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:37,079
You still here? I’ll come back when he’s through.

699
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:41,923
- I’ll get right to you, Mr. Clark. Please, sit down.
- It was nice meeting you.

700
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:45,557
If it’s an autograph you want,
don’t be bashful about asking.

701
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:47,763
Oh, I’m not.

702
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:55,557
Now, I know I’ve seen YOU, Mr. Clark.
You do commercials.

703
00:54:55,727 --> 00:55:01,962
- I used to, but my niece represents me now.
- Can I get a tea? My throat’s a little dry.

704
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:07,724
- Or are you gonna put make-up on my tonsils?
- We’ve got some next door. For you, Mr. Clark?

705
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,560
I gotta study my lines.

706
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:16,443
You’d better watch me out there,
because I’m gonna steal the show.

707
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:19,280
Let me know when it happens.
I don’t wanna miss it.

708
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:27,995
I’m ready to do the scene and you have
to send out for tea! Where the hell is she?

709
00:55:32,007 --> 00:55:35,966
We don’t need the tea. We’re making a movie here!

710
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:45,920
- Did somebody slam this door? It won’t open.
- I can’t believe this.

711
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:49,363
- I think I’m putting the ten years back on.

712
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:53,042
Nobody slammed anything. It stuck by itself.

713
00:55:53,207 --> 00:55:57,325
- You bring the door from the hotel?
- It’s locked.

714
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:02,163
It won’t open! Call the director!
Directors know about these things.

715
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:05,322
Why don’t you go downstairs...?

716
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,081
Hi, I’m Willie Clark’s agent.

717
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:11,159
- How are things going?
- They’re rehearsing the scene.

718
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:14,797
- Are there any problems?
- As many as they can find.

719
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:20,280
We’re running out of time. We had three hours
to shoot this. We have 40 minutes left.

720
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:26,079
- It’s just a test. I need to see it on film.
- I just have one question.

721
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:29,842
When I knock,
is he gonna say ‘Come in’ or ‘Enter’?

722
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:32,805
‘Come in.’
‘Enter’ sounds a little Shakespearean.

723
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,277
You only have to tell me once.

724
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:39,678
- So, are we ready to shoot this?
- Ready.

725
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:43,038
- Howie? Let’s do it.
- OK, everyone. This is picture.

726
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:46,517
- Eddie, lock it up.

727
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:49,485
- They seem to be co-operating.
- Wait.

728
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:02,605
Enough, already.
I’m beginning to look like the Revlon girl!

729
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:07,801
Speed. Screen test Lewis and Clark. Take one.

730
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:11,960
- Marker.
- And... action.

731
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:17,087
Hi, kid. How ya doin’?

732
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:21,525
- All right, I guess.
- Hey, cheer up! You know who I am?

733
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:24,406
- No.
- I’m Mr. Sunshine.

734
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,684
I brighten up the place. I’m a volunteer.

735
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:31,476
- What’s a volunteer?
- That’s when you don’t get paid.

736
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,241
It’s like a benefit. So, what’s your name?

737
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:39,276
- Peter. What’s yours?
- Uh, my name? It’s, er... Lucas.

738
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:42,120
No, Frank.

739
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,323
- Frank Lucas.
- Just keep rolling.

740
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:47,604
- So, do you like cards?
- Yeah.

741
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:50,645
- Do you wanna play peanuckle?
- What’s peanuckle?

742
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:54,766
That’s an old game
played with a penny and a nickel.

743
00:57:54,927 --> 00:58:00,320
People used to say,
‘Let’s play Penny and a Nickel. Peanickel?’

744
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:04,605
- ‘Peanuckle.’ That’s how it got its name.

745
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:07,565
Are you expecting somebody, Pauly?

746
00:58:07,727 --> 00:58:10,844
- Peter!
- You’re expecting Peter?

747
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:14,079
- No, I’m Peter.
- Cut.

748
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:17,319
I think the kid got his name wrong.

749
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:22,277
- It’s all right. I do it myself sometimes.
- No. Willie, the boy got it right.

750
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:25,962
- His name’s Peter.
- But we had a funny routine going.

751
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,961
I say, ‘You expecting someone, Pauly?’
He says, ‘Peter.’

752
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:35,520
I say, ‘You’re expecting Peter?’
He says, ‘No. I’m Peter.’ Bing-bang, bing-bang.

753
00:58:35,687 --> 00:58:39,600
- You have any children?
- I got a three-year-old girl.

754
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:44,363
- Lucky if you make her wedding.
- Willie, let’s not add anything.

755
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:48,281
If you make a mistake with the name,
just keep going.

756
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,486
I just wanna let you and Al Lewis
get on camera together.

757
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:56,401
Let’s pick it up from Peanuckle.
That’s how it got its name.’

758
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,445
Screen test. Lewis and Clark. Take two.

759
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:01,916
- Marker.
- And... action.

760
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:06,717
- Peanuckle. That’s how it got its name.

761
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:09,685
- Are you expecting somebody, Peter?
- No.

762
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:12,042
Well, let’s see who it is.

763
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:14,562
Come in!

764
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:17,958
And enter!

765
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:23,043
- I’m lookin’ for a boy named Peter.
- Who are you?

766
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:27,519
I’m Jack, the volunteer.
I’m here to cheer the boy up.

767
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:33,000
I already did it. See? That-a-boy, Paddy.
I think you got the wrong room.

768
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:37,319
- Take the elevator. Get off at the 12th floor.
- There are only ten floors.

769
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:43,198
Then come back as a patient. One sick kid
doesn’t need two people to cheer him up.

770
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:46,962
You go cheer up the people
eating the hospital food.

771
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:53,475
I’ve cheered up 22,000 people over ten years.
I’m ten times funnier than you are.

772
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:56,639
- What did I tell ya about the spitting?
- What?

773
00:59:56,807 --> 01:00:01,881
- You’re spitting your Ts at me again.
- Are you crazy? They have a microphone on.

774
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:06,359
- This’ll be in the film.
- They can cut it out, like I’ll do to your tongue.

775
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,246
OK. Cut.

776
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:19,875
Willie, you can’t make your movie inside my movie.
My movie’s about a sick kid in hospital.

777
01:00:20,047 --> 01:00:23,039
Yours is about two actors
arguing about something from years ago.

778
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:28,122
What? Show me in the script
where it says he spits in my face?

779
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,041
It’s impossible to say Ts without spitting a little.

780
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:37,406
- Then don’t say Ts. Say Ls or Ws.
- Guys, we got a whole scene to do.

781
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:43,039
We can’t get past four sentences at a time.
Can we run it one time without stopping?

782
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:45,482
- I would love to.
- I’ll go on.

783
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,639
But I’m moving to a safer spot.

784
01:00:51,407 --> 01:00:54,319
One more time, folks. Let’s have some bells.

785
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:57,320
- We’re rolling.

786
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,685
- Screen test, Lewis and Clark. Take three.
- And action.

787
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:03,963
Don’t tell me what to do.

788
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,915
- I’m ten times funnier than you.
- In your dreams.

789
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:11,523
In my dreams I’m 20 times funnier.
You’re not even here.

790
01:01:11,687 --> 01:01:16,522
- When you wake up, I’ll talk to you.
- I can make him laugh so he sends for a nurse.

791
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:22,000
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I can’t speak with a mouthful of change.

792
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:25,398
The kid’s hysterical.
Now tell me who the funny one is.

793
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:31,483
The finger? You’re giving me the finger again?
OK. You got the proof on film.

794
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:37,438
In the courtroom, the jury will see
how he spit on me and poked me in the face.

795
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:41,395
- Calm down, please.
- While you’re trying to make a fool of me?

796
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:47,483
- In front of the entire motion picture industry?
- There are six people. You’re a lunatic.

797
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,517
I’m a lunatic, huh? I’m gonna tell you something
I never told you in your entire life.

798
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:56,884
- I hate your guts.
- You told me that on Monday.

799
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,322
Can I have a word with him, please?

800
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:04,280
- Uncle Willie, you have to calm down.
- Everything I do is wrong.

801
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:09,805
He’s trying to get back at me. I won’t
give him the chance. Get somebody else.

802
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:13,164
- Somebody stronger, like the Terminator.
- He planned this!

803
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:19,163
He set me up for eight years, just for this day.
Just to walk out on me again.

804
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:22,319
- I never wanted to do this in the first place.
- Liar.

805
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:25,047
- Mr. Clark!
- His daughter begged me.

806
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:29,678
- On her hands and knees on the phone!
- I could be home playing Nintendo.

807
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:34,238
I could get anybody to play this part.
Does it suit somebody?

808
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,717
He pulled a kitchen knife on me in his apartment.

809
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,482
Filthy, with chunky peanut butter.
It could clog my arteries.

810
01:02:41,647 --> 01:02:45,799
Maybe we’ll get Jerry Lewis.
I only have to teach him a few things.

811
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:50,882
- It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have asked you.
- He thinks I can’t work without him.

812
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:54,164
Maybe his career is over, but not mine.

813
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:58,479
Maybe he’s finished, but not me.
You hear me? Not me!

814
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:00,683
No, sir.

815
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,358
Uncle Willie?

816
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:06,438
Uncle...? Uncle Willie!

817
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:10,276
It’s gonna be all right.
Will you get a doctor, quickly?

818
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:13,723
I don’t need a doctor. I don’t trust ‘em.

819
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:19,644
Don’t talk. Somebody get me a blanket,
please! Quickly, get me a blanket.

820
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:26,281
- Thanks.
- Don’t tell Al.

821
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:28,836
Don’t tell him I fell down.

822
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:34,525
- I don’t want to give him the satisfaction.
- There’s nothing to tell. You’re gonna be fine.

823
01:03:34,687 --> 01:03:38,043
- Chumpies.
- What?

824
01:03:38,207 --> 01:03:42,997
That was the name of the potato chips. Chumpies.

825
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:46,762
You see? I remembered it.

826
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:50,446
Maybe HE’S finished.

827
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:53,075
But I still got it.

828
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:57,485
Here.

829
01:04:13,247 --> 01:04:16,683
If anything happens to him,
I’ll never forgive myself.

830
01:04:16,847 --> 01:04:20,396
- How is he?
- They don’t know. They’re still running tests.

831
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:23,479
I know him. He’s strong as an ox.

832
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:26,366
Anybody who spends his life
doing comedy has to be.

833
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:31,681
- It’s very nice of you to come, Mr. Lewis.
- Don’t tell him I was here.

834
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:35,078
- He’s very proud, you know.
- Yes. I know.

835
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,637
He’s probably telling the nurses
that he has a toothache.

836
01:04:39,807 --> 01:04:42,526
That’s his doctor. I’ll be right back.

837
01:04:42,687 --> 01:04:46,441
- Mr. Lewis, I’m Nancy’s husband, Michael.
- Nice girl. I like her.

838
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:50,725
You know, I’ve decided to, er... get a new agent.

839
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,526
- I may ask her.
- Sure. Why don’t you?

840
01:04:53,687 --> 01:04:58,442
- Hi, I’m Carol.
- I’m sorry. My daughter. Also a very nice girl.

841
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:03,283
He’s all right.
They said he should be home by the weekend.

842
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:05,403
What did I say?

843
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:09,560
They don’t want him to have visitors tonight.
He needs some sleep.

844
01:05:09,727 --> 01:05:13,845
It’s been a long day.
Go home and I’ll call you tomorrow.

845
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:18,444
- It’s a good idea, Dad.
- Would you mind if I... stayed here?

846
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:20,882
It would make ME feel better.

847
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:23,038
Sure. I understand.

848
01:05:23,207 --> 01:05:26,438
This probably isn’t the best time to bring this up,

849
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:29,997
but I don’t think
it’s gonna work out with the picture.

850
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:34,080
Good. If that director still wanted
to work with us, I wouldn’t trust him.

851
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,436
- Good night.
- Good night.

852
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:52,121
You want some coffee, Dad?

853
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:56,075
The man yells at me on stage,
gets a million laughs.

854
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:59,842
Yells at me off stage, gets a heart attack.

855
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:19,523
- Don’t act like you’re asleep.

856
01:06:19,687 --> 01:06:24,966
- I get paid the same whether you’re up or not.
- If I’m up, you talk all day.

857
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:29,518
If I’m asleep, you eat my candy.
Two boxes in two days!

858
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:33,043
- You can’t eat ‘em anyway.
- I’m not fast enough.

859
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:36,085
You’ve got the quickest mouth on the west side.

860
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:40,684
- What am I gonna do with two empty boxes?
- Put ‘em on your feet.

861
01:06:40,847 --> 01:06:43,998
See the flowers? You could eat them, too.

862
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:48,046
- Who sent me that big one?
- There was no card.

863
01:06:48,207 --> 01:06:52,041
- Maybe the White House.
- They don’t sell flowers at the White House.

864
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:55,677
The President invited me to come see him once.

865
01:06:55,847 --> 01:06:58,998
Oh, really?
He give you his address at Gettysburg?

866
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:04,525
- For a nurse, you’re very fast, you know that?
- I give respect when I get respect.

867
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:09,363
Every time I take your pulse, you take mine.
I don’t have a pulse here.

868
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:12,803
I was holding on so I wouldn’t fall off the bed.

869
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:19,076
You’re a very attractive woman. I’d have liked
to have seen you before you ate my candy.

870
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:23,763
Honey, you don’t wanna know
what I got up under this white uniform.

871
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:30,241
Because I don’t just treat heart attacks,
I give heart attacks. Time for your pill.

872
01:07:30,407 --> 01:07:33,479
I’ll take you to lunch. Have a pill with me.

873
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:38,402
Why does a man recovering from an illness
think it’s fine to take liberties with a woman?

874
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:42,446
What are you talking about?
I haven’t taken a liberty in years.

875
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:47,727
I just want you to be sure
that my heart is still beating.

876
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,956
- Is that a good beat?
- Fine.

877
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:53,516
Like Guy Lombardo and his orchestra.

878
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:57,396
- Wanna play peanuckle? Two cents a point.
- I don’t gamble.

879
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:02,766
- If you win, I’ll let you eat the cards.
- I don’t like it when you diss me.

880
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,566
I don’t even know what dissing is.

881
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:09,402
Sometimes, I think I slept through
a whole new language.

882
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:12,843
I’m just trying to be friendly. Are ya married?

883
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:17,046
- My husband passed away four years ago.
- Oh, I’m sorry.

884
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:19,277
You were the nurse?

885
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:24,357
You know, I LIKE you. I really do, Mr. Clark.

886
01:08:24,527 --> 01:08:29,442
‘Cause you got spunk. That’s something missing
from young people today - spunk.

887
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:35,159
But if you spunk me once more,
I’m gonna diss you to death.

888
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,004
Hey, Uncle Willie.

889
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,727
You look absolutely terrific.

890
01:08:48,887 --> 01:08:54,644
I know. I’ve been cutting down on my sweets.
Is that my ‘Variety’?

891
01:08:54,807 --> 01:08:59,039
Yes, and about 100 get-well cards
from all over the country.

892
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:03,598
Shecky Greene, Jackie Mason, Jerry Lewis,
even Carol Burnett.

893
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:05,997
I never met Carol Burnett.

894
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:11,844
- She wished she had you on her show.
- She could put me on one of her re-runs.

895
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:16,239
Joke! How could you be on a re-run
if they already made it?

896
01:09:16,407 --> 01:09:20,195
- I get it, Willie.
- I don’t. Never have, never will.

897
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:24,076
I’m going to lunch. Don’t get up for the bathroom.

898
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:29,685
- Use the you-know-what.
- If not, I’ll go you-know-where.

899
01:09:30,687 --> 01:09:32,598
- Bye.
- Bye.

900
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:38,160
- How do you like that? Bernie Eisenstein died.
- Who’s Bernie Eisenstein?

901
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:41,922
There was a famous dance team -
Ramona and Rodriguez.

902
01:09:42,087 --> 01:09:45,238
Bernie Eisenstein was Rodriguez.

903
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:48,558
Willie, would you put down
your ‘Variety’ for a minute?

904
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:51,082
Did you bring me a cigar?

905
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:53,886
You heard the doctor. No cigars.

906
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,515
No corned beef sandwiches. No cheesecake.

907
01:09:56,687 --> 01:10:00,566
- No more temper tantrums, you understand?
- So what’s left for me?

908
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:03,161
The Oprah Show?

909
01:10:03,327 --> 01:10:05,841
- Willie?
- Ah.

910
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:09,841
- I talked to your doctor this morning.
- Good.

911
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:14,717
I’m gonna have to be
very honest and frank with you.

912
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:17,518
You have to retire, Willie.

913
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:21,804
Give it up. No more show business.

914
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,281
- Until when?
- Until ever.

915
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:32,157
You can’t go walking round New York
in winter looking for work.

916
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:36,718
- Your health is not gonna take it.
- I’ll think it over.

917
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:41,358
There’s nothing to think over.
You can’t work anymore. Do you understand?

918
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:46,282
- You decide for your life. I’ll decide for mine.
- I have to decide, Willie.

919
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:50,440
I am your only living relative.
I am responsible for your welfare.

920
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:55,886
You can’t live here alone. The nurse leaves
in two weeks. Medicare won’t pay any more.

921
01:10:56,047 --> 01:11:01,440
She doesn’t need to get paid.
She eats everything they send up anyway.

922
01:11:01,607 --> 01:11:04,679
There’s something else that I have to tell you.

923
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:07,042
Just happened yesterday.

924
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:12,725
I’m leaving New York. I got a promotion
to head up the Los Angeles office.

925
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:19,918
Michael’s a writer. He can work anywhere.
So we’re gonna be moving in about a month.

926
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:25,320
You think Los Angeles is a promotion?
That’s like being exiled to another country.

927
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:28,399
If Napoleon was alive,
that’s where they’d send him.

928
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:33,322
It has its good points.
Even Brian’s excited about moving there.

929
01:11:35,607 --> 01:11:37,518
What about us?

930
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:44,559
You and me. Does that mean
that you don’t see me anymore?

931
01:11:46,487 --> 01:11:51,003
- Would you really miss me, Uncle Willie?
- It’s not a question of missing you.

932
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:54,477
I just got used to seeing you.

933
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:58,560
That may be the nicest thing
you’ve ever said to me, Willie.

934
01:11:58,727 --> 01:12:01,878
No. I don’t intend to stop seeing you.

935
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:05,483
Michael, Brian and I want you to move with us.

936
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:09,196
We’ve seen houses that we like.
One has a guesthouse.

937
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:12,086
So you can still have your privacy.

938
01:12:12,247 --> 01:12:17,560
What would I do all day? There’s just so long
that you can watch mud slides.

939
01:12:17,727 --> 01:12:22,437
This house is ten minutes from the Friars Club.
Every comic belongs there.

940
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:27,681
You can go for lunch, even do a show
when they roast somebody.

941
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:33,205
They’ve got enough fires out there
to roast everybody. Is this an ultimatum?

942
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:36,086
- Do I get a choice?
- Of going?

943
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:40,604
No. Of who gets the big house
and who gets the guesthouse.

944
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:45,124
I’ll tell you what. We’ll toss a coin
when we get out there.

945
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:50,202
OK, now, there’s one last thing
that I want you to do for me.

946
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,165
- What?
- Promise you won’t get excited.

947
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,522
Tell me, already.

948
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:59,282
Al Lewis wants to come up and see you.

949
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:03,916
If you wanted to kill me,
why didn’t you bring the cigar?

950
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:08,603
- He has been heart-sick since this happened.
- And I got the mumps?

951
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:13,363
Who do you think’s been sending you
the candy and the flowers?

952
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:15,995
He was afraid you’d throw them out.

953
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:18,158
They’re his flowers?

954
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,283
Throw ‘em out!

955
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:24,804
He just wants to say hello.
He’s not going to stay long.

956
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:29,199
If he pokes me in the chest I’m a dead man.
That’s murder one.

957
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:32,598
Spitting at me is murder two and three.

958
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:34,803
Just do this for me, OK?

959
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:39,279
Even if you never speak again, let him say hello.

960
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:42,917
- Let him come. What do I care?
- OK. Thank you.

961
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:49,325
- I don’t know what to say to him.
- Just be friendly and don’t talk show business.

962
01:13:49,487 --> 01:13:53,924
He doesn’t know any other subject.
On ‘Jeopardy’, he’d owe them $50,000.

963
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:58,638
Could you tell Mr. Lewis to come up?
Mr. Clark said it would be fine.

964
01:13:58,807 --> 01:14:03,483
He’s here already? I thought you meant
in the spring or something.

965
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:08,357
- He says it’s all right to come up.
- Take your time. I’ll wait here.

966
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:14,796
- I think this is wonderful of you to do this.
- Didn’t I say that in the car?

967
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:27,763
You’re not supposed to be up.

968
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:32,523
I’m not giving him the satisfaction
of seeing me like a sick man.

969
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:38,080
- I’m gonna sit up, looking better than him.
- You’re not supposed to get up for anything.

970
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:42,365
Lewis coming to apologise to Clark is not anything.

971
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,643
It’s worth getting a heart attack.

972
01:14:44,807 --> 01:14:48,595
He’s not coming to apologise.
He’s coming to say hello.

973
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:53,921
- If he doesn’t apologise, I’ll drop dead for spite.
- What are you doing?

974
01:14:54,087 --> 01:14:56,647
Against the wall. This spot.

975
01:14:56,807 --> 01:15:00,516
I want him to have a long walk
when he comes in.

976
01:15:00,687 --> 01:15:05,841
- Why am I doing this?
- My pillows! My pillows on the chair.

977
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:10,319
I wanna look down on him
when he comes and says he’s sorry.

978
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:13,684
- I’ll get it.

979
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,883
Eight years.

980
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:20,006
Eight years I’ve waited for this to happen.

981
01:15:22,687 --> 01:15:26,077
Hi. Thanks for coming. He’s inside.

982
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:33,999
- If he’s sleeping, I could come back.
- No. He just nods off now and then.

983
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:36,635
- Can I take your coat?
- No, thanks.

984
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:40,880
My daughter’s double parked
in the parking lot, so...

985
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:42,958
Uncle Willie?

986
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:47,518
- Uncle Willie, someone’s here to see you.
- What? Uh?

987
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:53,717
- Look who’s here to see you, Uncle Willie.
- I don’t have my glasses. Who’s that?

988
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:56,447
It’s me, Willie. Al.

989
01:15:56,607 --> 01:16:00,520
- Al who?
- Al Lewis.

990
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:03,884
Al Lewis? Is that you?

991
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:07,676
You’re so far away.

992
01:16:07,847 --> 01:16:12,637
Walk ALL the way over here.

993
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:24,922
Oh! THAT Al Lewis.

994
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:31,687
I don’t want to disturb you, Willie. I...
Very nice flowers. Very beautiful.

995
01:16:31,847 --> 01:16:35,317
- Specially this one.
- I’m gonna throw’em out.

996
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:40,197
They turned bad right away.
People send them with boxes of cheap candy.

997
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:43,040
They mean well.

998
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:48,560
So, um... I just came to say, you know, hello.

999
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:50,922
So, hello.

1000
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:53,521
And, er, you know. Goodbye.

1001
01:16:53,687 --> 01:16:56,485
No, no. Please stay, Mr. Lewis.

1002
01:16:56,647 --> 01:17:00,196
Please. I have to go find the nurse anyway.

1003
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:05,637
It’s... It’s good to see you here.

1004
01:17:06,847 --> 01:17:08,838
Both of you.

1005
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:11,237
Together, I mean.

1006
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:14,046
OK. Bye, Uncle Willie.

1007
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:19,159
Bye.

1008
01:17:21,487 --> 01:17:23,523
Nice girl.

1009
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:29,842
Don’t force it. Slide it.

1010
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,682
So, you got everything you need?
Books? Magazines?

1011
01:17:40,847 --> 01:17:44,840
- I got all my fan mail to answer.
- You get fan mail?

1012
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:49,717
- Sure. Don’t you?
- I don’t even get jury duty.

1013
01:17:49,887 --> 01:17:55,439
- Is it all right for you to sit up and talk like this?
- I’m not. YOU’RE talking.

1014
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:58,360
Is there something special you wanna talk about?

1015
01:17:58,527 --> 01:18:03,123
- Like what?
- How do I know what’s on your mind?

1016
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:07,360
- Do I know why you can’t sleep at night?
- I can’t sleep at night?

1017
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:12,521
- Halfway through ‘Seinfeld’, I’m out like a light.
- You look tired, a little bit troubled.

1018
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:16,362
Like a person who has something
on his conscience.

1019
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:19,837
- I got nothing on my conscience.
- Are you sure?

1020
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:24,205
I got nothing on my conscience.
I’m sorry you got sick.

1021
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:27,723
Thank you. I accept your apology.

1022
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:32,597
- What apology? I didn’t apologise.
- You didn’t just apologise for making me sick?

1023
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:37,966
You made yourself sick. You yelled
like a lunatic and gave yourself a heart attack.

1024
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:40,925
Why did you come with your hat in your hand?

1025
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:45,763
I have a hat but I wouldn’t bring it here.
It costs a fortune to get it cleaned.

1026
01:18:45,927 --> 01:18:52,639
Why did you send me flowers and you didn’t
put your name on it? You were ashamed.

1027
01:18:52,807 --> 01:18:56,720
Only, this time I’m not
even going to accept your apology.

1028
01:18:56,887 --> 01:19:02,564
How do ya like that?
I finally got what I wanted, after eight years.

1029
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:06,242
What? I gave you no apology,
which you didn’t accept.

1030
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:09,763
I don’t want to discuss it any more.

1031
01:19:09,927 --> 01:19:13,761
You know what’s wrong with us, Willie?
Bad chemistry.

1032
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:18,125
- H20 and K17 don’t mix.
- What’s K17?

1033
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:21,597
It’s a sun lotion.
I couldn’t think of anything else.

1034
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:25,521
If we were so wrong,
why did we make people laugh?

1035
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:28,838
Because when two people don’t mix good,
it’s funny.

1036
01:19:29,007 --> 01:19:32,204
When they do mix good, it’s a love story.

1037
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:38,476
You and me as a love story. That’s hysterical.
Romeo and Jennifer.

1038
01:19:38,647 --> 01:19:43,516
- I knew you’d change it.
- Everybody’s got their ups and downs.

1039
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:47,157
In 23 years, we had maybe one ups.

1040
01:19:47,327 --> 01:19:51,081
- I can’t take the downs any more.
- I’m never giving up.

1041
01:19:51,247 --> 01:19:53,522
My career’s picking up again.

1042
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:57,999
- Beginning to weed out some offers now.
- What offers you weeding?

1043
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:02,558
My niece came up with something.
Out of town. Not too hard.

1044
01:20:02,727 --> 01:20:06,800
- Do a show now and then.
- Oh. Wonderful.

1045
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:11,722
- So, what’s with you?
- Good news.

1046
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:16,165
My daughter’s husband, David,
the lawyer, got an offer from a big firm.

1047
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:19,319
- We may have to move out there in July.
- Where?

1048
01:20:19,487 --> 01:20:22,001
The coast, California.

1049
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:26,998
- What part?
- Los Angeles. It’s great.

1050
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:31,126
There’s beach, there’s sun, the Friars Club,
all our old friends.

1051
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:34,597
Hey, God. I got the finger again!

1052
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:38,043
- You got chest pains?
- No, but I’m expecting them.

1053
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:41,279
- You want me to call a doctor?
- He’s downtown.

1054
01:20:41,447 --> 01:20:45,076
- Why did you get sick uptown?
- Wasn’t that from our act?

1055
01:20:45,247 --> 01:20:48,842
I can’t tell the difference
between our act and us anymore.

1056
01:20:49,007 --> 01:20:54,127
You’re a funny man, Al.
A pain in the ass, but a funny man.

1057
01:20:54,287 --> 01:20:57,404
You know what your problem is, Willie?

1058
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,922
You take the jokes too seriously.

1059
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:06,037
They’re just jokes. We did a comedy act
for 23 years, I don’t think you enjoyed it once.

1060
01:21:06,207 --> 01:21:09,404
If I was there to enjoy it, I would buy a ticket.

1061
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:16,677
Well... I’m gonna let you get some rest.

1062
01:21:16,847 --> 01:21:22,399
If you’re ever in Los Angeles,
call me and we’ll see each other.

1063
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:27,357
- You can count on it.
- Unless, of course, I’m too busy working.

1064
01:21:27,527 --> 01:21:31,042
- You’re going back to work?
- Just to keep busy.

1065
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:35,041
- I signed yesterday with a new agent.
- Who’d take you on?

1066
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:41,157
You’d be surprised. Well, I feel good
that we had this talk, don’t you?

1067
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:43,716
Some parts could have been better.

1068
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:48,961
Listen, I’m getting a little tired.
Keep talking to me, I’ll fall asleep.

1069
01:21:56,727 --> 01:22:02,723
It’s funny, when I was driving over the bridge,
I was thinking how we first met, remember?

1070
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:05,685
No. And I’m not anxious.

1071
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:09,965
It was at a benefit at some hotel in Atlantic City.

1072
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:13,563
It was at the veterans’ hospital in Brooklyn.

1073
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:16,685
No. That was the second time we met.

1074
01:22:16,847 --> 01:22:23,320
You asked me, ‘Remember the first time we met?’
The first time was where the second time was.

1075
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:27,275
No. You’re wrong.
The second time was the second time.

1076
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:32,521
The first time was in New Jersey.
The second time was the first time I met Helene.

1077
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:35,884
- Who’s Helene?
- She introduced me to Dee Dee.

1078
01:22:36,047 --> 01:22:37,878
Who cares?

1079
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:42,245
Anyway, it was at a benefit.
I went on third. I was terrific.

1080
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:46,286
Buddy Hackett followed me. He was fantastic.
He brought down the house.

1081
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:51,441
I felt sorry for you having to follow
Buddy Hackett. I thought you were wonderful.

1082
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:55,361
- I understand why you didn’t do too well.
- Who says I didn’t do too well?

1083
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:59,076
I did, just now.
With my spot, you’d have been a smash.

1084
01:22:59,247 --> 01:23:04,116
- You’re reviewing a show I did 28 years ago?
- I’m telling you how we met.

1085
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:08,758
Even though you weren’t a hit,
I knew I wanted to work with you.

1086
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:12,442
<i>- why did you want to work with me?
- You were original.</i>

1087
01:23:12,607 --> 01:23:18,239
<i>A little too crazy, a bit too angry,
but I thought, ‘He's the opposite of me.’</i>

1088
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:23,435
<i>It was my brother's idea. He was still an agent.
Also, he was still alive.</i>

1089
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:28,635
<i>- It's not important. Why argue about it now?
- I'm not. I'm going to sleep.</i>

1090
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:35,201
<i>Your brother was there. I suggested you and I
should team up. He said, ‘Great idea.’</i>

1091
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:39,485
<i>You want to take credit away from a dead man,
do what you want.</i>

1092
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:44,596
<i>- Maybe it's a good idea I'm going to California.
- I hear Scotland is nice.</i>

1093
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:48,840
<i>Anyway, we went for coffee after the show,
talked about teaming up.</i>

1094
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:54,127
<i>- The name Lewis and Clark was a natural.
- I changed it from Lewman and Clewinsky.</i>

1095
01:23:54,287 --> 01:23:59,964
<i>- That's when you started to change names.
- You always have to have the last word.</i>

1096
01:24:00,127 --> 01:24:03,244
<i>- No, I don't.
- See? You just had it.</i>
