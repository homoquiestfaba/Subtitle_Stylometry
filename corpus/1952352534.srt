Melly was 3 when
my daughter Emma died,

564
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,382

that she should raise Melly,

could have done a better job

570
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,811
But I did the best

Can I help you?

922
00:45:55,457 --> 00:45:57,793
Well, I couldn't help
but be a little bit curious

923
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,711
as to why you didn't
come in today,

924

this was the safest place

I'm going to
take you to dinner,

a date,

a date in the sense

a preposterous idea,

01:05:44,215 --> 01:05:46,301
Does it have a name?

1279
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,510
Yeah,

1280
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:50,638
She um,,,

1281
01:05:50,638 --> 01:05:52,640
She's helped me
a lot with my career,

1282
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:58,061
Bruce,
do you have any idea

1283
01:05:58,061 --> 01:06:00,230
what this
does to me?

1284
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:02,399
Yeah, I think I do,

1285
01:06:02,482 --> 01:06:04,609
I think I do, but,,,

1286
01:06:04,609 --> 01:06:06,361
it's not aimed
at you, Mel,

1287
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:08,613
It may not be
aimed at me,

1288
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:10,781
but it hits me,
and it hurts,

1289
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:12,408
Shit!

1290
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:14,368
This means Granny
was right,

1291
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,120
I could just
kill you!

1292
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,454
Just get out!

1293
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,413
O, K,

1294
01:06:20,707 --> 01:06:22,667
Can I ask you
something?

1295
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:24,085
What?!

1296
01:06:24,085 --> 01:06:27,088
I didn't get a chance
to forward my Varieties,

1297
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:30,383
and I need them for audition
notices, Can you hold onto them?

1298
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:31,592
Out!

1299
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:33,219
Thanks,

1300
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,638
Ooh!

1301
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:56,156
Hi,

1302
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:57,491
Remember me?

1303
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:59,159
I'm Patsy,

1304
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:03,705
I don't think I've met
anybody quite like you,

1305
01:07:03,788 --> 01:07:05,248
Patsy Carpenter,

1306
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,042
Why?

1307
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:11,837
A bored, rich
Houston divorcee?

1308
01:07:13,381 --> 01:07:15,257
Oh, well, Ha ha,

1309
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,134
We're not exactly
a rare breed,

1310
01:07:17,259 --> 01:07:20,012
I tend to stay away
from upper class women,

1311
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,180
They scare me,

1312
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:25,934
Make me feel
uncomfortable,

1313
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:27,393
I'm hardly upper class,

1314
01:07:27,435 --> 01:07:30,146
You know, I'm just
a poor little old Texas gal,

1315
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:32,565
Struck oil
at the altar,

1316
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:37,736
Now,,, Aurora,,,

1317
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:39,696
she's upper class,

1318
01:07:39,738 --> 01:07:41,615
Yeah, she is,

1319
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:44,492
Do you feel
uncomfortable with her?

1320
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:46,494
Well, I,,,

1321
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:49,247
I don't know what's going on
with Aurora right now,

1322
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,706
It's...

1323
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:52,958
Well, let's just say
it's complicated,

1324
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:55,753
I'll bet,

1325
01:08:03,009 --> 01:08:04,135
Trouble?

1326
01:08:05,887 --> 01:08:08,681
Well, I'm not really
at liberty to discuss her,

1327
01:08:08,806 --> 01:08:10,600
She is a patient,

1328
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:12,685
Oh!

1329
01:08:12,768 --> 01:08:16,146
The old
doctor/ patient thing,

1330
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:17,106
Yeah,

1331
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,693
But you're not really
a doctor, are you?

1332
01:08:21,818 --> 01:08:24,738
That's right,
I'm not,

1333
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:27,657
But I do try to
follow the rules,

1334
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:29,534
Hear no evil,
Speak no evil,

1335
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:31,285
Do no evil?

1336
01:08:35,414 --> 01:08:37,416
You're fascinating,

1337
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:38,667
No,

1338
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,669
You're fascinating,

1339
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:43,964
It's fascinating,,,

1340
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:47,300
that a man like you should be
sleeping with a woman

1341
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:49,552
who's old enough
to be,,,

1342
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:51,053
your mother,

1343
01:08:53,055 --> 01:08:54,140
Bottoms up,

1344
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:02,564
So what does the rest
of the house look like?

1345
01:09:02,647 --> 01:09:04,649
Why don't you
follow me?

1346
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:09,237
I haven't heard
from Melanie,

1347
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,239
and nothing compels me
to return to my therapist,

1348
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:15,201
I haven't seen much of Patsy,
either, thank God,

1349
01:09:15,242 --> 01:09:17,119
Rosie is becoming
extremely difficult,

1350
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:20,038
I think it might be
because Hector's gone,

1351
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:21,581
That's no great loss,

1352
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:23,083
How can you say that?

1353
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,502
Hector loved you
and you loved him,

1354
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:29,630
If I heard "The military'd
straighten Tommy out" one more time,

1355
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:31,549
I'd have killed him
myself,

1356
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:33,551
Tell me how it works,
Tommy,

1357
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:37,096
When someone that you hate dies,
like the General,

1358
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:41,016
does the hatred that you feel
for that person dissipate,

1359
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:44,436
or do you transfer it
to someone else,,,

1360
01:09:44,436 --> 01:09:45,311
like me?

1361
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:47,230
Would you explain this
to me, please?

1362
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:50,441
Because I do not understand
hatred as a sport,

1363
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:51,817
How does one win?

1364
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:54,862
Hey, eXcuse me,

1365
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:56,655
Sit down,

1366
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:03,036
Now do me a favor,

1367
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:04,996
I enjoy cooking
those brownies,

1368
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:06,331
That is my recipe,

1369
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:09,959
I have spent many years
perfecting it to get it right,

1370
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:12,962
I consider these brownies
to be the finest

1371
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:14,505
in the whole world,

1372
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:17,341
Please do not throw these brownies
away in front of me,

1373
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:20,302
You can take them and throw them
away after I'm gone

1374
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,762
if you want to,

1375
01:10:21,845 --> 01:10:24,889
Just so you know,
I've put a file inside,

1376
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,569
Whatcha got?

1377
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:40,404
Merry Christmas,

1378
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,004
If I could fly
like birds on high

1379
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:45,880
Then straight to
her arms

1380
01:11:46,089 --> 01:11:47,507
I'd go sailing

1381
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:48,716
Jerry,

1382
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:51,636
Jerry,

1383
01:11:51,636 --> 01:11:53,179
Aurora?

1384
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:54,680
Yes,

1385
01:11:54,805 --> 01:11:56,640
Tommy took the brownies,

1386
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:58,308
Ha ha,

1387
01:11:58,392 --> 01:11:59,810
Tommy did what?

1388
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:01,978
He took the brownies,
Ha ha!

1389
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:03,813
That's great,
Hey, I'll be right out,

1390
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,981
O, K,

1391
01:12:19,786 --> 01:12:20,704
Aurora?

1392
01:12:20,746 --> 01:12:22,080
Where are you?

1393
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,540
I'm so glad you came...

1394
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,000
[Wheels
Screech]

1395
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:28,836
Oh, Patsy!

1396
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,254
Oh!

1397
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:32,089
I'm so sorry
I'm a little late,

1398
01:12:32,256 --> 01:12:35,050
Oh, no! Listen,
I was just so glad you called,

1399
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:36,218
Oh, thank you,

1400
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,887
I decided it had just been
too long, you know?

1401
01:12:39,012 --> 01:12:40,597
It's so hot in here,
though,

1402
01:12:40,597 --> 01:12:42,641
Aren't you warm? Whoo!

1403
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:44,100
It's very warm in here,

1404
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:46,519
Could I have some iced-tea,
please? Thank you,

1405
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:48,396
Would you like
iced-tea?

1406
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:52,358
Uh,,,

1407
01:12:52,358 --> 01:12:53,567
Bloody Mary,

1408
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:54,735
Lotsa Mary,

1409
01:12:54,819 --> 01:12:57,696
So now tell me everything
that you've been up to,

1410
01:12:57,696 --> 01:13:00,282
and don't leave out a thing,
I wanna catch up,

1411
01:13:00,407 --> 01:13:02,284
Have you heard
from Melly?

1412
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:03,285
No, Oh... Melly?

1413
01:13:03,285 --> 01:13:04,286
Uh...

1414
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:07,038
Oh, it's Jerry!
Ooh, I see Jerry, One second,

1415
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,956
I will get him
and bring him in,

1416
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,958
My mother'll ask
for Bruckner, Thank you,

1417
01:13:11,042 --> 01:13:11,918

Aurora,

1419
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,420
I'm so glad
you called,

1420
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,214
'cause I have
a big surprise for you,

1421
01:13:17,256 --> 01:13:19,216
Oh, really?
Oh, I revel in surprises,

1422
01:13:19,216 --> 01:13:20,592
Great,

1423
01:13:20,717 --> 01:13:22,469
You remember
my very good friend Patsy?

1424
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:26,431
Of course,

1425
01:13:26,556 --> 01:13:30,309
We met at Melanie's,,,
going-away party,

1426

Hi, Patsy,
How you been?

1427
01:13:33,729 --> 01:13:35,147
Hi, Jerry,

1428
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,732
Sit down, Jerry,

1429
01:13:39,318 --> 01:13:41,153
You'll be
needing this,

1430
01:13:41,236 --> 01:13:44,489
I think you should order
the pasta primavera here,

1431
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:46,866

been fucking?

Aurora, let's get
a couple of things straight,

1439
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,180
You walked out on me,
Talk to me,

1440
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:12,932
Patsy I have to
talk to again,

1441
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,768

that life has dealt me,

in the cards,

1443
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:18,312
Hi, honey!

1444
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:22,315
You must be Aurora,

of scenery,

1470

wouldn't you like
to see some great art?

1473

Oh, a symphony, perhaps,

1474
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,679
We must think
about this, Rosie,

Well, things haven't been
so good around here, lately,

1483
01:16:31,642 --> 01:16:34,186
I felt like
you might want me to go,

he loves me,

to be my age

someone turn to you

1497

"I love you"?

1499

Arthur said that to me,

But he wants me
as I am,

from that,

Oh, Mel!

Well, darling,
the bad experiences

01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,037
are as important
as the good ones,

1513
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,455
I mean,
I was in Jerry's life

1514
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,458
because, apparently,
he needed to work through

1515
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,460
some dreary episode
with his mother,

1516
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,462
And I haven't yet
figured out

1517
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,339
why we're all blessed
with Patsy,

1518
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:24,592
I'm just so disappointed
in myself,

Never allow
disappointment, Mel,

Disappointment
ruins more lives

known to man,

Get back in the saddle
again, honey,

No way, I can't
let this happen again,

I seem to have this pattern
going on here,

1525
01:19:41,316 --> 01:19:43,318
Well, I'm finding
that the only way

1526
01:19:43,318 --> 01:19:47,113
to break bad behavior patterns
is to break them,

1527
01:19:47,113 --> 01:19:49,490
Anyway, Mel,
men come and go,

1528
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:53,202

come and go several times,

do something?

Could we go somewhere?

There is not a generous
tuck in your entire body,

I'm sorry you see
it as meddling,

1646

It's healthier than
your emotional terrorism,

to criticize what I do?

the first shift,

1990
01:52:05,014 --> 01:52:06,683
Go on, Go,

1991
01:52:31,247 --> 01:52:32,915
[Sighs]

1992
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,509
Tommy,

[Mumbling]

1994
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,939
Oh, my God,

1995
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:05,612
This isn't home,

1996
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:25,630
[Sighs]

1997
01:53:30,134 --> 01:53:33,762
Want some tea or something,
like water here?

1998
01:53:33,804 --> 01:53:36,181
Get you hot water
and lemon?

1999
01:53:36,306 --> 01:53:40,769
Patsy,,, always here,

2000
01:53:40,769 --> 01:53:44,439
Don't you have someone
you should be sleeping with?

2001
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:49,444
I want to stay,

2002
01:53:49,569 --> 01:53:51,779
I love seeing you
like this,

2003
01:53:54,657 --> 01:53:56,658
Besides, you're
so much nicer to me,

2004
01:53:56,658 --> 01:53:58,744
now we're
no longer enemies,

2005
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:04,749
Do you remember
I told you some time ago

2006
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:08,920
there are rewards
to having an enemy?

2007
01:54:10,379 --> 01:54:12,757
They can save your life,

2008
01:54:25,435 --> 01:54:26,686
Well,
that may be true,

2009
01:54:30,439 --> 01:54:33,859
But I did something
that I never should have done,

2010
01:54:35,194 --> 01:54:37,738
I made an enemy
of someone I love,

2011
01:54:39,614 --> 01:54:44,160
I was prettier,
younger,

2012
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,745
and richer,

2013
01:54:48,289 --> 01:54:51,667
But you had everything
I ever wanted,

2014
01:54:51,751 --> 01:54:53,335
and I hated that,

2015
01:54:55,546 --> 01:54:57,714
That was wrong
of me,

2016
01:55:01,635 --> 01:55:03,303
I'm sorry,

2017
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,816
Baby doll,
want one of these? Eggnog?

2018
01:55:17,816 --> 01:55:18,734
Yeah, How big?

2019
01:55:18,817 --> 01:55:20,652
That one right there
is yours,

2020
01:55:20,652 --> 01:55:22,612
Thank you very much,
pretty lady,

[Giggles]

2022
01:55:24,781 --> 01:55:27,617
Nutmeg? Um,
or cinnamon?

2023
01:55:27,617 --> 01:55:30,119
Nutmeg or cinnamon,
or one without... whatever you...

2024
01:55:30,161 --> 01:55:31,329
That's nutmeg,

2025
01:55:35,165 --> 01:55:36,708
,,, for the rest
of my life,

2026

[Indistinct Conversation]

2027
01:55:40,879 --> 01:55:43,214
Was she the same way
with you?

2028
01:55:43,298 --> 01:55:45,758
You, you don't
know the intensity

2029
01:55:45,842 --> 01:55:48,803
that I had to deal
with this woman,

2030
01:55:48,845 --> 01:55:50,555
"Melanie, listen to me,"

2031
01:55:54,016 --> 01:55:55,351
Emma,

2032
01:55:56,435 --> 01:55:58,562
Emma,

2033
01:56:00,188 --> 01:56:03,733
Honey, bring them to me,

2034
01:56:06,569 --> 01:56:09,739
No, not just the pink ones,

2035
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:12,992
Bring me all the flowers,

2036
01:56:24,044 --> 01:56:25,003
Granny?

2037
01:56:26,087 --> 01:56:27,630
Granny?

2038
01:56:31,467 --> 01:56:32,635
Aurora?

2039
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:37,431
[Whispering]
Granny?

2040
01:56:37,598 --> 01:56:39,308
Oh, God,

2041

[Crying]

2042
01:56:41,434 --> 01:56:42,394
Aurora?

2043
01:56:42,519 --> 01:56:43,978
What?

2044
01:56:50,568 --> 01:56:53,279
Well, where were you, honey?

2045
01:56:59,201 --> 01:57:00,911
[Whispering]
I was in a place,

2046
01:57:02,913 --> 01:57:04,706
I had a daughter,

2047
01:57:05,832 --> 01:57:08,459
Oh, and I was loved,

2048
01:58:03,593 --> 01:58:05,845
Look, Daddy,
it's Aurora,

2049
01:58:57,518 --> 01:58:59,519
Henry, you're getting
pretty good at this,

2050
01:58:59,519 --> 01:59:02,314
You know, your granny
would be very proud of you,

2051
01:59:02,314 --> 01:59:06,067
I like music,
It's my favorite thing,

2052
01:59:06,109 --> 01:59:08,486
All right, buddy,
Here we go,
