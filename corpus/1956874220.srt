You know, if we'd
grown up together,

348
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,666
He would've been the guy we
would be putting in the trunk

349
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,428
And pushing him down
the basement stairs.

This is a long-lasting product...

364
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,119
He's still trying
to sell the product

365
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,442
The whole time
I'm farting on him.

366

00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,407
Get her done!

369
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,965
Boy, good to see you.
Good to see you.

370
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,668
I had a horrible nightmare
last night.

371
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:52,068
I dreamt I drunk
the world's largest margarita,

372
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:53,933
And woke up this morning,

373
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,510
There was salt
on the toilet lid.

374
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,596
Thank God I didn't eat
the worm in there.

375
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,610
I'll tell you that much.

376
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,250
Boy, that wouldn't have
been good, right there.

377
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:09,471
It was a crazy week.

378
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,586
I called one of them 900
talk-dirty numbers

379
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:12,908
The other day.

380
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,969
You ever call one of them?

381
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:16,111
Yeah!

382
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:18,532
That's it? Two people?
That's it?

383
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,203
And those voices
sounded familiar,

384
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,263
To be honest with you.

385
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,066
Well, don't call.
It's a rip-off.

386
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,308
I got a girl that stuttered,

387
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,769
And it cost me $1700
on that deal.

388
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,138
Can you believe that?

389
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,696
But I love women.

390
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,984
I used to date this one girl

391
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,505
Had one boob
bigger than the other.

392
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,135
And she got
in a wet T-shirt contest

393
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,688
And took first and third place
at that contest.

394
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,223
Bless her heart. I was so proud
of my sister, bless her heart.

395
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,730
That's right.
I used to date this one girl,

396
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,446
Looked like Michelle Pfeiffer,
only a little shorter...

397
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,441
And the face was different.

398
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,478
I was drinking, it looked
like Michelle Pfeiffer.

399
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,161
Next morning,

400
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,575
Barney Pfeiffer's laying there
in the bed next to me.

401
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,065
She was ugly.

402
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,299
I had one girl had a beauty mark
on her cheek.

403
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,508
That was pretty sexy,
like Cindy Crawford.

404
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,590
And we get to kissing and stuff,
I was looking...

405
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,747
It was a tick!

406
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,594
I know. I disappeared like a set
of rims at a Puff Daddy concert.

407
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,792
I'll tell you what,
I was out the door.

408
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:27,849
Out the door.

409
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,408
So I went shopping around today.
Went to the mall.

410
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,269
You ever seen this PETsMART?

411
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,253
The critter store?
You been in there?

412
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,500
You know what they got in there?
A dog water-purifying machine.

413
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,746
You believe that? $75.
Dog water-purifying machine.

414
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:51,833
I'm like, "What's that thing
do right there?"

415
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,863
She says, "It purifies
your dog's drinking water."

416
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,811
"Well, he just ate a turd
10 minutes ago.

417
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,601
You got any turd-purifying
machines in here,

418
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,241
For Pete's sake?"

419
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:03,318
What in the world?

420
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,879
That's like wiping
before you poop.

421
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,564
It don't make sense
to do something like that.

422
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,690
Doesn't make any sense at all.

423
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,079
For Pete's sake.

424
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,064
Then I went in there...

425
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,699
I went in there
to the Victoria's Secret.

426
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,412
You ever been in there?

427
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,436
[WHISTLES]

428
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,158
Yeah. Get her done.
That's right.

429
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,645
That's like a grown-feller
Chuck E. Cheese in there.

430
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,139
I like that joint.

431
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,285
I was there the other day.

432
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,353
I was sniffing around in there
a couple hours...

433
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,930
Looking for some gift ideas.

434
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,839
You know what they got in there?

435
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,201
Underbritches with holes
in the crotch.

436
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:42,924
You believe that?

437
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,372
Twenty-four dollars women paying

438
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
For undershorts with holes
in the crotch.

439
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,470
I'm like, "Dadgum, I got
a whole drawer full of them

440
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:51,792
At the house, for Pete's sake."

441
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:55,609
I bet I'm sitting on $200, $300
worth of them underdrawers.

442
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,859
Dated a girl who
put a pair of them on

443
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,342
For my birthday one time.

444
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,889
I come home,
she's sitting there,

445
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,855
She's like, "You want some
of this right here?"

446
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,874
I'm like, "No, look what it did
to your undershorts."

447
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,923
Good Lord! What in the world?

448
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,307
Looked like a good place
for one of them Plug Ins

449
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,823
Or something, for Pete's sake.

450
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,758
Vanilla Plug Ins or something.

451
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,016
They got all kinds
of stuff out there.

452
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,711
They got this deal now...

453
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,588
Britches you eat. You ever
seen that? Eating britches?

454
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,293
Eating brit... Who in the world
thought of eating britches?

455
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:35,523
"What do you want to do
tonight?"

456
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:37,584
"Let me eat your undershorts.

457
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,314
"Give me a glass of milk.

458
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,688
"I'm going to gobble them up
right here, I tell you.

459
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,290
"Honey, put some
in the refrigerator.

460
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:46,053
I'm going to make
a sandwich later."

461
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,717
I was with a girl
that liked that stuff.

462
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,293
I was seeing this good-looking
girl for about six weeks.

463
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,115
And then somebody took
my binoculars out of the truck.

464
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,794
Yeah, she was a midget stripper.
And... Seriously.

465
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:05,066
I met her at a party one night,
and she popped out of a cupcake.

466
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,446
But anyway, she liked
all them edible underbritches.

467
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,032
And I bought her five pairs

468
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,827
Of the strawberry
eating-britches.

469
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,313
I bought five pair

470
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,665
Because I always end up eating
two or three pair

471
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,466
On the way to her house.

472
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,130
They're pretty good.

473
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,207
Thank God they don't make them
in biscuits and gravy.

474
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,141
I'll tell you that much.

475
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,151
Doggone right. I'd be getting
fat just on undershorts.

476
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,949
Need some SnackWell panties.

477
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,464
That's what they need,
right there.

478
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,226
Get her done. That's right.

479
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,774
"Honey, I'm on a diet.

480
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,322
Put on some
Fruit Roll-Ups, would you?"

481
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:46,148
That's right.

482
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,482
Went in for a checkup
the other day.

483
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:50,978
Doctor stick his finger
up my hind end, all right?

484
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,767
Didn't even tell me,
just does it.

485
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,049
I'm standing there. I'm like,

486
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,964
"Hey, you going to watch
the ball game...?

487
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,800
What in the world?!"

488
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,383
Then he said he found something.

489
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,022
"Found something?

490
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,573
I didn't even know you was
looking for nothing up there."

491
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,842
I'm all bent out of shape.

492
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:10,103
"What in the world's
in my hind end?

493
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,820
"Hope it's the remote control.
I ain't seen it in three weeks.

494
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,910
"Dadgum, no wonder
every time I fart

495
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:19,122
The volume goes up
on that TV set over there."

496
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,343
Found something in my hind end!

497
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,200
That's the worst dentist I've
been to in about five years.

498
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:28,682
I'll tell you straight up.

499
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,503
Tell you straight up.

500
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,613
You know what I used to be?

501
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:33,895
A lot of people don't know it,

502
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,263
But I used to be a real psychic
at fairs and stuff.

503
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,306
You know what I can do?
I was at the fair.

504
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,617
I used to be able to grab on
to girls' boobs...

505
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,605
Seriously...

506
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,432
And tell how old they was
by doing that.

507
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,553
I used to be at the fair.

508
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,163
I had a little stool
right there set up

509
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:50,678
And had some key chains on it.

510
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:52,626
I'd come up,
tell them what I'm doing:

511
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,948
"I can tell how old you are
by rubbing on your boobies."

512
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,911
So I'd be like, "Hold on."

513
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:11,552
I'm like, "You're 33 years old."

514
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,260
She's like,
"You ain't even close."

515
00:24:13,436 --> 00:24:15,476
I'm like,

00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,330
When the how-to-wash tag

686
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:46,853
Is the biggest piece of cloth
on there...

687
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,670
She's just growing up,
and she's smarter than me,

688
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,054
And she's starting
to realize that.

689
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,389
She came home from high school
the other day,

690
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,311
And goes, "Daddy, can you help
me with my math?"

691
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,513
And I said, "Yeah, baby,
let me take a look at it."

692
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:09,218
"When did they start putting
letters with it?"

693
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320
She's got a lot of friends,
which is cool.

694
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,759
She's friends
with the popular kids,

695
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:15,960
She's friends
with the unpopular kids

696
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:16,984
And she's in the middle,

697
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:18,998
Which is where you want
your kid to be, I think,

698
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,960
Until they bring home
one of their friends

699
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,189
You don't see eye to eye with.

700
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,836
Like, she's got a little friend
who's into this goth stuff.

701
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Oh, my God.

702
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,342
Have you seen
these little freaks?

703
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:31,306
What happened?

704
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,078
The black nail polish,
black lipstick,

705
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:37,040
Black eyeliner, black hair,
Liquid-Paper-white face.

706
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:40,538
I'm sorry. Didn't we used
to call that Halloween?

707
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,844
They walked in the front door,

708
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,885
And I looked at that little girl
and just went:

709
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
[LAUGHS]

710
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,997
But it's my daughter's friend.
I'm trying to be nice,

711
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,339
And my daughter said, "Daddy,
this is my friend Lucy."

712
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,934
And I said, "Hey, Luci...

713
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,391
Fer."

714
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,574
She looked at me like,

715
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,711
"I will set you ablaze
right now."

716
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,712
See, nobody tells you
about all that stuff

717
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,736
When you're having kids.

718
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,015
Nobody tells you about the stuff
you never hear about.

719
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,079
Like, nobody told me kids would
get out of their bed

720
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,241
In the middle of the night
and come into your room.

721
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:16,821
My son developed
this really bad habit.

722
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:18,965
He would get out of his bed in
the middle of the night

723
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:20,688
And come to my side of the bed,

724
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,409
And he'd get that close
to my face.

725
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,529
And just stare at me.

726
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,745
You ever get that feeling when
you know you're being watched?

727
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
He'd be like:

728
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,343
[WHISPERS]
"Dad.

729
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:39,867
"Dad.

730
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,283
Dad."
"What? What? What?"

731
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,959
He starts crying.
My wife goes, "You scared him!"

732
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,642
I'm like, "Well, hell,
he scared me!

733
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,251
Jesus, put a bell
around his neck!"

734
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,783
And if I ever find out who told
my son this, I will kill him.

735
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,666
Apparently, somebody told my son

736
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,908
There's a wiener thief
out there.

737
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:06,238
And if he takes his hand off it,
they going to snatch it away.

738
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:09,482
His hand doesn't leave
his pants.

739
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,205
It's like his own
little worry stone.

740
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:13,701
He's just:

741
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,542
I told him. I said,

742
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:24,393
"Boy, that thing's got
a shelf life. Trust me."

743
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,407
Then we had to have
the big talk this year.

744
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:36,589
I was on the road.
My wife called me and said:

745
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,332
"You need to have a talk
with your son."

746
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,594
Ah. Guess he's in trouble.
I said, "What happened?"

747
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,323
She goes, "His friends taught
him how to go on the Internet,

748
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,005
And he brought up
one of those sex sites."

749
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,913
And I said, "Oh, God."

750
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:49,509
I said, "Baby, um...

751
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,871
"did you write down
the name of the site?

752
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:56,883
Just for reference."

753
00:34:57,946 --> 00:34:59,386
She goes, "Shut up."

754
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,975
And I wanted my talk to be more
informative with my son

755
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:05,792
Than my dad's and mine's was.
We didn't have a talk.

756
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
I said, "Dad, when you
going to tell me about sex?"

757
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:11,330
He goes: "Here, just read
this<i> Penthouse Forum."</i>

758
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:13,794
So I wanted my talk

759
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,768
To be a little more informative,
you know?

760
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,264
I wanted my son
to know about things

761
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,879
That could actually happen
to him.

762
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:26,252
I'm still waiting on the VW bus
full of cheerleaders.

763
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,548
But that hasn't happened yet.

764
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,158
But I know that these kids today

765
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,059
Are much more
advanced than you and I were.

766
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:35,421
So I said, "Son, I know you
already know a lot of things.

767
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:36,924
"So why don't you do this:

768
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,525
"Why don't you tell me
what you know,

769
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,700
And then I'll just fill in
the blank spots?"

770
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,002
About 30 minutes later...

771
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,866
I'm sitting there with a pen
and a pad of paper.

772
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,709
"What, you can do that?"

773
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,692
Ah, but God bless my family.

774
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:00,093
They've been good to me
this year.

775
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,334
It's been a rough year on me.

776
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,856
I've been trying
to quit smoking.

777
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,438
I swear to God, it'll kill me
quicker than cigarettes would.

778
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:06,913
And anybody who's ever tried
to quit

779
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,755
Knows exactly
what I'm talking about.

780
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:11,936
It is the hardest thing
you will ever do in your life.

781
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,749
And people who have never smoked
just don't get that.

782
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,468
It's like my wife goes,
"I don't understand

783
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,132
Why you just don't
put them down and quit"

784
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:20,773
I go, "Baby, I am trying.
It is hard."

785
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:22,375
She goes, "I'm sorry, Bill.

786
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,484
I don't understand
why you just don't quit."

787
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,297
And I go, "All right.
Why don't you quit yelling?

788
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,172
Because you can't."

789
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,047
And I've tried everything.

790
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,861
I've tried the gum.
I couldn't keep it lit.

791
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,019
I tried the patches.

792
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,068
They pulled the skin
off my lips.

793
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,430
Finally, my wife goes,
"Why don't you try acupuncture?"

794
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,614
And I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."

795
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,936
I go, "Isn't that where
they screw needles into you?"

796
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,282
She goes, "Yeah."

797
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,879
And I go, "Why don't you try
waking up?

798
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:55,754
I'm not going to let somebody
screw little needles into me."

799
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:58,204
She goes,
"Bill, it's your last option."

800
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,366
So we found this lady,
her name was Dr. Chang.

801
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,175
And I had one question
for Dr. Chang.

802
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,914
Anybody know what that question
might have been?

803
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,018
"Does it hurt?"

804
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:06,173
She goes,

805
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,687
[CHINESE ACCENT]
"Oh, no. It no hurt."

806
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,276
From a door three feet away
from me,

807
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,538
I hear a grown man go,
"Ow! Ow!"

808
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,790
I go, "What was that?"
And she goes, "Oh, he big baby."

809
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:17,796
I said, "I'm a big baby."

810
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:19,553
So, next thing I know,

811
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,468
I'm lying on this bed
in my underwear.

812
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,509
She has screwed a needle
into the top of my head,

813
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:24,858
Three in each earlobe,

814
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,279
One in each pec,
one in each shin,

815
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,780
And three between each
of my toes.

816
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,523
And I'm lying on that bed
thinking,

817
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:32,341
"Dear God, I could use
a cigarette right now."

818
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,556
And I can hear her and her
partner talking in Chinese,

819
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:39,012
But I don't speak Chinese.

820
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,278
And then they start laughing.
I'm like, "Oh, my God!

821
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,822
They're filming this."

822
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,661
So she comes in
at the half-hour mark,

823
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:49,662
And I think she's going
to take the needles out.

824
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,065
No. She puts a cotton ball
on each of the ones in my legs,

825
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,807
Lights it on fire
and leaves the room!

826
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,910
Well, now I'm freaking out, man,
because all I can see

827
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,859
Is smoke drifting up
from between my legs

828
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,568
And I cannot inhale it.
Okey-dokey?

829
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,929
Finally...
Finally, at the hour mark,

830
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,785
She comes in, she takes
the needles out and she goes:

831
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,518
"You come back tomorrow
for another treatment."

832
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,152
I said, "Well, let's just
book that right now.

833
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,525
"Hey, after that,
I'll schedule a prostate exam.

834
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,447
Must be a big old day for me."

835
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,994
So I put my ball cap on,

836
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:25,538
I'm going to go home
and take a shower.

837
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,198
Because I've sweated
through this whole ordeal.

838
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,742
I get home, I'm standing in the
bathroom in front of the mirror.

839
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,304
I took my cap off and I went,
"Ow! Ow!

840
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,886
She left the needle in my head!

841
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:40,601
Oh, man.

842
00:38:41,203 --> 00:38:43,083
I took my family
on an RV trip this last summer.

843
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,238
I thought RV stood for
"Recreational Vehicle."

844
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:47,941
No.
It stands for "Ruins Vacations."

845
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,631
I had never driven
one of these things.

846
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:53,324
Dear God, it's 35 feet long,
8 feet wide,

847
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:55,668
And got two mirrors that stick
out three feet on each side.

848
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:59,627
Good Lord, I was like a
passenger trying to land a 747.

849
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,776
I'm weaving all over the road...

850
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,492
I'm getting flipped off by kids
in car seats, all right?

851
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:11,464
And I don't know why they put
a reverse on these dumb things.

852
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,866
I never learned to back it up.

853
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,101
If I pulled into a Quickie Mart
too far to get gas,

854
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:17,157
Because I pulled too far past
the pump,

855
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,751
There was no backing up.

856
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:22,900
It was: go all the way around
the block and try it again.

857
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,393
Thank God I wasn't the only one.

858
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,542
Sometimes there would be seven
or eight of us

859
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,503
Just circling that Quickie Mart.

860
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,799
Just like a white trash
road race.

861
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,734
I took my family camping
because I'm an idiot.

862
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:41,568
We're going to go camping.
We live in L.A.

863
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,757
We don't have any camping gear.

864
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,132
So I go to this store,
and I'm buying camping gear,

865
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,987
All this stuff,
and I saw this product.

866
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,749
And when I saw it,
I just started laughing.

867
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:52,578
Because we've become
so ecologically minded now,

868
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:54,394
They've developed a product

869
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,109
Called "Rapidly Dissolving
Toilet Paper."

870
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,868
Just how rapidly are we talking?

871
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,731
Because I don't want to have
to play "Beat the Clock"

872
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,581
In the thicket, all right?

873
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,372
If it's dark, I can't see
what's going on down there.

874
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:13,767
I got to know that toilet paper

875
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,409
Is going to be there
to finish the job.

876
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,196
But the reason you do
these things,

877
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,657
The reason you go on these
RV trips and these camping trips

878
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,650
Is because as your kids grow up,

879
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,874
They also grow apart from you,

880
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,356
And it just
tears your heart out.

881
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,870
It's like my little girl,
she's 16.

882
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,046
And she's at that age

883
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,958
Where she's in her room
listening to her stereo

884
00:40:33,982 --> 00:40:35,159
And she's online
with her friends,

885
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,623
And little boys are starting
to call.

886
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:40,182
Oh, my God. We had a kid call
the house at 2 in the morning.

[AUDIENCE MURMURS DISAPPROVAL]

888
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,029
Yeah. Oh, I lost it.

889
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,219
Because first off,
I'm sound asleep in "LaLa Land"

890
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:49,338
With Shania Twain
in the mountains somewhere.

891
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,313
I hear a phone ring
and I'm like:

892
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,148
"Who's got a phone
in the mountains?!"

893
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:56,883
So when I realized
it's my phone,

894
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:59,212
I'm already a little ticked off.
So I went, "Hello!"

895
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:02,172
And this little voice goes,
"Uh, is Emily there?"

896
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:03,640
And I go, "Dude...

897
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,206
"if you have a brain
in your skull,

898
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,402
You will hang this phone up
right now."

899
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:11,594
And my wife goes,
"Bill, you got to be nice."

900
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,967
I said, "No, ma'am,
nice stops at midnight."

901
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,784
Then she said,
"What are you going to do

902
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:19,813
When these little boys
come over the house?"

903
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,008
I said, "Oh, I'll tell you

That's what she puts up with
every day of the year.

00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
We've been married for 20 years,

916
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:08,695
And on our 20th anniversary,

917
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,054
I got to thinking
about the difference

918
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:11,255
Between that first year
of marriage

919
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,379
And that 20th year of marriage.
Wow.

920
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:15,288
Remember that first year
of marriage?

921
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,633
You'd pick a fight just so you
could make up and have sex.

922
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
Twenty years later,
you pick a fight

923
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,095
Just so they'll sleep
in the other room.

924
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,034
Remember that first year
of marriage?

925
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:30,207
You'd come home from work,
you had a bad day at work,

926
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,831
You go, "Oh, baby,
I had such a bad day."

927
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,420
And your new bride would go:

928
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,714
"Let me get you a beer
and you tell me all about it."

929
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:37,704
Twenty years later,
you walk in the door,

930
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,845
"Ooh! What a day at work!"

931
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:42,730
They go, "You want to hear what
went on at this house today?!

932

Remember that first year
of marriage?

934
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:52,265
If you had to go
to the bathroom, Oh, Lord, man,

935
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:53,667
You shut the door, lock it,

936
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:56,228
Turn the faucets on,
turn the shower on.

937

were going poop.

And you're screaming,
"Bring the camera!"

940
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,214
Remember that first year
of marriage, fellas,

941
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:11,918
When your new bride
was going to do laundry

942
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,218
And you freaked out because you
might have had dirty underwear,

943
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:15,362
So you just threw them away?

944
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,069
Twenty years later, you're just
hoping to gross them out.

945

to scream, "Oh, my God!

Did you hit a deer?"

00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,438
Sex changes when you get married

948
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:35,902
And you stay married
for a long time.

I think it has to because
things, they advance, you know?

950
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,186
It's like, one night, my wife
and I had a little interlude,

951
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,269
And it was hot.

952
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,163
I mean hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

953
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,912
She's arching her back
and moaning,

954
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:49,869
And I said, "Yes, ma'am.
You are welcome."

955
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:53,947
I said, "I'm really turning you
on, huh?"

956
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:56,702
She goes, "No, you're on
my hair! Get off!"

957
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,320
You never see that in the
movies, do you, ladies?

958
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,203
That's why I hate love scenes
in movies. They're not real.

959
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,147
You want to show me
a real love scene in a movie,

960
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:10,829
Show me a couple in bed
and their dogs are watching them

961
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,144
At the edge of the bed.

962
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,147
That's real, my friends.

963
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:19,558
You're trying to throw down
your best moves,

964
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:22,718
And there's these eyes at the
edge of the bed,

965
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:24,474
Just like, "Ooooh.

966
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,392
"Nice move there, Bill.

967

Jeez, don't that
hurt your back?"

968
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,673
I take my wife's bra off
and throw it across the room.

969
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,459
Dogs bring it back.

970
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,326
I can always tell when I'm doing
good because the dog growls,

971
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:43,475
Like, "Arrr, arrr, arrr.

972
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:46,198
Oh, she's loving this.
Arrr, arrr, arrr."

00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:50,224
You ever get that cold nose?
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"

to laugh, folks,

And that's what's important.

976
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,445
I'll give you a great example.

Three years ago
on my wife's birthday,

978
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,000
I had it planned to the tee:

979
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,882
A bottle of champagne
chilled by the bed,

980
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:05,178
Candles on the headboard,
some soft music playing,

981
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:07,165
And we just got into it.

982
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,708
Just that hot pig sex,
all right?

983
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,602
You know,
where you're not even talking.

984
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,546
You're just rooting around,
baby.

985
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:16,826
But we forgot about the candles
on the headboard.

986
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,511
I'm lying on my back.

987
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:21,681
Apparently, that headboard
was doing a little moving.

988
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:24,083
Because all of a sudden,
hot wax just goes, "Pwoosh!"

989
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:26,118
And I went, "Aaaaaaah!"

990
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,488
And my wife goes, "Yes, sir.

991
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:32,503
You are welcome."

992
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,140

How did you do that?

00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,241
See what you started?

I like any bait called "Spanky."

1021
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,273
Where might we find
the stink bait?

1022
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:02,582
Does anybody work in this store?

1023

There's got to be a stink
specialist around here.

1024
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,774
We need stink bait.

1025
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:08,714
Stink bait. Do y'all
have stink bait?

1026
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,956
How would you rank the stink?
We want stanky stink.

1027
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,100
Stanky, sure enough
stanky stink.

1028
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:17,443
Probably this, right here.

1029
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,168
That's a good stank right there.
Y'all need to smell that.

1030

Oh, God.

you won't eat any.

1032
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:27,738
No, I ain't eating stink bait.

00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,914

Nope.

1034
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:30,403

00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:32,585
Oh, man! God. No!
He did it.

1036
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:35,935
He did it, he did it.
No! He did it.

00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,860
Apparently, the people
that book these things

1047
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:10,402
Don't get the Weather Channel.
But, uh...

1048
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,571
It's been one of those years
like that for me.

1049
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:14,734
In February, I was doing a show

1050
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,055
In the northern part
of Minnesota.

1051
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:19,892
It was so cold.
A beautiful place.

1052
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,720
It was so cold.
It was like 15 below zero.

1053
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:25,457
And after the show, we were
talking to some guys backstage,

1054
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,760
And they were trying to talk us

1055
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:29,041
Into going ice fishing
with them.

1056
00:48:29,557 --> 00:48:31,167
It's 15 degrees below zero.

1057
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:32,970
I said, "Guys, you know what?
I appreciate it.

1058
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,754
I don't really think
I want to be that cold."

1059
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:37,035
One of the guys goes,
"Oh, it's not that cold."

1060
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,108
He goes, "We build a bonfire
out on the lake."

1061
00:48:42,937 --> 00:48:45,037
And you call us stupid
in the South?

1062
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:48,634
But I got to thinking
about that ice fishing,

1063
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,323
Especially from the point
of view

1064
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:53,433
Of the fish that gets caught
and then thrown back.

1065
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:55,128
Think about it.
In the animal kingdom,

1066
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,582
That has got to be
the closest thing

1067
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,524
To one of those out-of-body
experiences.

1068
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,520
That fish that gets
thrown back, he goes back,

1069
00:49:01,923 --> 00:49:02,923
And he tells his buddies,

1070
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,530
He's like, "Dudes,
I was swimming along,

1071
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:07,661
"and all of a sudden,

1072
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,738
"I felt myself being drawn

00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,806
"And it was getting brighter
and brighter.

1074
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,755
"And then I went
through this opening,

1075
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:19,357
"and I saw my dead relatives
all around me.

1076
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:21,587
"And I saw God.

00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:24,780
"He was wearing a flannel shirt
and a Budweiser hat.

1078
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:29,602
"And He held me and said, 'It's
not yet your time. Go back.'"

1079
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:37,055
And that's been one of the cool
things about doing this tour,

1080
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,971
Is because we've been everywhere
in the country.

1081
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:41,869
You know, and traveling
is never a lot of fun,

1082
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:43,709
But since 9/11
it's so much more difficult.

1083
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,642
In the Atlanta airport...
I live in Atlanta.

1084
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,666
In the Atlanta airport,

1085
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:48,779
You know where you go through
the metal detectors?

1086
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:51,203
They have now built
a giant Plexiglas box

1087
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:54,553
That contains all the things

1088
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:58,047
That are no longer allowed
in your carry-on luggage.

1089
00:49:58,345 --> 00:50:00,685
And in that box,
there is a leaf blower,

1090
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,928
And a Coleman lantern.

1091
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,699

an international yard man

1092
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,815

00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,604
You are S.O.L. right now.

1098
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,826
If your job requires
you use a leaf blower,

1099
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:32,029
And you have to get on an
airplane to get to that job,

1100
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,467
It is really time
to review your territory.

1101
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:41,787
You see a lot of things
in airports.

1102
00:50:42,156 --> 00:50:43,556
They tell us now the economy
is bad.

1103
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:44,838
You see it in the airports.

1104
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,452
Because everywhere we go now,
all the rental car places

1105
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:50,115
Are selling
the used rental cars.

1106
00:50:50,998 --> 00:50:52,838
And I have driven
some bad vehicles in my life.

1107
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,313
I have never been
so desperate for an automobile

1108
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:57,356
I wanted a used rental car.

1109
00:50:58,105 --> 00:50:59,945
Because you know what people do
to rental cars.

1110
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:03,001
My mother will not drive
55 miles an hour.

1111
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,164
You put her in a rental car,

00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,755
She's doing doughnuts in the
grocery store parking lot.

1113
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,827
Buying a used rental car

1114
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,428

Anything that's been driven
that hard by that many people,

1117
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:24,942
You really don't want
to put your key in it.

1118
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,800
There's no incentive
to take care of a rental car,

1119
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,889
Because if you pay
the extra insurance,

1120
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,052
You can total that rental car

1121
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:41,401
And they'll bring you
another one.

1122
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:43,727

additional insurance.

00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,280
And it's funny because...
Like tonight,

1132
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:05,944
You get to meet
a lot of people backstage.

The number one thing people
say to you when they meet you,

00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,888
They're like, "Where do you
come up with material?"

1136
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:13,792
And the honest answer, I think,
at least for us,

1137
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:17,312
Is the best stuff is not stuff
you make up, it's true stuff.

1138
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,033
Now, that being said, I have
to share this story with you.

1139
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:22,347
Last year, I was hosting a show

1140
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,410
For the children's hospital
in Atlanta.

1141
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,345
And a couple came up to me,

1142
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:27,794
And the man said to me,

1143
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,175
"Hey, I bet you done heard
every redneck thing."

1144
00:52:30,865 --> 00:52:32,945
And I was thinking, "Well,
I've heard a lot of them."

1145
00:52:33,267 --> 00:52:35,747
But I love talking to folks, so
I said, "No, no, no. Go ahead."

1146
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,666
He said, "Well..."

1147
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:39,999
He said, "My wife and I decided

1148
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,727
"if we ever had
the chance to meet you,

1149
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,755
"that we had to tell you

1150
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,911
"about the time we were down
at her family's house,

1151
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,492
"and while we were there,

1152
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,561
Her brother got his nipple
bitten off by a beaver."

1153
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:00,645
I said, "You have my attention."

1154
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:03,897
Because it's kind of hard

1155
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,231
To walk away
from a story like that.

1156
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:09,528
You're almost required to say,
"How did that happen?"

1157
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:13,251
Oh, and they were happy
to share the whole tale.

1158
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:15,248
Apparently, the brother
and his buddy

1159
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,352
Were driving down the road,

1160
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:17,736
And a beaver ran
across the street,

1161
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,389
And they accidentally hit it
with the truck.

1162
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:21,133
And then the beaver
went down into the ditch

1163
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:22,415
On the side of the road.

1164
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,703
So they decided they were going
down in the ditch

1165
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:26,648
To find this thing

1166
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,542
Because they wanted
to take it to the taxidermist.

1167
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,617
Because we all know
how pretty they look

1168
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:35,066
On a Thanksgiving dining table
just holding that turkey up.

1169
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,748
So he said he went down in the
ditch. He found the beaver.

1170
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,749
He picked it up by the tail.

1171
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,551
And he said, "Look at it.

1172
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:49,654
It ain't cut up,
or bloody or nothing."

1173
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,657
And apparently, "nothing"

1174
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:56,157
Is the word that brings
a beaver back to consciousness.

1175
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:58,251
And at that point,

1176
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:01,128
The animal lurched out
and bit his nipple off.

1177
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,969
Did not bite it, bit it off.

1178
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,270
O-F-F, off. Bit it off.

1179
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:10,642
That is a new kind of hurt
right there.

1180
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:14,211
And it is so rare,
I am at a loss for words.

1181
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:16,468
The only reply
I could come up with,

1182
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:19,144

That's the other question
I get asked.

1187
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:33,415
People always say:

1188
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:35,953
"When you say somebody might be
a redneck, what do you mean?"

1189
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,870
For the record,
my definition of "redneck":

1190
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,545
It is a glorious absence
of sophistication.

1191
00:54:41,228 --> 00:54:42,228
That's all it is.

1192
00:54:42,396 --> 00:54:44,556
And it can be full-time
or part-time.

1193
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:46,579
Most of us are guilty of it.

1194
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:50,605
And if you're not guilty of it,
you do have relatives that are.

1195
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:53,131
Think back to the last
family reunion you went to,

1196
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:55,073
When at the end of it,
you got in the car

1197
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:58,382
And looked at your spouse
and said, "Oh, my God.

00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:13,992
I got an uncle who, every time
he gets in and out of the car,

1203
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,338
He climbs in through
the driver's side window.

It's a difficult thing

I didn't know that's what I was.

it was oh, so obvious.

I was in the 11th grade,

at her and went:

them things, girl?"

She said, "I bought them."

1291

01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,855
"You know, I've been thinking
about buying me some."

1293
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:07,828

It's because a long time ago
in their lives,

1302
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:44,549

"Hey, why don't we have
children?"

1304
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:50,942

01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,560
Through the mail. Mail order.
You know?

1348
01:02:49,883 --> 01:02:52,878
So the bathing suits arrived.
They're trying them on.

1349
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:55,936
My mother-in-law walks out
in her bathing suit.

1350
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,510
My youngest daughter
looked at her and said:

1351
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:01,105
"Gamma, you shouldn't
draw on your legs

1352
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,121
With a blue magic marker."

1353
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:13,583
Needless to say, I had to mop up
the milk I had been drinking,

1354
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,152
Because it was on the other side
of the room.

1355
01:03:18,812 --> 01:03:22,326
Which is pretty good distance
through your nose. That's right.

1356
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:26,143
That's going to sting
a little while.

1357
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,667
I was doing a thing
not long ago for HBO,

1358
01:03:31,691 --> 01:03:33,811
And they were asking...
It was more serious questions.

1359
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,394
One of them, they said:

1360
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:37,315
"What's your earliest
recollection in life?"

1361
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,177
I thought about it and I said,
"Well, I remember being about 3,

1362
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,493
"and standing on the front seat
of the car with my dad.

1363
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:44,013
"Every time he would turn
the corner,

1364
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:46,557
I would make the sound
of tires squealing."

1365
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,574
[MAKES SQUEALING SOUND]

1366
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:51,528
My dad would go,
"Quit squealing my tires."

1367
01:03:51,645 --> 01:03:52,925
All of a sudden,
it dawned on me.

1368
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:56,389
What was I doing standing
on the front seat of the car?

1369
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,051
See, back in those days,
kids weren't too good

1370
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,560
To go through the windshield
with the rest of the family.

1371
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:04,729
When my kids were 3,

1372
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:06,185
I couldn't back
out of the driveway

1373
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,626
Unless they were in a car seat

1374
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,208
With a shoulder strap
and a safety fit.

1375
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:14,111
Think back. I can vividly recall
riding all the way to Florida

1376
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:16,494
Laying in the back window
of the car.

1377
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:22,775
People behind us going:

1378
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:25,556
"Harold, is that one
of those bobbing dogs?"

1379
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,379
"No. That's a skinny kid
with a big head.

1380
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,426
Boy, what a big head."

1381
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,010
My dad slammed on the brakes,

1382
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:34,580
You went bouncing around the car
like a pinball game.

1383
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:39,866
I remember as a child,
my mom would leave me,

1384
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:42,299
My brother and my sister
in the car

1385
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:44,588
While she ran into
the grocery store.

1386
01:04:44,898 --> 01:04:46,818
If you did that to a poodle now,

1387
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,567
They would fry you
on the 6:00 news.

1388
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:52,437
And I tell you something else.

1389
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,152
Now that I'm grown
and have kids of my own,

1390
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,920
I understand why my mother
didn't want

1391
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,270
To take three young'uns
in the grocery store.

1392
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,352
I would rather take a beating
with a brick stick

1393
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,748
Than take kids
in the grocery store.

1394
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,570
Because soon as those doors
slide open,

1395
01:05:05,919 --> 01:05:06,919
Those kids start begging

1396
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:09,607
Like homeless people at
Christmastime.

1397
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,678
Somebody with little kids,
help me out here:

1398
01:05:13,793 --> 01:05:16,153
The worst aisle to take kids
down in the grocery store is...

1399
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:18,972
The cereal aisle.
Oh, I hate the cereal aisle.

1400
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:22,279
You know why?
Because little kids buy cereal

1401
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:24,669
The same way grown men
buy lingerie.

1402
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,025
They will buy stuff they care
nothing about

1403
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,241
Just to get the prize
that's inside.

1404
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:34,792
And you forget about
the cereal aisle.

1405
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:36,834
You know, you've got them
in the store,

1406
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:39,294
And you're trying to keep them
from putting stuff in the cart.

1407
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:41,438
You turn the corner and there it
is, and they're like:

1408
01:05:41,555 --> 01:05:42,851
"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1409
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:46,238
"You got to buy
the Fruity Frosted Pebbles.

1410
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,937
"You got to buy
the Fruity Frosted Pebbles.

1411
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:48,961
"Oh, please! Please!

1412
01:05:49,228 --> 01:05:50,439
Please buy the Fruity Frosted
Pebbles.

1413
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:51,463
Please, please, please!"

1414
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:52,631
"We are not buying that.

1415
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:54,911
"We bought it before.
You guys didn't even eat it.

1416
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:56,495
It went stale.
We had to throw it away."

1417
01:05:56,937 --> 01:05:57,937
"We'll eat it today.

1418
01:05:58,071 --> 01:05:59,671
"We'll eat it in the car
on the way home.

1419
01:06:00,273 --> 01:06:02,613
I promise. I swear. I promise.
I swear!"

1420
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:04,369
"I said I'm not buying it.
Put it back."

1421
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:08,094
"You got to buy it! You got to
buy it! You got to buy it!"

1422
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:23,940
And that is the point

1423
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,778
When I very calmly walk up
to the child, and I say:

1424
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:30,614
"Where are your parents?"

1425
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,676
Everything has changed.
Even their toys have changed.

1426
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,551
I noticed with my kids now,
every toy they get

1427
01:06:46,853 --> 01:06:47,853
Has got little tags in it

1428
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:49,561
Showing you somebody has
inspected it

1429
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:51,089
To make sure
there's no possible way

1430
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:54,495
A child could hurt themselves
playing with that toy.

1431
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,501
I remember being 9 years old,

1432
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,970
My parents bought me
a wood burning kit.

1433
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:03,977
Hey, what could possibly go
wrong with a toy like that?

1434
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:07,484
A sharp metal stick that heated
up to 5000 degrees.

1435
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:09,494
And I'll tell you something,

1436
01:07:09,876 --> 01:07:12,254
Our dogs and cats didn't have
a little tag around their neck,

1437
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,558
But everybody
in the neighborhood

1438
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:15,373
Knew who they belonged to.

1439
01:07:16,683 --> 01:07:18,123
"The Circle F brand,

1440
01:07:18,317 --> 01:07:20,417
That's a Foxworthy cat
right there."

1441
01:07:24,557 --> 01:07:26,597
You remember
the wood burning kits?

1442
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,737
Remember those?

1443
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:29,801
The cord on it
was about that long.

1444
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:32,008
So you're always guaranteed

1445
01:07:32,032 --> 01:07:35,200
To be right next to the drapes
while you played with it.

1446
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:37,789
What were they thinking,
some of those toys?

1447
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,371
Did anybody else
have the swing set?

1448
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:40,673
My parents were too lazy

1449
01:07:40,874 --> 01:07:42,594
To actually pour the concrete
in the ground.

1450
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:44,342
We had the swing set,

1451
01:07:44,844 --> 01:07:47,284
Every time you swung above this
high, the front legs would go:

1452
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,321
Woooomp. Boom.

1453
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,157
Woooomp. Boom.

1454
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,458
Woooomp. Boom.

1455
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,771
There were stuntmen that would
not swing on our swing set.

1456
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,241
What were they thinking,
some of those toys?

1457
01:08:05,431 --> 01:08:06,431
Lawn Darts.

1458
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,536
Twelve-pound darts!

1459
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:12,649
You could kill an elk
with a Lawn Dart!

1460
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:13,949
And there were no directions.

1461
01:08:13,973 --> 01:08:15,253
They just came in a box
of eight.

1462
01:08:15,641 --> 01:08:17,041
We used to pull them
out of the box,

1463
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:18,763
Throw them straight up
in the air.

1464
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:20,625
You catch one of those
with your head,

1465
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:22,124
You're getting coloring books
for Christmas

1466
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:23,708
For the rest of your life.

1467
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,620
A lot of guys say to me,

1468
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,655
"Man, how you live with all
those women?"

1469
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,897
I love living
with all those women.

1470
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:34,704
Because I've accepted the fact
they just about

1471
01:08:34,728 --> 01:08:36,328
Have got me trained
the way they want me.

1472
01:08:37,063 --> 01:08:38,703
A lot of men go through their
entire lives

1473
01:08:39,132 --> 01:08:40,609
Never realizing
they're being trained.

1474
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,833
Guys, if you got a wife,
girlfriend, mother or daughter,

1475
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,282
You are being trained.

1476
01:08:46,606 --> 01:08:49,371
And just because they ain't
using the cattle prod

1477
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:51,242
Don't mean it ain't happening.

1478
01:08:51,778 --> 01:08:54,298
I been married 18 years
to an awesome girl.

1479
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:57,161
It did not dawn on me
until about year five

1480
01:08:57,917 --> 01:08:58,917
She was training me.

1481
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:00,605
And I remember the night
I realized it.

1482
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:02,906
We were both in bed reading
one night.

1483
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:04,213
And my wife said:

1484
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,391
"I'm hot."

1485
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:09,606
And I closed my book,

1486
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:12,377
Got out of bed,

1487
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,795
Walked over to the wall,
I turned on the ceiling fan,

1488
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,554
I was almost back to the bed
and I went, "Whoa!

1489
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:27,020
I wasn't hot."

1490
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:31,175
I guarantee the next morning
she called her mother and said:

1491
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,190
"Mama, it is working so well.

1492
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:36,414
"Last night, all I had to say
was 'I'm hot, '

1493
01:09:36,856 --> 01:09:38,936
And he got out of bed and turned
on the ceiling fan."

1494
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:42,741
And I'm sure her mother said,
"Baby, I am so proud of you.

1495
01:09:43,163 --> 01:09:45,283
"I'd put your daddy on the phone
and let you tell him,

1496
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,878
"but I just said, 'I'm hungry, '

1497
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:49,831
And he ran into town
to get me something to eat."

1498
01:09:51,137 --> 01:09:53,844
Guys, do you know why
they are able to train us?

1499
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:56,386
They are smarter than us.

1500
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,110
Right. Oh...

1501
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,611
[APPLAUSE]

1502
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:03,393
It ain't that big a deal.

1503
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,228
That's saying you're smarter
than a creature that,

1504
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:07,692
Every time it takes off
its underwear

1505
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,354
It tries to grab them
with its toes,

1506
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,444
Flip them in the air
and catch them with its hand.

1507
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:14,252
You are smarter than that.

1508
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:17,869
It is a good feeling

1509
01:10:17,897 --> 01:10:20,507
When you catch them
on the first try, though.

1510
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,560
Got my underpants, right there!

1511
01:10:26,339 --> 01:10:28,949
Women are smart,
and women keep men confused.

1512
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:32,249
A lot of times, men and women

1513
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:35,198
Can say the exact same thing
to each other,

1514
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,554
And get totally opposite
responses.

1515
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:39,811
Like, a woman can say to a man:

1516
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,073
"I'm not wearing any underwear."

1517
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:44,801
The man's first thought is,
"All right!

1518
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:46,848
Might get lucky."

1519
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,500
But if a man says to a woman,
"I'm not wearing any underwear,"

1520
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,508
Her first thought is:

1521
01:10:51,564 --> 01:10:54,617
"Oh, no! I'm going to have
to wash those pants twice."

1522
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:05,757
And I've found from living
with all these women,

1523
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:07,145
You know, it's funny,

1524
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,540
Men and women worry
about totally different stuff.

1525
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:12,063
I wish I had a dime for every
time in 18 years of marriage

1526
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,091
That my wife has said
this one to me,

1527
01:11:14,487 --> 01:11:16,298
Usually right when we're walking
out of the house,

1528
01:11:16,322 --> 01:11:17,562
She'll go,
"How's my butt look?"

1529
01:11:17,991 --> 01:11:19,791
If you've been married longer
than 10 seconds,

1530
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:21,239
You know the answer to that one.

1531
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,660
"Great!

1532
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:27,477
"You know, it's so small I could
barely see it in this light."

1533
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,994
But apparently,
women put a lot of thought

1534
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,414
Into what their butts look like.

1535
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:34,558
Ladies, do you know men are not
even aware of the fact

1536
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,428
We have a butt
till it starts itching?

1537
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:41,113
And a lot of guys aren't aware

1538
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:44,779
That scratching it in public
might be offensive to somebody.

1539
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,627
"Mr. President, how you doing?
Good to see you."

1540
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:55,514
And men ought to keep our hands
off our rear ends. We should.

1541
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:57,034
For a lot of reasons.
The biggest one

1542
01:11:57,363 --> 01:12:00,013
Is because we are causing
our own butt-erosion.

1543
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,161
We are. Have you ever seen
an old man's butt?

1544
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:05,722
No, you have not, because they
don't have one anymore.

1545
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:08,179
They've scratched it all off.

1546
01:12:09,108 --> 01:12:12,103
An old man's butt looks like
you made a frog stand up

1547
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:14,791
And put on a pair
of double-knit pants.

1548
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:20,251
When you lie down
to go to sleep tonight,

1549
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:22,959
I want that to be the last
visual image.

1550
01:12:23,722 --> 01:12:25,762
That frog pulling
them britches up.

1551
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:40,271
I have lots of theories
about women,

1552
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:42,673
And I'm sure none of them
are right.

1553
01:12:43,009 --> 01:12:45,329
But I found out women have
just as many theories about men.

1554
01:12:46,045 --> 01:12:49,040
Probably the most common theory
women have about men,

1555
01:12:49,182 --> 01:12:50,782
I bet I've heard this one
in every state,

1556
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,562
Goes something like this:

1557
01:12:53,186 --> 01:12:54,986
"Well, if he's got big feet...

1558
01:12:58,224 --> 01:12:59,304
Then you know."

1559
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:01,437
Or if he's got big hands.

1560
01:13:02,362 --> 01:13:03,922
Or if he's got a big nose.

1561
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:06,075
If he's got big ears.

1562
01:13:06,432 --> 01:13:08,152
Well, I tell you what,
he better be packing,

1563
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:11,099
Because that's one
goofy-looking guy right there.

1564
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,888
And, silly as it is, men do
worry about these things.

1565
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:19,871
And ladies, bless your heart,

1566
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:21,857
You have come up with all
these expressions

1567
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:22,961
To reassure us.

1568
01:13:24,183 --> 01:13:25,183
"Oh, honey,

1569
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,107
It's not the size of the ship,
it's the motion of the ocean."

1570
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:32,163
Which might be true,
but I know it takes a long time

1571
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:34,418
To get to England in a rowboat.

1572
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:38,723
Couple of ladies
writing that down,

1573
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:40,476
"Takes a long time to..."

1574
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:43,635
And talking about time,

1575
01:13:44,103 --> 01:13:46,248
That is something else I've
learned in 18 years of marriage.

1576
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:48,312
Guys, when it comes to romance,
don't be in a hurry.

1577
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:51,194
Because women
are like diesel engines.

1578
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:52,991
And what I mean by that is,

1579
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:56,244
It may take a little while to
get them warmed up,

1580
01:13:56,949 --> 01:13:58,101
But once you do,

1581
01:13:58,551 --> 01:14:00,411
They can run a long, long time!

1582
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:07,483
Whereas men, on the other hand,
see, men are more like...

1583
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,108
Bottle rockets.

1584
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,696
Psssssh.

You know, I got to tell you,

This show has been
the most fun thing

1603
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:17,237
I have ever done
in show business, and, uh...

1604
01:15:17,863 --> 01:15:19,783
When we first started
doing this,

1605
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,265
The first night, we had no idea
of how to close it.

1606
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:24,889
And I will tell you this,
when you're a comedian,

1607
01:15:25,137 --> 01:15:27,337
The greatest thrill in the world
is making people laugh.

But it gets your adrenaline
going so much

There's no way you can

At the end of the night.

1611

And so we've all been friends

Just sitting around
and telling stories.

1615
01:15:41,587 --> 01:15:43,307
So we decided, you know what,
that's the way

1616
01:15:43,388 --> 01:15:45,188
We were going to close
this thing every night,

1617
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,690
Is to just come out
and tell stories

1618
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,886
That made each of us laugh

About when you took your sister
to the flea market

1624
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,250
Because she was all bummed out.

1628
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:25,649
My sister is covered with moles.

1629
01:16:29,434 --> 01:16:32,256
She's got moles all over her
face, bunch of moles.

1630
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:35,705
And we used to call her
"Old Moley."

1631
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,802
But she went down to church
and got saved.

1632
01:16:40,112 --> 01:16:41,852
Now we call her "Holy Moley."

1633
01:16:45,084 --> 01:16:47,304
It ain't funny,
to be honest with you.

1634
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,528
But she was feeling bad
about her moles,

1635
01:16:51,924 --> 01:16:54,024
So we figured we'd lift
her spirits.

1636
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,752
Took her up to the flea market
to get her something nice.

1637
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:00,310
And...
We was up there...

1638
01:17:00,632 --> 01:17:02,272
She's already feeling bad
about her moles,

1639
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,541
And then the night before,

1640
01:17:03,903 --> 01:17:06,303
She got this horse
and it busted its leg,

1641
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:08,518
And I had to shoot it.

1642
01:17:08,808 --> 01:17:11,630
And now it's got a broken leg
and a gunshot wound.

1643
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,108
I don't know what you're
supposed to shoot it for, but...

01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:24,532
I guess it helps
in the healing process

01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,176
Or something. I ain't sure.

01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:29,259
If it ain't better by next week,
I'm going to shoot it again,

I'll tell you that much.

01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:33,743
But we's up there
at the flea market...

1649
01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:35,877
My grandma couldn't make it
up there.

1650
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,121
She got arrested
at the bass pro shop.

1651
01:17:39,205 --> 01:17:42,200
She was eating a corn dog
and got the farts in there.

1652
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,595
And they accused her
of stealing a duck call

1653
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:47,677
And some stink bait
at the bass pro shop.

1654
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:56,866
Yeah. It's ridiculous.

1655
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:00,410
She didn't even have any pockets

01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,979
On that nightgown she was
wearing in there.

1657
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:06,797
So we's up at the flea market,

1658
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:10,677
And my sister is feeling bad
about her moles.

1659
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,611
She's complaining all day long
about her moles.

1660
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:16,373
"My moles this. My moles that.
My moles, my moles."

1661
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:19,947
So we walk past this feller
up there at flea market.

1662
01:18:21,546 --> 01:18:22,546
Got no legs.

1663
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:24,927
All right? Selling boots.

1664
01:18:32,057 --> 01:18:35,340
That's right. Got no legs,
half an arm, you know. One ear.

1665
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:37,996
His name was Lucky.

1666
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:46,228
So I told my sister, I said,
"Listen, Dee Wayne." I said:

1667
01:18:52,077 --> 01:18:54,237
"You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

1668
01:18:55,714 --> 01:18:57,226
"You ought to be ashamed.

You ought to be thankful for
everything the Lord give you."

1673
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:12,036
And she said, "You know what?

01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:13,144
"You're right.
I ought to be

1675

Thankful for what
the Lord give me."

1676
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:18,311
She started to get a little
extra hitch in her giddyup.

1677
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:20,631
You know?
Started smiling a little more.

1678
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,135
As soon as we passed
that feller there, with no legs,

1679
01:19:24,243 --> 01:19:25,843
I heard him say to his buddy,
"Good Lord!

1680
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:29,621
Did you see the moles on that
girl's face right there?"

1681
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:32,795
That's right.
True story.

1682
01:19:36,288 --> 01:19:39,514
Larry, thank you so much for
sharing that with everybody.

1683
01:19:40,893 --> 01:19:42,853
Makes you feel better
about your family, don't it?

1684
01:19:43,095 --> 01:19:44,095
Yeah, it really does.

1685
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:46,756
It's kind of like going
to the state fair every time...

1686
01:19:47,299 --> 01:19:49,459
Feel better about
your own relatives.

1687
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:52,735
It's Ron's turn. I'm going to
let you guys pick tonight.

1688
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:54,784
He can either tell...

1689
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,660
Either tell the story about,

1690
01:19:56,842 --> 01:19:58,019
Remember when they put
the BENGAY

1691
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,723
In his grandmother's girdle,

1692
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:04,296
Or the time he got thrown
out of the bar in New York City.

1693
01:20:05,017 --> 01:20:07,117
Oh, yeah. We got
to go with the bar.

1694
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:08,786
New York.

1695
01:20:09,154 --> 01:20:10,594
All right, New York.

1696
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,911
I got thrown out of a bar
in New York City.

1697
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:19,889
Now, when I say I got thrown
out of a bar,

1698
01:20:20,432 --> 01:20:22,772
I don't mean somebody
asked me to leave,

1699
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,375
And we walked
to the door together,

1700
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,698
And I said, "Bye, everybody,
I got to go."

1701
01:20:30,109 --> 01:20:32,509
Six bouncers hurled me
out of a nightclub

1702
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:34,957
Like I was a Frisbee.

1703
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,440
Those big old New York bouncers

1704
01:20:37,616 --> 01:20:40,076
That think bouncing
is a cool job to have,

1705
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:42,545
They just think about bouncing.

1706
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,034
They hang out
with other bouncers

1707
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:45,868
Talking about bouncing.

1708
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:47,798
They go home every night,
watch<i> Road House</i>

1709
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,605
And fondle themselves.

1710
01:20:51,297 --> 01:20:52,593
For wearing a hat.

1711
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:54,742
I walk into a bar with a hat on.

1712
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:57,416
This guy, real pissy, goes,
"Take off the hat!"

1713
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:01,646
And I'm like,
"What's the deal?"

1714
01:21:01,807 --> 01:21:03,407
He goes, "I'll tell you
what the deal is.

1715
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,135
"Gay people in this area
wear hats.

1716
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:08,197
We're trying to keep them
out of our club."

1717
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,613
I was like, "Oh, really?

1718
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:11,401
"The only way we can tell
down in Texas

1719
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:14,427
Is if they have their hair
cut like... yours."

1720
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:22,839
And he got all pissed.

1721
01:21:23,829 --> 01:21:25,509
But he walked away,
and I took the hat off.

1722
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:27,991
And like an hour later,
I'd been drinking and I forgot.

1723
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,140
You ever forget?
It happened to me.

1724
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:34,177
I put the hat back on.
The guy comes over to me.

1725
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,626
Now, I'm between 6'1 " and 6'6",

1726
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,907
Depending on which convenience
store I'm leaving.

1727
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,686
I weigh 230 pounds.

1728
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:50,087
The guy comes over to me,
poking me in the shoulder

1729
01:21:50,289 --> 01:21:52,169
With two fingers and says,
"You're out of here!"

1730
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,011
I'm like, "I don't think so,
Scooter."

1731
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,114
And I was wrong.

1732
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:01,959
They hurled me out of that bar.

1733
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,541
And then they squared off
with me in the parking lot

1734
01:22:04,936 --> 01:22:06,856
And I backed down from the fight

1735
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:08,712
Because I don't know
how many of them

1736
01:22:08,974 --> 01:22:11,014
It would have taken
to whip my ass,

1737
01:22:12,878 --> 01:22:15,398
But I knew how many
they were going to use.

1738
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:29,633
That's a handy little piece
of information

1739
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:31,641
To have, right there.

1740
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,017
Well, they called the police

1741
01:22:33,065 --> 01:22:34,985
Because we broke a chair
on the way out the door,

1742
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,387
And I refused to pay for it.

1743
01:22:36,935 --> 01:22:40,218
I refused to pay for it because
<i>we</i> broke it over<i> my</i> thigh.

1744
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,926
The cops showed up,
and at that point,

1745
01:22:44,576 --> 01:22:46,496
I had the right
to remain silent,

1746
01:22:49,781 --> 01:22:51,581
But I didn't have the ability.

1747
01:22:58,723 --> 01:22:59,883
And the cop says, "Mr. White,

1748
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:02,839
You are being charged
with drunk in public."

1749
01:23:04,496 --> 01:23:07,146
I was like, "Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1750
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,178
"I was drunk in a bar.

1751
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:12,890
"They threw me into public.

1752
01:23:18,143 --> 01:23:20,243
"I don't want to be drunk
in public.

1753
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:22,619
"I want to be drunk in a bar,

1754
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:25,175
"which is perfectly legal.

1755
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:26,850
Arrest them."

1756
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:32,343
Well, he didn't arrest them.

1757
01:23:32,624 --> 01:23:34,344
Instead, he made me do
a field sobriety test

1758
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:36,247
Where you stand on one foot,

1759
01:23:36,528 --> 01:23:38,368
Raise the other foot
six inches off the ground,

1760
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:39,949
And count to 30.

1761
01:23:40,799 --> 01:23:42,311
I made it to, "Whoo."

1762
01:23:45,471 --> 01:23:47,511
"Is that going
to be close enough?"

1763
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:49,933
Well, it wasn't close enough,

1764
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,535
So they call in
for my arrest record.

1765
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,958
There's some good news.

1766
01:23:58,049 --> 01:24:00,449
Satellites are linking up
in outer space,

1767
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:04,240
Computer banks at NASA
are kicking on,

1768
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:08,738
There's a telegraph
in Fritch, Texas, going:

1769
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,572
[MAKING BEEPING SOUNDS]

1770
01:24:24,943 --> 01:24:25,943
This part takes a while.

1771
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:27,831
[MAKES RAPID BEEPING SOUND]

1772
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:30,681
Shorthand.

1773
01:24:33,752 --> 01:24:34,752
Beep.

1774
01:24:35,854 --> 01:24:38,676
Now, I told you that story
to tell you this story.

1775
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:41,771
When I was 17 years old,

1776
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:44,861
I was arrested
for being drunk in public.

1777
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,849
There kind of seems
to be a pattern there, Ron.

1778
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:53,409
If you knew Morse code,
you'd already know that.

1779
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:07,231
And one DWI, which was a bogus
charge because it turns out

1780
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:11,108
They were stopping every vehicle

1781
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,730
Traveling down
that particular sidewalk,

1782
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,708
And that's profiling.

1783
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,812
And profiling is wrong.

1784
01:25:25,136 --> 01:25:26,976
On the drunk in public charge
in Fritch, Texas,

1785
01:25:27,406 --> 01:25:28,406
The arresting officer,

1786
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:32,271
Who I had literally known all my
life. You know what I mean?

1787
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:35,492
This guy lived four doors
down from me

1788
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:38,127
In a town of less
than 400 people.

1789
01:25:38,684 --> 01:25:39,684
We've met.

1790
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,826
He takes me to jail.

1791
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,925
When we get there, he asks me
if I have any aliases.

1792
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:51,012
And I was just being a smart-ass
and said, "Yeah. They call me...

1793
01:25:51,996 --> 01:25:52,996
Tater Salad."

1794
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:00,182
Seventeen years later
in New York City,

1795
01:26:00,606 --> 01:26:01,606
I'm handcuffed on a bench

1796
01:26:02,107 --> 01:26:03,387
With blood coming
out of my nose,

1797
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,737
And this cop goes, "Are you
Ron 'Tater Salad' White?"

1798
01:26:12,183 --> 01:26:13,263
"You caught me!

1799
01:26:14,353 --> 01:26:15,865
You caught the Tater."

1800
01:26:17,188 --> 01:26:19,168
Thanks a lot.
Thank you very much.

1801
01:26:22,661 --> 01:26:24,173
JEFF: Love that story.

1802
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:31,143
All right, it is your turn,
and you don't get a choice.

1803
01:26:31,569 --> 01:26:34,334
You have got to do some
"Here's your sign" jokes.

1804
01:26:40,212 --> 01:26:41,364
BILL: Thank you.

1805
01:26:41,814 --> 01:26:43,254
I had the great opportunity
this year

1806
01:26:43,715 --> 01:26:45,315
To take my family
to the Winter Olympics.

1807
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,150
It was great being an American
and being in our home country.

1808
01:26:48,821 --> 01:26:50,661
And we were renting a car
up in Salt Lake City,

1809
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:52,256
And it's got a ski rack on it.

1810
01:26:52,825 --> 01:26:54,665
And we was putting the skis
up in the ski rack.

1811
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:58,583
The guy at the car right next
to me goes, "You going skiing?"

1812
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:01,051
I said, "Nope, we put them
on top of the car

1813
01:27:01,533 --> 01:27:03,693
"in case we flip over
on an icy road.

1814
01:27:04,602 --> 01:27:05,898
Here's your sign."

1815
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,563
This last year, I had a chance
to go elk hunting.

1816
01:27:13,879 --> 01:27:16,319
I got me a nice one, had it hung
on the den wall in the house.

1817
01:27:17,249 --> 01:27:20,647
My neighbor comes over and goes,
"Did you shoot that thing?"

1818
01:27:20,685 --> 01:27:23,680
I said, "Nope, he ran
through the wall and got stuck.

1819
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:25,952
Here's your sign."

1820
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:28,592
Hey, Bill.

1821
01:27:29,094 --> 01:27:31,294
Tell them about the one when
we did the show in Buffalo.

1822
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,364
When they lost the... Oh, God!

1823
01:27:33,932 --> 01:27:35,532
We did this show up
in Buffalo, New York,

1824
01:27:35,968 --> 01:27:37,588
And we land at the airport.

1825
01:27:37,736 --> 01:27:39,056
We all go down
to get our luggage,

1826
01:27:39,371 --> 01:27:41,171
And mine didn't show up,
which I know happens.

1827
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:42,726
So I go down to
the lost luggage office

1828
01:27:43,075 --> 01:27:45,355
Where everybody is
in such a good mood.

1829
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:47,556
Who applies for that job?

1830
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,701
Who says, "I want to work
in lost luggage?"

1831
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,110
You don't have a good day.

1832
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,606
That's like having a job
emptying Port-a-Potties.

1833
01:27:56,955 --> 01:27:59,565
You're just going
to catch crap all day long.

1834
01:28:00,392 --> 01:28:03,002
That is beautiful.
Did you just make that up?

1835
01:28:03,461 --> 01:28:04,461
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

1836
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,736
I like to use analogies
in my show.

1837
01:28:10,235 --> 01:28:12,155
That's where
they compare things.

1838
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:24,894
"That's funny. I don't care
who you are, right there.

1839
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,770
That's funny, right there."

1840
01:28:33,992 --> 01:28:34,992
So...

1841
01:28:36,594 --> 01:28:38,106
So I'm trying to be nice

1842
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:39,997
To this woman
in the lost luggage office.

1843
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:42,205
And I said, "Excuse me."
She goes, "Can I help you?"

1844
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:44,575
I said, "Yes, ma'am,
you lost my luggage."

1845
01:28:45,037 --> 01:28:46,237
She looked me right in the eye

1846
01:28:46,438 --> 01:28:48,658
And said,
"Has your plane landed yet?"

1847
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:49,907
Swear.

1848
01:28:52,777 --> 01:28:53,777
I said, "No, princess,

1849
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:56,199
"I'm having an
out-of-body experience.

1850
01:28:57,382 --> 01:28:58,894
"I'm just checking on it.

1851
01:29:00,352 --> 01:29:01,648
Here's your sign."

1852
01:29:05,123 --> 01:29:06,883
I hate to stop you,
but I've got one for you,

1853
01:29:07,525 --> 01:29:08,525
Me?

1854
01:29:08,961 --> 01:29:10,681
And I know you have
so many of these things.

1855
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:12,163
This happened to me last week.

1856
01:29:12,697 --> 01:29:14,457
We're in the process
of remodeling our house.

1857
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,600
We've been doing it
for a while, and, uh,

1858
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,329
We have the painters
in there right now.

1859
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:21,282
And they're putting sheets
over the furniture.

1860
01:29:21,306 --> 01:29:22,306
And we have a piano

1861
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,185
Just a regular,
up-against-the-wall piano.

1862
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:26,669
Last week, one of the painters
says to me,

1863
01:29:26,811 --> 01:29:28,323
"Is that y'all's piano?"

1864
01:29:30,882 --> 01:29:33,820
"No, that's our coffee table.
It just has buckteeth.

1865
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,288
Here's your sign."

1866
01:29:37,555 --> 01:29:38,555
He did not.
Yes, he did.

1867
01:29:39,024 --> 01:29:40,024
Oh, my God.

1868
01:29:40,425 --> 01:29:43,075
I'll keep that one.
I'm going to keep that one.

1869
01:29:43,928 --> 01:29:46,388
Hey, let me try one of these
Bill Engvall,

1870
01:29:47,332 --> 01:29:48,844
"Here's your sign" deals.

1871
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:53,609
I'm sorry. I did not mean
to start this.

1872
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,552
No, you can use this.

1873
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,397
Your next album
will go aluminum.

1874
01:30:12,257 --> 01:30:14,177
My grandma
is covered with moles.

1875
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:17,495
Oh, my!

1876
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:23,365
No. My grandma recently
just passed away.

1877
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:27,457
Hundred and four years old.

1878
01:30:28,407 --> 01:30:30,627
That's right.
But they saved the baby.

1879
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,466
I don't think he's kidding.

1880
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,870
My grandma just passed away,
104 years old.

1881
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:45,413
So I go up there to the flower
feller to get her flowers,

1882
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:49,959
And a card up there
at the flower feller.

1883
01:30:51,296 --> 01:30:53,906
Wait. No, wait.
And I was walking in there...

1884
01:30:53,965 --> 01:30:56,545
You bought a card
for your dead grandmother?

1885
01:31:00,272 --> 01:31:01,712
They had them there.

1886
01:31:04,008 --> 01:31:06,773
I know I'm going to regret this.
What did it say?

1887
01:31:07,912 --> 01:31:09,064
"Get well soon."

1888
01:31:12,584 --> 01:31:14,444
I knew it was coming.
I knew it!

1889
01:31:14,852 --> 01:31:15,852
So anyway...

1890
01:31:18,022 --> 01:31:19,022
But anyway...

1891
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,791
Hundred four years old.
Passed away.

1892
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:23,987
I go up there
to the flower feller.

1893
01:31:24,496 --> 01:31:25,616
He said, "What is this for?"

1894
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,624
I said, "My grandma
passed away at 104."

1895
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,080
He said, "Oh, 104!
How'd she die?"

1896
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,682
How'd she die? She's 104!

1897
01:31:34,806 --> 01:31:37,416
"She wrecked her Harley
up here at Bike Week.

1898
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:40,874
Here's your sign."

1899
01:31:42,013 --> 01:31:43,013
I love it!

1900
01:31:48,286 --> 01:31:50,993
It was better than I thought
it was going to be.

1901
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:53,890
Hey, Bill?

1902
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,311
Bill? I got one.

1903
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:57,747
Oh, do you?
Yeah.

1904
01:31:58,029 --> 01:31:59,029
My son...

1905
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:00,931
Tater Tot...

1906
01:32:06,838 --> 01:32:08,350
Is covered with moles.

1907
01:32:12,677 --> 01:32:14,597
My son, when he was 6 years old,

1908
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,699
Was going to fly by himself
from Dallas to Austin

1909
01:32:16,881 --> 01:32:18,321
To spend a week
with his grandmother.

1910
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,510
I'm putting him on the plane,

1911
01:32:19,817 --> 01:32:21,262
His grandmother's
taking him off the plane.

1912
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,126
And the lady I was buying
the ticket from says:

1913
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:25,521
"Is there going to be somebody
there in Austin

1914
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:28,343
To pick him up
when he gets off the plane?"

1915
01:32:32,764 --> 01:32:35,374
I said, "No, I'll pin
a $20 bill to his collar

1916
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:38,028
"and wish him the best of luck.

1917
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,100
Here's your sign."

1918
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:44,027
Those were three good ones.

1919
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,467
Bill, what do you say
you try one?

1920
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:52,562
Yeah, let me give it a shot.

1921
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:56,266
A couple weeks ago,
my car broke down.

1922
01:32:56,521 --> 01:32:58,361
I was on the side of the road,
had the hood up,

1923
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:00,723
There was smoke
just pouring out of the motor.

1924
01:33:00,758 --> 01:33:02,278
This guy stops to see
if I'm all right,

1925
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:04,481
But he asks the stupid question.

1926
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:06,669
He goes, "Did your car
break down?"

1927
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:10,139
"Nope. Car wanted a cigarette,
so I pulled over.

1928
01:33:11,903 --> 01:33:13,199
Here's your sign."

1929
01:33:14,072 --> 01:33:16,232
I was in the store
buying some pants.

1930
01:33:16,741 --> 01:33:18,721
I put the pants
up on the counter,

1931
01:33:18,776 --> 01:33:21,256
And the girl behind the counter
goes, "You going to buy those?"

1932
01:33:21,613 --> 01:33:22,693
"Nope, going to steal them.

1933
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,100
"Just wanted you to see them

1934
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,162
Before I walked
out of the store."

1935
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:29,099
Hey. Tell them about the one

1936
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,101
That you done did over
at what-you-call-her.

1937
01:33:33,825 --> 01:33:35,803
"Yeah, Bill, tell us
about the one

1938
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:38,047
You done did over
at that deal there."

1939
01:33:39,297 --> 01:33:41,907
He just ended a sentence
in nine prepositions.

1940
01:33:45,002 --> 01:33:46,514
He's an overachiever.

1941
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,773
I don't know about all that,
but tell it.

1942
01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:54,584
I know the one you're talking
about. All right.

1943
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:56,453
I came out of the mall one day.

1944
01:33:56,948 --> 01:33:58,628
The guy parked next to me
is standing there

1945
01:33:59,317 --> 01:34:01,237
With a coat hanger
in his window.

1946
01:34:01,519 --> 01:34:03,199
And I could not stop myself.

1947
01:34:04,656 --> 01:34:07,056
I said, "You lock your keys
in your car?"

1948
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:10,273
He whipped around and said:

1949
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:13,384
"Nope. Just washed it,
going to hang it up to dry.

1950
01:34:14,799 --> 01:34:16,095
Here's your sign."

1951
01:34:19,003 --> 01:34:20,371
But the best one...

1952
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:22,098
The best one I've seen yet

1953
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,640
Happened in Los Angeles,
California.

1954
01:34:24,108 --> 01:34:25,228
I got stuck behind a big rig

1955
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,187
That wedged his trailer up
underneath an overpass.

1956
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:29,492
And me and the trucker are
waiting on the side of the road

1957
01:34:29,847 --> 01:34:30,847
On the tow truck driver.

1958
01:34:31,149 --> 01:34:32,460
Well, the highway
patrolman pulls up

1959
01:34:32,484 --> 01:34:34,644
And looks at the guy's rig
and he looks at the trucker.

1960
01:34:35,019 --> 01:34:36,979
And I'm thinking, "Oh, dear God,
he can't say it."

1961
01:34:37,555 --> 01:34:39,235
Because I'll start laughing.

1962
01:34:40,057 --> 01:34:42,822
Sure enough, he goes,
"You get your truck stuck?"

1963
01:34:44,162 --> 01:34:46,522
And God bless this trucker,
without missing a beat, he goes:

1964
01:34:46,898 --> 01:34:50,239
"Nope. I was delivering that
overpass and I ran out of gas.

1965
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,966
Here's your sign."

1966
01:34:57,342 --> 01:34:58,342
Thank you.

1967
01:35:00,211 --> 01:35:01,211
Well, folks, I know this,

1968
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,100
I can speak
for the rest of these guys.

1969
01:35:03,414 --> 01:35:05,614
This has been one of the most
awesome nights of my life.

1970
01:35:05,884 --> 01:35:08,706
And I know it's been good
for y'all, but I know...

1971
01:35:09,053 --> 01:35:11,153
You are not going
to leave this room

1972
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:14,100
Until you hear some
"You might be a redneck!"

1973
01:35:24,503 --> 01:35:27,556
If you think 'N Sync is where
your dirty dishes are...

1974
01:35:31,376 --> 01:35:32,888
You might be a redneck.

1975
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:36,439
If you take your dog for a walk

1976
01:35:36,748 --> 01:35:39,208
And you both use the tree
at the corner...

1977
01:35:41,052 --> 01:35:42,564
You might be a redneck.

1978
01:35:45,023 --> 01:35:48,249
If you think a 401(k) is your
mother-in-law's bra size...

1979
01:35:51,796 --> 01:35:53,308
You might be a redneck.

1980
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,178
If your dad's cell number

1981
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:58,995
Has nothing to do
with a telephone...

1982
01:36:01,873 --> 01:36:03,385
You might be a redneck.

1983
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,735
If you keep a fly swatter
on the front seat of the car...

1984
01:36:07,779 --> 01:36:11,005
So you can reach your kids
in the back seat of the car...

1985
01:36:14,485 --> 01:36:16,285
They're like, "Can you do that?
Is that okay?"

1986
01:36:16,655 --> 01:36:17,951
No. Don't do that.

1987
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,083
If your working television

1988
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:23,435
Sits on top of your non-working
television...

1989
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:27,142
You might be a redneck.

1990
01:36:28,266 --> 01:36:31,549
If you've ever been accused
of lying through your tooth...

1991
01:36:34,773 --> 01:36:36,285
You might be a redneck.

1992
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:41,292
If you work without a shirt on
and so does your husband...

1993
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:48,450
You might be a redneck.
I like that.

1994
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,480
If an episode
of<i> Walker, Texas Ranger</i>

1995
01:36:53,692 --> 01:36:55,132
Changed your life...

1996
01:36:57,195 --> 01:36:58,707
You might be a redneck.

1997
01:37:00,031 --> 01:37:02,911
If you've ever worn a tube top
to a funeral home...

1998
01:37:05,303 --> 01:37:07,343
You might be a redneck.
Oh, my God!

1999
01:37:09,674 --> 01:37:12,254
I can't even believe
you just said that one.

2000
01:37:13,344 --> 01:37:14,856
Why? Did you see that?
No.

2001
01:37:15,847 --> 01:37:17,359
No. I got one better.

2002
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:20,832
If you've ever opened a beer
during a eulogy...

2003
01:37:22,721 --> 01:37:24,233
You might be a redneck.

2004
01:37:29,027 --> 01:37:30,627
I'm just guessing,
one of your relatives.

2005
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:32,337
My uncle Jack.

2006
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:35,671
I swear to you, Jeff,
we were sitting...

2007
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,212
We weren't even outside.

2008
01:37:37,702 --> 01:37:39,214
We were in the church.

2009
01:37:40,071 --> 01:37:42,231
The reverend had just finished
the eulogy and we heard:

2010
01:37:42,641 --> 01:37:44,321
[MAKES SOUND OF CAN OPENING]

2011
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:46,376
And we look in the back,

2012
01:37:46,811 --> 01:37:49,921
And he's sitting there
