00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,113
[bats flapping]

00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,745
[slow organ music]

4
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:33,861
- Tiny hellish demons disguised
as play things for children.

5
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:37,347
Diminutive beasts who
thrive on fear and pain,

6
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:42,249
who feast on the souls of those
who dare cross their path.

7
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,355
My goodness.

8
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:53,501
They will mount in numbers
 until their army rises

9
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,779
and opens the gates to...

10
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,645
toy hell...

11
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:02,959
led by...

12
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,446
the toy master.

13
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,625
The crazy lady wasn't
 so crazy after all.

14
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:19,872
He, after all he who
 possesses this wicked tome

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,598
controls the toy master's will.

16
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,153
Beware of the toys.

17
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:32,471
Well, I possess it now, buddy.

18
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:36,234
We'll see about that.

19
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,377
[mysterious theme music]

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,640
[childlike yelling]

21
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,918
- [Toy] You're stepping
 on the boat, little miss.

22
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,748
We're only afraid of the dark.

23
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,681
- Shut up, you moron!

24
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,613
Let us out!

25
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,928
Open this fucking
 treasure chest.

26
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,172
[indistinct shouting]

27
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,761
- Oh, gonna hit the
 fan, hit the fan.

28
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,659
- Face it, loser.

29
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:34,006
We're running this rodeo.

30
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,973
Yee haw!

31
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,492
Yee haw!

32
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:40,116
Now let us out before I put
 you on a permanent time out.

33
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:43,084
[indistinct shouting]

34
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,362
- Oh the scratch

35
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:45,915
shows his grizzled muzzle,

36
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,952
and he threatens to cloak
 the world in darkness

37
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:53,957
and forsake the glory and
 life of Lord Jesus Christ.

38
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:58,238
That is why we must be strong.

39
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
That is when me must
 stand and shout,

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,864
Satan you get--
[loud splashing]

41
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,315
- Turn that shit off!

42
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,351
Bring me a bowl of mayonnaise.

43
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,214
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:11,561
- Now Ray Ray.

45
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,045
- I need to be be hurt

46
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,633
before you dine us.

47
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,773
- Ray Ray, you don't mean that.

48
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,327
You're just not yourself.

49
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,121
Get back.

50
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,985
Something evil got ahold of you.

51
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:25,092
- Evil.

52
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,922
- Ray Ray, you've
 gotta fight it.

53
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,786
We're best friends, remember?

54
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,686
- You can never stop
 our reign of terror.

55
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:36,448
But sadly, you'll
 suffer the legendary.

56
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:39,589
- [TV Preacher] Satan, you
 are cast out of this home.

57
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,419
Cast out of this life.

58
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,491
- Satan, get ye behind me!

59
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,182
- Fuck you, skank!

60
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:47,804
Your stepmother was right.

61
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,461
You're nothing but
 a piece of garbage

62
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:51,705
with a shitty ass hair cut.

63
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,260
You'll never amount to anything.

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,297
You're just a dried
 up old spinster

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,229
who smells like rotten leather.

66
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,679
You're a dive.

67
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,992
- Why, you son of a bitch!

68
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:07,997
[cross sizzling]
[man shouting]

00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:14,659

70
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,707
[man laughing]

71
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:33,850
- Father Luke.

72
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,127
- Father McGavin.

73
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,301
I just made a pot.

74
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,820
- Oh, no thank you.

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,063
Um, I took your advice.

76
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,411
And I went down to the archives.

77
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,998
- Horribly dreary down there.

78
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,311
- Father, I found this.

79
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,874
Father, it's filled
 with pages and pages

80
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,600
that corroborate
 the woman's story.

81
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:03,328
It says that the evil
 toys are already here.

82
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,573
I did some research.

83
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:09,230
I went on the internet and
 I found underground videos

84
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,371
of people saying the toys,

85
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,374
they're basically being
 distributed to gullible folks

86
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,168
that will nurture the toys.

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,551
It says that when
 the time is right

88
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,381
the toys will rise in an army

89
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,935
to destroy mankind.

90
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,973
- Sounds like horse shit.

91
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:30,666
- Maybe.

92
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,359
But father, what if it isn't?

93
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,774
- Father.

94
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:37,120
- Will you at least grant
 me the permission to

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,156
look into it further?

96
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,336
- Yes, but please keep in
 mind that most of the writings

97
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:49,685
from that period are simply
 metaphors for mental illness

98
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:55,242
- Father she, she
 seems so convinced.

99
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,140
- She's bat shit.

100
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:01,559
Sister Alicia believes that
 she saw the face of Jesus

101
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,939
in her oatmeal.

102
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,251
That doesn't make it true.

103
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,082
We live in very
troubled times, father.

104
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:12,949
Plain and simple, the only
 demons that truly exist

105
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,227
are the ones in our head.

106
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,473
- Right.

107
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:25,859
- I'll show you a grave

108
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:28,309
if I bury you alive.

109
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,072
Your evil toys will kill
everyone that you love.

110
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:34,695
- May the power of
 Christ compel you.

111
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:35,593
- Fuck you!

112
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,150
[pan clanging]

113
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:52,817
- Teddy!

114
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:54,543
- Hey, Sybil.

115
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,338
Is Christy around?

116
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,307
- Christy?

117
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,176
- My girlfriend.

118
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:12,008
I haven't seen her since
we got back from Mexico.

119
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:16,565
[woman screaming]
 [electricity zapping]

120
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,464
Kind of got into it on
 the plane ride back.

121
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,673
I figured she was giving
me the cold shoulder,

122
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,330
but it's been two weeks.

123
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,504
I can't get ahold of her.

124
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,436
- I haven't see her.

125
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,508
She ain't been around here.

126
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:30,682
- At all, I mean...

127
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,892
Her car's still here.

128
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:37,551
- Like I said, I
 have not seen her.

129
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,932
I have a lot to do.

130
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:42,142
If I see her, I'll
 tell her to call you.

131
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:43,453
- If you see her--

132
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,596
[door slamming]

133
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:50,599
[suspenseful music]

134
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,987
[phone ringing]

135
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,681
- What?

136
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,579
- Sybil Lindon,
 it's Father McGavin.

137
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,063
- I can't talk right now!

138
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,858
My plate is very full.

139
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,550
- I researched
 some of the things

140
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,137
that you were trying
 to share with me.

141
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,830
Sybil, I think there might
 actually be some truth

142
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,418
to the claims that
 you were making.

143
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,834
- Well goody for you.

144
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,145
You're too late.

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,872
- I need to meet with you
 as soon as possible, Sybil,

146
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,356
please.

147
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,324
I really think that the
 church needs to just have--

148
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,326
- It's too late.

149
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,915
- But I really believe--

150
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,951
- I have a pissed off demon

151
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,229
tied up in my living
 room right now, okay?

152
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,058
I can't talk!

153
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,585
- This is not gonna end well.

154
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,518
[light airy music]

155
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:05,846
- Ray Ray.

156
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,021
- Hey, honey.

157
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,333
You got any Ibuprofen?

158
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,062
- Ray Ray, is it really you?

159
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:16,961
- Yes, of course it's me.

160
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,790
Who else would it be?

161
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,034
- You're back to
 your normal self?

162
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,311
- Nothing knocks
 the devil out of you

163
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:24,624
like a frying pan to the head.

164
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,832
- You ain't fooling me?

165
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,109
- I'm right as rain.

166
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,111
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles.

167
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:34,806
Come on, got to end this
 craziness once and for all.

168
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:35,635
- Okay.

169
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,844
Ray.

170
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:44,402
- I never wanna see another
 doll as long as I live.

171
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:56,586
[gravel crunching]

172
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,796
- You a friend of Miss Pittman?

173
00:10:58,796 --> 00:10:59,624
- No.

174
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,385
My girlfriend's her roommate.

175
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,836
Or was.

176
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,079
- Was?

177
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,943
- She's not returning
 my phone calls.

178
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,361
- Private Detective Clink.

179
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,259
Mind if I ask you
 a few questions?

180
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,676
- Sure, um,

181
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,643
I mean it's probably nothing.

182
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,127
We went on vacation together,

183
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,439
got into it on the
 plane ride back.

184
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:22,371
I dropped her off here.

185
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,786
I haven't heard from her since.

186
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,271
Sybil says she hasn't been here.

187
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,411
- Sybil said that?

188
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,343
- Yeah.

189
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,658
- Does your girlfriend have
 a habit of disappearing?

190
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,523
- No.

191
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,042

[indistinct mumbling]

197
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,642
- [Toy] We can't
breathe in here.

198
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,023
- What are we
 gonna do with them?

199
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,956
- Maybe we can put
 the box in a fireplace

200
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:05,888
and burn them.

201
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,373
- They're gonna barbecue us.

202
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:09,374
- Good idea.

203
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:10,306
- Or better yet,

204
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,032
we can sink them in the river.

205
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,171
- No, daddy please!

206
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,552
- [Male Toy] But honey likes--

207
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:15,795

208

 kill you instead!

Yee haw!

- It's time I
 deliver the bad toys.

213
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,673
The day of reckoning is upon us.

214
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,505
Toys shall ravish the earth.

215
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:39,819
Rivers of blood shall
 flood the streets.

216
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:43,201
- Oh no, Sybil.

217
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,308
[toys laughing]

218
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,035
Now let's finish
 this loser up, daddy.

219
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:49,967
Tie the bitch up

220
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,520
so I can to medieval on her.

221
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,523
- We shall feast from the
 skullcaps from the dammed.

222
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,352
- Froggy hungry.

223
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,146

229
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,266
- Where are the dolls?

230
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,509
- Way ahead of me, mister Chump.

231
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:17,546
She is clearly got cold feet,

232
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:20,790
so I'm taking matters
 into my own hands.

233
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,586
- It's you that will be cold
 if you continue to fail.

234
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,900
This is your last chance.

235
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,040

I'm going to her
 house and not leaving

238
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,081

- Feeling comfy, mommy?

243
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,137
Now it's your turn
 for a time out.

244
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,690
Your final time out.

245
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,106
That'll drown off his wife.

246
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:00,934
You're not evil.

247
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:01,935
You're just stupid.

248
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,557
Time for night night.

249

- [Doll] Mommy got an ouchie.

256
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,924
Should I kiss it

from the unknown evil
 I'm about to face.

262
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,533
- Sign this.

263
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,328
I'll submit a missing
 person report.

264
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,642
I have a feeling there's
more to this story

265
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,092
than meets the eye.

266
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,957
In the meantime, have you
 contacted her parents?

267
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,303
- No, I never met them.

268
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,790
Do you really think
 something happened?

269
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,930
- The only thing I know for sure

270
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,450
that Sybil Pitman
 is up to no good.

271
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,694
Do you have any

00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:14,490
on your girlfriend that
 might help me locate her?

273

274
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,977
we could look in her car.

275
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,116
Haven't moved since we got back,

276
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,048
I have a spare key.

277
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,293
- What about the house key?

278
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,087

In the name of the
 Lord, Jesus Christ

I pine you from excreting
 your thorn of evil.

No way but through us

308

- Real amateur

310
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,419
The only reason why
 you became a priest

311
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,697
is because you got
 to put tie on jeans.

312
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:42,802
- What'd you say?

00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,907
