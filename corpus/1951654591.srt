1
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,151
- Honey, i'm home.
- Roger that.

2
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,590
Copy at the boathouse.
Right on time.

3
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,631
Faisil, get your butt in here.
Harry's inside.

4
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,712
Yeah, yeah, i'm coming.
I'm coming.

5
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,989
- Hey, were you born in a barn?
- Whorehouse.

6
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,191
All right. You got
your fur-coated razor blade there...

7
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,550
and a bunch of guys with guns.

8
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,553
I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

9
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,069
Check, check.

10
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,872
- <i>Check, check.</i>
- It's talk radio.

11
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,109
- <i>You're on the air.</i>
- Check.

12
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,469
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

13
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,271
He's at the service door.
He's inside.

14
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,033
Have you seen Khaled yet?

15
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,111
Yep, there he is.

16
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,350
How come billionaires
are always short?

17
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,913
Excuse me.

18
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,632
Thank you.

19
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,190
Colonel! How are you?

20
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,153
- It's so good to see you again.
- Yes, it's been a long time.

21
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,231
- Terrific.
- Who was that guy?

22
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,790
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

23
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,794
<i>You should be crossing the main foyer,</i>
<i>heading for the stairs.</i>

24
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,350
Keep moving. Keep moving.

25
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.

26
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,993
Modem in place.
Transmitting now.

27
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,348
Affirmatory.

28
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,074
It's a good hook-up.

29
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,909
These are encrypted files.
It's going to take me a few minutes.

30
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,750
I got your password.

31
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,599
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Yes, quite.

32
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,190
I thought i knew Khaled's friends,
but i don't believe i've met you before.

33
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,959
<i>We haven't met,</i>
<i>because I certainly would remember.</i>

34
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,230
Renquist, Harry Renquist.

35
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,993
- Juno Skinner.
- Juno Skinner.

36
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,559
Come on!

37
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,952
"Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

38
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,350
specializing in ancient Persia."

39
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,114
This is Persian,
if i'm not mistaken.

40
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,153
Very good.
Sixth century BC, to be exact.

41
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,670
- Do you like the period?
- I adore it.

42
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,669
We got a problem.
Guards are going apeshit down there.

43
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,633
Acquired most of these pieces
for Jamal.

44
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,549
Do you tango?

45
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,349
Tango?

46
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,029
<i>Harry, you do not have time</i>
<i>to tango, buddy.</i>

47
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,111
<i>You copy?</i>

48
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,712
Don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. You hear me?

49
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,872
- You gotta get out of there.
- Yes! Files are unlocked!

50
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,508
Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

51
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,029
I got my hand up her dress,
and i am going for the gold...

52
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,872
Just copy the goddam files, okay?

53
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,233
Wow. And i thought
this was just gonna be...

54
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,312
another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.

55
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,113
Seconds count.
Ditch the bitch.

56
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,471
Unfortunately, i have to leave.

57
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,551
I have a plane to catch.

58
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,719
Well, call me sometime.

59
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,910
My offices are in Rome.

60
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,951
I would like that.

61
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,073
Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.

62
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,471
Twinkletoes,
what's your exit strategy?

63
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,870
I'm going to walk
right out of the front gate.

64
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,389
<i>Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.</i>

65
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,870
Sir, may i see
your invitation, please?

66
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,679
Sure. Here is my invitation.

67
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,792
Shit. Here we go.

68
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,439
Slight change in plans.

69
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,152
Stay!

70
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,551
We're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.

71
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,233
Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

72
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,429
- Watch it!
- It's called ice, and it's slick.

73
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,993
- Harry, do you copy? Whoa!
- I got it.

74
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,351
Shit!

75
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,669
Whoops!

76
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,759
Oh, my God!

77
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,871
Whoa! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

78
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,429
- There he is!
- Shit!

79
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,471
Hi, guys.

80
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,192
That worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

81
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,191
Can you lean back a second?

82
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,234
Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

83
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,872
All right, that's it
for Mr Renquist. Okay, go.

84
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,358
We got Harry Tasker billfold,
Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub.

85
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,552
Hotel bill, Tasker.
I got two postcards here from Geneva.

86
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,271
Got some house keys right there...

87
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,671
and i've got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

88
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,990
- What's that for?
- It's for Dana, stupe.

89
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,350
Bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.

90
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,549
Nice touch.

91
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,150
- Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
- Will do.

92
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,909
The debriefing is at 1000.

93
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,952
- See you at 8:00. Bye.
- Hey, Harry.

94
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,350
Did you forget something?

95
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,029
What a team.

96
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,310
Sleep fast, buddy.

97
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,670
Hi, honey. How was your flight?

98
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,310
- It was fine.
- Good.

99
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,108
Brought you a little gift
from Switzerland. Snowy village.

100
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,913
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

101
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,349
- I've never had one of these.
- You're welcome.

102
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,431
You're late for school.
You better get going.

103
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,472
- Don't forget to feed Gizmo.
- Okay.

104
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,989
It's pretty lame.

105
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,152
- I'm late.
- Yeah, me too.

106
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,511
How'd it go at the convention?
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

107
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,319
It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

108
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,908
You should have been there.
We were the big hit of the show.

109
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,350
With that new model ordering system,
the 680 i told you about...

110
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,630
i can write up an order
and immediately...

111
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,309
as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...

112
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,671
what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.

113
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
- Every little detail.
- Sounds great.

114
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,119
It's fantastic. That's why
i love the computer business.

115
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,071
Listen, the plumber called.

116
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,472
He says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.

117
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,871
- That's okay.
- It's not okay. It's extortion.

118
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,831
What did you tell him?

119
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,231
I slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $ 100.

120
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,669
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

121
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,952
Hello!

122
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,633
Boy, i remember the first time
i got shot out of a cannon.

123
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,593
- Good morning. Go to school.
- Yeah, i am.

124
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,234
Thanks, dear.

125
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,112
Check these out.

126
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,554
Check them out.

127
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,830
Where's the image coming from?

128
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,470
Got a CCD camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.

129
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,471
It's pretty cool, huh?

130
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,033
What the hell?

131
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,150
Bye, Dad!

132
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,113
- She's ripping you off.
- I knew it.

133
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,631
Let's go!

134
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,751
Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

135
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,351
God. Shit.

136
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,472
<i>Kids. Ten seconds of joy,</i>
<i>30 years of misery.</i>

137
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,239
I got married three times, but at least
i was never dumb enough to have any.

138
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,591
She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better than that.

139
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,591
You're not her parents any more,
you and Helen.

140
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,830
Her parents are
Axl Rose and Madonna.

141
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,470
Five minutes a day you spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.

142
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,119
You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

143
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,231
It's not just
because you're a bad parent.

144
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,749
Kids today are ten years ahead
of where we were at the same age.

145
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,711
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr Tasker.

146
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,950
- I bet you think she's still a virgin.
- Don't be ridiculous.

147
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,991
- She's only... What is she now?
- She's 14.

148
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,192
- She's only 14.
- Her hormones are going like an alarm.

149
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,351
It's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

150
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,192
- Not Dana.
- "Not Dana."

151
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,954
Denial. It's not just a river
in Egypt no more, is it?

152
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,548
She's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.

153
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,989
Why don't you open the door?

154
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,912
Or drugs.

155
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,673
Twenty here, 50 there. I figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

156
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,752
He takes everything else. There's
never a beer in the goddam fridge.

157
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,150
<i>- Thought you moved out.</i>
<i>- I had to move back in.</i>

158
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,999
<i>My lawyer said it'd give me</i>
<i>a better shot at getting the house...</i>

159
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,680
<i>during the property settlement,</i>
<i>but don't change the subject.</i>

160
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,519
<i>- You still owe me 200 bucks.</i>
<i>- Good morning, Janice.</i>

161
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,073
- Good morning.
- Identify yourselves to the scanner.

162
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,988
- Harry Tasker, 10024.
- Albert Gibson, 34991.

163
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,831
All right, Frances. I don't believe
we need you any longer now. Thank you.

164
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,433
Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn't you?

165
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,429
Would you please tell me how i can see
this as anything but a total disaster?

166
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,670
"Total" is a strong word.

167
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,711
There are different
degrees of totality.

168
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,031
It's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...

169
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,232
and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this...

170
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,432
Faisil, you're new on Harry's team,
aren't you?

171
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,874
Yes.

172
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,120
So what makes you think the slack
i cut him in any way translates to you?

173
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,270
Let me show you what we got.

174
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,639
Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.

175
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,433
One hundred million in wire transfers
from the Commerce Bank international.

176
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,313
Which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.

177
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,034
That's why we think
something really big is going down.

178
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,151
We know that a week ago
four MiRV warheads were smuggled...

179
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,271
out of the former
Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

180
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,279
We think Khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

181
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,551
So far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

182
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,150
Don't you have anything
remotely substantial?

183
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,113
Harry, do you have any hard data?

184
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,750
- Nothing you would call rock-hard.
- Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

185
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,194
Then perhaps you better get some...

186
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,880
before somebody parks an automobile
in front of the White House...

187
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,753
with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

188
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,269
It's not like
he's saving the world or anything.

189
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,749
He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

190
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,912
Whenever i can't sleep,
i ask him to tell me about his day.

191
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,150
Six seconds and i'm out.

192
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,153
He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

193
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,470
I guess this means you didn't
get away for the weekend after all.

194
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,909
- Harry had to go out of town.
- I'm shocked.

195
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,951
Yeah, well, you know Harry.

196
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,752
- What's up?
- Check this out.

197
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,714
There's a $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

198
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,671
That's right.
The babe at the party.

199
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,470
That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

200
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,512
He keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger.

201
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,148
This is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...

202
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,350
even for a total biscuit
like her.

203
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,670
I want a complete workup on her.

204
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,559
- Do we know where she is?
- Right here in River City.

205
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,399
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff
for the Smithsonian.

206
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,353
She has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.

207
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,789
I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

208
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,278
- Care to tango?
- Yes, i would.

209
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,192
Assholes.

210
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,352
It's all set up. You got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.

211
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,109
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel
under the name of Renquist.

212
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,231
Reality check. Let's go.

213
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,592
My name is Harry Renquist. I own
an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

214
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,671
I have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

215
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,910
- Harry!
- Hello.

216
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,393
Hello.

217
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,432
I thought i'd see you again.
I just didn't know it would be so soon.

218
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,433
- What's the point of waiting?
- I agree.

219
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,993
Your clients are looking for something
for the lobby of their new headquarters?

220
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,111
They would like to see something
very dramatic.

221
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,151
That's a nice piece.

222
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,989
I talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.

223
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,918
Really? Checking on me.

224
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,919
So what did these people
say about me exactly?

225
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,192
That you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...

226
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,433
and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.

227
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,072
Those wimps.

228
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,273
It's because i use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...

229
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,312
from countries which tell them
to take a hike.

230
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,119
Most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

231
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,950
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet
under the sand of iran, iraq and Syria.

232
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,680
Not the most popular places
lately.

233
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,509
So i've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

234
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,148
Well, Mr Renquist?

235
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,319
Do you see anything you like?

236
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,510
Maybe.

237
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,389
Give me a break. I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

238
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,511
She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

239
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,392
She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

240
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,630
The second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.

241
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,591
They were checking out
the Renquist front.

242
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,354
Let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.

243
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,314
Maurizio, i said Saturday,
not Tuesday. Saturday.

244
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,391
Miss Skinner, may i have
a word with you, please?

245
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,630
Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

246
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,672
It's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

247
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,713
Do you realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?

248
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,990
Your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.

249
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,352
And you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this Renquist...

250
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,550
He checked out okay...

251
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,868
We do not tolerate mistakes.

252
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,191
What would you like me to do?

253
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,510
Find out where this Renquist is.

254
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,471
Hello, Tektel Systems.
Mr Tasker's office.

255
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,154
Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen.
Is he in?

256
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,670
Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

257
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,831
Relay, 10024.

258
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,789
It's a patch from Tektel.

259
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,471
It's Helen.

260
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,154
Hello, honey. How are you?
What's going on?

261
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,794
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.

262
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,593
It's just that Dana and i want to make
sure you were gonna be home by 8:00.

263
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,870
We're going to a lot of trouble
for your big birthday.

264
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,470
We just wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be home.

265
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,631
Absolutely.
This time you can count on me.

266
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,074
- <i>Promise?</i>
- Trust me.

267
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,872
- Great.
- <i>Got to go. Bye.</i>

268
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,830
Bye.

269
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,992
- That's disgusting, Dana.
- Calm down.

270
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,188
We got a friend.
Three cars back on the inside lane.

271
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,392
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

272
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,351
- You mean the station wagon?
- Yes.

273
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,399
- You want me to lose them?
- No. We need this lead.

274
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,430
Unit Seven?

275
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,149
Seven here.

276
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,629
<i>We need you at the Georgetown Mall</i>
<i>in three minutes.</i>

277
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,110
- <i>Copy. We're rolling.</i>
- Helen's gonna be pissed.

278
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,070
This is the problem with terrorists.

279
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,073
They're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.

280
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,111
Pull over here. This is good.

281
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,592
- Okay, testing, one, two, three.
- I got you. I got you. I got you.

282
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,189
They're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

283
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,709
- Dickhead.
- Blow me.

284
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,830
I got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming after you.

285
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,632
Think i'm blind?

286
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,548
<i>You do look like Ray Charles.</i>
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

287
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,148
Just trying to get a closer look
at Beavis and Butt-head.

288
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,511
- There's a third one still in the car.
- <i>Stay on him.</i>

289
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,111
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.
Oh, not much.

290
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,312
Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office.

291
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,512
You know Harry.

292
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,871
Yeah, Gib, i know Harry. Bye.

293
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,274
<i>Bye. See you soon.</i>

294
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,992
See?

295
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,313
I lost the third guy.

296
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,429
Shit!

297
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,159
Shit! Hold it! Shit!

298
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,714
Here. Cool off.

299
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,908
Sorry about this.

300
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,959
Look out! Get out of the way!

301
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,551
Hey! Freeze!

302
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,912
Oh, thank God.

303
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,591
Get in the car.

304
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,473
Here we go.

305
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,590
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

306
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,992
Sorry.

307
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,230
- Harry, what's your 20?
- Westbound in the park.

308
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,954
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on Franklin.

309
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,671
Copy!

310
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,553
I want you on 14th
in case he turns south.

311
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,319
I want Seven on the north side
to box him in.

312
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,038
Make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.

313
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,909
Your horse?

314
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,993
- There he is! That's him!
- Come on!

315
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,952
- Go around to the back.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

316
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,710
Out of my way!

317
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,720
Out of my way!

318
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,989
Sorry.

319
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,153
Excuse me.

320
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,032
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

321
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,112
Open it!

322
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,869
Excuse me. Excuse me.

323
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,069
Out of the way!

324
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,873
Move! Move! Move!

325
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,351
Federal officer! Get down! Now!
Get off or die!

326
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,599
- Get down! Now!
- Move!

327
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,270
Turn around! Hold still!

328
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,152
Come on!

329
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,548
Whoa!

330
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,831
Hold still!

331
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,751
Will you press the button
for the top floor, please?

332
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,628
Thank you.

333
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,710
Help!

334
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,552
Shut up!

335
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,669
Whoa.

336
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,513
Say something.

337
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,790
That's a fine animal.

338
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,029
Stay against the glass!

339
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,349
Come on.

340
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,072
So sorry.

341
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,988
Stay there! Don't move!

342
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,151
Come on, come on, come on!

343
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,672
Okay, back up.

344
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,114
Back up.

345
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,790
You can do it.
Come on.

346
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,512
Good horse. Good.

347
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,949
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

348
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,031
Come on.
Yeah, that's teamwork now.

349
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,270
Keep pulling. Come on.

350
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,234
A little bit more.

351
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,633
That a boy.

352
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,352
Okay.

353
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,870
What the hell were you thinking?

354
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,872
I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

355
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,874
Look at me when i talk to you.
What kind of a cop are you anyway?

356
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,112
Hi, honey.

357
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,952
I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.

358
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,669
I hurried home
as fast as i could.

359
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,552
It's okay.

360
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,552
It's okay.

361
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,071
I'm sorry.

362
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,390
Thank you for the party.

363
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,829
Yeah, it was great.

364
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,079
Hey.

365
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,589
That's him.

366
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,633
- Pause it right there.
- Salim Abu Aziz.

367
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,479
This guy is really hard-core.
Highly fanatical.

368
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,831
The man's a real psycho. He's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.

369
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,470
You know that cafe bomb
in Rome last year? That was his.

370
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,473
As well as a 727 out of Lisbon.
This guy's a major player.

371
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,831
Now he's formed his own splinter faction
called Crimson Jihad.

372
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,549
I guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.

373
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,240
- They call him the Sand Spider.
- Why?

374
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,430
Probably because it sounds scary.

375
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,989
This is impressive, gentlemen.

376
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,829
It would be even more impressive
if you actually knew where he was.

377
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,914
We'll get him.

378
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,910
- Why don't you pull over here?
- What's up?

379
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,952
I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

380
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,150
I'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over.

381
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,550
- You just want me to hang?
- Just hang.

382
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,113
I'll just be hanging.

383
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,399
Hold, please.

384
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,114
- It's your mystery man on two.
- Simon?

385
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,309
Oh, my God.

386
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,073
Hello? Simon?

387
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,872
Simon?

388
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,512
Yes, i can talk.

389
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
You mean right now?

390
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,911
Yes, i can meet you.

391
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,234
Okay, i can't wait.

392
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,349
Bye.

393
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,191
Can you cover me for an hour?

394
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,828
Just an hour? You should tell
that stud to take more time.

395
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,589
Would you shut up?
I should have never told you about him.

396
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,469
Have a good time.

397
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,269
Get a little bit for me
while you're at it.

398
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,189
Hey! Hold it! Fucker!

399
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,231
What's going on? Sick?

400
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,669
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

401
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,992
It's Hel... it's Helen...
it's Helen.

402
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,390
It has something to do with Helen,
i'm guessing.

403
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,672
Helen...

404
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,711
is having an affair.

405
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,434
Welcome to the club, man.

406
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,073
It can't be. Not Helen.

407
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,310
Nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.

408
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,159
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?

409
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,590
I had no idea nothing was going on.
I come home, and the house is empty.

410
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,030
She even took the ice cube trays
out of the freezer.

411
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,518
What kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out of the freezer?

412
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,109
- It's not Helen.
- Helen still loves you.

413
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,909
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while. It's nothing serious.

414
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,231
- You'll get used to it soon...
- Stop cheering me up!

415
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,992
What'd you expect?

416
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,310
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

417
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,310
It was just a matter of time.

418
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,428
I say we concentrate on work.

419
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,790
That's what i do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

420
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,951
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

421
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,469
Right, buddy?
It's gonna be great.

422
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,949
We're gonna catch some terrorists.
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

423
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,071
You're going to feel a hell
of a lot better.

424
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,959
Watch your head.
Okay. All right.

425
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,230
Women. Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

426
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,871
I came by your office today.

427
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,873
I was in the area, and i thought
you might want to have lunch.

428
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,670
Really? Well,
you must have just missed me.

429
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,468
That's what they said. They said
you had to run out or something.

430
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,273
It was this rush job...

431
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,234
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

432
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,511
So, of course, the big problem...
our printer shut down.

433
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,553
So i went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1720.

434
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,990
Of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1720.

435
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,833
So i had to go back upstairs
and reformat...

436
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,190
go back downstairs
and use their printer.

437
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,874
By the time i got there,
i couldn't get my car to start.

438
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,912
Then traffic...
i barely got there.

439
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,552
So a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

440
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,193
Did it work out okay?

441
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,911
Yeah. Great.

442
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,671
I'll check on dessert.

443
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,671
I'm done.

444
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,152
The great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

445
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,118
I set them up on all of Juno's
shipping agents and her clients.

446
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,151
Faisil's made a list
of all the possible contacts...

447
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,151
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

448
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,390
Now all we have
to do is sit around...

449
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,230
Hey. This national security stuff
boring you?

450
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,631
- Put a tap on her phone.
- What? I already did that.

451
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,793
I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap
on her office line and the house. Now.

452
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,639
Come over here for a second.
That sounds great.

453
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,513
I want to ask you about something.
I got two words to describe that idea...

454
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,552
in-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. You know that.

455
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,599
And you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.

456
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,073
Do it.

457
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,111
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk?</i>

458
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,589
<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

459
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,354
I can't talk long. Can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

460
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,550
I suppose so. Where?

461
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,310
Same place, 1:00.
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

462
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,630
<i>Remember, I need you.</i>

463
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,958
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

464
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,313
You know... darn it...

465
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,274
i'm going to meet Allison.
We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

466
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,992
No problem.

467
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,070
I think you're going about
this whole thing all wrong.

468
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,231
Women... they like you
to talk to them.

469
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,828
Maybe it's just that you're not
in touch with your feminine side.

470
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,430
I was watching <i>Sally Jessy Raphael...</i>
All right.

471
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,319
I got all the usual stuff here...
a telemetry burst transmitter.

472
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,273
I got a GPS tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.

473
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,399
I've got it sewn into the lining here...
Hey, Harry?

474
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,193
If you need to talk,
speak into the purse.

475
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,752
Here she comes. She's gonna pop out
right in front of us. Watch this.

476
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,552
Bingo.

477
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,670
Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

478
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,669
She's parking.

479
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,433
Okay, give me audio.

480
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,831
You sure you weren't followed?

481
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,390
No. I kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but i didn't see anyone.

482
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,710
Okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.

483
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,992
If i get a signal,
i may have to leave suddenly.

484
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,519
I understand.

485
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,951
Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

486
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,312
<i>I feel bad about bringing you into this,</i>
<i>but you're the only one I can trust.</i>

487
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,673
Were you out on a mission?

488
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,868
We say "op," covert operation.
And this one, well, got a little rough.

489
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,230
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo.

490
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,592
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

491
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,632
- The guy's a spook.
- But for whom?

492
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,711
He could be working her
to get to you.

493
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,711
- Did you read the papers yesterday?
- Yes.

494
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,551
Sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.

495
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,069
You see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...

496
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,800
<i>in a running shootout,</i>
<i>ending at the Marriott?</i>

497
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,399
That was you?

498
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,873
- Me.
- <i>You're very good.</i>

499
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,149
You recognized my style.

500
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,788
You're a natural at this.

501
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,070
The guy's a fake.
He's taking credit for our moves.

502
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,629
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

503
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,311
Two of them
won't bother me again.

504
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,711
- Unbelievable.
- <i>You chased one?</i>

505
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,589
Something came over me. I had to nail
this guy no matter what the risk.

506
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,354
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times, but i...

507
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,870
- i really can't take credit.
- Why not?

508
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,314
It's the training. It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

509
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,271
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

510
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,352
I'm starting to like this guy.

511
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,637
We still gotta kill him.
That's a given, you know.

512
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,030
The guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.

513
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,754
This keeps getting better and better!

514
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,469
I'm sorry.
I know this has gotta be painful.

515
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,279
But you gotta admit it's funny.
If it was just some idiot, not you...

516
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,550
you'd be laughing your ass off.

517
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,551
One born every minute.

518
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,229
It wants you too.
Feel it vibrate?

519
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,914
- Say, how about a little spin?
- Sure.

520
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,153
See, it's not just a car.
It's a total image. An identity.

521
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,953
You have to go for it.
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

522
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,753
To tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.

523
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,791
But that's not the idea, is it?

524
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,713
What are we talking about here?
Pussy, right?

525
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,391
Absolutely.

526
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,472
Let's face it.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

527
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,710
But it's not enough.

528
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,071
If you really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.

529
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,952
I suppose you have an angle.

530
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,752
It's killer.

531
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,753
I mean, look at me.
I'm not that much to look at.

532
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,911
No, no, no.
I can be honest.

533
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,430
But i got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either.

534
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,471
- Well, some are.
- What's your angle?

535
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,919
No, sorry. Trade secret.

536
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,838
Okay, just ask yourself:

537
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,791
What do women really want?

538
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,713
You take these bored housewives
married to the same guy for years.

539
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,751
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release.

540
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,309
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

541
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,351
I create that for them.

542
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,750
So basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

543
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,832
- I couldn't do that.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?

544
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,791
Think of it as playing a role.
It's fantasy.

545
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,791
You gotta work on their dreams...

546
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,390
get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

547
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,471
- What about their husbands?
- Dickless!

548
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,712
I mean, let's face it.
If they took care of business...

549
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,269
i'd be out of business,
you know what i mean?

550
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,231
Those idiots.

551
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,471
You mind keeping it under 90?

552
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,949
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

553
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,270
So, who are you
working on right now?

554
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,431
I always got a couple on the hook.

555
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,831
There's this one right now,
i got her panting like a dog.

556
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,070
- It's great.
- What does she do?

557
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,879
Some sort of legal secretary
or something.

558
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,389
You know,
uptight and conservative.

559
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,710
But she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

560
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,990
And with you,
she gets to be real hot.

561
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,390
Red hot!
Her thighs steam.

562
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,120
It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

563
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,834
- Married to some boring jerk.
- Some boring jerk?

564
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,270
He doesn't appreciate her.
She's like all these babes.

565
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,512
You get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

566
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,030
She's got the most incredible body,
and a pair of titties...

567
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,549
make you want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.

568
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,631
Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

569
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,712
So, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

570
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,671
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

571
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,713
See?

572
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,071
You and this car were made
for each other. Why fight it?

573
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,471
Sure, i got a couple other buyers
on the line, but i like your style.

574
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,591
So, what do you say?

575
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,950
Should we start up
the paperwork?

576
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,832
Let me think about it.

577
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,831
Hold it for me for a day, okay?

578
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,069
Hey, because it's you.

579
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,109
I got today's transcripts.

580
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,111
Not much going on.

581
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,990
- Nothing from Simon?
- No.

582
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,711
- My turn to drive?
- Give me the page.

583
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,711
- What?
- This jumped from page 9 to 11.

584
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,711
- Where's page 10?
- It's gotta be a typo.

585
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,711
Give me the goddam page!

586
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,759
- Seek help, Harry.
- <i>Hello?</i>

587
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,509
Helen, i need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

588
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,471
- What's happened?
- <i>It's serious.</i>

589
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,591
Meet me on K Street...

590
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,990
under the Key Bridge,
8:00 sharp.

591
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,709
Gotcha.

592
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,792
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

593
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,870
She's still at the house.

594
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,911
<i>The purse is still at the house.</i>

595
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,473
Shit.

596
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,594
Unit Two, Unit Seven,
immediate roll.

597
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,234
Acquire subject
at K Street and Key Bridge.

598
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,750
Vehicle is red and white convertible.
You got exactly six minutes.

599
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,440
Wait a minute.
Are you out of your mind?

600
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,870
You can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to follow your wife.

601
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,073
That's a misappropriation of resources
and a breach of national security.

602
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,589
You copy?
You're losing it big-time, man.

603
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,393
- I have to stop you.
- What are you gonna do, tell?

604
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,114
Look, goddam it.
Both of our butts are on the line.

605
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,471
So your life's in the crapper.
Your wife's banging a used car salesman.

606
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,632
It's humiliating, i know,
but take it like a man!

607
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,274
- You tell on me, i tell on you.
- What are you talking about?

608
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,198
I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
I'm as clean as...

609
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,151
What about when you blew
a six-week operation...

610
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,153
because you were busy
getting a blow-job?

611
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,350
You knew about that?

612
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,951
Let's take Franklin.
It's quicker.

613
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,389
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

614
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,630
Two here.
Suspect vehicle in sight.

615
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,591
<i>One male, one female.</i>

616
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,320
Now, don't be alarmed.

617
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,954
If i'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

618
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,230
You should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.

619
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,229
Here, let me help you.

620
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,593
That's better.

621
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,231
<i>Now the woman has her head</i>
<i>in the guy's lap.</i>

622
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,193
<i>Southbound on the Key Bridge.</i>
<i>Two in pursuit.</i>

623
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,511
Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual?

624
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,870
<i>Roger, One. This is Condor.</i>
<i>Subject is in sight.</i>

625
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,031
<i>Repeat: We have the ball.</i>

626
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,993
<i>We got a pretty good lockup</i>
<i>on infrared.</i>

627
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,993
<i>She's got her head</i>
<i>in the guy's lap, all right.</i>

628
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,589
Maybe she's sleepy.

629
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,231
This is a safe house.

630
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,994
My place in the city
is a little too hot right now.

631
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,031
So is the penthouse in New York.

632
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,991
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

633
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,271
I want you to be my wife.

634
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,231
But i'm married!

635
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,552
It's just for the operation in Paris.
I need to be married.

636
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,551
They'll be looking for a man
travelling alone.

637
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,553
You want me to go to Paris?

638
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,069
Paris, with a quick stopover
in London.

639
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,994
There's a double agent in my outfit.
I don't know who.

640
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,389
There's no one i can trust,
except you.

641
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,391
Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

642
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,391
I just don't know.

643
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,790
Of course. I'm rushing you.
Forgive me.

644
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,150
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

645
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,600
Let me pour you some more wine.

646
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,029
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

647
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,470
You just saved my life.

648
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,319
You are incredibly brave.

649
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,069
I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

650
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,589
You see, for me
fear is not an option.

651
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,548
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

652
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,752
we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other.

653
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,751
The enemy can spot a fake easily.

654
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,831
- You see what i mean?
- Sorry.

655
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,831
That reaction could
get us both killed.

656
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,310
- I'm sorry.
- We can't afford that.

657
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,953
Try to relax.

658
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,031
It's just been a long time...

659
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,390
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

660
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,909
- It's a little difficult.
- I know.

661
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,679
- It's awkward for me too.
- I'm sorry.

662
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,872
- That's all right. Just sit back.
- I'm okay.

663
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,471
There. That's better.

664
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,270
Just let yourself
slip into the role.

665
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,114
That's it.

666
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,071
There you go.

667
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,194
Just let yourself go.

668
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,639
That's good.

669
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,432
That's great.

670
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,953
That's it.

671
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,469
No, i can't do this.
I can't do this.

672
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,239
- What's wrong? It's okay.
- I cannot do this.

673
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,713
I cannot do this!

674
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,149
If not for me...

675
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,151
do it for your country?

676
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,150
Oh, God!
Don't hurt me!

677
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,111
I'll do whatever you want!

678
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,272
Please!
I didn't do anything!

679
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,473
Damn it!

680
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,270
Take her! Take her!
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

681
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,200
Son of a bitch!

682
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,911
<i>Sit down.</i>

683
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,749
<i>I said sit down.</i>

684
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,269
<i>Who do you work for?</i>

685
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,432
Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krumpnick.

686
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,711
- I'm just a legal secretary.
- Sure, Mrs Tasker.

687
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,348
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>with the international terrorist...</i>

688
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,471
<i>Carlos theJackal,</i>
<i>taking dictation?</i>

689
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,279
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

690
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,231
I don't know anything
about a faction.

691
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,119
I just met Simon...

692
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,879
or whoever you say he is...

693
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,831
just a couple weeks ago.

694
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,479
I barely know him.

695
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,431
That's not what it looked like
when we found you.

696
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,628
How did you meet him?

697
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,993
Well...

698
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,480
Keep this for me.
I can't afford to be taken with it.

699
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,160
- What?
- It's a matter of national security.

700
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,353
Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

701
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,311
Oh, shit.

702
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,469
<i>Why did you continue</i>
<i>to see him?</i>

703
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,511
He said he needed my help.

704
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,989
<i>Not because you were</i>
<i>attracted to him?</i>

705
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,238
You were not attracted
to him at all?

706
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,469
Well, maybe just a little.

707
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,831
- So, is cheating a common thing for you?
- Never.

708
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,872
So you're telling me
this was your first time?

709
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,508
I wasn't cheating!

710
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,790
Tell me about your husband,
Mrs Tasker.

711
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,909
What can i say about Harry?

712
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,110
He's a sales rep
for a computer company.

713
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,028
So sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag any more?

714
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,630
That is none of your goddam business!
What kind of questions are these?

715
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,354
<i>You're in a lot of trouble,</i>
<i>so I suggest you cooperate.</i>

716
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,789
If we want to know the most
intimate details about your life...

717
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,110
you'd better tell us.

718
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,671
My husband is a good man.

719
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,673
But he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?

720
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,753
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

721
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,713
<i>Why did you go</i>
<i>to Carlos'hideout?</i>

722
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,633
He wanted me to go to Paris with him
on a mission...

723
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,230
to pose as his wife.

724
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,191
And you agreed?

725
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,112
<i>Why?</i>

726
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,078
I don't know.

727
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,430
<i>I guess I needed something.</i>

728
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,873
What did you need?

729
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,474
I needed to feel alive.

730
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,112
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

731
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,111
And it felt really good...

732
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,111
to be needed.

733
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,951
And to be trusted.

734
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,038
And to be special.

735
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,991
It's just that there's...

736
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,151
so much i wanted to do
with this life...

737
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,589
and it's like
i haven't done any of it.

738
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,433
And the sand's running out
of the hourglass...

739
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,199
and i wanted to be able
to look back and say...

740
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,709
"See? I did that!

741
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,589
I was reckless and i was wild
and i fucking did it!"

742
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,391
<i>Quite frankly,</i>
<i>I don't give a shit...</i>

743
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,630
<i>whether you understand that or not.</i>

744
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,554
This Simon...

745
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,671
did you sleep with him?

746
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,751
- No.
- She's lying.

747
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,591
You did not have
sexual relations with him?

748
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,992
Listen, if you're gonna ask me
every question twice...

749
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,789
this is gonna take a really long time,
and i have to get back to my family.

750
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,190
You're not going anywhere, lady.

751
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,158
Just let me out of here!

752
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,952
<i>Answer the question.</i>

753
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,793
- Answer the question!
- No!

754
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,832
I did not...

755
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,679
sleep with him!

756
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,313
Calm down, please.

757
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,631
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

758
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,593
- Calm down.
- She could be telling the truth.

759
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,711
Calm down, Mrs Tasker.

760
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,313
<i>Calm down, please.</i>

761
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,109
I've only one more question,
Mrs Tasker.

762
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,429
What?

763
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,150
Do you still love your husband?

764
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,232
Yes, i love him.

765
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,954
I've always loved him...

766
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,230
and i will always love him.

767
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,949
She loves you.
Now what?

768
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,833
There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs Tasker.

769
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,831
<i>You must work for us.</i>

770
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,791
What are you doing?

771
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,229
- Just giving her a little assignment.
- You gotta be shitting me!

772
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,631
She wants a little adventure,
so i'm gonna give her one.

773
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,712
I'm offering you a choice.

774
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,990
If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

775
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,429
and you can go back
to your normal life.

776
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,398
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

777
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,832
<i>and your husband and daughter</i>
<i>will be left humiliated and alone.</i>

778
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,030
<i>Your life will be destroyed.</i>

779
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,190
Gee. Let me think.

780
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,590
<i>Yes or no?</i>

781
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,591
Of course yes.

782
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,591
What's involved?

783
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,990
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

784
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,072
The code name of your contact
will be Boris.

785
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,112
Your code name will be...

786
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,231
- Natasha?
- <i>No.</i>

787
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,029
Doris.

788
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,994
Pricks!

789
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,318
You son of a bitch. Did you think
you could elude us forever, Carlos?

790
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,034
Wait! You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon.

791
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,311
Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

792
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,789
I haven't seen your face...

793
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,751
Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

794
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,679
It's you!

795
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,109
Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

796
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,151
Hey, Carlos.
The game's over.

797
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,390
Your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.

798
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,873
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

799
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,389
I sell cars.
That's all!

800
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,159
Come on.
I'm not a terrorist.

801
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,353
I'm actually a complete coward.
If i ever saw a gun i'd... Oh, God!

802
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,273
Oh, please, don't!
Don't kill me!

803
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,200
I'm not a spy.

804
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,869
I'm nothing!
I'm navel lint!

805
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,830
I have to lie to women to get laid.
And i don't score much.

806
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,991
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic.

807
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,914
Oh, God.

808
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,829
Would a spy pee himself?
Huh?

809
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,830
Please, i'm not worth a bullet.

810
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,470
- Have mercy, sir.
- Get the fuck out of here.

811
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,232
Just beat it.
Go on.

812
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,311
As soon as i turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

813
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,152
You're gonna shoot me!

814
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,352
Please! You can have
the car for free.

815
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,311
What do you say, huh?

816
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,359
Get lost, dipshit.

817
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,438
So last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.

818
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,072
My flat tyre?

819
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,071
Actually, it was a little scary...

820
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,073
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

821
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,679
I'll get it.

822
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,999
Hello?

823
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,599
<i>Doris?</i>

824
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,632
Yes?

825
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,839
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

826
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,793
In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

827
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,711
- <i>and dress sexy.</i>
- What?

828
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,392
No, no.
Turn around.

829
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,432
Do it <i>doucement.</i>

830
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,391
Do it very slowly.

831
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,590
You've reached a new
all-time low.

832
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,711
I can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the Marquis.

833
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,190
Do you think i can afford
a suite like this on my salary?

834
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,151
- <i>Is Jean-Claude done yet?</i>
- Hang on.

835
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,151
Who wrote this shit? Harry?

836
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,759
It's going great.

837
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,910
Do you have an envelope for Doris?

838
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,032
This is Doris.

839
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,789
Listen, you are
a prostitute named Michelle.

840
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,713
Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

841
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,354
<i>He is a suspected arms dealer.</i>

842
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,072
Now, wait a minute.

843
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,988
You don't expect me to, uh,
you know.

844
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,032
No. He has particular tastes.

845
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,072
<i>He likes to watch.</i>

846
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,591
Tell him that his regular girl,
Carla, is sick.

847
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,029
<i>If he likes you,</i>
<i>he will tell you what to do.</i>

848
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,191
You must plant the bug...

849
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:51,591
<i>near the telephone by the bed</i>
<i>before you leave.</i>

850
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,354
If you do not
complete your mission...

851
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,311
the deal is off.

852
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,951
I'm gonna go to hell.
