00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,456
...a lot of stuff that
he just doesn't understand

4
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,926
about the world
that I understand

5
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,061
that makes...
It makes all my actions

6
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:46,562
when I move
through the world...

7
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,997
I do things better because
I can see it all laid out

8
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,867
like a map. Have you
ever looked at a map?

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,434
-Yes.
-Do you know how to read a map?

10
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,837
When I'm not mistaken.

11
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,305
-Do you know how to read a map?
-Yeah.

12
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:56,338
Your father's
a perfectly good guy,

13
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,107
but there's a lot of stuff

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,442
that he just doesn't
understand about the world

15
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,009
-that I understand.
-My dad...

16
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,278
-Wait. Listen.
-My daddy's...

17
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,046
I haven't asked you
a question yet.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,113
I haven't
asked you a question.

19
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,449
-Listen.
-My daddy...

20
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,217
Don't tell your mother.
Shut up! By quiet.

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,853
Shush. I haven't asked
you the question yet.

22
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,553
I haven't asked you
anything. Listen.

23
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,623
Quiet. We got it.
Don't worry about it.

24
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:14,591
Listen.

25
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,392
If there was...

26
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:19,462
If you could take one guy
to an island with you

27
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:21,865
and you knew you'd be safe
because he was the best man

28
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:23,466
and he was going to
figure out how to survive,

29
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:24,867
he was going
to make everything...

30
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,170
Make the world a good place
on the island,

31
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:28,503
he was going
to keep you happy,

32
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:32,075
he... this is the best man
for the job, no matter what,

33
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,642
if it was between me
and your father,

34
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:35,211
-who would you say?
-My daddy.

35
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,545
I don't see...
Hang on a second.

36
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,046
Hang on a second.
Listen.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,016
I think you're
wrong about that.

38
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:40,849
It's your choice to make,

39
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:42,885
but I want you
to understand something:

40
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,052
that there's a lot of...

41
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,356
Hey. Pick up...
What hap... What is that?

42
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:48,525
You can't leave your
fishing rod like that.

43
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:10,380
I don't know why the hell
it keeps dripping.

44
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,582
All night long...
Drip, drip, drip.

45
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,118
I've had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.

46
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,653
You need a new stopper.

47
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:19,022
Is that it?

48
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,490
Your stopper's...

49
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:22,258
It's rotted
all around the edges,

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,592
so it's not making
a seal.

51
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,362
The water's going to drip
through to the bowl.

52
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,400
I could...

53
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,201
I could bring you
a new one tomorrow.

54
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:37,407
Or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,309
What do you recommend?

56
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,111
I could replace
the stopper first.

57
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:44,380
If that doesn't work,

58
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,415
I could replace
the whole apparatus.

59
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,585
You can't give me a
professional recommendation?

60
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,220
Well,

61
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:53,489
it's really up to you.

62
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,592
Tomorrow

63
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,294
my sister-in-law's
coming over

64
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,430
with the nephews.

65
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:02,397
I got to take the car in.

66
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:19,549
No, it's my sister Jeanine's
oldest daughter's bat mitzvah.

67
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,117
<i>sank 200 ships...</i>

68
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm looking forward
to being bored to death.

69
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,754
<i>The storm demonstrated
the need for more...</i>

70
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:29,025
The girl doesn't want it,
her father doesn't want it,

71
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,461
and don't even ask me.

72
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,496
Seven hours in the car.

73
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,431
<i>charge and leave
their cities...</i>

74
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:37,600
I could really
slit my throat.

75
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:43,039
But well.
The little girls are charming.

76
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,658
Lee, I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:05,160
That's okay.

78
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,496
This is so gross.

79
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:07,998
That's all right.

80
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,642
No, tell him to come.

81
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,611
Okay. Yeah.

82
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:26,616
But... But... But, Cindy,
I have to tell you something.

83
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:30,319
I'm, like, in love
with my janitor.

84
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,787
Is that sick?

85
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,657
Have you ever had a sexual
fantasy about your handyman?

86
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,628
Well, it's awkward because
he's literally, like,

87
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,664
cleaning the shit out of
my toilet bowl right now,

88
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,634
and I don't think
I'm at my most alluring.

89
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,536
Yeah, maybe you're right.

90
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:49,071
It's not like I
met him socially.

91
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:51,373
Okay, thank you, Cindy.

92
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:55,077
Okay. Like 20 minutes. Bye.

93
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:07,523
Hi. All set.

94
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,192
Thank you so much.

95
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,225
You're welcome.

96
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,493
Can I give you a tip?

97
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,695
You mean
like a suggestion?

98
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,231
No. I mean like a tip.

99
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,402
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,272
-Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:24,306
Good night.

102
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,407
Good night. Goodbye.

103
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:41,324
I mean, how many times do I have
to fix these fucking pipes?

104
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:42,558
Every time I take a shower,

105
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,226
the entire apartment
has a flood.

106
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,895
It's driving me insane.

107
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,863
Well, I'll get you
a plumber here tomorrow,

108
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:50,233
but I'd say we're going to
have to break through the tile

109
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,867
and isolate the leak because there's
quite a lot of water down there.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,436
How do you know it's me?
Why is it automatically me?

111
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,606
Because if it was coming
from higher up,

112
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,573
you'd have water damage
in your ceiling

113
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,575
or in your wall,
and it's all dry.

114
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,145
Great.

115
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:07,450
It might just be the caulking.

116
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,718
This whole tub
needs to be recaulked.

117
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,587
Have you taken a bath or a shower
in the last couple of hours?

118
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,755
Yes.

119
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:15,590
It might just be that.

120
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,559
Okay. And how are you
planning to find that out?

121
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:18,794
Well, we could
run the shower

122
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:20,262
and see if it drips
downstairs.

123
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,431
You want me to take
a shower right now?

124
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:23,633
No.

125
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,933
You want me to take
a shower right now

126
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,635
while you stand there
watching to see

127
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,671
if it drips into
the Friedrichs' apartment?

128
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:30,739
I don't give a fuck

129
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,207
what you do, Mrs. Olsen.

130
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,377
I'm just trying to fix
the fucking leak.

131
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:43,452
I... I like that.

132
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,655
How dare you
talk to me like that.

133
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,590
Get the fuck
out of my fucking house.

134
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,193
-Okay.
-Get the fuck

135
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:53,763
out of my fucking house
before I call the police.

136
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:54,496
All right.

137
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,631
Did you hear me?
I said get out.

138
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,800
I can't. You're blocking
the doorway.

139
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,703
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

140
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,872
You can't talk to
the tenants like that.

141
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,241
Look, Lee,
you do good work.

142
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,175
You're dependable.

143
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,644
But I get these complaints
all the time.

144
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:11,681
You're rude,
you're unfriendly.

145
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,949
You won't say good morning.
I mean, come on.

146
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:16,685
Mr. Emery,
I fix the plumbing,

147
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,222
take out the garbage,
paint their apartments.

148
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:20,056
I do electrical work,

149
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,491
which we both know
is against the law.

150
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,625
I show up on time.

151
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,660
I'm working four buildings,

152
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:27,729
and you're getting
all the money.

153
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:30,266
So do whatever
you're going to do.

154
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:33,702
Would you be willing to
apologize to Mrs. Olsen?

155
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,337
For what?

156
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,510
All right. All right.
I'll talk to her.

157
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:44,981
-Here, Lee.
-Thanks.

158
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,515
-How are you doing?
-Good.

159
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,986
How's things going,
all right?

160
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,354
Yeah.

161
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:52,420
Watch the game?

162
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:53,521
Yeah, I did.

163
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:54,623
You think
they got a shot?

164
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,657
-No.
-You bet?

165
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:56,859
Yeah, I would.

166
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,593
They dropped the first two.

167
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,429
They're going
to lose the next three.

168
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:04,766
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

169
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:10,305
My God. I'm so sorry.

170
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:11,373
That's okay.

171
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,407
Did I get you?

172
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:13,709
Yes.

173
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,943
-I got you...
-That's okay.

174
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,611
-Let me get you some napkins.
-I'm okay.

175
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,314
Hey, Lenny, can I
grab some napkins?

176
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:21,049
Thanks.

177
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,851
Thank you.

178
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,053
Here.

179
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:25,488
Thanks.

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,423
It's okay.

181
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,864
Well, now I spilled
my beer all over you,

182
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,765
-my name's Sharon.
-Thank you.

183
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,500
Thank you for finally
stepping up...

184
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,669
It's okay.

185
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:41,937
And you are?

186
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,606
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

187
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,741
-Lee.
-Does that sound like me?

188
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:46,741
-No.
-Come on.

189
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,611
get to her, she
tries to pick up a tip.

190
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,413
I...

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,488
-Ask anybody.
-Okay.

192
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,348
Here he comes.

193
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,361
How you doing?

194
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,731
-How you doing?
-Good. I'm good.

195
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:19,534
Hey, can I ask you guys,
do you know me?

196
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,871
-I don't think so.
-Yeah, I don't think so either.

197
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:23,972
We never met?

198
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,607
-No.
-No, not yet.

199
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,410
-No, I don't think so.
-No.

200
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:31,447
So what the fuck
are you looking at me for?

201
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,749
-Excuse me?
-I said what the fuck are you looking at me for?

202
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,717
-Hey, take a fuckin' walk.
-Sir, we weren't looking at you.

203
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,852
No, don't apologize
to this asshole.

204
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:40,890
-Take a fuckin' hike.
-We weren't looking at you, seriously.

205
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,526
Come on, man! Hey!

206
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,998
Let me go!
I gotta go take a hike!

207
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,732
I wanna take a fuckin' hike!

208
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,789
Hello, this is Lee.

209
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:28,864
Okay.

210
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,665
When did that happen?

211
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,236
Well, how's he doing now?

212
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,312
No, don't do that.

213
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,515
I'm gonna come up there
right now.

214
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:50,919
I'll be up there
in an hour and a half.

215
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,721
Okay?

216
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:53,923
Thank you.

217
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,558
Bye.

218
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:09,170
Mr. Emery, it's Lee again.
I contacted Jose.

219
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:12,340
He can cover me
till Friday night at least.

220
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:17,012
After that, Gene MacAdavey
will take over until I get back.

221
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:19,681
I wouldn't do anything

222
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:22,918
with the ceiling until you you
get a real plumber in there.

223
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,754
But what are you gonna do?

224
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:28,590
I will, let you know as soon
as I have more information.

225
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,026
I should be in Manchester
a week at least.

226
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,661
Thank you very much. Bye.

227
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,779
Come on!

228
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,752
Go!

229
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:37,793
<i>Social services volunteer
to inpatient admitting.</i>

230
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:41,664
<i>Can we get a social services
volunteer to inpatient admitting?</i>

231
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,808
-Hey, Lee.
-Is he dead?

232
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm sorry, Lee.

233
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,116
He passed away
about an hour ago.

234
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm so sorry.

235
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,366
-Did you see him?
-No.

236
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,034
-I mean, I brought him in.
-George brought him in.

237
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,972
We were looking at
the boat this morning,

238
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:25,707
and he just...

239
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,009
I don't know, he just,
like, fell over.

240
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,813
I thought he was kidding me
at first.

241
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:34,982
Then I called the ambulance,
and...

242
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:35,985
that was it.

243
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:43,124
I'll just call Dr. Muller
and tell him that you're here.

244
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:44,726
Where's Dr. Betheny?

245
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,295
She's on maternity leave.
Here he is.

246
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,299
Lee, I'm Dr. Muller.
We spoke on the phone.

247
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:53,736
-Yeah, hi.
-I'm very, very sorry.

248
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:57,138
-Thank you.
-Hello, George.

249
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,006
-Hiya, Jim.
-How you holding up?

250
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,844
Great, you know?

251
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:04,346
-It's a very sad day.
-Yeah.

252
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,318
Where's my brother?

253
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,188
He's downstairs.
You can see him if you want.

254
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,024
What happened to him?

255
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,525
Just a cardiac arrest.

256
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,962
You know his heart's
very weak at this point.

257
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,496
It just gave out.

258
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,099
I'm really sorry
you couldn't get here in time,

259
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:25,868
but as I told you before...

260
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,303
Fuck this.

261
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,080
Sorry.

262
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:41,182
-That's okay, buddy.
-That's perfectly all right.

263
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:44,085
Did anybody call my uncle?

264
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,821
It's their Uncle Donny.

265
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:47,523
Yeah, my aunt and uncle.

266
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:48,990
-Somebody should have called...
-No, Lee. Lee, no.

267
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,459
-What? What?
-Donny got a job in Minnesota.

268
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:53,829
-Like, a while ago.
-Minnesota?

269
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:57,231
Yeah, he got a job
in some outfit

270
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,301
in Minnetonka, Minnesota,

271
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,969
if you can believe that.

272
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,573
-Joe didn't tell you about that?
-No.

273
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,442
<i>Dr. Hallerin,
if you're on fourth floor,</i>

274
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:08,910
<i>please come
to the nurses station.</i>

275
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,312
I can call him
if you want, Lee,

276
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:12,247
and tell him what happened.

277
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,819
-Okay, thanks.
-No problem.

278
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,486
Tell him what happened.

279
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,223
Tell him I'll call him tonight.

280
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:25,026
Talk about arrangements.

281
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,229
Somebody should call my wife.

282
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:30,232
-Your...
-Ex-wife.

283
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:31,934
-You mean Randi?
-Randi.

284
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,002
-Yes, I'm sorry. I meant Randi.
-That's okay.

285
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,838
I already thought of that.
I'll take care of it.

286
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,273
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.

287
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:41,008
-Can I see him now?
-Sure.

288
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,312
Lee, I can wait up here.

289
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:45,146
Lee, if you need anything.

290
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,815
Okay.

291
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:50,351
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

292
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,527
Would you like a Kleenex?

293
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,429
-Yeah, thanks. Yeah.
-Yeah.

294
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:03,332
Can I get a couple Kleenex,
please?

295
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:04,498
Thanks, hon.

296
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,305
-I'm sorry.
-Please.

297
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:24,186
-How is Dr. Betheny?
-She's doing very well.

298
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:25,019
She just had twin girls.

299
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,622
-Irene told me that.
-Yeah.

300
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:31,059
I call this afternoon
and tell her what happened.

301
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:33,227
She was very good to him.

302
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:36,064
Yeah, she was.

303
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:40,001
The disease is commonly referred
to as congestive heart failure.

304
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,371
-My God.
-Are you familiar with it?

305
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,238
-No.
-Then what are you saying "My God" for?

306
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:47,643
-Because... What is it?
-She's trying to explain it, honey.

307
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:50,512
-I'm sorry, Dr. Beth...
-Betheny.

308
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:53,047
-Betheny, I'm sorry.
-Not a problem.

309
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,384
So you were saying.

310
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:59,420
It's a gradual deterioration
of the muscles of the heart.

311
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,323
It's usually associated
with older people.

312
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,492
But in rare cases, it will
occur in a younger person.

313
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:08,563
Some people live up to 50-60 years
with just an occasional attack.

314
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:11,232
But most people suffer
periodic episodes,

315
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,034
like the one you had
on Monday,

316
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,435
which mimic the symptoms
of a heart attack,

317
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,371
and which further weaken
the muscle.

318
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:19,240
They can put you out of
commission for a week, two weeks.

319
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,275
And you'll need to be hospitalized
so we can monitor your heart,

320
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,579
because the risk of cardiac arrest
is elevated for a week or two.

321
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:26,348
-My God.
-It's okay.

322
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,382
But in between, most
people feel perfectly healthy

323
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,552
You can basically live
a normal life.

324
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:35,222
Wait. So what do you mean some
people live to be 50-60 years?

325
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:36,591
I mean, are you saying total?

326
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,626
Or are saying when
they're diagnosed with this?

327
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,161
Or what? What are you saying?

328
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,996
And tell me the fuckin' truth.

329
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,398
Total.

330
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,702
For most people with the
particulars of your condition,

331
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:51,172
the average life expectancy
is five to ten years.

332
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:01,549
The statistics vary widely.
You're not a statistic.

333
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:03,384
You're just one person,

334
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:07,421
and we don't know what's
gonna happen to you yet.

335
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,625
But it's not a good disease.

336
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:14,729
What is a good disease?

337
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:18,100
-Poison Ivy.
-Athlete's Foot?

338
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,101
-It's a comedy routine.
-Elise, please.

339
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,402
-For Christ's sake.
-My God!

340
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:23,005
When am I gonna put
one foot right?

341
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:25,306
-How about a hint?
-Elise...

342
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,209
-Daddy.
-What?

343
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,445
She's fine.

344
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:31,645
We're all upset.

345
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,115
We're all gonna listen,

346
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:36,184
then we're gonna ask any of
the questions we wanna ask,

347
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:38,486
and then we're gonna figure out
what to do together, right?

348
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,488
-Right.
-Sure.

349
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:42,758
So you were saying,
Dr. Beth.

350
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,693
-Betheny, Dad.
-It's Dr. Betheny, Dad. Get it right.

351
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,428
I do not see where the humor
lies in this situation.

352
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,230
-Elise, you must calm down.
-No.

353
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,366
-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to...
-No, no, don't.

354
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,168
No more. I'm not gonna. Nope.

355
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,603
-Elise, let me get you a glass of water.
-No.

356
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:59,474
-Daddy, forget it.
-Forget it like you.

357
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,509
Everybody should be
just like you.

358
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:04,646
You know what? I am tired
of being the bad guy here.

359
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,480
Jesus Christ! Who's in
the fuckin' hospital here?

360
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,483
Right. Right.
So I'll be the bad guy,

361
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:11,519
and you be in the hospital and
explain the jokes to your son.

362
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:13,688
-I'm going home.
-You're going home?

363
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,824
-You're going home?
-Yep!

364
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,693
-Let me get her back.
-Fuck her.

365
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:21,729
-Come on with that stuff already!
-Stop that shit!

366
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,055
Thank you, Tony.

367
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,284
Thank you.

368
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,524
I have to get up to Manchester.

369
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:30,958
Nobody told Patrick, right?

370
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,461
No, you had asked for us
to wait for you to get here.

371
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,797
-Yes. Thank you.
-Okay.

372
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,669
So, what is
the procedure now?

373
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:44,639
Now you have to make arrangements
with a funeral parlor.

374
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:46,842
And they pretty much
take care of everything.

375
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:49,678
I don't know the name of one.

376
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,512
That's all right.
We can help you with that.

377
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:53,314
Yeah.

378
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:54,549
And they'll just come
and pick him up?

379
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:55,850
-Yeah.
-Yes.

380
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:57,552
-I can make those calls, Lee.
-Okay.

381
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,321
Let me know if you need
any help with anything.

382
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:01,789
Okay. Thank you.

383
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:03,525
Yeah, we've gotta talk
about the boat

384
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,960
and the website,

385
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:07,696
and all that.

386
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:14,902
Sure. I'm around.

387
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:17,539
I gotta get up there
before school let's out, so...

388
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:20,609
You just have to sign
for Joe's belongings.

389
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:22,210
Right this way.

390
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,848
Just gotta sign right here.

391
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,553
<i>Dr. Hallerin,
if you're on fourth floor,</i>

392
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,521
<i>please come
to the nurses station.</i>

393
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:38,526
-Where's Joe's belongings?
-The plastic bag right here.

394
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:42,297
Sorry. Give me a sec.

395
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,567
Where's Joe's belongings?

396
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,669
All right, all right.
That's good. Hup!

397
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,539
Like that? Yeah, but keep
your thumb off the line,

398
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:53,608
because, if you get a strike,
it's gonna slice it right open,

399
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,043
and you know what happens then?

400
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,444
What? The sharks will
smell the blood,

401
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:59,313
and they'll rip
this boat apart.

402
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:01,282
-No, they won't.
-Yeah, they will.

403
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:02,449
Dad, will they?

404
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:03,952
-Yes, sir.
-Shut up.

405
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,621
You know, I seen a school of
sharks tear a boat to pieces

406
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:07,921
like it was made of cardboard,

407
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:10,558
because some kid threw
a Band-Aid in the water.

408
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:11,693
Yeah.

409
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,061
Yeah, he did.

410
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,864
-Yeah.
-No, you didn't.

411
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:19,467
Sometimes the only way to keep
them off is to throw the kid

412
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:21,568
directly in the ocean
to distract them.

413
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:24,406
Shut up. Sharks don't
even swim in schools.

414
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:27,508
He says sharks
don't swim in schools.

415
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,878
-Smart kid.
-Yeah, he is.

416
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,647
A really smart kid is exactly
the kind of quality meal

417
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:35,717
a humongous school of sharks is looking
for when they're circling a boat.

418
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:37,885
Uncle Lee, shut up.

419
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,888
Hey, you got a strike!
Strike, strike, strike!

420
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,790
Ease up on the drag,
and watch your fuckin' thumb!

421
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,758
-You got a strike now!
-Jesus! Don't hit me!

422
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:45,959
-No swearing!
-He got a strike!

423
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,428
-Ease up on it.
-I got it! We got it!

424
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:48,929
Drive the boat!
Mind your business!

425
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:50,765
-You gotta get the hook in him.
-What kind of fish is it?

426
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:52,534
We're fine! Shut up!
Mind your business!

427
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:54,001
-What kind of fish is it?
-Great White.

428
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,771
-It's gotta be a Great White.
-Shut up!

429
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:57,938
Or maybe a Barracuda.
Who knows?

430
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:00,107
It's not a shark!

431
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,110
-Come on, pull him up!
-It's not a shark!

432
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,879
-Just stop talking!
-Come on!

433
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:05,806
How come that's
connected to those?

434
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,041
It's not connected,
it just looks that way.

435
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,842
I'm trying to teach you
the islands.

436
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,678
That's the island
the rich guy bought

437
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,813
so no one else
would put a house on it.

438
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:12,813
That's how rich he is.

439
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:14,882
Baker Island, Misery Island.

440
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,719
Misery Island's where me
and your Aunt Randi got married.

441
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,696
-Hello?
-Yeah, hi.

442
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:31,600
Suzy, Daddy's home.

443
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:37,171
Hi, Suzy.
Daddy's home.

444
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,573
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetheart.

445
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,111
Hug.

446
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,886
Jesus Christ!
You're breaking my neck!

447
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,053
Lee?

448
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:55,823
Yeah, hang on.

449
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:01,896
-Hey. Did you have a good time?
-Yeah, really good.

450
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,665
-Where's your mother?
-They just left.

451
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:04,865
No!

452
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:06,868
Yeah, she's sorry
to miss you too.

453
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,036
Well, there's always next time.
Did you get any sleep?

454
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,806
Yeah, it's so restful
when my mother's here.

455
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,742
Too bad.
Hi, Kary.

456
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:16,744
-Hi, Daddy.
-Come here.

457
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:18,746
-Put me down.
-I'm putting you down. Relax.

458
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,482
I'm just giving you a kiss.
Honey, all right...

459
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:22,851
Karen! Karen!

460
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:24,685
-I almost dropped you on your head.
-Jesus.

461
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,755
I'm making a hair salon.

462
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:30,057
Yeah?
It's really good.

463
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:31,959
You wanna cut my hair?

464
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:33,928
It's just for girls.
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,897
That's all right.
I understand, sweetheart.

466
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,934
Can I watch TV
to get some ideas?

467
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:42,003
-No.
-Yeah.

468
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:45,005
Go ahead.

469
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,075
Get off.

470
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:50,544
God.

471
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:52,680
How you feeling?

472
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:53,982
Better.

473
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:55,984
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

474
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:57,919
You sound better.

475
00:29:57,951 --> 00:29:59,987
So did you guys actually use
the fishing tackle?

476
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:01,956
Yeah.

477
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:05,559
Patty caught a humongous
bluefish... 18 pounds.

478
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:07,528
Yeah?
Well, that's awesome.

479
00:30:07,562 --> 00:30:09,964
I never seen anybody
so happy in my whole life.

480
00:30:09,996 --> 00:30:11,533
Its nice in here.

481
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:13,133
You keep it nice.

482
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,102
-What a homemaker.
-Fuck off.

483
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,839
All right.
Get away from me.

484
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:18,939
Stop it.

485
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:21,876
Don't. Stop.

486
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:24,978
Please, I'm sick.

487
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:27,716
Okay. For real, get off of me.

488
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:35,290
-Hi, Stanny.
-God, let him alone.

489
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:37,691
-How come you're not crying?
-I just got him settled.

490
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:40,227
-When are you getting him settled for?
-Lee, don't pick him up.

491
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,164
If he's not crying,
leave well enough alone.

492
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:44,998
Leave well enough alone.
That's what me and your mommy

493
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:47,135
should have done instead
of getting married.

494
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:51,205
-Shut up.
-Then you wouldn't be here. your sisters wouldn't be here,

495
00:30:51,237 --> 00:30:54,976
and I could watch the football game in
my own living room with peace and quiet.

496
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:57,745
You know what?
You can go fuck yourself.

497
00:30:57,777 --> 00:31:00,247
Jeez Louise.
Hey, kiddo.

498
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:03,952
My gosh. You're very
handsome, you know that?

499
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:08,022
See that?
I didn't make him cry.

500
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:09,923
Up and down.

501
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:11,025
Yeah.

502
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,060
He's not crying...

503
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:14,895
'cause I know how to handle him.

504
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:18,866
-How is he?
-How's Joe?

505
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:22,035
He's fine. You know, he's...
He's all right.

506
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:24,172
Actually, he's doing all right.

507
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:27,008
And you didn't run out of beer?
You got through the day okay?

508
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,878
Yeah.
We were very temperate.

509
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,181
I don't know why you guys bother
getting on the friggin' boat.

510
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:36,117
What do you mean?
We love the sea.

511
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,053
Yeah? How many beers
did you have on the sea?

512
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:40,787
-Eight.
-Eight?

513
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,055
Yep, eight,

514
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:44,726
over a seven-hour period,
which...

515
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:47,060
I am well impressed.

516
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,662
is...

517
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:55,803
1.1428572 beers an hour.

518
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,672
It's like you didn't even have
anything to drink at all.

519
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:01,042
Yeah, I told you
I was cutting down.

520
00:32:05,012 --> 00:32:08,183
God, no. What do you
think you're gonna do?

521
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:13,086
I guess I'm gonna take a shower.

522
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,856
Randi, I swear to God.

523
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,791
You should have seen his face.

524
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:20,294
So happy.

525
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:23,765
It was like when we took the
girls on the merry-go-round.

526
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,101
I mean,
it was just pure happiness.

527
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:33,140
Come on, I'm sick.

528
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:35,108
I'm sick. I'm really,

529
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:39,113
really, deeply sick.

530
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:45,152
It's hard to breathe.

531
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:55,163
He's not at school?
I thought school left out...

532
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,330
<i>-I'm pretty sure he would have...
-What?</i>

533
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:58,832
I'm sorry, Paul, my phone is...

534
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,834
<i>-Sorry. Say that again?
-That's all right.</i>

535
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:03,171
I'm pretty sure he would have
left for hockey practice by now.

536
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:04,806
He's on the hockey team?

537
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,140
Yeah. Yeah, he's doing
real well too.

538
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,042
Hey, how's Joe doing?
He gonna be okay?

539
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:10,477
<i>Yeah, he's fine.</i>

540
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,013
Where's the practice?
Is it at the school?

541
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:14,181
No, they practice at Gloucester.

542
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,184
<i>-They practice in the...
-I'm sorry.</i>

543
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:17,451
<i>-It's not at the school?
-No.</i>

544
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,053
<i>-What? I'm sorry.
-Yeah.</i>

545
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,353
<i>-Can you hear me?
-The phone is...</i>

546
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:22,457
That's all right.
Can you hear me?

547
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,124
<i>-Yes.
-It's at Gloucester, okay?</i>

548
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:25,892
Okay. I understand.

549
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:28,162
We play with the Rockport team,
but they're the lead team.

550
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:29,997
Okay, I understand.
Thank you, Paul.

551
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,999
Yeah, sure thing.
Give Joe my regards, all right?

552
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,836
-I will.
-What's up?

553
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,037
Joe Chandler's
in the hospital again.

554
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,472
-How awful.
-Yeah.

555
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,375
-Who was on the phone?
-That was Lee Chandler.

556
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,712
-Lee Chandler?
-The very one.

557
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,722
Hey!

558
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,804
Knock it off!

559
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:13,975
Chandler! Knock it off!

560
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,776
One more time and you're out.

561
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:17,177
You understand that, Chandler?
One more time.

562
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,514
-Fuck me.
-What's that?

563
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:21,983
-Fuck my fuckin' ass.
-All right, you're out.

564
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:25,218
-Chandler, you're benched.
-All right.

565
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:27,121
Ask me if I give a shit.

566
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:30,390
What was that?

567
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,260
Coach, that's his uncle.

568
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:35,228
His father must be
in the hospital.

569
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:38,566
-Whose father, Chandlers?
-Yeah, he only comes around...

570
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,234
He's got
congestive heart failure.

571
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,303
Patrick's dad, I mean,
not... not Patrick.

572
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:46,073
<i>So that's Lee Chandler.
The Lee Chandler?</i>

573
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:48,276
Yeah, but Coach, you know
that story's bullshit, right?

574
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:49,577
Total bullshit, Coach.

575
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,144
You guys wanna watch
the language?

576
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:52,946
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

577
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,923
All right. Mind your own
business for a little while,

578
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:05,159
Let's take a break.
Get a water.

579
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:14,936
So, something going on
with your dad?

580
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:19,307
His father passed away
this morning.

581
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,108
Jeez.

582
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,476
I'm sorry to hear that.
I really am.

583
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:26,012
I... Well, listen,
do what you gotta do.

584
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,948
I... I feel terrible.

585
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:29,449
Why don't you...

586
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:32,053
All right, well,
go in and change,

587
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:35,156
and we'll talk about it later,
all right?

588
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:37,225
Go ahead.
I'll meet you outside.

589
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:40,995
-All right.
-All right. Thank you.

590
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:42,997
All right, show's over.

591
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:48,335
Come on, let's go.

592
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,637
-You all right?
-My...

593
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:52,305
Take your sticks back,
would you?

594
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,223
-Hey, I'll see you in there.
-Yeah.

595
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:11,459
-We'll talk, okay?
-I'll talk to you soon.

596
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:14,028
See you soon.
I love you.

597
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:18,332
Line it up again.

598
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:20,301
Come on, let's go.

599
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:36,017
I have to go to the hospital
and sign some more papers.

600
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,218
Do you wanna see him?

601
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:42,323
I don't know. Why?

602
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:44,258
What's he look like?

603
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:47,193
He looks like he's dead.

604
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:51,432
I mean, he doesn't look
like he's sleeping or anything.

605
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,601
But he doesn't look gross,
either.

606
00:36:58,405 --> 00:36:59,908
I don't know.

607
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:08,650
Well, you know,
you don't have to.

608
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:14,287
I wanted to see him.

609
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,556
Maybe you don't want
that image in your memory.

610
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,124
I don't...

611
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:19,559
It's up to you.

612
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,441
What do you wanna do?

613
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:36,276
You want me to take you home?

614
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:41,015
Want me to decide for you?

615
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,186
Let's just go.

616
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,289
What the fuck are you doing?

617
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:51,092
-I just said let's go inside!
-No, you said let's just go,

618
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:53,260
-and then you get out of the car?
-I meant let's go inside.

619
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:55,262
-What the matter with you?
-What's your problem?

620
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:56,731
-I could have ripped your fuckin' leg off!
-Okay, okay!

621
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:59,032
I'm sorry I misused
the English language.

622
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,475
I'm sorry, Uncle Lee.

623
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:09,977
I'm sorry, too.
I just get scared.

624
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:17,017
Yeah, okay, thank you.

625
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:19,453
Of course.

626
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:43,244
You gotta hit the bleeper.

627
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:45,646
I don't have a bleeper.

628
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,581
I'll do it.
There's a code.

629
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,067
Hey, is it okay if I invite
some of my friends over?

630
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:08,268
-I told them I would call them.
-Go ahead.

631
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:11,238
And can we get some pizza? 'Cause
there's nothing to eat here.

632
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:12,340
Okay.

633
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,278
-What kind would you like?
-Any kind is fine.

634
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,678
Thank you.

635
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,195
At least he didn't suffer.

636
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,530
It's worse for the family,
but it's better for the person.

637
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:39,233
Well, he was a fuckin' great guy,
Patrick, I'll tell you that.

638
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:40,867
That's for sure.

639
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:43,236
Yeah, I remember
this one time he...

640
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:46,673
He took us out in the boat,
like, in sixth grade.

641
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:48,141
Yeah, I remember that.

642
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,211
He made us wear
these life preservers.

643
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:51,479
And I was like, you know,

644
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:52,880
"What's the difference,
Mr. Chandler?

645
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,514
The boat sinks in this weather,
we're dead anyways."

646
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:56,684
-Yeah, I remember that.
-Then he goes,

647
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:59,887
"The life jacket's to make it easy
on the sharks once you go over."

648
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,454
Fuckin' smartass,
I swear to God.

649
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:03,858
Yeah, he really liked
those shark jokes.

650
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,693
-Funny guy.
-He was funny, man.

651
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:10,231
Yeah, he was gentle too,
you know?

652
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:12,400
Like his son.

653
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,441
So there's this former
Starship captain, all right?

654
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:23,910
<i>Jesus Christ!
With the Star Trek again?</i>

655
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,746
<i>-Will you shut the fuck up?
-Fuck you. Star Trek sucks.</i>

656
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,284
<i>-You fuckin' retard.
-Star Trek's one of the classical pillars</i>

657
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:32,253
-of modern entertainment.
-Yeah?

658
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,320
<i>Tell me about Star Trek.
Enlighten me, motherfucker.</i>

659
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:36,189
-I'll tell you this...
-How long have I been friends with you?

660
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:37,891
-How you doing, baby?
-I'm okay.

661
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:40,193
<i>Enough is enough, okay?
It's just Star Trek.</i>

662
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:41,929
<i>-How dare you! Will you shut up?
-Fuck Star Trek.</i>

663
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,631
<i>Every sci-fi classic film
you like was based on Star Trek.</i>

664
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:45,900
<i>Star Trek's bullshit.</i>

665
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:47,800
<i>-Right? Start Trek...
-Star Trek's retarded.</i>

666
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,736
<i>-Then The Road Warrior.
-Retarded.</i>

667
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,572
<i>-Then The Matrix.
-Retarded and shit.</i>

668
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:53,573
<i>I love Star Trek!</i>

669
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:55,441
-Yeah, do you?
-How dare you?

670
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:57,443
Ask Patrick. He loves 'em!
He loves 'em!

671
00:40:57,477 --> 00:40:59,613
-Patrick, what do you think?
-Go ahead, ask Patrick.

672
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:02,182
<i>I can't believe we're talking
about Star Trek right now.</i>

673
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:09,622
<i>-I like Star Trek.
-Thank you.</i>

674
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:12,825
Hey, Uncle Lee.

675
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:15,195
Is it okay
if Silvie sleeps over?

676
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:16,797
Dad always let her.

677
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:20,300
Then what are you asking me for?

678
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,536
No reason.

679
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:24,171
Thanks.

680
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,709
Not that it would
come up or anything,

681
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:32,512
but her parents thinks she stays
downstairs when she stays over.

682
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,948
So if it comes up
for some reason,

683
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,351
can you just say she stayed
in the downstairs room?

684
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:44,624
-I don't even know them.
-Yeah, you do.

685
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:46,993
It's the McGanns.
It's Frank and Pat McGann.

686
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,862
-That's Silvie McGann?
-Yeah.

687
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:53,834
-Okay.
-So...

688
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,803
Do you mind saying
she stayed downstairs,

689
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:57,905
like, if they call
or something?

690
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:59,273
Okay.

691
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:11,517
Am I supposed to tell you
to use a condom?

692
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,553
No. I mean...

693
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:17,624
-Is that what Joe would say?
-No.

694
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:21,761
Well, I mean, yeah, we've had
the discussion and everything.

695
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:23,697
-So...
-Yeah, good.

696
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:25,865
Yeah, just let me know
if we're making too much noise.

697
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:29,535
Okay.

698
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:30,971
Just fuckin' with you.

699
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:40,680
All right.

700
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:44,851
Do you think
I should call my mom

701
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:46,754
to tell her about Dad?

702
00:42:48,822 --> 00:42:51,724
-No, I wouldn't, Patty.
-Yeah.

703
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:55,462
I mean, nobody even knows
where she is.

704
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:56,729
Yeah.

705
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:59,432
Yeah, no, I was just
curious what you thought.

706
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:04,405
Anyway, good night, Uncle Lee.

707
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:05,773
Good night.

708
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:16,517
Are you gonna sulk all night long
because you dropped the goddamn ball?

709
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,885
-I'm not sulking.
-Shut up.

710
00:43:18,918 --> 00:43:21,454
If you'd use a goddamn baseball mitt,
you wouldn't drop the fuckin' ball.

711
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:24,058
-I don't need a baseball mitt!
-I catch better without one.

712
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,459
Hey, shut up.
Hey, Elise!

713
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:30,063
Shit. Hey.

714
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:33,100
Come on. Hey, Lee, you wanna
take Patty upstairs

715
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:36,736
and get him washed up?

716
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,805
-Come on, kid.
-Go on, now.

717
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:40,106
It'll be all right.
I'll be up in a minute.

718
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,508
Go on upstairs, Patty.
Everything will be okay.

719
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,911
I thought it was wonderful
how you dropped that ball.

720
00:43:44,945 --> 00:43:48,782
Okay. I didn't want
you to catch it.

721
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:53,787
Shit.

722
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,789
Go on.

723
00:43:58,057 --> 00:43:59,459
Fuck's sake.

724
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:11,838
Shut the fuck up.

725
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:53,714
Beverly, Massachusetts,
Gallagher Funeral Home, please.

726
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:55,549
Morning.

727
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:56,549
Hi.

728
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,823
Yes, hi, my name is
Lee Chandler.

729
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:06,160
My brother, Joseph Chandler,
is at the Beverly...

730
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:08,528
Hospital Morgue.
I'm wondering,

731
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:11,498
who I need to talk to about
making arrangements?

732
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:16,035
Okay, thank you.

733
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,178
Yes.

734
00:45:25,211 --> 00:45:27,648
Yes, I just spoke...

735
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,016
Yes, my name is
Lee Chandler.

736
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:33,921
My brother is at the
Beverly Hospital Morgue.

737
00:45:33,954 --> 00:45:34,722
Yes.

738
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,226
Okay.

739
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,729
I understand, I'm...

740
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,865
I'm calling to find out
exactly what I need to do

741
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:47,734
to make arrangements
for the next step.

742
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,741
I see.
Okay, thank you.

743
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,912
Can I have a napkin?

744
00:45:58,945 --> 00:46:01,247
Yes.

745
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,583
That's right, so... But what
do I gotta do to get his...

746
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,619
To get his body
over the...

747
00:46:05,651 --> 00:46:09,255
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler, I don't think
Patrick needs to be here for this.

748
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:11,691
Don't...
I'm all right.

749
00:46:11,724 --> 00:46:12,726
I understand.

750
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,063
So why is it more to
drive his body to Manchester?

751
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:17,630
So you gotta take the
highway for seven minutes,

752
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:18,765
that's why
it costs more?

753
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:21,968
Well, what does it cost
for the hearse to take 127?

754
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,936
Jesus, like,
that's his focus?

755
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,139
Jeez,
I'm all right.

756
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:31,912
Thanks, Uncle Lee.

757
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:33,647
You're welcome.

758
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,182
-Thanks, Mr. Chandler.
-You're welcome.

759
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:53,901
So...

760
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:57,303
we're gonna forget about
the language.

761
00:46:57,336 --> 00:46:59,872
We're gonna forget about
the fists.

762
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:03,643
But I want you to take
a few days off of practice.

763
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:06,146
I don't want you
on the ice.

764
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:07,814
Well, to tell you
the honest truth, sir,

765
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:10,117
I could really use
the distraction.

766
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,287
The ice is not
a distraction.

767
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,923
When you're on the ice,
you gotta be there.

768
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,958
Okay, so take
a couple days off,

769
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:20,561
and we'll talk.

770
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,864
Listen.

771
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:28,702
When I was your age,
I lost my dad, too.

772
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:31,137
So...

773
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:34,775
I know what you're...
You're goin' through.

774
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,008
If you want to
come in and talk,

775
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:40,346
or want somebody to
spill your guts to,

776
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,983
or throw the bull around,

777
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:44,251
the door's open.

778
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,895
You mind if I
put some music on?

779
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:57,164
No.

780
00:47:57,197 --> 00:47:59,032
<i>It's at 54...</i>

781
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:05,072
Do you like these guys?

782
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:08,175
The lead guitar is weak,

783
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:10,811
but otherwise
they're pretty good.

784
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:13,880
They all sound
the same to me.

785
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:20,920
Where are we goin'?

786
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:22,956
Gotta go to the lawyer.

787
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,291
What for?

788
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:27,093
To read your father's will.

789
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:29,061
Do I have to be there?

790
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:32,064
I don't think so, but I think
you're supposed to be.

791
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,035
Who do you think
he left the boat to?

792
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:39,905
I'm sure he
left you everything.

793
00:48:45,678 --> 00:48:47,615
I don't understand.

794
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,952
Which, part are you
having trouble with?

795
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:53,954
Well, I can't be
the guardian.

796
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,327
Well...

797
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,962
I mean, I can't.

798
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:08,101
Well, naturally,
I... I assumed Joe had

799
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:08,968
discussed all this with you.

800
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:11,871
No.

801
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:14,073
He didn't.

802
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:15,275
No.

803
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,945
I... I...

804
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:21,715
Sorry, I have to say,
I'm somewhat taken aback.

805
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:23,950
He can't live with me.
I live in one room.

806
00:49:23,983 --> 00:49:26,253
Well, but Joe has provided
for Patrick's upkeep.

807
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:28,421
Food, clothes,
etcetera.

808
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:29,989
And the house and the boat
are owned outright.

809
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,425
I can't commute
from Boston every day

810
00:49:31,457 --> 00:49:33,827
until he turns 18.

811
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,095
I think the idea was that
you would relocate.

812
00:49:36,128 --> 00:49:38,264
R... Relocate to where?

813
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:39,832
-Well, you look...
-Here?

814
00:49:39,865 --> 00:49:41,200
Well, as you can see,
your brother

815
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:43,202
worked everything out
extremely carefully.

816
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:44,270
-But he can't have...
-Yes.

817
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:46,006
He can't have meant that.

818
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:48,374
He's allowed
up to $5,000

819
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:50,009
to pay for moving expenses.

820
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,012
And there's...
There's also a small amount

821
00:49:52,044 --> 00:49:54,046
set aside for,
you know,

822
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:54,813
for you to draw from...

823
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:56,749
As personal income.

824
00:49:56,782 --> 00:49:58,351
While you settle in.

825
00:49:58,383 --> 00:50:00,052
I mean, assuming...

826
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:01,021
that you accept.

827
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:03,055
What about my Uncle Donny
and Aunt Teresa?

828
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:06,459
Joe didn't feel that Patrick really
had any special relationship

829
00:50:06,492 --> 00:50:07,460
-or feeling about them...
-I don't understand.

830
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:09,996
And now,
as I think you know,

831
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:11,997
they've moved out to
Wisconsin, I believe.

832
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:12,798
Minnesota.

833
00:50:12,831 --> 00:50:15,501
-Minnesota.
-Minnetonka, Minnesota.

834
00:50:15,535 --> 00:50:17,771
That's right.

835
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:37,090
It was my impression that
you'd spent a lot of time here

836
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:38,791
over the years.

837
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:40,894
I was just the back up.

838
00:50:40,927 --> 00:50:42,394
I came up here to
look after Patty, yeah,

839
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:45,197
if Joe was in the hospital
after my father couldn't do it,

840
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:46,332
but we...

841
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:49,436
It was supposed to be Donny.

842
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:51,070
I'm just the back up.

843
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:58,077
Well, I... I can just repeat
that I'm... I'm...

844
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,111
astonished that Joe didn't
run this by you,

845
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:01,213
thorough as he was.

846
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,184
Yeah, 'cause he knew what I would
say if he would have asked.

847
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:09,122
Once!
It was once!

848
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:11,358
One time nothin'.
It's nothin' but one time.

849
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,959
Stay out of this quadrant,

850
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:14,227
and you won't go home
in tears.

851
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,262
All right.

852
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,303
Hey!

853
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,238
You wanna keep it down,
you fuckin' morons?

854
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:29,108
My kids are sleepin'.

855
00:51:29,142 --> 00:51:32,946
I'm so sorry. I am... I didn't
think we were that loud.

856
00:51:32,979 --> 00:51:35,314
Lee. You wanna get these
fuckin' pinheads

857
00:51:35,347 --> 00:51:38,184
out of my house, please?

858
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:39,586
Yeah, I do.

859
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,088
Randi, I really do.

860
00:51:45,157 --> 00:51:46,926
She can't talk to us
that way.

861
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:51,398
Yeah.

862
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,568
Hey!

863
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:56,570
I'm not fuckin' around!

864
00:51:56,602 --> 00:51:58,171
It's 2:00 in
the fuckin' morning.

865
00:51:58,204 --> 00:51:59,472
Get these fuckin' assholes
dressed,

866
00:51:59,505 --> 00:52:00,907
and get 'em the fuck
out of here!

867
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:09,148
We are dressed.

868
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:12,151
She didn't mean it.
She'll apologize later.

869
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:16,189
Gotta get
out of here, man.

870
00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:17,490
-See ya later.
-Right on.

871
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:24,298
Lee.

872
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,068
-Thanks, bro. Take care!
-All right!

873
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,470
-Tell Randi we're sorry.
-Good night!

874
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:33,039
-Don't drink and drive.
-We're so sorry!

875
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:34,173
You see Jupiter?

876
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:40,646
Hey, Tommy!

877
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,549
Good night, Joe!

878
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:44,183
Sorry again!

879
00:52:46,184 --> 00:52:48,520
Go ahead. It's Jupiter,
you fuckin' idiot.

880
00:52:48,553 --> 00:52:50,389
Look at, there's
the north star right there.

881
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:52,325
-Right there.
-Where?

882
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:54,528
It's... It's due north.

883
00:53:07,572 --> 00:53:11,110
I'll clean up
in the morning.

884
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:12,946
You see Jupiter,
you fuckin' asshole?

885
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:16,316
Come on.

886
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:17,316
Fuck you.

887
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:19,085
Come on.

888
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:23,256
Lee.

889
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:36,669
Lee, nobody can appreciate
what you've been through.

890
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:38,103
If I can say that.

891
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:55,387
And if you really feel
like you can't take this on,

892
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:58,358
well, that's... that's...

893
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,526
You know,
that's your right.

894
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:00,727
-Obviously.
-So who would get him?

895
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:08,367
Patrick, can I get you
a can of soda or anything?

896
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:10,037
No, thank you.

897
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:14,240
Well, I don't know what's
happening with Patrick's mother.

898
00:54:14,273 --> 00:54:16,142
-No.
-I'm not sure where she is,

899
00:54:16,175 --> 00:54:17,410
-or what kind of condition she's in.
-No.

900
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:32,459
We can't do that.

901
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:08,061
God, no!
God!

902
00:55:08,093 --> 00:55:11,331
Fred! Fred!
My kids are in there!

903
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:12,698
My kids are in there!

904
00:55:12,731 --> 00:55:14,601
God! God!

905
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:16,635
I gotta go in there.

906
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,045
All right, we're gonna
go around the back.

907
00:56:17,597 --> 00:56:19,232
Couple of hot spots
over there.

908
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:25,137
Check out and make sure
the wiring's all right.

909
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:42,255
My God.

910
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,258
Hey, Sheehan.
Sheehan.

911
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,552
Look, Lee.

912
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:22,555
Why don't you just...

913
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:24,823
I'm gonna...
I'll be in touch.

914
00:58:24,856 --> 00:58:27,559
I'm here.

915
00:59:02,394 --> 00:59:05,564
Well, we were partying
pretty hard.

916
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:07,366
And there was beer.

917
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,570
And someone was
passin' around a joint,

918
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:11,871
and there was cocaine.

919
00:59:11,903 --> 00:59:13,672
Cocaine?

920
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:15,008
Yes.

921
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,443
Okay, go ahead.

922
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:23,916
Anyway, our bedroom
is in the downstairs,

923
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:26,586
and the kids
sleep upstairs,

924
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:31,957
so Randi makes everyone
leave around 2:00.

925
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,494
Or 3 a.m.

926
00:59:34,526 --> 00:59:36,795
And then...

927
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:38,265
she goes back to bed.

928
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:43,602
So I go upstairs to
check on the kids,

929
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:45,971
and it's fuckin' freezin'
upstairs,

930
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:47,573
but I can't use
the central heat

931
00:59:47,606 --> 00:59:49,575
'cause it dries out
Randi's sinuses,

932
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:51,744
and gives her
really bad headaches.

933
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:55,747
So I go downstairs and I
put a fire in the fireplace,

934
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,616
and sit down and watch TV,

935
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,485
but there's no more beer.

936
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:04,756
I'm still jumpin' around
like... a jackrabbit,

937
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:08,494
so I put a couple of
fire logs in the fire,

938
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:13,932
and I... just to warm up the
house while I was gone.

939
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:22,608
And then I...
I'm goin' to the mini mart,

940
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,079
but I'm too wasted and
I don't want to drive.

941
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:29,916
So I walk, it's about
20 minutes each way.

942
01:00:29,948 --> 01:00:32,485
I'm about halfway there,

943
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:36,055
and I can't remember if I put
a screen on the fireplace.

944
01:00:44,497 --> 01:00:45,899
I figure it's okay.

945
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:53,005
So I just keep goin'
to the store.

946
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:00,714
And, that's it.

947
01:01:02,148 --> 01:01:06,151
Log must have rolled out
onto the floor.

948
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:10,822
Fireman said
they pulled Randi out.

949
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:13,860
She passed out downstairs.

950
01:01:13,892 --> 01:01:15,461
And...

951
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,132
And then the furnace blew,

952
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:22,869
and they couldn't
go back in again.

953
01:01:22,901 --> 01:01:25,871
And...

954
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:27,540
that's all I remember.

955
01:01:32,878 --> 01:01:34,680
Okay, Lee,
that's all for now.

956
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:37,150
We'll... we'll call you
if anything else comes up

957
01:01:37,182 --> 01:01:39,151
we want to
ask you about.

958
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:41,420
Assuming the forensics
bear you out,

959
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:44,691
which I'm assuming
they will.

960
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:49,428
So, that's it?

961
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:51,863
Look, Lee, you made
a horrible mistake.

962
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:54,833
Like a million other
people did last night.

963
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:56,769
Not gonna crucify you.

964
01:01:56,802 --> 01:02:01,408
It's not a crime to forget to put
the screen on the fireplace.

965
01:02:03,508 --> 01:02:04,943
Well, I mean,
you know,

966
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:06,879
so I can go?

967
01:02:06,912 --> 01:02:13,619
Well, if something comes up we
don't already know about, yeah.

968
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:15,188
You got anyone to give you
a ride back home?

969
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,056
Is Joe here?
Is your dad here?

970
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:20,860
Yeah.

971
01:02:22,794 --> 01:02:24,530
-Sorry.
-Okay.

972
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:53,793
Son!

973
01:02:55,927 --> 01:02:57,863
Put it down.
Put it down!

974
01:02:57,896 --> 01:02:59,898
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

975
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:01,934
-Please!
-Settle down. Settle down.

976
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:03,769
-We need some cuffs right now.
-Stay down.

977
01:03:03,802 --> 01:03:05,771
-Stay down.
-Down, down, get him down.

978
01:03:24,856 --> 01:03:26,124
All right,
let's go.

979
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,829
Bye.

980
01:03:30,863 --> 01:03:32,631
Where we goin',
to the orphanage?

981
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:34,900
-Shut up.
-What the hell did I do?

982
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,236
Just be quiet.

983
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:44,944
All right,
we got a lot to do.

984
01:03:44,977 --> 01:03:46,312
-What about the boat?
-We can talk to George about it.

985
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:47,947
There's no use
hangin' onto it

986
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:49,981
-if no one's gonna use it.
-I'm gonna use it.

987
01:03:50,014 --> 01:03:52,017
-It's gotta be maintained.
-I'm maintaining it.

988
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,852
-I'm gonna maintain it.
-You can't maintain it by yourself.

989
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:55,854
Why not? It's my
boat now, isn't it?

990
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:56,889
'Cause you're a minor,
you can't take it out alone.

991
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:58,690
I'm... I'm the trustee.

992
01:03:58,724 --> 01:03:59,758
-I gotta make the payments...
-What does trustee mean?

993
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,660
I gotta keep up
the inspections.

994
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:03,762
It means I'm in charge of handling
everything for you until...

995
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,231
Does that mean you're allowed to sell
the boat if I don't want you to?

996
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:06,298
Until you turn 18.
I don't know.

997
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,300
I'll definitely
consider it.

998
01:04:08,334 --> 01:04:11,303
-No fuckin' way.
-You're so goddamn sure of yourself.

999
01:04:11,336 --> 01:04:12,972
-There's no one to run it. You're 16 years old.
-I get my license this year.

1000
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:14,606
Doesn't matter,
you're still a minor.

1001
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,008
You can't run a commercial
vessel by yourself.

1002
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,044
Meanwhile, it's a big fuckin' expense,
and I'm the one that's gotta manage it,

1003
01:04:19,077 --> 01:04:21,346
-and I'm not gonna be here.
-Who gives a fuck where you are?

1004
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,148
Patty, I swear to God, I'm gonna
knock your fuckin' block off.

1005
01:04:23,182 --> 01:04:25,685
-Great parenting.
-What? What'd you say?

1006
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:27,920
-I said great parenting.
-Fuck you! Mind your fuckin' business, you fuckin' asshole!

1007
01:04:27,952 --> 01:04:29,854
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
-You're gonna smash me in the face.

1008
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:31,890
Hey, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1009
01:04:31,923 --> 01:04:34,593
-It's okay, it's okay.
-You want me to smash your fuckin' face,

1010
01:04:34,626 --> 01:04:36,361
-you fuckin' asshole.
-It's okay. It's okay.

1011
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:38,030
Thank you. Thank you.
It's okay.

1012
01:04:38,063 --> 01:04:41,334
Uncle Lee, are you
fundamentally unsound?

1013
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,901
Get in the
fuckin' car.

1014
01:04:46,372 --> 01:04:48,207
Can't obey your orders
until you unlock the door.

1015
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,642
Shut up.

1016
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,892
It's not like the motor's
gonna die tomorrow,

1017
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:10,795
but Joe said it keeps breakin'
down like a son of a bitch.

1018
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:12,298
Yeah, but we were gonna
take a look...

1019
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,733
See, there's an allotment
of some kind, but...

1020
01:05:13,765 --> 01:05:15,066
Take a look
this weekend.

1021
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:16,101
Things are a little bit
up in the air.

1022
01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:17,903
No, I... I can
take care of it

1023
01:05:17,936 --> 01:05:19,738
as far as the general
maintenance is concerned,

1024
01:05:19,771 --> 01:05:21,239
but that motor's gonna go
at some point.

1025
01:05:21,273 --> 01:05:22,642
I'm taking care of it.

1026
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:24,744
There's no allotment
for a new motor.

1027
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:26,345
Unless, George, you know
someone who wants to buy it.

1028
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,748
Wait a second,
I'm not selling it.

1029
01:05:29,782 --> 01:05:31,050
We're gonna be
in Boston, anyway.

1030
01:05:31,082 --> 01:05:32,418
What?!

1031
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,052
Since when are we
supposed to be in Boston?

1032
01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:35,154
Just take it easy.

1033
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:36,955
Well, whatever you decide,

1034
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:38,791
it's gonna bleed you dry
just sittin' here.

1035
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:40,258
Well, we don't know
exactly what we're doin'.

1036
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,794
Well, you know,
he can always stay with us

1037
01:05:42,827 --> 01:05:44,295
if he wants to
come up weekends.

1038
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:46,164
Do you want to be
his guardian?

1039
01:05:46,197 --> 01:05:48,099
-Well, we already...
-He doesn't want to be my guardian,

1040
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:50,236
for Christ sakes.

1041
01:05:50,269 --> 01:05:52,405
-We're tryin' to lose some kids at this point.
-Have you seen his house?

1042
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:54,807
-Yeah.
-No, we're tryin' to work out the logistics,

1043
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,008
-so I don't know...
-We're jammed in there pretty good,

1044
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:58,110
-but we...
-Jesus Christ, will you stop?

1045
01:05:58,142 --> 01:05:59,244
We've always got a sofa for
him any time he wants.

1046
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:00,680
-George...
-You know that, right?

1047
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:01,981
That's all right,
I know... I know that.

1048
01:06:02,014 --> 01:06:03,314
-He's welcome any time.
-I understand.

1049
01:06:03,347 --> 01:06:06,052
I... I know.
Thank you.

1050
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:10,121
Are you brain damaged?

1051
01:06:10,155 --> 01:06:11,990
You can't just
talk to people like that.

1052
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:13,892
You don't want to be my
guardian, that's fine with me.

1053
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:15,860
It's not that,
it's just the logistics.

1054
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:17,697
I've just gotta work
it all out, I swear.

1055
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:19,331
How? My takin' me to
Wonkatonka, Minnesota,

1056
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:21,132
-with Uncle Donny?
-Minnetonka.

1057
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,102
-Minnetonka, Minnesota.
-Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.

1058
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:24,337
Same difference.

1059
01:06:27,305 --> 01:06:29,008
What about my mother?

1060
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:32,812
The judge would never
let that happen.

1061
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:35,180
And anyway, no one even
knows where she is.

1062
01:06:35,213 --> 01:06:36,014
I do.

1063
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:37,183
She's in Connecticut.

1064
01:06:37,215 --> 01:06:39,384
At least she was
last year.

1065
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:40,720
Since when
do you know that?

1066
01:06:40,753 --> 01:06:42,722
Well, she emailed me
last year,

1067
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:44,023
so I emailed her back.

1068
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:45,457
You know email?

1069
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,126
Did your father know
you were in touch with her?

1070
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:50,028
Are you kidding?

1071
01:06:50,061 --> 01:06:51,863
Can we walk?
I'm freezing.

1072
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:01,840
-All I know is...
-I know, I know, I know.

1073
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:03,075
She's a drunk,
she's insane,

1074
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:04,310
she let the dog
shit on the floor.

1075
01:07:04,343 --> 01:07:05,411
It's the last thing
that your father

1076
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:06,778
ever would have wanted.

1077
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:07,912
Like
suddenly you care

1078
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:09,414
what he
would have wanted.

1079
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:13,952
Where to now?

1080
01:07:13,985 --> 01:07:16,822
-The funeral parlor.
-Great.

1081
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,361
Where are we...

1082
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:25,230
Where are we goin'?

1083
01:07:25,264 --> 01:07:26,499
He's in Beverly.

1084
01:07:26,532 --> 01:07:28,200
There's no funeral homes
in Manchester?

1085
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:29,401
Nope.

1086
01:07:32,436 --> 01:07:33,972
The cemetery's here.

1087
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:47,353
Let's just get this done.

1088
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:49,354
Down south, we got
a lot of snowbirds.

1089
01:07:49,388 --> 01:07:53,159
Early in the year, people from
the north head down there,

1090
01:07:53,192 --> 01:07:56,095
they die down there,
they're not from the area.

1091
01:07:57,562 --> 01:08:01,099
What do they even
like about us?

1092
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:02,902
-Makin' arrangements for a loved one.
-Right.

1093
01:08:02,934 --> 01:08:04,370
A lot of times,
people are comin' in,

1094
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:06,905
-last thing they had on their mind.
-Right.

1095
01:08:06,938 --> 01:08:10,241
Sometimes I find there's
dysfunction in the family still,

1096
01:08:10,275 --> 01:08:13,146
somehow people come together.
You know?

1097
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:18,284
Dude, what is with that guy

1098
01:08:18,317 --> 01:08:20,520
and the big serious
and somber act?

1099
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,088
I don't know.

1100
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,455
No, but seriously,
does he not realize

1101
01:08:24,488 --> 01:08:26,893
that people know he does
this every single day?

1102
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:29,461
I don't know.

1103
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:32,231
Why can't we bury him?

1104
01:08:32,263 --> 01:08:34,967
Too cold.
The ground is too hard.

1105
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,302
They'll bury him
in the spring.

1106
01:08:36,335 --> 01:08:37,837
So what do they do
with him until then?

1107
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:39,871
Put him in a freezer.

1108
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:43,474
Are you serious?

1109
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:45,311
Yes.

1110
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:48,948
That really
freaks me out.

1111
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:50,883
It doesn't matter.

1112
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:53,952
Wait a minute.

1113
01:08:53,986 --> 01:08:54,987
Wait.

1114
01:08:56,655 --> 01:08:59,925
I think I parked the car
the other way. Sorry.

1115
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:05,998
What about one of those
mini steam shovels?

1116
01:09:07,165 --> 01:09:08,334
What?

1117
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:10,134
I once saw one of those
mini steam shovels

1118
01:09:10,168 --> 01:09:11,603
one time in a graveyard
in New Haven.

1119
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:13,606
It's like a perfect little
hole in about two seconds.

1120
01:09:13,638 --> 01:09:17,442
Well, I don't really know
how to get a hold of one

1121
01:09:17,476 --> 01:09:19,978
or how much it would cost.

1122
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:22,214
Why can't we
just look into it?

1123
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:24,316
Because you can't use
heavy equipment

1124
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:25,985
in the historic
Rosedale Cemetery.

1125
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:26,953
Why not?

1126
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,988
Because there are
very important people

1127
01:09:30,022 --> 01:09:31,323
who are buried there,

1128
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:32,892
and their descendants
don't want steam shovels

1129
01:09:32,924 --> 01:09:34,293
vibrating
over their dead bodies.

1130
01:09:34,326 --> 01:09:36,662
Well, why can't we just
bury him someplace else?

1131
01:09:36,695 --> 01:09:39,264
Because that's the plot
that Joe bought.

1132
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:40,532
Don't ask me why.

1133
01:09:40,564 --> 01:09:42,300
But if you want to make
some other arrangements,

1134
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:44,103
you want to find someplace
else to bury him,

1135
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:45,370
you want to talk
to the mortician,

1136
01:09:45,403 --> 01:09:46,371
and you want
to call up Sacred Heart

1137
01:09:46,405 --> 01:09:48,006
and talk to Father Martin

1138
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,308
and find out how much
that's gonna cost

1139
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,942
and make all those
arrangements,

1140
01:09:50,976 --> 01:09:52,344
be my guest. Otherwise,
let's just leave it.

1141
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:54,245
I just don't like him
being in a freezer.

1142
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:56,281
Yeah.

1143
01:09:57,448 --> 01:09:59,183
I don't like it,
either,

1144
01:09:59,217 --> 01:10:01,019
but it isn't him
because he's gone.

1145
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:02,220
It's just his body.

1146
01:10:02,254 --> 01:10:04,657
I'm just saying
it kind of freaks me out.

1147
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:08,027
God damn it,
where did I park the car?

1148
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:10,228
Yeah, I don't know, but I
wish you'd figure it out

1149
01:10:10,262 --> 01:10:12,497
because I'm freezing
my ass off.

1150
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:15,100
You don't have
a normal winter coat?

1151
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:16,669
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1152
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:19,304
Why don't you wear gloves
with the real fingers on them?

1153
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:23,509
God, fuck.

1154
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:26,646
Fuck, where did I park
this motherfucking car?

1155
01:10:32,985 --> 01:10:34,353
God damn, it's cold.

1156
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:36,254
Why? What's the matter
with your winter jacket?

1157
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,057
-Seriously, Patty?
-Just turn the heat on.

1158
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:39,057
It's on already.

1159
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,258
Well,
turn it up a little.

1160
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:41,360
It's all the way up.

1161
01:10:41,393 --> 01:10:42,528
It's blowing
freezing air on me.

1162
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:44,063
It just needs a minute
to warm up.

1163
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:45,630
What year did you
get this thing, 1928?

1164
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:47,366
Where's the horse that goes
with this fucking car?

1165
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:48,633
Patty, I swear to God.

1166
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,535
I know. Why don't we
keep my dad in here

1167
01:10:50,568 --> 01:10:52,236
for the next
three months?

1168
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:53,170
We'd save
a fucking fortune.

1169
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:55,240
Would you shut the fuck up
about the freezer?

1170
01:10:55,272 --> 01:10:56,374
Want me to have
a nervous breakdown

1171
01:10:56,407 --> 01:10:57,709
because there's undertakers
and a funeral?

1172
01:10:57,742 --> 01:10:59,512
-Who cares?
-No. I don't.

1173
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:06,218
Okay, it's getting warmer.

1174
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,286
I got band practice.
Can you drive me home

1175
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,554
so I can get my stuff

1176
01:11:09,588 --> 01:11:11,456
and take me over to my
girlfriend's house?

1177
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:14,994
Sure.

1178
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:30,743
This the same girl
who was over at the house?

1179
01:11:30,776 --> 01:11:33,612
No. That was Sylvie,
and this is Sandy.

1180
01:11:33,644 --> 01:11:35,313
They don't know
about each other,

1181
01:11:35,347 --> 01:11:36,749
so, please don't
say anything

1182
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:38,284
in case it comes up.

1183
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:40,652
I won't.

1184
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,455
Do you actually have sex
with these girls?

1185
01:11:44,488 --> 01:11:47,192
We don't just play
computer games.

1186
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:49,193
With both of them?

1187
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:51,497
Well, with Sandy's mom here,

1188
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:55,334
it's sort of, strictly
just like basement business.

1189
01:11:55,366 --> 01:11:57,402
What does that mean?

1190
01:11:57,436 --> 01:11:59,505
It means I'm working on it.

1191
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:16,582
Stop. Otto, man,
what are you doing?

1192
01:13:16,615 --> 01:13:18,117
What did I do?

1193
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,384
You're way behind, man.

1194
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:20,419
No, I'm not.

1195
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:22,420
You're a little behind,
Otto.

1196
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:24,423
You got to start
with the bass, Otto.

1197
01:13:24,455 --> 01:13:25,857
Come on, man, just stay
with me, all right?

1198
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,459
-Let's go.
-All right, I'm sorry.

1199
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,494
All right.
Yeah. Come on.

1200
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:29,561
It's all right.

1201
01:13:29,594 --> 01:13:30,696
Come on, let's go.

1202
01:13:30,728 --> 01:13:32,263
-All right, guys.
-Let's go again.

1203
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:33,598
Otto, you good?

1204
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:34,900
-You good, buddy?
-Let's go, baby.

1205
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:36,635
Let me ask Stentorian.

1206
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:38,903
1, 2, 3.

1207
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,563
Hi. Are you Lee?

1208
01:14:05,597 --> 01:14:07,566
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.

1209
01:14:07,598 --> 01:14:09,267
I think they're wrapping up.

1210
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,437
You want to come inside
and have a beer or something?

1211
01:14:15,573 --> 01:14:18,943
It's all right. Thank you.

1212
01:14:18,977 --> 01:14:23,447
I wanted to offer
my condolences about Joe.

1213
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:25,617
He was a terrific guy.

1214
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,451
There's not too many
like him.

1215
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,755
He was
a wonderful father.

1216
01:14:29,787 --> 01:14:31,256
Thank you.

1217
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,527
I was... I was going
to ask Patrick

1218
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:37,562
if he wants
to stay for supper,

1219
01:14:37,595 --> 01:14:39,464
if that's okay with you.

1220
01:14:39,496 --> 01:14:42,401
You want to join us?
I made way too much.

1221
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:55,646
That's all right.

1222
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,781
I'll just come back
and get him.

1223
01:14:56,814 --> 01:14:58,483
What time
should I come back?

1224
01:15:00,518 --> 01:15:02,654
I don't know.
9, 9:30.

1225
01:15:02,687 --> 01:15:05,657
They're going to do their
homework together, supposedly.

1226
01:15:09,027 --> 01:15:11,663
All right.
I'll come back at 9:30.

1227
01:15:11,696 --> 01:15:15,000
Okay. When you change your mind
in the next ten minutes,

1228
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,500
we're right inside.

1229
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:17,736
Okay. Thanks.

1230
01:15:52,036 --> 01:15:54,005
Jesus Christ, how
do you unbuckle this?

1231
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:55,674
I'm scraping the skin
off my knuckles.

1232
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:57,942
Hold on. Just take
your hand out.

1233
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,711
Would you please

1234
01:16:00,745 --> 01:16:02,447
just take your hand
out of my cunt?

1235
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:03,648
Okay. Okay.

1236
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:09,454
Are we
taking our pants off?

1237
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:10,656
I'm taking my pants off.

1238
01:16:10,688 --> 01:16:11,756
I don't know
what you're doing.

1239
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,392
I'm taking my pants off.

1240
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,665
Come on.

1241
01:16:21,765 --> 01:16:23,567
You got to take
your show off first.

1242
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,403
-Jesus.
-I'm... I'm trying.

1243
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:28,907
Hey, kids, come on,
have some dinner.

1244
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:32,510
Thanks, Mom.
We'll be right down.

1245
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:33,778
Thanks, Jill.
One second.

1246
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:35,647
I just got to log off.

1247
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,615
Would you shut up?
She's not retarded.

1248
01:16:37,648 --> 01:16:39,317
Why are you
picking on me?

1249
01:16:39,351 --> 01:16:40,585
I'm not picking on you.

1250
01:16:40,617 --> 01:16:41,620
You'll get me in trouble.

1251
01:16:41,652 --> 01:16:43,088
We're not
gonna get in trouble.

1252
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,588
We are.

1253
01:16:44,621 --> 01:16:45,990
I can't believe
what you're gonna do.

1254
01:16:47,459 --> 01:16:48,927
How's the math homework?

1255
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,995
It's good.

1256
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,329
Very frustrating.

1257
01:16:51,362 --> 01:16:52,463
Good.

1258
01:16:52,496 --> 01:16:54,932
Those algorithms are a bitch.

1259
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,737
This is really good,
Jill.

1260
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:01,807
-Thank you, Patrick.
-Is this a...

1261
01:17:01,839 --> 01:17:03,441
This is a homemade
carbonara sauce?

1262
01:17:03,474 --> 01:17:04,543
Jesus, shut up.

1263
01:17:04,576 --> 01:17:05,677
No.

1264
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,112
You could have
fooled me.

1265
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:08,546
Jesus.

1266
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,814
What? What?

1267
01:17:09,848 --> 01:17:10,749
You're such a kiss-ass.

1268
01:17:10,781 --> 01:17:12,383
-Sandy!
-What,

1269
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:14,719
because I appreciate
your mother's cooking?

1270
01:17:20,657 --> 01:17:22,327
-Good night.
-Good night.

1271
01:17:26,697 --> 01:17:27,765
Aren't you going to ask
what happened?

1272
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:29,702
-I don't want to know.
-Guess not.

1273
01:17:37,509 --> 01:17:38,444
Come on.

1274
01:17:50,854 --> 01:17:51,857
Hello.

1275
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:53,157
<i>Hello. Lee?</i>

1276
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:54,793
<i>It's Randi.</i>

1277
01:17:57,528 --> 01:17:59,531
<i>-Hello?
-Yeah. Sorry. I'm here.</i>

1278
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:01,665
<i>-Hi. How are you?
-Okay. How are you?</i>

1279
01:18:01,698 --> 01:18:02,701
<i>-Good.
-Good.</i>

1280
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:04,669
<i>I was just calling...</i>

1281
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:05,802
<i>George
told me about Joe,</i>

1282
01:18:05,836 --> 01:18:07,738
<i>and I just wanted to call
and say I'm sorry.</i>

1283
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:09,674
<i>I hope you don't mind
me calling.</i>

1284
01:18:09,706 --> 01:18:10,808
No. It's fine. Thank you.

1285
01:18:10,842 --> 01:18:12,878
I don't mind. How are you?

1286
01:18:12,911 --> 01:18:15,514
<i>Not so good right now.</i>

1287
01:18:15,546 --> 01:18:16,915
<i>I guess we should have
seen it coming,</i>

1288
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,849
<i>but it's still
hard to believe.</i>

1289
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:20,152
<i>-Yeah.
-Yeah.</i>

1290
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:22,019
<i>-How's Patrick doing?
-He's good.</i>

1291
01:18:22,053 --> 01:18:23,722
<i>Beyond the obvious,
obviously.</i>

1292
01:18:23,754 --> 01:18:25,523
He's okay. He's fine.
I don't know.

1293
01:18:25,557 --> 01:18:26,992
You know how kids are.
It's hard to tell.

1294
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:28,893
He doesn't really
open up with me,

1295
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:30,594
but he seems fine.
He's got a lot of friends.

1296
01:18:30,628 --> 01:18:33,598
<i>-Well, that's good.
-Yeah, it is.</i>

1297
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:36,101
<i>So I don't know if you'd
planned a service yet,</i>

1298
01:18:36,134 --> 01:18:38,170
<i>but I was also going to ask,
if you wouldn't mind,</i>

1299
01:18:38,202 --> 01:18:41,005
<i>I'd like to be there
if it's okay with you.</i>

1300
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:42,874
Yeah, it's fine.
I don't mind.

1301
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:44,175
<i>Okay, okay. Thank you.</i>

1302
01:18:44,209 --> 01:18:45,911
<i>It would mean
a lot to me.</i>

1303
01:18:45,943 --> 01:18:47,178
No, you should come.

1304
01:18:47,211 --> 01:18:49,214
I'll let you know
when it's going to be.

1305
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:50,848
<i>Thank you.</i>

1306
01:18:52,584 --> 01:18:54,619
<i>So can I ask...</i>

1307
01:18:54,652 --> 01:18:56,522
<i>how are you?</i>

1308
01:18:58,522 --> 01:18:59,790
I don't know. How are you?

1309
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,860
<i>I don't know.</i>

1310
01:19:01,893 --> 01:19:04,163
<i>We're doing pretty well.</i>

1311
01:19:07,165 --> 01:19:08,767
<i>I should probably
tell you.</i>

1312
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,668
<i>I'm going to be a...</i>

1313
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:11,537
<i>Actually,
I'm... I'm pregnant.</i>

1314
01:19:13,604 --> 01:19:14,939
<i>-Yeah?
-Yeah.</i>

1315
01:19:14,973 --> 01:19:17,509
<i>You know,
like, ready to pop.</i>

1316
01:19:19,943 --> 01:19:21,513
I didn't know that.

1317
01:19:21,545 --> 01:19:24,749
<i>I didn't know
if I should tell you,</i>

1318
01:19:24,781 --> 01:19:25,750
<i>but...</i>

1319
01:19:26,817 --> 01:19:28,820
No, it's fine.
Congratulations.

1320
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:31,490
<i>Thank you. You would probably
decide it for yourself</i>

1321
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:32,690
<i>when you see me.</i>

1322
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:34,025
Yeah.

1323
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:36,093
<i>So, you know,</i>

1324
01:19:36,128 --> 01:19:38,229
<i>I just wanted to say,
you know...</i>

1325
01:19:38,263 --> 01:19:40,131
Actually, I...
Sorry.

1326
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,000
I didn't mean to cut you
off. I just got to go.

1327
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:43,934
<i>I just wanted to make
sure it's okay</i>

1328
01:19:43,968 --> 01:19:45,103
<i>if me and Josh
come to the funeral.</i>

1329
01:19:45,135 --> 01:19:46,905
<i>-It's totally okay.
-Thank you, Lee.</i>

1330
01:19:46,937 --> 01:19:48,939
<i>Okay. God bless.</i>

1331
01:19:48,973 --> 01:19:50,275
<i>-So long.
-Bye.</i>

1332
01:23:10,942 --> 01:23:13,278
Are you kidding me?
I've never even been to Boston.

1333
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:15,313
It's great,
you and Patrick.

1334
01:23:15,345 --> 01:23:16,180
Yeah.

1335
01:23:49,213 --> 01:23:52,349
No, not really
warming to hear.

1336
01:23:53,284 --> 01:23:55,018
So how are you
holding up?

1337
01:23:55,052 --> 01:23:57,021
What's the matter?

1338
01:23:57,054 --> 01:23:58,156
I said how are you
holding up?

1339
01:23:58,188 --> 01:24:00,892
It's a stupid question.
Get some food?

1340
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:02,860
I had some cheese.

1341
01:24:02,893 --> 01:24:05,329
You had some cheese,
asshole?

1342
01:24:05,362 --> 01:24:07,030
I'll get you something.

1343
01:24:07,063 --> 01:24:08,165
-I don't want anything.
-Hey, Janine!

1344
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:09,366
-Sure?
-What?

1345
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,035
-I don't want anything.
-Never mind.

1346
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:12,503
-What?
-Forget it. Skip it.

1347
01:24:12,536 --> 01:24:15,039
I can't hear a goddamn
word you're saying.

1348
01:24:15,071 --> 01:24:16,206
What?

1349
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,442
Did Lee get food?

1350
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,776
He didn't... What?

1351
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:20,044
Did Lee get food?

1352
01:24:20,076 --> 01:24:21,411
No!
He doesn't want any.

1353
01:24:21,445 --> 01:24:22,981
-We're good.
-I'll make him a plate.

1354
01:24:23,013 --> 01:24:24,448
Forget it. He doesn't...

1355
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:25,283
We're fine.

1356
01:24:25,316 --> 01:24:26,485
He doesn't want any...

1357
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:31,289
Hey, is it okay if I
invite Sylvie over?

1358
01:24:34,558 --> 01:24:36,460
Which one is she?

1359
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:41,198
She's the one with the...
the brown hair.

1360
01:24:41,232 --> 01:24:42,467
No.

1361
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,069
What do you mean, no?

1362
01:24:45,102 --> 01:24:46,237
I don't like her.

1363
01:24:46,269 --> 01:24:48,173
I don't want her
in the house right now.

1364
01:24:48,205 --> 01:24:50,275
Why not? You don't even
have to talk to her.

1365
01:24:50,308 --> 01:24:54,513
Sorry. Go to her house
or call one of your friends.

1366
01:24:56,347 --> 01:24:57,482
That's that.

1367
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:07,893
Would it be cool with your mom
if I came over there?

1368
01:25:11,495 --> 01:25:13,165
I have no idea.

1369
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:17,434
Okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1370
01:25:17,468 --> 01:25:20,572
Well, I can't stay
there, either.

1371
01:25:20,604 --> 01:25:22,840
Sorry about that.

1372
01:25:29,013 --> 01:25:30,281
You going to stay in here?

1373
01:25:30,313 --> 01:25:31,982
Yeah. Why not?

1374
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:34,152
I thought maybe you'd
want to stay in Dad's room.

1375
01:25:34,184 --> 01:25:36,955
Why,
do you want me to?

1376
01:25:36,987 --> 01:25:38,356
No. It's just
a better room.

1377
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:40,290
And he's
not using it.

1378
01:25:40,323 --> 01:25:42,294
Okay. I'll stay in there.

1379
01:25:43,561 --> 01:25:45,530
We're not gonna be here
that much longer anyway.

1380
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,865
We're not moving
to Boston, Uncle Lee.

1381
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:50,334
Well, I don't want to talk
about that right now.

1382
01:25:50,367 --> 01:25:52,035
You said he left you
money so you could move.

1383
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,237
Yeah. That doesn't mean...

1384
01:25:53,271 --> 01:25:54,272
Anyway,
what's in Boston?

1385
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,340
You're a janitor.

1386
01:25:56,374 --> 01:25:58,175
-So what?
-You can do that anywhere.

1387
01:25:58,209 --> 01:25:59,210
There's plenty of toilets

1388
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:01,079
and clogged-up drains
all over town.

1389
01:26:01,112 --> 01:26:02,614
-I don't want to...
-All my friends are here.

1390
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:03,281
I'm on the hockey team.

1391
01:26:03,314 --> 01:26:04,883
I'm on the basketball team.

1392
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,450
I got to maintain
our boat now.

1393
01:26:06,483 --> 01:26:08,887
I work on George's boat
two days a week.

1394
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,321
I got two girlfriends,

1395
01:26:10,353 --> 01:26:12,155
and I'm in a band.

1396
01:26:12,188 --> 01:26:13,657
You're a janitor
in Quincy.

1397
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:16,494
What the hell do you
care where you live?

1398
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:23,902
I got to go to sleep.

1399
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:25,402
Good night.

1400
01:26:54,331 --> 01:26:55,532
Where are you going
to stay tonight?

1401
01:26:55,566 --> 01:26:57,235
I don't know.
A motel.

1402
01:26:57,268 --> 01:26:58,937
What time
you going to call me?

1403
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:01,039
When I get to the motel.

1404
01:27:01,071 --> 01:27:02,272
I want to hear
from you by 9:00,

1405
01:27:02,305 --> 01:27:03,674
or I'm going
to call the cops.

1406
01:27:03,707 --> 01:27:05,977
-Understand?
-Yes. Yes.

1407
01:27:12,415 --> 01:27:14,418
Patrick, come say goodbye
to your uncle Lee!

1408
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:16,219
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

1409
01:27:16,253 --> 01:27:17,322
Patrick!

1410
01:27:17,354 --> 01:27:18,589
Coming!

1411
01:27:35,106 --> 01:27:36,573
I'm going to see him.

1412
01:27:56,293 --> 01:27:57,528
So long.

1413
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:46,443
Patty?

1414
01:28:46,477 --> 01:28:47,678
I think there's something
wrong with me.

1415
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:50,714
What do you mean?
Like what? Are you sick?

1416
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:52,116
I don't know!

1417
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:55,385
-I feel really weird!
-Are you sick?

1418
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,488
I think I'm havin'
a panic attack.

1419
01:28:57,521 --> 01:28:59,057
What do you mean?
Hey.

1420
01:28:59,089 --> 01:28:59,957
I don't know, I mean...

1421
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:01,793
Could you get that
shit outta here, please?

1422
01:29:01,826 --> 01:29:03,161
Get rid of what?

1423
01:29:03,193 --> 01:29:04,495
I don't know, I don't know!

1424
01:29:04,527 --> 01:29:05,629
The food?

1425
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:08,566
You want me to get
rid of the food?

1426
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,235
Patrick? Hey.

1427
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:12,437
Do you want me to take
you to the hospital?

1428
01:29:12,469 --> 01:29:13,303
No. I don't know.

1429
01:29:13,338 --> 01:29:15,173
Do you want me
to call your friends?

1430
01:29:15,205 --> 01:29:16,506
-I don't know.
-What do you want me to do?

1431
01:29:20,678 --> 01:29:22,180
Patty, are you
going to bed?

1432
01:29:22,213 --> 01:29:23,214
Leave me alone.

1433
01:29:23,247 --> 01:29:24,816
I don't think I should let
you keep the door shut.

1434
01:29:24,848 --> 01:29:26,416
Just go away.

1435
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,219
I will.
Just open up the door.

1436
01:29:28,251 --> 01:29:30,521
Fuck you.

1437
01:29:30,554 --> 01:29:31,823
Jesus Christ,
what's your problem?

1438
01:29:31,856 --> 01:29:33,590
I said open up the door.
Are you havin' a breakdown?

1439
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:34,826
Shall we take you
to the hospital?

1440
01:29:34,858 --> 01:29:36,227
No! No! No!

1441
01:29:36,259 --> 01:29:38,228
I'm just freakin' out.

1442
01:29:38,262 --> 01:29:41,566
Okay, fine, but I can't let you
freak out with the door closed.

1443
01:29:43,299 --> 01:29:45,268
And if you're gonna
freak out every time

1444
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:47,572
you see a frozen chicken I think
we should go to the hospital.

1445
01:29:47,604 --> 01:29:49,674
I don't know
anything about this.

1446
01:29:49,706 --> 01:29:53,244
I just don't like him
bein' in the freezer!

1447
01:29:54,812 --> 01:29:56,447
You've expressed
that very clearly.

1448
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:57,714
I don't like it either.

1449
01:29:57,747 --> 01:29:59,250
There's nothin'
we can do about it.

1450
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,389
I'm not gonna bother you.
I'm just gonna sit here

1451
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:07,258
until you calm down.

1452
01:30:17,268 --> 01:30:18,736
All right, I'm calmer now.

1453
01:30:18,768 --> 01:30:21,171
Can you please
just go away?

1454
01:30:21,205 --> 01:30:22,740
No.

1455
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,662
Cool!

1456
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,469
How much are
they payin' you?

1457
01:30:52,503 --> 01:30:54,606
Minimum wage plus the room.

1458
01:30:59,777 --> 01:31:01,746
All right.

1459
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:04,314
Let's go get
some furniture.

1460
01:31:04,348 --> 01:31:07,552
I got furniture.

1461
01:31:07,585 --> 01:31:09,620
No, you don't.

1462
01:31:09,652 --> 01:31:12,923
This doesn't count
as furniture.

1463
01:31:12,956 --> 01:31:15,160
This is not a room.

1464
01:31:17,361 --> 01:31:18,528
Let's go get some furniture

1465
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:19,831
Get off my back.

1466
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:26,336
Patty, come on.
Let's go.

1467
01:31:30,808 --> 01:31:32,343
Let's go.

1468
01:31:47,023 --> 01:31:48,358
There we go.

1469
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:52,997
All right.

1470
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:55,700
Better?

1471
01:31:55,732 --> 01:31:56,900
Better.

1472
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,844
So, listen.

1473
01:32:09,713 --> 01:32:13,584
We can stay here until
your school lets out.

1474
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:15,418
Okay?

1475
01:32:15,451 --> 01:32:17,887
That'll give me time to set
things up in Boston better.

1476
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,990
Maybe you can do some stuff
with George in the summer

1477
01:32:20,023 --> 01:32:21,558
if you want, and
you don't get jerked

1478
01:32:21,592 --> 01:32:23,995
out of your life overnight.

1479
01:32:24,027 --> 01:32:26,696
Okay?

1480
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:29,032
Are you askin' me
or tellin' me?

1481
01:32:29,066 --> 01:32:31,369
I'm tellin' you
that's the best I can do.

1482
01:32:31,402 --> 01:32:34,339
Then what the fuck do you care
whether it's okay with me or not?

1483
01:32:35,738 --> 01:32:37,308
It's 45 minutes away.

1484
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,541
You can come back here
any time you want.

1485
01:32:38,575 --> 01:32:39,577
-From Quincy?
-Yeah.

1486
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,745
It's an hour and a...
Is that a joke?

1487
01:32:40,777 --> 01:32:42,579
It's an hour and
a half at least!

1488
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:44,682
-No, it's not.
-You gotta include the other cars!

1489
01:32:44,714 --> 01:32:45,882
You couldn't get from here
to Roxbury in half an hour

1490
01:32:45,915 --> 01:32:47,617
if you flew in
a fuckin' spaceship!

1491
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,420
Okay, fuck it.

1492
01:32:56,059 --> 01:32:58,629
I need lunch money.

1493
01:32:58,661 --> 01:32:59,896
-Hey, Patrick!
-Hey, Patrick!

1494
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:02,465
-Hey, Patrick!
-Patrick! Patrick!

1495
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:04,568
So, are you going
to Godspell?

1496
01:33:04,601 --> 01:33:05,568
I'm thinking about it.

1497
01:33:05,602 --> 01:33:06,903
All right, 'kay.
Bye.

1498
01:33:08,371 --> 01:33:10,607
Those your girlfriends, too?

1499
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,742
They wish.

1500
01:33:13,777 --> 01:33:15,780
Doesn't George give you money
for working on his boat?

1501
01:33:15,812 --> 01:33:16,946
Yeah, but I'm savin' that.

1502
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:19,317
-For what?
-New motor.

1503
01:33:20,483 --> 01:33:21,818
You going to Godspell?

1504
01:35:06,189 --> 01:35:07,825
Come on.

1505
01:35:10,727 --> 01:35:13,064
Come on!

1506
01:35:15,598 --> 01:35:16,566
Hello.

1507
01:35:16,599 --> 01:35:17,901
Hello, Lee?

1508
01:35:19,769 --> 01:35:22,839
<i>Lee?</i>

1509
01:35:22,872 --> 01:35:25,175
<i>Lee, is that you?</i>

1510
01:35:25,209 --> 01:35:26,144
Hello?

1511
01:35:33,784 --> 01:35:35,553
What happened
to your hand?

1512
01:35:35,585 --> 01:35:37,655
I cut it.

1513
01:35:37,687 --> 01:35:40,757
For a minute there
I didn't know what happened.

1514
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,768
Is there some reason
why you didn't tell me

1515
01:35:51,802 --> 01:35:54,138
my Mom tried to call me?

1516
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,448
She wrote me you
hung up on her.

1517
01:36:05,816 --> 01:36:07,585
She's in Essex.

1518
01:36:07,617 --> 01:36:11,088
She wants me to come have
lunch and meet her fianc?.

1519
01:36:13,823 --> 01:36:14,924
What'd you think?

1520
01:36:14,957 --> 01:36:17,762
She couldn't get
in touch with me?

1521
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:21,866
I hung up on her because I
didn't know what to say to her.

1522
01:36:21,898 --> 01:36:24,602
And I didn't tell you because 'cause
I didn't know what to say to you.

1523
01:36:24,634 --> 01:36:25,802
I'm sorry.

1524
01:36:25,835 --> 01:36:28,638
You can't stop me
talkin' to her.

1525
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:31,608
I don't give a shit
what you do.

1526
01:36:31,642 --> 01:36:33,911
No, but you won't let
my girlfriend stay over,

1527
01:36:33,943 --> 01:36:35,245
you hate my mother so much

1528
01:36:35,278 --> 01:36:37,013
you won't even tell me
she called.

1529
01:36:37,046 --> 01:36:38,616
You'd rather drag me back
to Quincy and ruin my life

1530
01:36:38,648 --> 01:36:40,250
than let somebody else
be my guardian...

1531
01:36:40,284 --> 01:36:41,852
There is nobody else.

1532
01:36:41,884 --> 01:36:44,787
I can live in
Essex with my Mom.

1533
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:46,256
No, you can't.

1534
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,158
She's not an alcoholic
anymore and she wants me

1535
01:36:48,191 --> 01:36:50,160
to stay with her, then
that solves all our problems.

1536
01:36:50,192 --> 01:36:52,662
I can take the same bus
to my same school

1537
01:36:52,696 --> 01:36:54,098
and keep all my friends,

1538
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:55,798
and the boat, and you can
go back to Boston,

1539
01:36:55,831 --> 01:36:58,535
and still check in on me, or
whatever, if you want to...

1540
01:36:58,568 --> 01:36:59,536
I can't do that.

1541
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,005
Why not?

1542
01:37:01,037 --> 01:37:04,842
Patty, I'm sorry
I hung up on her.

1543
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:06,110
I'll call her back,

1544
01:37:06,143 --> 01:37:07,845
and if she seems
semi-human to me,

1545
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:09,112
you can go have lunch with her
and her fianc?.

1546
01:37:09,146 --> 01:37:10,281
That's it.

1547
01:37:10,313 --> 01:37:12,182
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

1548
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:25,195
Okay, soon as we're clear,

1549
01:37:25,228 --> 01:37:27,164
open it up and we'll see
what we can do.

1550
01:37:27,196 --> 01:37:28,532
Okay.

1551
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:42,045
Lee?

1552
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:44,581
-Hey.
-Hey, what do you say?

1553
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:46,717
-How are you?
-Yeah, I'm good. How are you?

1554
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,319
-All right.
-Yeah.

1555
01:37:48,352 --> 01:37:50,153
I'm really... I'm really
sorry to hear about Joe.

1556
01:37:50,187 --> 01:37:51,722
I know, yeah, thanks.

1557
01:37:51,754 --> 01:37:52,755
How's Patrick doing?

1558
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:53,756
-Good.
-Yeah?

1559
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,025
-Yeah.
-Good.

1560
01:37:55,058 --> 01:37:57,027
What's going on?
What are ya...

1561
01:37:57,059 --> 01:37:58,227
You know, I'm back, I'm thinking
about staying through the summer.

1562
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:59,929
I was wondering
if you had any work.

1563
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:00,930
I'm looking to
pick up some hours.

1564
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:01,999
Sure, sure...

1565
01:38:02,031 --> 01:38:03,900
Walt is down in Boston, so...

1566
01:38:03,933 --> 01:38:05,702
-He is?
-Yeah, he should be back tomorrow

1567
01:38:05,736 --> 01:38:06,870
-if you want to come by.
-He's coming back up tomorrow?

1568
01:38:06,902 --> 01:38:08,037
Yeah, yeah.
Give him a call.

1569
01:38:08,071 --> 01:38:09,273
Okay.
I will give him a call.

1570
01:38:09,305 --> 01:38:10,874
-That's a good idea.
-I'll do that.

1571
01:38:10,906 --> 01:38:11,874
-Absolutely.
-Okay. All right.

1572
01:38:11,907 --> 01:38:12,942
-Hey.
-Yeah.

1573
01:38:12,976 --> 01:38:14,178
-All right.
-Good to see you.

1574
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,046
-Thanks, Jerry.
-All right.

1575
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,957
I don't want to see him
in here again.

1576
01:39:22,446 --> 01:39:23,981
Bye, Patrick.

1577
01:39:24,013 --> 01:39:25,448
Want to watch
the football game on Sunday?

1578
01:39:25,482 --> 01:39:27,818
-Sure.
-So long, Patrick.

1579
01:39:30,887 --> 01:39:32,389
-Bye, Patrick.
-See you guys.

1580
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,459
How's the motor?

1581
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:37,260
George says the piston's
gonna go right

1582
01:39:37,294 --> 01:39:40,264
through the block
any minute now.

1583
01:39:40,296 --> 01:39:42,900
Unfortunately
that's a problem.

1584
01:39:42,933 --> 01:39:45,102
We can't afford to keep
a boat if we can't run it,

1585
01:39:45,134 --> 01:39:47,437
and we can't run it
if it's got a broken motor.

1586
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,738
Let's take out a loan.

1587
01:39:48,772 --> 01:39:49,807
And pay it
back with what?

1588
01:39:49,839 --> 01:39:53,343
We hire it out 'til we pay
the loan back, obviously.

1589
01:39:55,112 --> 01:39:56,980
Unfortunately for you,

1590
01:39:57,013 --> 01:39:59,750
I'm in charge of your
finances until you turn 21,

1591
01:39:59,782 --> 01:40:01,985
and I'm not comfortable
takin' out enormous loans

1592
01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:05,155
on your behalf.

1593
01:40:05,187 --> 01:40:05,988
I have band practice.

1594
01:40:06,022 --> 01:40:07,390
Can you drive me home
to get my stuff

1595
01:40:07,424 --> 01:40:10,327
then drive me over
to Sandy's house?

1596
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,869
Sure.

1597
01:40:21,237 --> 01:40:23,840
Why don't you take a Drivers' Ed
course? I'm not your chauffeur.

1598
01:40:23,874 --> 01:40:26,110
'Cause Dad made me promise not
to drive 'til I was 17.

1599
01:40:26,143 --> 01:40:28,879
Okay, we'll stick
with that then.

1600
01:40:36,085 --> 01:40:38,121
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

1601
01:40:38,155 --> 01:40:40,023
I think Sandy's mother
likes you.

1602
01:40:40,055 --> 01:40:41,191
No, she doesn't.

1603
01:40:41,223 --> 01:40:43,793
I happen to know
that she does.

1604
01:40:46,362 --> 01:40:49,133
This could be good
for both of us.

1605
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,872
I'd really rather not.

1606
01:40:54,905 --> 01:40:59,209
Well, can you at least
just like hang out with her

1607
01:40:59,241 --> 01:41:00,878
for half an hour
so I can be alone with Sandy

1608
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:03,447
without her mother knockin' on
the door every twenty seconds?

1609
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:04,180
Come on, man.

1610
01:41:04,214 --> 01:41:06,250
All you gotta do
is talk to her.

1611
01:41:06,282 --> 01:41:07,985
Why can't you help me out
a little bit for once

1612
01:41:08,018 --> 01:41:09,219
instead of draggin' me
to the lawyers

1613
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:11,254
and the funeral parlor
and the morgue?

1614
01:41:11,287 --> 01:41:13,256
Anyway, she's really nice.

1615
01:41:27,103 --> 01:41:29,139
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

1616
01:41:29,171 --> 01:41:31,241
-Otto...
-What, I'm too slow?

1617
01:41:31,273 --> 01:41:33,242
Too fast man.
You're dragging.

1618
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:34,545
You're way too fast, man.

1619
01:41:34,577 --> 01:41:35,946
I'm too fast.

1620
01:41:35,979 --> 01:41:38,247
Dude, you're like pulling out of
the fucking station ahead of me.

1621
01:41:38,281 --> 01:41:39,850
My God, you guys,
leave him alone.

1622
01:41:39,883 --> 01:41:41,117
Dude, like, are you serious
about this band, or what?

1623
01:41:41,151 --> 01:41:42,419
Okay, all right,
all right.

1624
01:41:42,451 --> 01:41:45,155
-Just lay off him.
-Get off my back.

1625
01:41:45,187 --> 01:41:47,256
All right, everybody
just chill here.

1626
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:49,527
Let's just...
Let's just go again.

1627
01:41:52,228 --> 01:41:54,365
We are Stentorian.

1628
01:42:02,138 --> 01:42:05,108
Patrick is one of
my favorite people.

1629
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:10,446
That's good.

1630
01:42:14,617 --> 01:42:18,222
How's it goin' up there,
you guys?

1631
01:42:20,322 --> 01:42:24,594
It's going...
It's going fine, thanks!

1632
01:42:24,628 --> 01:42:27,130
But we're right in
the middle of something.

1633
01:42:27,162 --> 01:42:31,300
We're just banging out
those compound fractions.

1634
01:42:31,334 --> 01:42:35,438
At least we know
where they are, right?

1635
01:42:35,472 --> 01:42:37,273
That's true.

1636
01:42:41,344 --> 01:42:43,247
How many of those you
generally gotta go through

1637
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,648
before you pick a winner?

1638
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,148
I'd like to see you use
one of these goddamn things

1639
01:42:46,182 --> 01:42:48,318
with all these interruptions.

1640
01:42:48,351 --> 01:42:49,486
Fuck me!

1641
01:42:49,518 --> 01:42:51,320
What happened?
Are you OK?

1642
01:42:51,353 --> 01:42:53,322
I tripped over your
fuckin' doll house.

1643
01:42:53,356 --> 01:42:54,457
My God,
did you break it?

1644
01:42:54,491 --> 01:42:56,460
I don't know.
I'm fine though, by the way.

1645
01:42:56,492 --> 01:42:57,561
My God.

1646
01:42:57,594 --> 01:42:59,563
My grandmother gave me that
when I was five years old.

1647
01:42:59,595 --> 01:43:01,031
It was literally
her doll house

1648
01:43:01,063 --> 01:43:02,398
from when she was
a little girl.

1649
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:04,300
Then what's it doin'
on the fuckin' floor?

1650
01:43:04,334 --> 01:43:05,635
It's a doll house, that's
where you play with it!

1651
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:07,470
Kids, what is going
on up there?

1652
01:43:07,504 --> 01:43:10,307
Nothing! Patrick just stubbed
his toe on Mummer's doll house,

1653
01:43:10,339 --> 01:43:11,540
but it's okay!

1654
01:43:11,573 --> 01:43:13,643
Sandy, that doll house
belonged to my mother.

1655
01:43:13,677 --> 01:43:15,344
-Yes I know, Mom.
-If you're gonna smash it to pieces...

1656
01:43:15,378 --> 01:43:17,380
Nobody is smashin'
it to pieces! It's fine!

1657
01:43:17,414 --> 01:43:20,184
Don't worry, Jill, I'm okay.
My toe's gonna be okay.

1658
01:43:24,086 --> 01:43:25,656
Do you want to
fuck me or not?

1659
01:43:25,688 --> 01:43:27,124
Yes.

1660
01:43:30,427 --> 01:43:33,664
Could I get you
another beer, Lee?

1661
01:43:33,696 --> 01:43:37,066
I'm good. Thank you.

1662
01:43:40,402 --> 01:43:43,240
Would you excuse me,
Lee, one sec?

1663
01:43:43,272 --> 01:43:45,275
Sure.

1664
01:43:49,379 --> 01:43:51,381
-Is it on?
-Yes. It's a miracle.

1665
01:43:51,414 --> 01:43:53,384
Okay, hurry up.

1666
01:43:56,387 --> 01:43:58,522
One second please!

1667
01:43:58,554 --> 01:44:00,423
Get outta my way!

1668
01:44:00,456 --> 01:44:02,459
I'm sorry.

1669
01:44:13,469 --> 01:44:15,137
What's up?

1670
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:18,374
I'm really sorry,
I know you're trying to work,

1671
01:44:18,407 --> 01:44:20,309
but I can't sit
down there much longer.

1672
01:44:20,343 --> 01:44:21,577
Why?
What's the problem?

1673
01:44:21,611 --> 01:44:22,679
He won't talk.

1674
01:44:22,711 --> 01:44:25,115
I've been trying to make
conversation for half an hour.

1675
01:44:25,147 --> 01:44:26,382
-Are you serious?
-What's the matter?

1676
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:28,184
I realize I'm not
the most fascinating

1677
01:44:28,218 --> 01:44:29,318
-person in the world...
-Mom!

1678
01:44:29,352 --> 01:44:31,287
But it's very,
very strained.

1679
01:44:31,321 --> 01:44:35,092
-What's going on?
-She can't get your Uncle to talk.

1680
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:36,259
He likes sports.

1681
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:37,259
I'm sorry to bust things up,

1682
01:44:37,293 --> 01:44:39,563
but how much longer do you
think you're gonna be?

1683
01:44:39,595 --> 01:44:41,365
Could you maybe
turn on a game?

1684
01:44:41,397 --> 01:44:42,465
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up.

1685
01:44:42,499 --> 01:44:44,335
Mummy, Please.

1686
01:44:45,402 --> 01:44:46,436
You were a tremendous help.

1687
01:44:46,469 --> 01:44:48,438
I didn't ask to
sit down there.

1688
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,439
You can't make small talk like
every other grown up in the world?

1689
01:44:50,473 --> 01:44:52,476
-No.
-You can't talk about boring bullshit for half an hour?

1690
01:44:52,509 --> 01:44:54,044
-No.
-Hey, how about those interest rates?

1691
01:44:54,076 --> 01:44:55,445
-No, I can't.
-Hey, I lost my Triple A card.

1692
01:44:55,478 --> 01:44:56,446
-Nope.
-Like everybody else?

1693
01:44:56,478 --> 01:44:58,081
Nope, sorry.

1694
01:45:01,351 --> 01:45:03,454
You're a fucking asshole.

1695
01:45:21,504 --> 01:45:22,671
Where'd you say she lives?

1696
01:45:22,705 --> 01:45:24,541
'Cause there's, like,
no houses here. None.

1697
01:45:24,573 --> 01:45:26,476
What, does she live
in a fucking sleeping bag?

1698
01:45:26,509 --> 01:45:27,611
119 Pigeon Hill Street.

1699
01:45:27,643 --> 01:45:29,478
Pigeon Hill Street,
or Pigeon Hill Road?

1700
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:31,380
-Pigeon Hill Street
-Okay, Pigeon Hill Street.

1701
01:45:31,414 --> 01:45:32,148
-Pigeon Hill Court.
-Street.

1702
01:45:32,182 --> 01:45:33,784
-Pigeon Hill Road.
-Street.

1703
01:45:33,817 --> 01:45:35,619
-Fine, Pigeon Hill...
-Pigeon Hill Street.

1704
01:45:35,652 --> 01:45:37,621
-This is Pigeon Hill Road.
-Okay.

1705
01:45:37,653 --> 01:45:40,057
-You have no GPS whatsoever?
-No, I have a little fucking cartoon.

1706
01:45:40,089 --> 01:45:41,525
-You want me to punch it in for you?
-No, I don't.

1707
01:45:41,558 --> 01:45:44,194
I've got it, thank you.

1708
01:45:47,196 --> 01:45:49,165
Okay, listen.

1709
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:50,267
Are you nervous?

1710
01:45:50,299 --> 01:45:51,534
Yeah, I'm nervous.

1711
01:45:51,567 --> 01:45:53,202
What are you,
a fuckin' genius?

1712
01:45:53,236 --> 01:45:56,506
Okay, skip it.

1713
01:45:56,539 --> 01:45:59,476
Just want you to text me
if anything gets weird.

1714
01:45:59,509 --> 01:46:02,446
Okay. Thank you.

1715
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:21,397
My gosh.
Is that my Patrick?

1716
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:23,532
Hi, Mom.

1717
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,670
I'm so happy.

1718
01:46:27,704 --> 01:46:31,707
Come in.
Welcome to my home.

1719
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:36,546
Patrick.
This is my fella.

1720
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:38,782
Jeffrey,
this is Patrick...

1721
01:46:38,814 --> 01:46:40,549
Great to finally
meet you, Patrick.

1722
01:46:40,582 --> 01:46:43,853
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

1723
01:46:43,887 --> 01:46:45,455
And this is Lee.

1724
01:46:45,487 --> 01:46:47,557
Hey, welcome.

1725
01:46:47,589 --> 01:46:49,125
-Thanks.
-Jeffrey.

1726
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:50,661
Lee.

1727
01:46:53,329 --> 01:46:56,133
Now, Lee, are you sure
you can't stay for lunch?

1728
01:46:56,165 --> 01:46:59,570
I'm positive. Yeah.

1729
01:47:03,906 --> 01:47:06,209
All right.

1730
01:47:08,311 --> 01:47:09,278
Come, come.

1731
01:47:15,285 --> 01:47:18,321
Are you sure...
I can't help you...

1732
01:47:18,353 --> 01:47:19,522
No thanks, honey.

1733
01:47:19,555 --> 01:47:21,724
Your job is to relax.

1734
01:47:21,758 --> 01:47:24,260
That is your number one
assignment, okay?

1735
01:47:24,294 --> 01:47:27,330
Okay, all right.
I'm really gonna apply myself.

1736
01:47:27,362 --> 01:47:30,599
No, I was just joking.

1737
01:47:30,633 --> 01:47:32,469
I know you were.
So was I.

1738
01:47:37,773 --> 01:47:40,442
How we gettin' along?

1739
01:47:40,476 --> 01:47:41,911
-Great.
-Great.

1740
01:47:41,945 --> 01:47:45,348
You don't have to be
so polite, you know.

1741
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:47,584
I'm not being polite.

1742
01:47:51,687 --> 01:47:54,523
Did you wanna wash your
hands before we eat?

1743
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:57,327
Yes.

1744
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:03,633
For what we are about to
receive, let us give thanks.

1745
01:48:03,665 --> 01:48:04,633
-Amen.
-Amen.

1746
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:06,969
Amen.

1747
01:48:07,003 --> 01:48:09,505
You can say "Amen",
Patrick.

1748
01:48:09,539 --> 01:48:10,941
Nobody's tryin'
to recruit you.

1749
01:48:10,973 --> 01:48:12,241
I did say "Amen".

1750
01:48:12,275 --> 01:48:13,509
You did? Okay.

1751
01:48:13,543 --> 01:48:14,945
Well, you don't have to.

1752
01:48:14,978 --> 01:48:17,414
Yeah, I know. I just
said it really quietly.

1753
01:48:17,446 --> 01:48:19,782
It's fine, honey.

1754
01:48:19,816 --> 01:48:21,617
Look, I know I'm gonna
be a shock to you.

1755
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:23,553
In a lot of ways.

1756
01:48:23,585 --> 01:48:25,955
I'm hoping it's
a good shock.

1757
01:48:25,988 --> 01:48:27,490
Yeah.

1758
01:48:27,522 --> 01:48:28,691
You need anything
else, Patrick?

1759
01:48:28,724 --> 01:48:30,360
I hope everything's okay.

1760
01:48:30,393 --> 01:48:31,795
Yeah, everything's great.

1761
01:48:31,827 --> 01:48:34,231
You don't have
to be so formal.

1762
01:48:34,263 --> 01:48:35,397
I'm not.

1763
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,701
I think your mother
wants you to feel...

1764
01:48:37,733 --> 01:48:42,338
I'm just sayin' that
this is your home, too.

1765
01:48:42,371 --> 01:48:43,973
I want it to be.

1766
01:48:44,006 --> 01:48:46,610
And I know...

1767
01:48:46,643 --> 01:48:48,345
I know...

1768
01:48:48,378 --> 01:48:50,347
things are different for you.

1769
01:48:50,379 --> 01:48:52,448
Anyway, I don't know.

1770
01:48:52,482 --> 01:48:54,718
That's okay.

1771
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,457
What are you studying
at school, Patrick?

1772
01:49:01,491 --> 01:49:04,995
Well,
the usual stuff.

1773
01:49:05,027 --> 01:49:07,463
You know what?
I'm gonna be right back.

1774
01:49:07,496 --> 01:49:10,299
Does anybody need anything
from the kitchen?

1775
01:49:10,332 --> 01:49:11,934
-No, thanks. Thank you.
-I'm good, no.

1776
01:49:21,576 --> 01:49:24,613
Did you get some string beans?

1777
01:49:24,647 --> 01:49:27,550
No, not yet.
Thank you.

1778
01:49:27,582 --> 01:49:30,053
Let me...

1779
01:49:30,085 --> 01:49:32,421
Let me just see what
she's doin' in there.

1780
01:49:46,803 --> 01:49:48,572
So what was she like?

1781
01:49:50,372 --> 01:49:53,043
I don't know.
She was pretty nervous.

1782
01:49:53,076 --> 01:49:55,312
Yeah?

1783
01:49:55,344 --> 01:49:58,347
What was that guy like?

1784
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,284
He was very Christian.

1785
01:50:02,919 --> 01:50:05,421
You know, we're
Christian, too, right?

1786
01:50:05,455 --> 01:50:06,622
Yes, I know that.

1787
01:50:06,656 --> 01:50:09,326
You are aware that
Catholics are Christians?

1788
01:50:09,358 --> 01:50:10,927
Yes, I am aware of that.

1789
01:50:14,129 --> 01:50:17,666
Well, it sounds like
she's doin' better, anyway.

1790
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,903
She's not drinkin'.

1791
01:50:19,936 --> 01:50:21,638
She's not in
the psych ward.

1792
01:50:26,675 --> 01:50:29,778
What?

1793
01:50:29,812 --> 01:50:31,448
You'll do anything
to get rid of me.

1794
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:34,951
-What?
-You heard me.

1795
01:50:34,983 --> 01:50:36,786
That's not true.

1796
01:50:47,796 --> 01:50:50,967
<i>Dear Patrick, I'm writing
to thank you for today.</i>

1797
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,802
<i>Your visit meant
the world to your mom.</i>

1798
01:50:52,835 --> 01:50:55,105
<i>We are both deeply grateful
for the love and trust</i>

1799
01:50:55,138 --> 01:50:57,774
<i>you've shown by offering
to rejoin her life,</i>

1800
01:50:57,807 --> 01:51:00,410
<i>but I feel it would be unfair
to your mom to rush her along</i>

1801
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:02,644
<i>the long and challenging
road ahead,</i>

1802
01:51:02,678 --> 01:51:04,647
<i>and so I'm going
to ask you to write to me</i>

1803
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:07,416
<i>in future to arrange
any further visits.</i>

1804
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:11,455
<i>I hope you won't take
this as an intrusion...</i>

1805
01:51:34,009 --> 01:51:35,744
Where are your
friends tonight?

1806
01:51:35,777 --> 01:51:36,746
I don't know.

1807
01:51:38,781 --> 01:51:40,750
Why don't you
call that girl Sandy,

1808
01:51:40,782 --> 01:51:43,719
-see if she'll come over?
-No, thanks.

1809
01:51:43,753 --> 01:51:45,655
Nice try, though.

1810
01:52:08,844 --> 01:52:10,713
Who are you going
to shoot, you or me?

1811
01:52:12,214 --> 01:52:13,782
Do you know what these
things are worth?

1812
01:52:13,816 --> 01:52:14,918
No.

1813
01:52:16,751 --> 01:52:17,786
Want to try and sell them

1814
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,723
so you can have a motor
for the boat?

1815
01:52:22,692 --> 01:52:24,661
That's
a really good idea.

1816
01:52:38,773 --> 01:52:39,942
This is awesome.

1817
01:52:39,976 --> 01:52:41,110
This is awesome.

1818
01:52:41,143 --> 01:52:42,779
Do you want to drive?

1819
01:52:42,812 --> 01:52:43,947
Sure.

1820
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:45,948
All right.

1821
01:52:45,982 --> 01:52:47,584
My God!

1822
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,817
-I'm so sorry.
-That's all right.

1823
01:52:48,851 --> 01:52:50,586
That's all right.
Just straighten her out.

1824
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:52,121
-My God.
-Straighten her out.

1825
01:52:52,153 --> 01:52:54,523
-That's okay.
-Sorry.

1826
01:53:17,812 --> 01:53:19,281
Hey, I got to run
some chores.

1827
01:53:19,314 --> 01:53:20,884
I'll be back
in a couple hours.

1828
01:53:20,916 --> 01:53:22,117
-You want anything?
-No, thank you.

1829
01:53:22,151 --> 01:53:23,253
No, thanks, Mr. Chandler.

1830
01:53:23,286 --> 01:53:24,654
Thank you.

1831
01:53:27,956 --> 01:53:29,526
Set-up city.

1832
01:53:29,558 --> 01:53:30,793
What are you
talking about?

1833
01:53:30,826 --> 01:53:32,695
Yeah? How Sylvie McGann?

1834
01:53:32,728 --> 01:53:33,462
Who?

1835
01:53:33,495 --> 01:53:34,997
Just open the door.

1836
01:54:07,028 --> 01:54:08,830
I didn't think it was
our responsibility, but...

1837
01:54:08,863 --> 01:54:11,000
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, they could have...

1838
01:54:11,032 --> 01:54:11,968
It's okay.

1839
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,936
Lee.

1840
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:16,939
Hi.

1841
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:19,309
Hi.

1842
01:54:19,342 --> 01:54:21,210
Rachel, this is Lee.

1843
01:54:21,242 --> 01:54:22,911
-Hello.
-Lee, this is Rachel.

1844
01:54:22,945 --> 01:54:25,014
Hi. Hi.

1845
01:54:25,046 --> 01:54:26,816
And this is Dylan.

1846
01:54:29,919 --> 01:54:32,220
You can't
see him too good.

1847
01:54:32,254 --> 01:54:35,024
Hi, Dylan.

1848
01:54:35,057 --> 01:54:36,893
Very handsome.

1849
01:54:38,728 --> 01:54:40,697
Randi, you want me to get
the car and pick you up?

1850
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:42,698
-Yeah.
-That's okay. I got to go.

1851
01:54:42,732 --> 01:54:44,033
Actually, could...
Could we,

1852
01:54:44,066 --> 01:54:46,102
could we
talk for a second?

1853
01:54:46,134 --> 01:54:48,771
-Sure.
-Okay.

1854
01:54:48,804 --> 01:54:50,006
I'll just pull around.
Just be a few minutes.

1855
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:51,640
-Okay. Thanks.
-Nice to meet you.

1856
01:54:51,674 --> 01:54:53,043
-Yeah. You, too.
-Be right back.

1857
01:55:07,389 --> 01:55:09,092
I don't have
anything big to say.

1858
01:55:09,125 --> 01:55:11,027
That's okay.

1859
01:55:11,059 --> 01:55:12,062
I just...

1860
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:15,732
I know you've
been around, and I...

1861
01:55:15,764 --> 01:55:18,066
I've just been getting
Patrick settled in.

1862
01:55:18,099 --> 01:55:20,202
It seems like he's
doing pretty good?

1863
01:55:20,236 --> 01:55:21,970
Considering.

1864
01:55:22,004 --> 01:55:23,907
I think he is, yeah.

1865
01:55:25,775 --> 01:55:26,976
I guess
you don't know this,

1866
01:55:27,009 --> 01:55:28,277
but I...

1867
01:55:28,309 --> 01:55:30,847
I really kept
in touch with Joe.

1868
01:55:30,879 --> 01:55:32,114
-No, I knew that.
-It's been kind of weird

1869
01:55:32,147 --> 01:55:34,116
for me not seeing Patrick.
Okay.

1870
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,719
I... I didn't know.

1871
01:55:36,852 --> 01:55:38,388
You could see him
if you want.

1872
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:40,022
Could we ever have lunch?

1873
01:55:42,424 --> 01:55:44,159
You mean us, you and me?

1874
01:55:44,192 --> 01:55:46,128
Yeah.

1875
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,131
Because I...

1876
01:55:56,438 --> 01:55:58,874
I said a lot of terrible
things to you.

1877
01:55:58,907 --> 01:55:59,875
No.

1878
01:56:01,009 --> 01:56:02,110
But I...

1879
01:56:02,143 --> 01:56:03,379
I know you never...

1880
01:56:06,848 --> 01:56:08,250
Maybe you don't
want to talk to me.

1881
01:56:08,284 --> 01:56:10,687
-It's not that.
-Let me finish.

1882
01:56:12,153 --> 01:56:13,822
However...

1883
01:56:15,890 --> 01:56:17,927
My heart was broken.

1884
01:56:20,396 --> 01:56:22,965
It's always
going to be broken.

1885
01:56:24,733 --> 01:56:27,137
And I know
yours is broken, too.

1886
01:56:29,304 --> 01:56:31,941
But I don't
have to carry...

1887
01:56:33,308 --> 01:56:35,177
I said things that...

1888
01:56:37,045 --> 01:56:39,182
I should fucking burn in hell
for what I said to you.

1889
01:56:39,214 --> 01:56:40,148
No. No.

1890
01:56:40,182 --> 01:56:41,349
-It was...
-No, no, no, no.

1891
01:56:41,383 --> 01:56:42,452
Randi, no.

1892
01:56:42,485 --> 01:56:43,986
I'm just sorry.

1893
01:56:44,018 --> 01:56:46,155
It... I... I can't ex...
I can't...

1894
01:56:46,187 --> 01:56:47,690
I love you.

1895
01:56:50,192 --> 01:56:51,761
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

1896
01:56:51,794 --> 01:56:53,028
No, you can say that.

1897
01:56:53,062 --> 01:56:53,996
It's just...

1898
01:56:54,028 --> 01:56:55,298
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

1899
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,999
We couldn't have lunch?

1900
01:56:58,032 --> 01:56:59,835
I'm really sorry.
I don't think so.

1901
01:56:59,869 --> 01:57:01,237
I thank you for saying
everything you said.

1902
01:57:01,269 --> 01:57:02,738
You can't just die.

1903
01:57:02,772 --> 01:57:04,407
I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not.

1904
01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:06,476
But, honey... honey...

1905
01:57:06,509 --> 01:57:08,044
And I...
I want you to be happy.

1906
01:57:08,076 --> 01:57:11,046
Honey, I see you
walking around here,

1907
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,381
and I just want to tell you...

1908
01:57:12,414 --> 01:57:14,183
I would want to talk
to you, Randi,

1909
01:57:14,215 --> 01:57:16,218
-But, Lee...
-Please, I... I... I...

1910
01:57:16,251 --> 01:57:17,120
Because... I...

1911
01:57:17,152 --> 01:57:18,854
-Lee...
-I'm...

1912
01:57:18,888 --> 01:57:20,523
-I'm trying to...
-Lee, you've got to...

1913
01:57:20,555 --> 01:57:22,424
I don't know what...

1914
01:57:22,457 --> 01:57:23,860
Look, this is not...

1915
01:57:23,893 --> 01:57:25,228
I don't want
to torture you.

1916
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:26,094
You're not torturing me.

1917
01:57:26,128 --> 01:57:28,063
I just want to tell you

1918
01:57:28,097 --> 01:57:29,264
that I was wrong.

1919
01:57:29,298 --> 01:57:31,099
No. No.

1920
01:57:31,133 --> 01:57:33,169
You don't understand.
There's nothing...

1921
01:57:33,201 --> 01:57:35,036
There's nothing there.

1922
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:37,540
-There's nothing there.
-That's not true.

1923
01:57:37,572 --> 01:57:39,174
-That's not true.
-Let me say this.

1924
01:57:39,207 --> 01:57:40,242
You don't understand.

1925
01:57:40,276 --> 01:57:41,443
I understand you.

1926
01:57:41,477 --> 01:57:42,512
I don't know what to...

1927
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:44,113
I know you understand me.

1928
01:57:44,146 --> 01:57:46,249
I... I... I've got to go.

1929
01:57:46,281 --> 01:57:47,750
-Don't.
-I'm sorry.

1930
01:57:53,289 --> 01:57:54,256
I'm sorry.

1931
01:57:55,491 --> 01:57:56,793
Corner pocket.

1932
01:58:12,575 --> 01:58:14,811
-Pardon me.
-It's all right.

1933
01:58:16,312 --> 01:58:17,113
Shit.

1934
01:58:17,146 --> 01:58:18,281
Did you see that?

1935
01:58:18,313 --> 01:58:19,981
You want to hit us?
Want to hit us?

1936
01:58:20,014 --> 01:58:22,250
-God damn it!
-Come on, you little bastard!

1937
01:58:23,585 --> 01:58:24,553
Look out, look out, look out.

1938
01:58:24,586 --> 01:58:25,821
Look out, look out, look out!

1939
01:58:25,854 --> 01:58:27,423
Break it up! Break it up!

1940
01:58:27,455 --> 01:58:28,590
-George!
-Break it up!

1941
01:58:28,624 --> 01:58:29,925
Get off him! Break it up!

1942
01:58:29,959 --> 01:58:31,260
Back off, George!

1943
01:58:31,293 --> 01:58:33,161
-Fuck him!
-George, get out of here!

1944
01:58:33,195 --> 01:58:34,397
-Break him up!
-George!

1945
01:58:34,429 --> 01:58:35,597
Get him out
of here, George!

1946
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:37,098
He's Joey Chandler's brother.

1947
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:38,233
-Back off, back off.
-Fucking dude...

1948
01:58:38,267 --> 01:58:39,936
-Fuck...
-Hey, settle down.

1949
01:58:39,969 --> 01:58:42,205
Fuck him! Fuck him!

1950
01:58:42,237 --> 01:58:44,307
-He's a fucking douche bag!
-Settle down.

1951
01:58:44,339 --> 01:58:45,874
Settle down.
You won, all right?

1952
01:58:45,907 --> 01:58:47,108
Fuck
that motherfucker.

1953
01:58:47,142 --> 01:58:48,311
-Settle down.
-Okay, brother.

1954
01:58:48,344 --> 01:58:49,846
-You good?
-You won, all right?

1955
01:58:49,879 --> 01:58:51,280
-Are we cool?
-Fuck him.

1956
01:58:51,312 --> 01:58:52,981
Fuck him!

1957
01:58:54,215 --> 01:58:55,584
Come here. Get off.

1958
01:58:55,617 --> 01:58:57,253
-Get off. Get off.
-Leave him...

1959
01:58:57,286 --> 01:58:59,088
-Fuck you!
-Get the fuck off. Get him...

1960
01:59:00,455 --> 01:59:02,057
Should he go
to the hospital?

1961
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:03,892
I don't think so.
Nothing's broken.

1962
01:59:05,059 --> 01:59:06,329
What did they fucking
hit him with,

1963
01:59:06,362 --> 01:59:07,496
a baseball bat?

1964
01:59:07,528 --> 01:59:09,197
They all just said
he started swinging.

1965
01:59:09,231 --> 01:59:10,198
Where's Patrick?

1966
01:59:10,232 --> 01:59:11,300
He's with the kids.

1967
01:59:11,332 --> 01:59:12,602
I sent them out
for burgers.

1968
01:59:12,634 --> 01:59:13,869
No, no, no, no.

1969
01:59:13,902 --> 01:59:14,903
-Lee, sit down.
-Sit down.

1970
01:59:14,937 --> 01:59:16,305
Sit down. it's all right.

1971
01:59:18,206 --> 01:59:19,374
Let me give you some money.

1972
01:59:19,407 --> 01:59:21,043
Lee, please, I got it.

1973
01:59:21,076 --> 01:59:22,311
-I'll give you some money.
-Put that away.

1974
01:59:22,344 --> 01:59:23,980
-Please, no. I got it.
-Put your money away.

1975
01:59:24,013 --> 01:59:25,046
-Come on.
-I got it.

1976
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,015
I got it. It's on me.

1977
01:59:45,067 --> 01:59:48,037
I made you some coffee.
Come on. Drink this.

1978
01:59:49,138 --> 01:59:50,340
-Come on.
-Come on.

1979
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:52,575
Come on, buddy.

1980
01:59:52,607 --> 01:59:53,675
Just have a little.

1981
02:00:02,617 --> 02:00:06,222
It's all right. I'm going to get
you some ice for your face, okay?

1982
02:00:07,356 --> 02:00:08,358
It's all right.

1983
02:01:44,085 --> 02:01:46,054
Can I get you anything,
Uncle Lee?

1984
02:01:47,455 --> 02:01:49,458
No, thanks, buddy.

1985
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,295
All right.
I'm going to go to bed.

1986
02:01:55,363 --> 02:01:57,400
-Good night.
-Good night.

1987
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,486
Daddy.

1988
02:02:18,554 --> 02:02:20,089
Daddy.

1989
02:02:26,428 --> 02:02:27,830
Yes, honey?

1990
02:02:27,862 --> 02:02:30,499
Can't you see we're burning?

1991
02:02:33,835 --> 02:02:38,040
No, honey.
You're not burning.

1992
02:02:42,111 --> 02:02:43,813
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1993
02:02:55,557 --> 02:02:58,094
Uncle Lee,
what... what is that smell?

1994
02:02:58,126 --> 02:03:00,429
I just burned the sauce.
Everything's okay.

1995
02:03:48,376 --> 02:03:49,378
Yeah.

1996
02:03:51,513 --> 02:03:54,617
I got a job in Boston.
Starts in July.

1997
02:03:57,786 --> 02:03:59,255
What is it?

1998
02:03:59,287 --> 02:04:02,625
Custodian, handyman.

1999
02:04:02,657 --> 02:04:06,829
But it's just two buildings
this time, so...

2000
02:04:06,862 --> 02:04:09,899
And what, delightful
Boston neighborhood

2001
02:04:09,932 --> 02:04:11,834
have you selected
for us to live in?

2002
02:04:11,866 --> 02:04:14,669
-None.
-What do you mean?

2003
02:04:14,702 --> 02:04:17,606
You don't have
to move to Boston.

2004
02:04:17,638 --> 02:04:20,342
I want to be
in Charlestown,

2005
02:04:20,375 --> 02:04:22,512
and George is going
to take you.

2006
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:26,549
What?

2007
02:04:28,784 --> 02:04:30,652
I talked to him last week

2008
02:04:30,686 --> 02:04:33,555
and explained
the situation to him.

2009
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:35,658
Georgie Junior's
going to BU in the fall,

2010
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:37,293
and Jimmy graduates
next year.

2011
02:04:37,326 --> 02:04:40,362
We can rent this house out
until you turn 18.

2012
02:04:40,394 --> 02:04:42,397
Then you come back
and stay if you want.

2013
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:45,201
When you turn 21,
you're allowed to sell it

2014
02:04:45,233 --> 02:04:47,468
or keep it or whatever
you want to do.

2015
02:04:47,501 --> 02:04:51,941
We definitely have to hire out
the boat when summer's over.

2016
02:04:53,642 --> 02:04:55,644
Just like we talked about.

2017
02:04:55,677 --> 02:04:57,213
When you get your license,

2018
02:04:57,245 --> 02:05:00,315
then we can... we can just
figure that out

2019
02:05:00,348 --> 02:05:01,583
when it happens.

2020
02:05:02,683 --> 02:05:04,485
I'm still the trustee.

2021
02:05:04,518 --> 02:05:06,554
But all the financial stuff
that Joe set up for me

2022
02:05:06,588 --> 02:05:08,691
is going to get
transferred over to George.

2023
02:05:08,723 --> 02:05:10,358
So basically everything's
staying the same,

2024
02:05:10,392 --> 02:05:12,528
except you don't
have to move.

2025
02:05:16,464 --> 02:05:18,700
Thank you,
but, like, who's...

2026
02:05:18,733 --> 02:05:20,869
Are they going to be my
guardians, or are you going...

2027
02:05:20,902 --> 02:05:22,505
They're going to adopt you.

2028
02:05:28,643 --> 02:05:32,447
Anyway, that's just
how I set it up.

2029
02:05:32,481 --> 02:05:35,550
You don't have to.
It's up to you.

2030
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:39,521
So you're just
going to disappear?

2031
02:05:39,554 --> 02:05:40,556
No.

2032
02:05:40,589 --> 02:05:43,359
No.

2033
02:05:43,392 --> 02:05:46,329
I set it up this way
so you could stay here.

2034
02:05:47,562 --> 02:05:48,863
And they're really
glad to have you.

2035
02:05:48,897 --> 02:05:49,999
-They...
-I know, I know.

2036
02:05:50,031 --> 02:05:51,601
I mean, they're great,
but...

2037
02:05:54,702 --> 02:05:57,240
why can't you stay?

2038
02:05:57,973 --> 02:05:59,642
Come on, Patty.

2039
02:06:09,684 --> 02:06:11,286
I can't beat it.

2040
02:06:17,058 --> 02:06:18,760
I can't beat it.

2041
02:06:20,594 --> 02:06:21,597
I'm sorry.

2042
02:07:20,488 --> 02:07:22,090
What do you think?

2043
02:07:22,124 --> 02:07:24,460
It's going to be okay.

2044
02:07:24,492 --> 02:07:26,829
Are you one
of Stan Chandler's boys?

2045
02:07:26,862 --> 02:07:28,097
Yeah. I'm Lee.

2046
02:07:28,129 --> 02:07:29,864
I used to play chess
with your father

2047
02:07:29,897 --> 02:07:31,099
a long time ago.

2048
02:07:31,133 --> 02:07:33,001
He was a excellent
chess player.

2049
02:07:33,034 --> 02:07:34,402
That's him.

2050
02:07:34,436 --> 02:07:36,705
He's not still
living, is he?

2051
02:07:36,737 --> 02:07:37,772
No.

2052
02:07:37,805 --> 02:07:39,107
One of the sons

2053
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:40,976
passed away
recently, I heard.

2054
02:07:41,009 --> 02:07:43,412
Yeah, my brother Joe.

2055
02:07:43,445 --> 02:07:45,447
Very personable man.

2056
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:47,715
Yeah.

2057
02:07:47,749 --> 02:07:50,853
My father
passed away in 1959.

2058
02:07:50,885 --> 02:07:52,687
A young man.

2059
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:55,124
He worked on a tuna boat.

2060
02:07:55,156 --> 02:07:57,125
He got up one morning.

2061
02:07:57,159 --> 02:08:01,129
Some weather,
nothing dramatic.

2062
02:08:01,162 --> 02:08:03,831
And he never returned.

2063
02:08:03,865 --> 02:08:06,835
No signals, no maydays.

2064
02:08:06,867 --> 02:08:10,405
No one ever found out
what happened to him.

2065
02:09:30,986 --> 02:09:32,821
I'm going to get
some ice cream.

2066
02:09:32,853 --> 02:09:33,888
Go ahead.

2067
02:09:34,955 --> 02:09:36,659
Can I have
some money?

2068
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:39,795
Yes.

2069
02:10:09,823 --> 02:10:12,094
So when am I supposed
to move in with Georgie?

2070
02:10:12,126 --> 02:10:13,762
July.

2071
02:10:15,696 --> 02:10:17,965
I don't even have
a place to live yet.

2072
02:10:17,999 --> 02:10:19,668
They don't give you
an apartment?

2073
02:10:19,701 --> 02:10:21,971
Yeah, but I'm looking
for one with an extra room.

2074
02:10:23,138 --> 02:10:25,841
A room for
a pull-out sofa or...

2075
02:10:25,874 --> 02:10:27,242
What for?

2076
02:10:35,349 --> 02:10:37,719
So you can come
visit some time.

2077
02:10:41,022 --> 02:10:42,823
Or if you want to look
at colleges in Boston,

2078
02:10:42,857 --> 02:10:43,992
you could stay overnight.

2079
02:10:44,025 --> 02:10:45,527
I'm not going
to college.

2080
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:49,932
All right, then I'll have
an extra room for all my shit.

2081
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,769
Do we have to talk
about this now?

2082
02:10:54,803 --> 02:10:55,970
No.

2083
02:11:07,982 --> 02:11:08,950
Great throw.

2084
02:11:13,988 --> 02:11:15,057
Just let it go.

2085
02:11:18,026 --> 02:11:19,028
Heads up.

2086
02:11:51,461 --> 02:11:54,461
