00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,146
Yeah, I enjoy it,
but my school is

143
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,048
Still the most important thing.

144
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,951
And besides, Brent, no one
ever touches me except you

145
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,152
As you know damn well.

146
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:43,756

me what a lucky guy I am.

the two borgies

Who came in a little white ago?

150
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,608
You mean the ones
in the corner?

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,442
So what?

152
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,744
Just a couple of cyborgs.

153
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah, well, there's something
suspicious about 'em.

154
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,950
You know, Brent, sometimes
I just don't figure you.

155
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,218
You've got to be
one of the least

156

when it comes to cyborgs.

give me the creeps.

especially creepy.

You knocked them
dead again tonight.

Thanks, sugar.

163
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,140
What'd you say to McCord
to make him so serious?

164
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,207
It's not me.

165
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,177
He doesn't like the
looks of those two.

166
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,913
Uh, borgies.

167
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,315
Jesus, you too?

168
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,585
BRENT: I don't know, I just
have a bad feeling about them.

169
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,719
Well, maybe there's
a connection,

170
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,222
But something's
going on backstage.

171
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,723
What do you mean?

172

gorillas back there in suits,

173
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,461
By Maria's dressing room.

174
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,166

entertaining some pretty

175

176
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,902

BRENT: What?

178
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,906
BLUE: Well, some of the goods
taken some business from time

179
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,808
To time with some
well-to-do types,

180

happen to show up tonight?

Hey, where'd they go?

184
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,442
Come on!

185
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,510
Let's come up through backstage.

186
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,944
Blue, get behind the bar.

187
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,386
[Gunshots]

188
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,801
[Screaming]

189
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,741
[Gunshots]

190
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,627
See you later, cop.

191
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,069
[Gunshots]

192
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,206
Weave, you OK?

193
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,741
Yeah, they got me, pal.

194
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,743
But they didn't get me good.

195
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,091
Well, I don't know
why you rushed me.

196
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,393
We're here and the meeting
doesn't start for 40 minutes

197
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,361
Yet.

198
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,797
I apologize, sir.

199
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,999
I had a few points I'd like
to go over with you before we

200
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,033
Meet with general Braddock.

201
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,036
You know he hates
to be kept waiting.

202
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:21,040
Braddock can take a flying...
Uh, where's my briefcase?

203
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,775
Um, it's right here, sir.

204
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,986
Get any more word on
Senator Overstreet's murder?

205
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,189
[Sighs] Well,
Braddock seems think

206
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,891
It's linked to the
Project Blackhawk problem.

207
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,494
Well, I figured that much out.

208
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,863
I was against that project
right from the start.

209
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,265
So was Overstreet.

210
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,668
Dammit, I hate dealing
with the military.

211
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,439
General Braddock seems think
we can still make it work, sir.

212
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,642
General Braddock
is full of shit.

213
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,211
That project was mishandled
right from the start.

214
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,979
He gave his man Peck
too much leeway.

215
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,815
Now it's totally out of control.

216
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,685
You're trying to say
we can't regain control?

217
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,020
I'm saying there's only one
thing we can do with it now,

218
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,890
And that's shut it down.

219
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,525
Close down Blackhawk?

220
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,861
But we've put millions into it.

221
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,229
Wipe it out.

222
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,330
Leave no trace.

223
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,998
Make it look like it
never existed at all.

224
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,502
Listen, if we can't do
that, and do it now,

225
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,637
Then we at all better get
the hell out of the country

226
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,438
And fast.

227
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:39,752
[Gunshots]

228
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,373
Hey, Veena.

229
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,774
Don't they ever let you go home?

230
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,012
Well, fellows, if
it wasn't for you,

231
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,748
I probably would be home by now.

232
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,817
Well, just doing my job, Veena.

233
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,753
And making my tougher.

234
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,289
So, what do we have here?

235
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,593
What we have is possibly
a very sticky situation.

236
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,262
Come, let me show you
what I have found.

237
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,271
We have two cyborgs.

238
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,806
This one is almost
totally reinforced

239
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,843
With a titanium steel alloy
throughout his midsection.

240
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,679
He's virtually indestructible.

241
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,681
He was killed with a bullet
penetrating the heart.

242
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,621
She had much more
humanity than the other.

243
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,557
A shot to the throat
[inaudible] to kill her,

244
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,792
Connecting the link
up to the brain.

245
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,727
What is all that,
um, white stuff?

246
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,633
I believe it's a
preservative of some kind,

247
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,603
Possibly a substrate for blood.

248
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,474
Do you have any idea where
these cyborgs are from?

249
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:12,011
It is my speculation that it
is government property, probably

250
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,846
Army or something like that.

251
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,484
What makes you so sure?

252
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,419
I may only be a
coroner, but I know

253
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,187
The difference between
commercial work

254
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,855
And fighting machines.

255
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,325
These two are specifically
built for combat,

256
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,026
And they have a
high pain tolerance

257
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,730
And can withstand
any temperature.

258
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,333
Are these two unique?

259
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,902
Their circuitry and
programming is very complex.

260
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm sure there's more from
where these came from.

261
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,410
Well, we better get going.

262
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,846
BRENT: Um, look, if you,
uh, find out anything else,

263
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,315
Give us a call at the office.

264
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,115
Sure.

265
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,954
Major Wright, gentlemen.

266
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:28,921
Have a seat.

267
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,762
So, uh, what can I do for you?

268
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,130
Well, you're familiar
with a massacre

269
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,367
At Sharkey's last night?

270
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,569
Yes, I saw it on television.

271
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,939
Yes, well, it seems that
two cyborgs strolled in there

272
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,241
And blew the place apart
for no apparent reason.

273
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,244
But what has that got
to do with the Army?

274
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:56,015
The coroner report states
it was a government model

275
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,984
With very sophisticated parts.

276
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,423
All of our soldiers are humans.

277
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,658
The government
doesn't build robots.

278
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,660
[Knocking]

279
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,163
Come in.

280
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,500
Here's that design on that
Blackhawk 2000 for the colonel.

281
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,934
Uh, not now, Sam.

282
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,235
I'm busy.

283
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,036
Oh.

284
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,406
Sorry.

285
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,808
So where was I?

286
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,009
Oh yes, yes, yes.

287
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,211
I understand the marines
are experimenting

288
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:29,181
With some cybernetic tanks
or something of that nature.

289
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,519
I'm afraid that's all
I can tell you, sorry.

290
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,589
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me.

291
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:42,028
What's the Blackhawk 2000?

292
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,432
I'm sorry, this classified
Army information.

293
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,066
Now, if you gentlemen
would excuse me,

294
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,000
I have some work to do.

295
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,968
Thank you.

296
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:49,769
Of course.

297
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,077
Hold up.

298
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,211
You guys the police?

299
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah.

300
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,081
Show me your badges.

301
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,887
All right, look.

302
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,155
I know what's going on.

303
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,724
I can tell you
about the cyborgs.

304
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:45,958
I help make them.

305
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,661
Do you know why they
attacked a club last night?

306
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,162
Look, not here.

307
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,265
There's this alleyway off
of Hollywood and Vine.

308
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,467
We know the place.

309
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,936
Meet me there tonight at 11:45.

310
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,270
I'll answer your questions then.

311
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,241
Make sure no one follows you.

312
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,042
Gotcha.

313
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,947
No, I hear you loud
and clear, general.

314
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,348
Yeah.

315
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,149
No, no, don't worry.

316
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,016
It won't happen again.

317
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,818
You've got my word on it.

318
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,720
Goodbye.

319
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,921
Nice tie.

320
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,591
You know who that was on
the phone just now, boys?

321
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,894
General Braddock
over at the Pentagon.

322
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,995
Seems like your
little visits you

323
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,164
Made to [inaudible]
made some pretty

324
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,066
Big waves with those boys.

325
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,569
I'd like to know what the
hell you think you're doing.

326
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,170
Well, we can, uh,
explain that, captain.

327
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:07,907
Go on.

328
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,809
I'd like to hear it.

329
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,945
Well, Weaver and I, we have
stumbled onto something big.

330
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,617
I, uh, think the
Army is involved

331
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,552
With some way with the
Overstreet assassination

332
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,253
And Sharkey's last night.

333
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,454
And the Quay
assassination as well.

334
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,993
Go on.

335
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,596
Well, we checked and found
that the two dead cyborgs

336
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,097
At Sharkey's were
government-issued,

337
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,567
The kind that were being
turned on back in the '90s.

338
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,007
You guys are out of your
fucking minds, you know that?

339
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,342
BRENT: It's true, sir.

340
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,078
And we think the Army is
trying to cover it up.

341
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,614
When we left Major
Wright's we ran

342
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,716
Into a possible
information source,

343
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,152
And he said that something
covert was going on.

344
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:58,991
So we've arranged a
meeting with him later.

345
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,360
So who is this
reliable source, huh?

346
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,862
JIM: You know we can't
reveal that until we're

347
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,263
Sure of our information.

348
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,064
All right.

349
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,971
And you have a meeting
set up with this guy.

350
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes, sir.

351
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,709
For tonight.

352
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,011
Forget it.

353
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:19,812
What?

354
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,147
I said forget it.

355
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,048
Cancel the meeting.

356
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,115
Do not show up for that.

357
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:23,983
You hear me?

358
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:24,784
Are you crazy?

359
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:25,852
We can't do that.

360
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:34,694
[Stammers] What he means
is, you can't be serious?

361
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,695
I can.

362
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:36,663
And I am.

363
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,702
Captain, two United
States senators have

364
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,837
Been assassinated, murdered.

365
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,438
Look, I know all
about that, McCord.

366
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,740
But you know what that means?

367
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,776
It means you two have got
to find their murders, see?

368
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:50,576
Only.

369
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:51,944
Leave the Army out of it.

370
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,647
[Sighs] I can't believe
I've hearing this shit.

371
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,916
Just stay away from
the Army, McCord.

372
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,918
And forget about that
meeting, you got it?

373
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,454
That's a direct order.

374
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,423
You boys are excused.

375
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,475
Hey, sugar.

376
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,211
Are you lookin' for some action?

377
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,612
Yeah.

378
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,980
Party's at our place.

379
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,449
Look, I'm just meeting
someone here, so, uh.

380
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,583
Oh, come on now.

381
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,886
Lizzy feels like getting
her knees dirty for you.

382
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:34,721
Mmm.

383
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,655
What do you say? [Inaudible].

384
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,090
Look, I'm really
not interested.

385
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,958
Oh, we won't hurt you.

386
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:39,759
Maybe just a little.

387
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,093
Yeah.

388
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,063
We don't bite unless, uh,
it's what you're into.

389
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,331
Yeah, maybe some other time.

390
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,565
Thank you.

391
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,434
Well, honey, you ain't
gonna find a better girl

392
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:49,401
No where on this block.

393
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,202
Mhmm.

394
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,070
What she said.

395
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,871
Yeah.

396
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:52,872
He'll be back.

397
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:53,672
Huh.

398
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,346
Hey.

399
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,315
I didn't say anything, I swear.

400
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,019
[Gunshots]

401
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,788
Search him.

402
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,761
Freeze, [inaudible].

403
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,764
[Gunshots]

404
00:28:56,702 --> 00:30:20,286
[Grunts]

405
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,754
Oh, Brent.

406
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:35,201
[Breathes heavily] Brent.

407
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,203
We have to take
it easy, brother.

408
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,704
Yeah, help's coming.

409
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,706
I got you.

410
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,174
[Inaudible].

411
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,843
Don't try to talk,
man. [Inaudible].

412
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,012
We'll have you
fixed up in no time.

413
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,481
[Inaudible].

414
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,955
[Crying]

415
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:56,923
They won't kill you.

416
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,394
[Crying]

417
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,367
[Sirens]

418
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,658
COLONEL PECK: Report Hair.

419
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,928
Captain Hair, reporting, sir.

420
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,829
Target Sam Ames is dead.

421
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,269
Are you sure?

422
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,572
Oh, I'm real sure.

423
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,540
Also dusted one of those
two cops I told you about.

424
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,681
Only one.

425
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,183
I had a little trouble, sir.

426
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:05,224
What kind of trouble
was that, Captain Hair?

427
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,194
It was that second cop.

428
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,963
He's like no other human
I've ever gone up against.

429
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,064
He killed Lead Eye.

430
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:24,576
You're telling me that,
uh, that one cop took you?

431
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,545
It was no ordinary
cop, Colonel.

432
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:35,654
Fighting him was... well, it
was like fighting another borg.

433
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:36,588
Another borg?

434
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,193
What is it you're saying?

435
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:47,066
What I'm trying to say,
sir, is that he was good.

436
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,468
He could've the man that dusted
Deep Throat and Ratchet Jaw

437
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,469
At the club.

438
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,642
What did he look like?

439
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:02,181
Well, he was six foot, had
black hair, blue eyes, a

440
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:07,419
Crooked nose, and a wide mouth.

441
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,857
Crooked nose, blue eyes.

442
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,429
McCord.

443
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,230
Sir?

444
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:28,407
[Chuckles] After all
this time, finally.

445
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,842
Finding McCord.

446
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,211
What are you saying, sir?

447
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,980
You... you know this guy?

448
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:35,781
Know him?

449
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:46,592
Captain Hair, [laughs] you
might say he's like my brother.

450
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,560
McCord.

451
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,529
You bastard!

452
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:54,966
[Laughs]

453
00:33:55,067 --> 00:34:01,440
[Buzzes lips] How
did you get in here?

454
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,311
Why did those bastard machines
of yours kill my partner?

455
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,778
I've got nothing to say to you.

456
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,749
Hell, well I have
something to say to you.

457
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,518
So listen up.

458
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,487
First, I'm going to find
those clowns of yours

459
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,023
And cancel every one
of their fucking asses.

460
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:21,960
Then I'm gonna gather
enough evidence

461
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,164
On you to have you court
marshaled and put in jail

462
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,298
Where you belong.

463
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,334
Look, I'm sorry for what
happened to your friend

464
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,269
And whatever happened to you.

465
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,838
But you're getting into
this matter much too deeply.

466
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:36,542
There are other people
involved, professional people

467
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,445
Know what they're doing.

468
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:40,912
I think you're full of shit!

469
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,516
And I think we've
talked enough.

470
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:48,754
It's time for you to leave.

471
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:59,598
[Breathes heavily]
You're finished, Frank.

472
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:15,814
[Sighs]

473
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,318
I gave you an explicit order
not to go to that meeting,

474
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,488
And you deliberately disobeyed
that order, didn't you, McCord?

475
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,956
You also told me to
find the murderer.

476
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,024
That's...

477
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,829
Look, I don't want
to hear that, McCord.

478
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,599
Where do you get off, huh?

479
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,368
Where do you get off taking
matters into your own hands?

480
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,038
What gives you the right to
disobey a direct order, huh?

481
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,507
And go above the law?

482
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,176
Captain, we were
on to something.

483
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,244
Oh, Jesus.

484
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,578
I don't want to hear
that again, McCord.

485
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:47,979
I don't want to hear
anything from you

486
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,750
Right now, not word one.

487
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,485
I've got a man down out there.

488
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,887
And you know why?

489
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,057
Because he disobeyed
an order, McCord.

490
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,093
And you... you're as responsible
for that man's murder

491
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,729
As the guy as who
pulled that trigger.

492
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,797
Don't you think I know that?

493
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,865
Weaver was my partner.

494
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,367
How do you think I feel?

495
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:11,903
If he were here right now, he'd
tell you we were onto something

496
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,005
Big, something that
involved the Army.

497
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,674
And we both knew it.

498
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:16,675
I don't want to hear it.

499
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,678
Something really
rotten is going down.

500
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,415
And nobody is doing
anything about it.

501
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,951
They killed my partner.

502
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:30,021
I'm gonna bust their asses
if I have to blast my way

503
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,058
Into the Pentagon to do it.

504
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,726
You're not gonna
fuck with the Army.

505
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,562
I ought to bust your
ass except that I

506
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:39,531
Got a shortage of good men.

507
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,332
Yeah?

508
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:44,102
Fuck your shortage.

509
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,572
I quit.

510
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,973
What're you gonna do, huh?

511
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:48,840
Take to the streets?

512
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,141
Let me tell ya.

513
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,977
You wouldn't last two days
out there without this badge

514
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,144
To protect you.

515
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,446
Out there?

516
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,115
Why, you'd just be another
hot-headed punk with a gun.

517
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,351
And sooner or later,
McCord, I'd have

518
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:03,188
To come out and cancel you.

519
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,122
Don't make me do that.

520
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,859
Jesus Christ.

521
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,028
This isn't the '90s, you know?

522
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:10,896
I wish it was.

523
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,235
McCord, this whole country
is this close... this close...

524
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,337
To busting right at the seams.

525
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,671
And you know what's
holding it together?

526
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,840
Two things, two things.

527
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,877
The Army and us.

528
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,580
So we take care of the murderers
and the... and the pimps,

529
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,782
And the punks, and the whores.

530
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,918
If there's something rotten
in the political system,

531
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,453
Well, the Army
takes care of that.

532
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,756
And one thing we don't do,
we don't fuck with the Army.

533
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,124
Well, yeah?

534
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,226
Well, who's policing the Army?

535
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:47,399
You're on thin ice, McCord.

536
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,301
And you know what
I want you to do?

537
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:52,438
I want you to go home
and get some rest.

538
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,574
Take a couple days off and
you come back and see me.

539
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,876
I will give you
your new assignment.

540
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,077
My what?

541
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,947
As of right now,
you're off this case.

542
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,082
You can't do that to me!

543
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,151
Watch me.

544
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:06,952
Do I make myself clear?

545
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:14,059
Yes, sir.

546
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:50,596
I'll see you in two days

547
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:54,099
You couldn't do
it, not this way.

548
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,067
What's wrong with
how I'm doing it?

549
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,970
Because, baby, what you're
planning to do isn't justice.

550
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,706
It's revenge.

551
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,608
BRENT: That's right, it is.

552
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:06,378
They murdered my
partner, my best friend.

553
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,880
What do you expect me to
do, slap them on the wrist

554
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,649
And make them stand
in the corner?

555
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,317
BLUE: What about me?

556
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:15,086
What happens to me if you go
off and you get yourself killed?

557
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,358
I'm not the one that's
gonna die tonight.

558
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,094
Oh, Brent.

559
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,362
Please don't be stupid.

560
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,735
What do you want from me?

561
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:34,172
Can't you see that something
is very, very wrong?

562
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:38,710
[Inaudible] hasn't been bought
off or at least scared off.

563
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,381
Now there's no one
else left but me.

564
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,217
Can't you see that?

565
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,954
And what if you die?

566
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,355
Huh?

567
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:53,258
What happens then?

568
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,360
You knew the risk when
you fell for a cop.

569
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,496
[Sighs] Brent.

570
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,998
Please don't go, baby.

571
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,000
Please don't go.

572
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,001
Please, baby.

573
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,914
You're still gonna
go, aren't you?

574
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,816
I have to, baby.

575
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,684
Then I'm going too.

576
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,786
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

577
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,987
It's gonna be dangerous.

578
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,989
I mean it, Brent.

579
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,224
You're gonna need help now.

580
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,959
So I'll be your partner.

581
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,360
Blue, you've got to get real.

582
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,062
This is gonna be dangerous.

583
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,096
That's right.

584
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,765
You could get killed.

585
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,534
And I'm not going to
live without you, McCord.

586
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:52,638
If we go, we go together.

587
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:55,040
You realize what you're
getting yourself into?

588
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,007
Yes.

589
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,142
All right, let's go.

590
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,046
Ah ha.

591
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:41,880
Pay dirt.

592
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,882
You found something?

593
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,351
Well, not something.

594
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:47,385
Everything.

595
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:50,188
What is it?

596
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:54,960
Some birth records of some
are least favorite cyborgs.

597
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,229
Let me see.

598
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,833
"Severely wounded while
attempting escape."

599
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,735
Son of a bitch.

600
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,072
Seems that my pale
friend here was, uh,

601
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,674
A prisoner at Leavenworth
prior to picking

602
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:10,876
Up some much needed new parts.

603
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:14,980
Lovely.

604
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,282
"Convicted murderer
and pederast.

605
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,952
Shot before a firing squad."

606
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,421
Some more lovable types here.

607
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,800
Brent.

608
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,801
What is that?

609
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,302
What's the matter?

610
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,739
Oh.

611
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,241
It's not true!

612
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,743
Oh my god.

613
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:48,046
"Lieutenant Brent C.
McCord was stationed

614
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,782
At the American
embassy in Beirut."

615
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,518
Lieutenant, huh?

616
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:54,786
[Inaudible]

617
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:57,355
"When he was seriously
wounded in a terrorist bombing.

618
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:03,594
He later died"... my god...
"while undergoing " Uh.

619
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,098
"Cybernetic transformation
and memory block authorized

620
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:14,672
By Major Collin Wright."

621
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,640
Come on, Brent.

622
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,641
We've got to get out of here.

623
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,043
Come on.

624
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:18,844
Come on!

625
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:12,390
[Gunshots]

626
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:28,273
What the hell did you do to him?

627
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,074
Shut up.

628
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,615
Well, it doesn't look as if
he'll be much trouble now.

629
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,263
Let's get him out of
here on the double.

630
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:55,266
[Inaudible].

631
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,268
Don't take him out
of here so fast.

632
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,174
I'd give a closer look
at these intruders.

633
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,243
There's nothing to worry
about here, Colonel.

634
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,445
We have the situation
well in hand.

635
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,246
All right, let's go.

636
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:09,214
Let's get them out of here.

637
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,182
Major.

638
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,783
I said wait.

639
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:13,584
Wait.

640
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,365
Guh.

641
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:34,172
[Laughs] [inaudible]
good work, Major.

642
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,575
See, I don't care what you
do with the rest of them.

643
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,545
I want this one in my
office in five minutes.

644
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,314
I'm sorry, Colonel,
but I can't do that.

645
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,282
You can't what?

646
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:51,122
Major, perhaps you, uh... you
forget to whom you're speaking.

647
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:54,025
No, sir, but this is
Project Rogue business.

648
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,627
As you know, we
have our procedures.

649
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,397
Uh huh.

650
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,667
Well, perhaps I could
phrase it another way.

651
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,104
I'm sure you're cognizant
of the chain of command.

652
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:07,172
I'm a colonel.

653
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,641
You're a major.

654
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,577
This colonel has given
this major a direct order,

655
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,512
Which will be obeyed.

656
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,614
This man will be in my
office in five minutes.

657
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,450
With all due respect,
sir, as officer

658
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,687
In charge of Project Rogue,
I take my orders only

659
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:23,754
From General Braddock.

660
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:30,661
Have a nice evening, Major.

661
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,069
Glad that's over with.

662
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,874
What should we do with
these two now, Major?

663
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,010
Take them back to the base?

664
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,646
No, I don't think that's
a good idea right now.

665
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,715
I know a better
place to put them.

666
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,150
Yes, sir?

667
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,983
Call Professor Mancini.

668
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:59,824
Tell him to meet
us at this address.

669
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,093
Tell him I need him immediately.

670
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,661
Yes, sir.

671
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,563
Where you taking us?

672
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,165
MAJOR WRIGHT: To some
place where we can talk.

673
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,666
To jail?

674
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:09,467
MAJOR WRIGHT: Oh no.

675
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,868
It's a place better.

676
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:11,669
To your house.

677
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:34,925
Good, you're awake.

678
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,894
Wha... wha... where am I?

679
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,096
We're in your own bed.

680
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:42,633
Just relax a minute while
I go and get someone.

681
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:48,606
[Groans] Ow.

682
00:51:52,210 --> 00:52:14,098
[Groans]

683
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,333
Well, McCord, how
are you feeling?

684
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,104
Where's Blue?

685
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:21,606
She's perfectly all right.

686
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,208
You'll be seeing here soon.

687
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:25,443
But how do you feel?

688
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,878
How do you think I feel?

689
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,516
I would think you have
a lot of questions.

690
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:32,450
BRENT: Oh?

691
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,385
Whatever will give
you that idea?

692
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,855
I mean, just because I find
out I'm some kind of cyborg

693
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:42,527
And that I... I've been living
a lie for the past few years?

694
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:45,863
Whatever would give you the
idea that I have questions?

695
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,031
PROFESSOR MANCINI:
OK, easy McCord.

696
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,533
Oh, fuck you.

697
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,734
MAJOR WRIGHT: All
right, let's calm.

698
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,668
No, no.

699
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,902
Fuck you too.

700
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,104
What the hell gives you
the right to do this to me?

701
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,172
You were about to die?

702
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:57,875
Well, you should've
let me die then.

703
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,777
McCord, I can understand
how you must feel.

704
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:03,047
But I'm not going to stand here
and argue the morality of it.

705
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:04,715
What's done is done.

706
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,551
When that car bomb in
Beirut took you out,

707
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,387
There wasn't enough... left
of you to put together.

708
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:12,122
You were a dying man... no
family, no attachments.

709
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:14,359
And we needed a subject.

710
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:15,460
A subject?

711
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,694
Yes, a subject.

712
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,663
And you were the perfect choice.

713
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,666
OK, so that said, I'm...
I'm not a man anymore.

714
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:25,270
I'm just an experiment?

715
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,604
A robot?

716
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,706
You are not a robot.

717
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:31,141
You just have a few new parts.

718
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,344
Professor Mancini, you tell.

719
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,680
This is Professor Mancini.

720
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,584
He headed the research project
that developed this technology.

721
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,018
Oh really?

722
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:44,289
So I should... I
should call you Daddy.

723
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,123
Look, I'm not here to win
your approval, Mr. McCord.

724
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,293
Oh, then why the hell
are you here, then?

725
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,761
To check up on your experiment?

726
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,129
PROFESSOR MANCINI:
Let's face facts here.

727
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,865
You were an experiment,
McCord, like it or not.

728
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,034
We built you practically
from the ground up.

729
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,869
We erased certain
memories pertaining

730
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,305
To your time in the service.

731
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:02,373
We even returned you
back into society.

732
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:05,643
So yes, you were an experiment,
a very successful one,

733
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,811
I might add.

734
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:11,349
So all this time on the
force, all these years,

735
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,917
You've been watching me?

736
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:16,454
We never have lost track of
you, if that's what you mean.

737
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,255
Don't worry, though,
you've had your privacy.

738
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:20,024
Oh, thanks.

739
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,926
Come on, McCord.

740
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,193
Snap out of it.

741
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:25,062
It's not as bad as all that.

742
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:27,998
You've got some new parts
that are 100 times stronger

743
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,700
Than the originals,
but you're still

744
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,969
A man in the ways that count.

745
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,438
So I'm new and improved?

746
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,075
So why tell me all this?

747
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:40,445
Why not just erase my memory?

748
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:43,013
Because we need
your help, McCord.

749
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,416
Have you ever heard
the term, "cybernator"?

750
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,819
Sure, isn't that one of
those hologram movies?

751
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,688
MAJOR WRIGHT: No, it's the
name of the secret government

752
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,457
Project that was
involved in creating

753
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,692
Military cyborg assassins.

754
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,995
The only glitch was that once
they created the cyborgs,

755
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,965
They found out that they
couldn't control them.

756
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,967
They had to terminate
the whole project.

757
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,470
All borgs were to be erased.

758
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,071
Right, so?

759
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,939
So the cyborgs found out.

760
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,275
And they went
underground for 10 years.

761
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:13,878
We lost all trace of them.

762
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,245
Now over the last
year and a half,

763
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:19,049
They've begun to resurface
as assassins, the function

764
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,051
For which they were created.

765
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,388
Only now we've
become the target.

766
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,122
At last count, they
had assassinated

767
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:28,859
A total of 12 military
leaders and politicians.

768
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,294
So you've got a problem?

769
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,529
Why call on me?

770
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,898
Because you are
our ace in the hole.

771
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,833
That's why we put
you with the police.

772
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,168
In the eight months this
bunch has been on the loose,

773
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,938
We tracked them down and
fought the five times.

774
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,807
We lost every time.

775
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,875
You, on the other hand, have
gone up against them twice

776
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,945
And beat them both times.

777
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,647
And now you want me
to clean up your mess.

778
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:50,848
Is that it?

779
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,050
MAJOR WRIGHT: I sure makes
you the logical choice.

780
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,420
Well, what if I don't want to?

781
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,754
MAJOR WRIGHT: That's
not a request, son.

782
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,222
That's an order.

783
00:55:58,322 --> 00:55:59,890
You're still in the army.

784
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,526
PROFESSOR MANCINI: You
have the advantage.

785
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,293
The other cyborgs
you've seen are

786
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,630
Part of an older technology
developed during the Falcon

787
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,865
Project of the 1990s.

788
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:11,769
Except for a few touches that
are still military secrets,

789
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,404
Most of the
technology in cyborgs

790
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,506
Is available in the
commercial marketplace.

791
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:18,509
You, on the other hand,
are a Blackhawk class.

792
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,445
Your cybermechanics
are all internally

793
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,346
Contained, no external parts.

794
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:25,015
Plus your speed and agility
are several times that

795
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,684
Of the earlier models.

796
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:29,119
And now you want me to go up
against your other experiments,

797
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:29,920
Is that it?

798
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,194
Well, what if I don't
want to play cybernator?

799
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:38,829
There must be others
like me, right?

800
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:42,700
There is one other Blackhawk
class cyborg in existence.

801
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,470
Why the hell don't you go
get him to ice those guys?

802
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,606
For military reasons,
I can't tell you more.

803
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:51,442
Oh great, just fucking great.

804
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,243
PROFESSOR MANCINI: He's
not your equal in any case.

805
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,513
He was created first,
actually, the prototype

806
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:56,914
Of the Blackhawk series.

807
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,149
By the time we got to
you, we had improved

808
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,985
The model significantly.

809
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,352
BRENT: Really, really?

810
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:05,255
Well, how come that doesn't
make me feel any better then?

811
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,357
MAJOR WRIGHT: Those are
the facts, Mr. McCord.

812
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,626
What's your answer?

813
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,761
Will you help us?

814
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,697
Do... do I have any choice?

815
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,632
MAJOR WRIGHT: Not really.

816
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:15,633
All right, what about Blue?

817
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,502
What'll happen to her?

818
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,069
She's quite all
right at the moment.

819
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,204
And what does that mean?

820
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,005
Where's Blue?

821
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,139
I want to see her.

822
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,641
MAJOR WRIGHT: You'll
see her, McCord, just as

823
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,210
Soon as we finish our business.

824
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:29,179
I'm not doing nothing
till I've seen Blue.

825
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,581
MAJOR WRIGHT:
Understand one thing,

826
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:34,685
McCord, what you think of us and
our work isn't important to me.

827
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,055
But stopping those rogue cyborgs
is absolutely imperative.

828
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,156
We need you to do that.

829
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,892
And Blue stays with
us until you do.

830
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,995
Or you're dead.

831
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,732
Think about that.

832
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,233
We'll be right in the next room.

833
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,411
So, they patched
you up pretty well.

834
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,114
On my outsides, maybe.

835
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,983
I'm still burning
on the inside, Blue.

836
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,321
I feel like my bed is on fire.

837
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:15,893
I need to latch onto
something, someone.

838
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:16,827
I feel the same way, Brent.

839
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,163
I'm with you.

840
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,331
So what do we do now, McCord?

841
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,800
Are you with me, then?

842
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,268
I'll always be with you, baby.

843
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:39,316
They want me to track
down the other cyborgs.

844
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:42,753
They're holding
you as insurance.

845
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,954
Me?

846
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,091
But isn't that what you
were after, to get Peck?

847
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,192
But that was different.

848
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,727
Then it was my idea.

849
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,863
And that was before all this.

850
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,965
You saying you've
changed your mind?

851
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:55,766
No, no.

852
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:56,901
It's not that.

853
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,636
It's just that I don't
like the way they work.

854
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,938
At first they
turned me into this,

855
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:05,042
And... then they blackmail me
into doing their dirty work.

856
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:05,843
So?

857
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,645
I just don't like it, Blue.

858
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:08,613
I don't like it.

859
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,380
So what are you gonna do?

860
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,351
I'm gonna do exactly
what they want me to do.

861
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:17,287
Then, um, I'm
coming back for ya.

862
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,390
We're gonna go away some
place where we can be alone.

863
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,427
Just you and me.

864
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,295
I'm waiting right
here for you, Brent.

865
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,296
That you can count on.

866
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,580
[Sighs]

867
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:46,116
Well, McCord, what
have you decided?

868
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,552
I want your guarantee
that Blue will be OK.

869
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,454
Nothing will happen to her.

870
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,156
You have my word.

871
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,258
And I want her here
where I can call

872
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,060
And talk to her at any time.

873
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,394
Forget it, McCord.

874
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:58,963
She goes into high security.

875
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,865
Get this straight, Wright.

876
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:02,767
You need me to do this job.

877
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:04,434
If I decide not to...

878
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:05,870
We kill Blue.

879
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:11,909
Yeah, well, you could kill
Blue and you can kill me.

880
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,044
But that still won't
solve your rogue problem.

881
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:16,213
I want her here,
Wright, or no deal.

882
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,983
All right, all right,
we'll do it your way.

883
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:19,784
All right.

884
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:20,985
What about equipment?

885
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,087
I have plenty of my own.

886
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:26,256
I just need a couple
things from you.

887
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,057
MAJOR WRIGHT: Name it.

888
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:36,066
First, I need that weapon
you used on me last night.

889
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,367
MAJOR WRIGHT:
Absolutely, McCord.

890
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,036
That's a good choice.

891
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,006
That was developed especially
to use with rogues.

892
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,074
In fact, we call it
the rogue killer.

893
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,475
Yeah.

894
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,745
It's funny you haven't come up
with a way to track them yet.

895
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,646
We had, almost.

896
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52,349
Sam Ames was developing
the prototype.

897
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,618
Unfortunately, he was killed
in the alley where you had

898
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,687
Your fight with the cybernator.

899
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:59,356
I could only assume
that they got it.

01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,425
Dammit.

901
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,794
Yeah, that's too bad.

902
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,696
Well, we'll just have
to do without it.

903
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,436
They must have a
secret base operation.

904
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,940

I'll say two or three

You're pretty
confident, aren't you?

909
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:32,056
What makes you think
it'll be so easy?

910
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:34,925
You just keep up your
end of the bargain.

911
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,127
I'll be calling here tonight.

Where will you be?

913
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,733
I'll let you know.

have, but you can't

The Blackhawk Project was a
mistake, was an embarrassment.

1029
