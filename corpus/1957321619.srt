Hey, how could
I have known that?

- Think about it.
- I told you,

213
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,252
you have to text me five minutes
before you get home.

214

I'm not gonna text you

beautiful, blue eyes,

289

moment that I realized...

that happened and I was like,

303

- Huh.

304
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:41,418

attachments to it.

- That I don't give a shit about.
- Okay, fine.

on one of our shared items

What, why?

321
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,162

like a brother.

just come on, Peter.

323
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:30,134
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

324
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:38,208
Just in case.

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,276
Uh, thank you?

326
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:42,645
Go ahead, take one.

327
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:50,153
(blowing noisily)

328
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:53,190
So yeah, I'm really sorry, man,

329
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:54,991
but that's what we decided.

330
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,492
Wait, wait, wait, but you guys
have only been married

331
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:58,327
- for, like, two years.
- Yeah, no, right,

332
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,129
but we've actually been together
for 10, you know,

333
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,431
and it's complicated.

334
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,632
We're just different people now.

335
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah, of course
you're different people,

336
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,769
but like, I thought
opposites attract.

337
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:09,105
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,073
So, what, are you like
my ex-brother now or...

339
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,608
I mean, I guess technically,
but...

340
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,011
Whatever, whatever, I gotta go.

opposites attract?

I know, that's what I said!

351
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,265
But we love Peter.

352
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:38,134
What are we gonna do about that?

353
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,736
I don't know, man.

354
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,338
I don't know.

355
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,407
Wow.

356
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,744
- I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

357
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:52,581
Well, it's not great timing,

358
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,519
but I actually have a Tinder
date coming in a couple minutes.

359
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,720
- Oh, wow.
- But I could totally

360
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:58,422
- bail on her.
- No, no, no, it's fine,

361
00:14:58,455 --> 00:14:59,790
it's fine, just be careful,
okay?

362
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,457
Because right now
she's just a Tinder girl,

363
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,159
but next thing you know,
she's your wife,

364
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:07,329
and then right after that
she's your fucking ex-wife!

365
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,800
But yeah, no, it's fine,
it's chill, she can come over.

366
00:15:09,832 --> 00:15:11,333
You can totally crash
the date if you want.

367

368
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,770
- From where?
- Store-bought.

369
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,572
- Ugh!
- Okay, you are invited.

370
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,475
It's gonna have spicy mayo
all over it.

371
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:21,078
Ah, I'm Noah,
I'm a bougie ass bitch

372
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,511
and I don't have
a brother-in-law anymore.

373
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,512
- Too far, man.
- Yeah,

374
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:26,583
it didn't feel right saying it.

375
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:27,884
You know what,
whatever, fuck it.

376
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm fucking with you, let's go
eat some shitty Cali rolls.

to speak your truth,

And I thought, "Well, dang!

498
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:07,563
I didn't even know
she liked fishing this much.

499

they weren't even
talking about fishing.

503
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,642
They were calling you
a lesbian predator.

504
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,044
Yeah, Mary Grace,
they were fucking with me.

505

grilling me some sexy meat.

522
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:11,493
Oh, my little crudite girl.

523
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:13,462
Why are you wearing your
blue light glasses outside?

524
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:14,998
Well, there's no easy way
to say this

525
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,932
but we're living in
a simulation, babe.

526
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:20,169
Every second is screen time,
so keeping these on for good.

527
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:22,172
So what you're saying is
you got high without me.

528
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:25,574
- Exactly.
- Wow!

529
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,509
Wow.

530
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,810
Four weeks into the relationship

531
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,879
and you're already
sneaking around.

532
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,815
Hey, hey, come on.

533
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:34,017
- What?
- No, stay off the nips!

534
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,752
If you let me do it,
I will forgive you.

535
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:39,055
Okay, lightly, light... ow!

536
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,789
All right, okay, okay.

537
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:42,025
Okay, you're forgiven.

538
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:43,992
All right, thank you,
I gotta flip.

539
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:47,864
Okay, but just remember, I like
my men how I like my meats.

540
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:50,200
Rare, because you're
one of a kind,

541
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,100
and I like my meats bloody.

542
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:55,137
Oh, which reminds me,
I have a new project for us,

543
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,974
- but first, carrot?
- Sure.

544
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:00,777
- Ranch shot?
- Always, yeah.

545
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,178
(laughing)

546
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:04,913
No teeth!

547
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,949
Don't bite it, you use lips,

548
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,019
use your lips, use your lips.

549
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:12,020
God, Ranch is so sexual.

550
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,257
Should we leave these meats
and go to the bedroom?

551
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,892
No, they're almost ready.

552
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:18,228
Really, so no?

553
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,498
Okay, well that leads me
to our project.

554
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,066
I think we can both agree
that up until now,

555
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,299
the sex has been amazing.

556
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,903
- Yeah, it's been great.
- I know, it's not surprising.

557
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,770
All my boyfriends
say that about me.

558
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:29,538
You mean "said that."

559
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:30,739
They're not still saying that,

560
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:31,874
'cause you're not still
having sex with them, right?

561
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:36,745
Okay, but I think we're on
the edge of the phase

562
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:38,580
where it's like
new relationship,

563
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:40,115
the sex is always amazing,

564
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:43,118
and the phase of, "Ugh,
we never have sex anymore

565
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,787
and it's always missionary,

566
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:46,923
and even when we do have
missionary sex,

567
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:48,757
it's really dry and boring

568
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,259
and you think about CNN
the whole time."

569
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,927
But we're in the first phase,
right?

570
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:54,029
Gabriel, Gabriel,
you're missing the point.

571
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:56,566
It's scientifically proven
in the first four weeks,

572
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:59,034
we should be at a 10
on "el pasión" scale.

573
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,170
Sure, we're having sex
in restaurant bathrooms

574
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,006
and in your car
and at your mom's house.

575
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:04,606
On my mom's house.

576
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,076
I got second degree burns
on my back from the roof.

577
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:10,178
And I'm sorry for that, but if
we don't do something now,

578
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:13,081
we're gonna end up boring
and divorced and brunette,

579
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,250
and you know I don't have
the face shape

580
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:15,884
- to support brown hair.
- Okay, but...

581
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,287
Imagine this
with a brown wig on.

582
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,923

one of the Little Women.

It's good to get
the adrenaline pumping

589

before we dive into
some new areas.

590
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:40,142

was go straight to Craigslist

- Right, buddy?
- Yeah!

683
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,573
Another important practice
on reclaiming your space

684
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,540
is to stand or sit in spots

685
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:08,510
that have significant memories
of your honeybunch...

686

...of your ex, ex,

687
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:18,221
of your ex, and then you say
to yourself,

688
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:21,356
"I reclaim this space."

689
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,161
For example,
this is where we would spend

690
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:27,963
most of our evenings
watching Netflix.

691
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,199

they were funny

00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:34,103

they were cheesy,

694
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:37,973
and I was bored the whole time,
so I was like, "Whatever,"

695
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:42,612
but she would laugh at them
and her laugh was like,

you know,
low-key pretty magical,

697
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,448

00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:16,431
Ugh, life is weird!

874
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,499
Like, this is weird!

875
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:18,867
Our friend is getting a divorce.

876
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,869
- I know.
- And if somebody had asked me,

877
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:23,472
like, "Do you think Amy
and Peter will get a divorce?"

878
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:26,642
- I would've absolutely said no.
- Yes.

879
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:27,776
Okay, I just lied,

880
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:28,976
I definitely didn't think
they were gonna make it.

881
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,711
The writing was on the wall.

882
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:31,113
Remember at Amy's bachelorette?

883
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:33,015
- She was so unhappy.
- So unhappy,

884
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:34,750
and it was not because of us,
right?

885
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:36,351
- It wasn't because of us?
- No!

886
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:37,820
She was totally off
and not herself,

887
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:39,755
- and we talked to her about it.
- Yeah.

888
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:41,556
We were like, "Amy,
what's going on with you?"

889
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,791
"Why are you so unhappy?

890
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:43,759
What's up?

891
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,860
Why didn't you invite
your cousin Eva?"

892
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:47,096
- Cousin Eva is an alcoholic.
- And not in a fun way.

893
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,764
And Amy, she was like...

894
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,633
she said...

895
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,536
Okay, so Amy actually
wasn't there for that.

896
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:55,836
Of course she was there,
it was her bachelorette.

897
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:59,407
No, no, what we're remembering
is you and I talking about it,

898
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,110
talking about her.

899
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:04,979
Oh, talking about her
behind her back.

900
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:07,715
Yeah.

901
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:10,084
But we've told her in the past
that she seemed unhappy.

902
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,920
Yeah, like when she went
ring shopping alone.

903
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:13,989
Yes, we said,
"Amy, this is not something

904
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:14,922
you should be doing
by yourself."

905
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:16,891
- Yeah, we told her that!
- Yeah, and she said

906
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:19,562
she was, she was...

907
00:37:21,463 --> 00:37:23,532
She was also not there
for that part either.

908
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:25,567
That part where we told her
how we really felt?

909
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,635
Yeah, that part.

910
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:30,972
I'm hungry.

911
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:31,940
Want a little snack?

912
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:35,110
I can offer you a pouch,
some cheddar bunnies,

913
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,112
or celery sticks.

914
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:38,514
Literally just celery sticks?

915
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,648
Not even peanut butter
on the side?

916
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,182
Oh, no, peanuts are legumes

917
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:43,918
and Xander's mom tries to limit
his legumes.

918
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:46,522
- Poor Xander.
- I know.

919
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:48,890
(crunching)

920
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:53,795
Okay, were,

921
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,531
were we mean to Peter?

922
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,098
No, we were not mean to Peter.

923
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,634
Right.

924
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:03,838
Okay, so like define mean.

925
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,606
- Like were our jokes mean?
- No.

926
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,141
I mean, maybe our jokes
were mean,

927
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:08,744
but that doesn't mean
that we were mean.

928
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:10,646
Right, right, you are so right.

929
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,880
- You get it.
- And plus,

930
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,215
I don't even really think
you can be mean

931
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,016
to somebody that you don't know.

932
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,618
I never really got
to know Peter.

933
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,019
And now we never will.

934
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,989
Tell me about it.

935
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,226
- I miss Amy.
- Me too.

936
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:26,461
But her not telling us about
the divorce really hurts.

937
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,230
It does, and I mean,
I don't know about you,

938
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:30,465
but Amy and I talk all the time.

939
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:33,000
- Same, like, look at my texts.
- Same!

940
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,537
- I text her all the time.
- All the time.

941
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,508
- All the time.
- All the time...

942
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,977
- four months ago.
- Five.

943
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:48,583
Okay, should we just call her?

944
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,519
Yeah, I feel like we're overdue
for a phone call.

945
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:52,721
And you know what,
we'll lead with, "We love you."

946
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:53,822
"We heard about what happened."

947
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,990
"And we wanna let you know
that we are here for you

948
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,992
and we just wanted to say hi."

949
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,895
- I love that.
- Thanks.

950
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,931
(phone ringing)

951
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:05,900
- I'm so happy we're doing this.
- Me too.

952
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,537
Hey, it's Amy, leave a message.

953
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:15,843
- She just...
- Sent us to voicemail, yeah.

954
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,112
That's mean, right?

955
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:18,746
She's mean, she's mean!

956
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,615
She is mean.

957
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:25,219
But I guess she is dealing with

958
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,688
- a divorce.
- Divorce.

959
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:29,291
- Yeah, that's, that's not...
- Not great.

960
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:30,425
(message alert)

961
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,860
- Oh, it's my Postmates order.
- What'd they say?

962
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,829
"Where the fuck are you?"

963
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:36,597
- Rude!
- Yeah.

964
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,899
I'm like... what do they mean
where am I?

965
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,835
I'm right here,
I'm clearly busy.

966
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:40,902
- Yeah.
- Vanessa,

967
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,937
where the fuck are you?

968
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,538
Anderson,
where the fuck are you?

969
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:45,574
Next to the big green tree.

970
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:46,842
No, like where are you exactly?

971
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,043
All these trees look the same.

972
00:39:48,076 --> 00:39:49,945
By the... I don't know... elm?

973
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:51,079
Let's go with elm,
this is an elm.

974
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:53,848
Um, I don't know what in my life
has led you to believe

975
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:56,585
that I know what an elm tree
looks like,

976
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:58,219
- but I don't.
- Vanessa?

977
00:39:58,253 --> 00:39:59,922
- Anderson?
- Vanessa!

978
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:02,723
- Anderson!
- Vanessa?

979
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:04,326
Vanessa, Vanessa!

980
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,094
Follow the sound of my voice,

981
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:07,929
follow the sound of my voice.

982
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:09,798
Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa.

983
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:10,731
- Anderson!
- Vanessa!

984
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:12,268
Anderson.

985
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:16,038
You have to stop yelling
my name.

986
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,639
Gosh, you scared me there.

987
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,141
Whoa, love the Pippi
Longstocking look.

988
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,778
Oh thank you, yeah, I heard that
if you French braid your hair,

989
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:24,846
it makes you look like
you got a face lift,

990
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:27,949
and I also recently got
a facelift.

991
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,851
Thanks so much for coming
to Family Day.

992
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,820
Oh, of course, I'm happy to.

993
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:33,789
Plus, Mom offered me 50 bucks
if I came, so.

994
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:37,125
- Mm.
- What is Family Day?

995
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:41,128
Family Day is where the families
of the teens come to visit

996
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,864
and we hike out to Stinson Beach

997
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:45,032
and discuss our
substance abuse issues,

998
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:47,201
- I think.
- Okay.

999
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:49,338
Um, yeah, I really don't want
to do any of that.

1000
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:52,039
- I did just come for the 50.
- Absolutely.

1001
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,643
Quick Q, why can't you stop
freeloading off Mom

1002
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:57,244
and start freeloading off your
boyfriend like a normal person?

1003
00:40:57,277 --> 00:41:00,014
You know, it's a great Q
and I would counter with,

1004
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,149
why can't you stop
freeloading off Mom?

1005
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,985
And it's a great counter
and I would say

1006
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:05,753
because I don't have
any other option.

1007
00:41:05,786 --> 00:41:09,625
That's why I said yes to this
wilderness rehab retreat thing.

1008
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:11,626
Mom said if I don't complete
this rehab,

1009
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:15,062
that she'd kick me out
and I cannot be homeless at 24...

1010
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:16,731
27...

1011
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,666
30.

1012
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:21,168
Well, anyways,
to answer you initial Q,

1013
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,904
the reason I can't
freeload off Gabriel

1014
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,405
is because something went down

1015
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,240
and I don't really wanna
get into the details of it.

1016
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:29,010
But basically when he said no,
I heard him say no

1017
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:30,311
but I didn't hear him say no.

1018
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,512
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

1019

1047
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,469
Just go with it.

1048
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:01,902
Ow, ow!

1049
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:03,138
One just stung me in my ear.

1050
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,240
♪ Bad bees, boo bees,
whatcha gonna do ♪

1051
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:08,777
♪ Whatcha gonna do
when the bad bees come for you ♪

1052
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:10,512
- ♪ Bad bees ♪
- Bananas, bananas!

1053
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,114
What? The safe word already?

1054
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,347
We just got started!

1055
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,182
I'm down for some freaky shit,

1056
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,184
but this doesn't even
feel sexual.

1057
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:19,353
It just feels... ah!

1058
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,922
- Dangerous.
- What's your point?

1059
00:43:20,954 --> 00:43:22,891
Look, maybe we should
try something

1060
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:24,326
with a little more sex

1061
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,261
and a little less honey
in all my crevices.

1062
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:28,896
Okay. Just a little more honey?

1063
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,098
No. No! Vanessa!

1064
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:32,300
Okay, let's compromise.

1065
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,902
So did you start
taking a lot of baths?

1066
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:36,203
I did. I was taking
two or three a day.

1067
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:37,838
And then my youngest
wanted to get in with me,

1068
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:38,906
and after that, I had to quit.

1069
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,443
And I've just...
I've been in a tizzy ever since!

1070
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:43,278
Well, Mary Grace,
we've gotta get you fixed up!

1071
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:44,813
Can't live life
in a tizzy like that.

1072
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:47,114
- Amen!
- So, okay, so how often

1073
00:43:47,148 --> 00:43:49,217
are you and Bill,
you know, boning?

1074
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,152
Not often enough.

1075
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:52,821
And I wouldn't call it boning,
to be honest,

1076
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:54,822
it's more like
laying down together

1077
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,258
and moving for a little bit.

1078
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,526
It's just... it's just,

1079
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:00,327
you know, Bill likes things
a certain way.

1080
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,197
So we schedule it,
every other Monday.

1081
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,566
Missionary Monday is
what we call it,

1082
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:05,700
so we put it in the calendar.

1083
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:06,835
It's like a little code
and that way people see it

1084
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,969
and they think, "Oh,
they're doing mission work,"

1085
00:44:09,003 --> 00:44:10,071
but it's really just sex

1086
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:13,974
every other Monday at 8:15
after the kids go down.

1087
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:16,277
The same sex, missionary sex.

1088
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:17,445
It's not even the good kind.

1089
00:44:17,478 --> 00:44:18,479
Is there a good kind?

1090
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:20,981
Lauren, I just... I can't
continue to be grateful!

1091
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:22,884
It's a sin, it's a lie!

1092
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,853
Okay, I mean,
does he at least go down on you?

1093
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:27,822
(laughing)

1094
00:44:27,856 --> 00:44:28,924
Lauren!

1095
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:30,257
Honey, you got me rollin'!

1096
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,359
No!

1097
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:33,427
Not since 2001.

1098
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,296
Listen, when I had
my first child,

1099
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:36,331
he looked me dead in the eye,

1100
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:37,265
and he said, "Listen,
I can't go down there

1101
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:39,400
after I saw my daughter
come out of there."

1102
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:42,037
You know, she was
an 11-pound baby, but still.

1103
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,238
Okay, you know what, Mary Grace?

1104
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:44,172
No, fuck this guy.

1105
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,942
He needs to get down there
and get busy!

1106
00:44:46,974 --> 00:44:49,243
You know what, I agree!

1107
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:52,146
I've been doing my exercises
for years now!

1108
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:55,884
Lord, on the wings of Jesus,
I'm sharing my story!

1109
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,219
Okay, wow, okay!

1110
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:59,153
Yes, cheers to that, Mary Grace!

1111
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:02,489
Cheers to that.

1112
00:45:02,523 --> 00:45:04,125
Hold on, I'ma be right back.

1113
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:05,559
Woo! I feel alive today!

1114
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:06,627
Jesus is real!

1115
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,864
What the fuck?

1116
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:13,101
Okay, so...

1117
00:45:13,134 --> 00:45:14,603
I went to the paint and sip,
all right,

1118
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:16,103
and I didn't want
to paint the hydrangeas

1119
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:17,038
that were in
the sample painting,

1120
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:17,939
'cause I've already
done that, okay?

1121
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:19,608
I've got two bushes
in my backyard.

1122
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:21,276
So the instructor said to me,
she goes,

1123
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,112
"Just paint what calls to you."

1124
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:27,114
So I painted something,
it's a little wild,

1125
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:30,117
and I just... I've been
too afraid to show Bill,

1126
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,353
I've been hiding it
under my bed,

1127
00:45:31,385 --> 00:45:33,021
but I wanna show you.

1128
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:34,456
Okay, now keep in mind,

1129
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:36,057
I had spent some time
in the jacuzzi tub

1130
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,927
before I went.

1131
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,095
Here it is.

1132
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,963
It's a self-portrait.

1133
00:45:41,996 --> 00:45:44,266
Oh, my God, wow!

1134
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:46,668
I mean, the writing
was on the wall.

1135
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:48,469
He's not a rich man,
and she's...

1136
00:45:48,503 --> 00:45:50,171
I don't know, pretty-ish.

1137
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:52,173
So, really, all they had
keeping their marriage together

1138
00:45:52,206 --> 00:45:53,909
was love?

1139
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,309
(laughing)

1140
00:45:55,342 --> 00:45:57,111
And I know you know this
better than anyone, babe,

1141
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:58,179
'cause we're so good together,

1142
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,048
that a healthy relationship
is a tête-à-tête

1143
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:03,417
of wit
and emotional communication.

1144
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:06,688
Without it, you have nothing.

1145
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,523
Unless, of course, obviously,
one of you has stock

1146
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:10,692
or Bitcoin
or a beachside property.

1147
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,493
But even then, you know,
it's a give and a take.

1148
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:14,295
- Don't you agree?
- Do you wanna stretch me or...

1149
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:17,465
Equity and communication.

1150
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:20,001
It's a give and a take.

1151
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:21,469
Oh, give me that.

1152
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,202
You know what I mean?

1153
00:46:22,235 --> 00:46:24,138
It's like a back and a forth.

1154
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,673
Here's the thing
about Amy and Peter,

1155
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:27,275
they were never equal.

1156
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:29,543
She always wore the pants
in the relationship.

1157
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:31,046
Do you remember last summer
when they were in town

1158
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:31,947
and we went to Jones?

1159
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,347
And the waitress
dropped the check off

1160
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,983
in front of Amy.

1161
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:38,118
Amy, not Peter.

1162
00:46:38,152 --> 00:46:39,721
I mean, how humiliating,

1163
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:41,722
and not just for her, for him.

1164
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:43,524
So emasculating.

1165
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,393
Oh, my God, honey, no.

1166
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,461
Somebody's gonna see you,
you look like a wimp.

1167
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:49,130
Your arms are like
tiny SpongeBob arms

1168
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:51,465
and you have the body
of Kermit the Frog.

1169
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:54,601
You should really call
my trainer!

1170
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:56,071
Crunches.

1171
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:57,638
Now, gentlemen,

1172
00:46:57,672 --> 00:47:00,108
I understand that sometimes

1173
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:02,309
some of these porcupine memories

1174
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:03,711
are hard to get rid of,

1175
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:07,248
and simply yelling them away
is not enough.

1176
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,219
That's why the last thing
we're gonna learn today

1177
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:14,621
will require
a more aggressive approach.

1178
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:17,525
Bam! Fireworks!

1179
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:20,195
This here is the cobra box.

1180
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:23,398
The cobra can hypnotize
its prey

1181
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:26,266
before launching for the kill.

1182
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,638
So, inside this box
is a bunch of crap

1183
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:34,174
that my ex used to own
and that hypnotizes me

1184
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:37,479
into doing stuff
I really don't want to do

1185
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:41,048
like text her or call her
or drive up to her place

1186
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:44,485
and see her go in
and out of her apartment

1187
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:48,489
with a random guy that may
or may not be her new boyfriend.

1188
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:49,490
We don't know.

1189
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:52,059
What we do know is
that he owns a new Tesla.

1190
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:54,261
I know it's new,
because it's the new model.

1191
00:47:56,264 --> 00:48:00,068
And we can't keep doing that
to ourselves.

1192
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:04,204
Time to destroy the cobra box,
trademark... not granted,

1193
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:06,507
because I guess there's
a company in Australia

1194
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,676
that sells cobras in a box.

1195
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:12,480
All right, let's get to it.

1196
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:15,382
Time to reclaim
the space in our hearts.

1197
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:25,360
♪ ♪

1198
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,202
Well, that was disappointing.

1199
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:35,637
♪ ♪

1200
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,605
Oh, my gosh.

1201
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:40,107
Oh, my gosh, what am I doing?

1202
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,077
What is the matter with me?

1203
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,345
It's like I turned 38
and I went crazy!

1204
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,547
I'm like a horndog!

1205
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:47,114
I just... I gotta burn this.

1206
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:49,084
No, no, no. Mary Grace, no.

1207
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:50,518
You listen to me, okay?

1208
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,154
We were not raised
to talk about sex or want it,

1209
00:48:54,188 --> 00:48:56,257
but we do,
and that is great, okay?

1210
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:57,659
So you just need
to get out there,

1211
00:48:57,692 --> 00:48:59,527
and you need to tell Bill
what you want.

1212
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:01,563
Well, I mean, do you tell men
what you want?

1213
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:02,797
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah, I do!

1214
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:04,465
There's a fucking
orgasm epidemic

1215
00:49:04,498 --> 00:49:05,532
in this country, okay?

1216
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:08,135
And we must demand action.

1217
00:49:08,168 --> 00:49:09,237
- Heck, yeah.

Okay, kiss kiss!

Stay calm, stay calm!

1400
00:56:57,271 --> 00:56:59,807
Think peaceful thoughts,
think Elle Fanning.

1401
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,076
What? Why would you make me
think of Elle Fanning?

1402
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,610
That only makes me think
of Dakota Fanning

1403
00:57:03,643 --> 00:57:05,211
who used to be more famous
than her sister,

1404
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:07,114
- and now she's not!
- Okay, okay.

1405

- We need to take shelter!

1409

Quick, give me a boost!

1410
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:20,227
Oh, so you can leave me
down here

1411
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,996

- What?

- I am starving to death!

1425

I can literally feel my body
eating itself alive.

01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,811
Ray, I have a fiancée.

1572
01:04:50,844 --> 01:04:52,679
Yeah, you said that already.

1573
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:56,182
Yeah. I did.

1574
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:58,719
Yeah, by the sound of it,
you still do.

1575
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:00,420
Take it from me, kid.

1576
01:05:00,454 --> 01:05:02,423
You get the beginning,
you get the end,

1577
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:05,224
and usually, the only thing
separating the two

1578
01:05:05,257 --> 01:05:06,359
is a lot of wasted time.

1579
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:08,561
Hey, Ray?

1580
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,829
Are you good with this stuff?

1581
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:12,432
- Women?
- No, lumber.

1582
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:13,733
I know a thing or two.

1583
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:17,304
- Can you teach me?
- Oh, sure!

1584
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:19,273
You just hit the nail
on the head.

1585
01:05:19,306 --> 01:05:20,574
No.

1586
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:25,545
I mean, would you come over here
and help me build it?

1587
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:27,581
Ah!

1588
01:05:27,614 --> 01:05:29,416
No.

1589
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,751
- No?
- No, don't got the time.

1590
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:34,353
- Tomorrow then!
- Nope, can't!

1591
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:38,158
- Why?
- Well, you're an asshole

1592
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,093
to my dog.

1593
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:44,697
Well, why didn't you
say anything then?

1594
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:48,569
Son, I was in the war.

1595
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:51,338
Oh.

1596
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:55,342

I don't know what it is

I mean, it just... the food
just tastes better.

1606

- So true.

- No, that's okay!

No, I have a whole bag,
and they're really old,

1609

and if we don't use them,
they're gonna go bad.

1610

- I can get them.
- No, I'll be right back.

- Kai is fragile, okay?

And if you're not in it
for the long haul,

1614
01:06:56,835 --> 01:06:59,639
I'm talking holding hands
and dying in bed together...

1615
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:01,207
- Like The Notebook?
- Please do not

1616
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,442
bring that film up right now.

1617
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:03,643
I cannot handle that, okay?

1618
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:06,846
Anyways, if you're here
to just have fun or something,

1619
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,182
then you might as well leave now

1620
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:09,350
and spare us
all the heartbreak, okay?

1621
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:12,785
- Dude, what is your deal?
- Are you seeing other guys?

1622

- Are you clean?
- Excuse me?

1623

- Sexually.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

1624

When's the last time
you had unprotected sex?

1625

- Hey, bad news.

1626
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,194
Motherfucking knew it,
limes are old.

1627
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:22,729
Good news, neighbor said
we could borrow some of theirs.

1628
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:23,897
- I'll be right back.
- Please don't go!

1629
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:24,797
- Be right back!
- I just don't think

1630
01:07:24,831 --> 01:07:26,466
- you're right for each other.
- Dude!

1631
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:27,567
I mean, do you even want kids?

1632
01:07:27,601 --> 01:07:28,869
I don't know, maybe one day!

- when she was 23.
- Well, times have changed!

1636
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:38,612
Times have changed, because now
commitment doesn't matter!

1637
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:39,813
Marriage doesn't mean anything!

1638
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:41,481
This is all just
a bunch of bullshit!

1639
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:42,782
And whatever you're here to do,

1640
01:07:42,815 --> 01:07:43,916
okay, it's just
not gonna work out,

1641
01:07:43,951 --> 01:07:45,818
so you might as well leave
before somebody gets hurt!

1642
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:49,489
Fine!

1645
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:54,927
but this conversation
is fucked up.

1646
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,262
You guys can have each other.

1647
01:07:56,295 --> 01:07:58,898
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I can't handle your roommate!

is getting a divorce.

1652
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:10,943
I'm sorry.

1653
01:08:10,976 --> 01:08:12,245
No, I'm sorry.

It's just this whole thing
is fucking with me, you know?

1656

Like I always thought
that love was real.

01:08:19,452 --> 01:08:20,686
Love is real.

1658
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,724
I mean, sometimes it's scary
and it doesn't work out,

1659
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:26,893
but it's definitely real.

1660
01:08:26,926 --> 01:08:29,730
Yeah, man, just hang in there.

1661
01:08:29,762 --> 01:08:31,899
Things will sort themselves out.

A ton. He loves it.

He's even got a name
for my front tushy.

1669

Calls it the "open road."

I am sending you

No, no, no, no, don't do that,

- Okay, I gotta go.

1695
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,343
I'ma show Bill
how to use the jacuzzi jets.

1696
01:09:49,376 --> 01:09:51,478
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
did you say "32 dicks"?

1697
01:09:51,511 --> 01:09:52,979
- Mary Grace?
- Bye, Lauren.

What does she know?

1701
01:09:58,885 --> 01:10:01,988
Jaime, come on, man.

1702
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,690
You're better than this.

1703
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:06,593
No, I'm not.

Hey.

1707
01:10:38,557 --> 01:10:39,926
I miss you.

1708
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:42,762
Well, it's a little
too late for that.

1709
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:44,865
I made a huge mistake.

1710
01:10:44,898 --> 01:10:47,400
I should have given you
a second chance.

1711
01:10:47,434 --> 01:10:50,103
Well, too bad,
because I've moved on, okay?

1712
01:10:50,136 --> 01:10:52,672
No, you haven't.

1713
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:55,475
You still listen to Adele
and Sam Smith every night

1714
01:10:55,507 --> 01:10:57,778
until your eyes burn
with salty tears.

1715
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,011
Shut up, that's not true.

1716
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:02,115
See? You are always pretending
to be someone you're not,

1717
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:03,617
because you are still afraid

1718
01:11:03,649 --> 01:11:05,050
that I wouldn't love
the real you.

1719
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:06,752
Oh, please.

1720
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:08,020
You kept getting distant

1721
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:09,789

recognize you anymore.

01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,057
Well, surprise, surprise!

1723
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:14,461

Oh, wait, you're not on campus

1728
01:11:23,136 --> 01:11:25,605
because you didn't go
back to school!

1729
01:11:25,637 --> 01:11:26,773
You know what, that's it.

1730
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:28,140
I'm so done.

1731
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:30,411
So done.

1732
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:34,948
I am so done with you.

1733
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,015
So...

1734
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:42,588
Wait, let's be friends!

1735
01:11:42,622 --> 01:11:43,923
With benefits!

1736
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:46,092
And then we'll fall in love
slowly again!

1737
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,228
Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

1738
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:51,064
I can't let you go!

1739
01:11:51,096 --> 01:11:53,000
I still love you.

1740
01:11:55,134 --> 01:11:55,801

1741
01:11:55,835 --> 01:11:57,837
Bill, we've got 30 minutes

1742
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:59,573
before the kids get home,
all right?

1743
01:11:59,605 --> 01:12:03,042
So let's pave this open road
with jacuzzi's finest.

1744
01:12:03,076 --> 01:12:05,145
- Woo!
- Fuck.

1745
01:12:05,177 --> 01:12:07,747
Fuck!

1746
01:12:07,779 --> 01:12:09,815
(explosion)

1747
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:11,918
What the fuck?

1748
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:13,953
(coughing)

1749
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:16,088
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

1750
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:17,891
Oh, hey, neighbor.

1751
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:19,592
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1752
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:20,827
I was just, um...

1753
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,161
Reclaiming your space?

1754
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:24,764
- Can you...
- Hear all the inspirational shit

1755
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:25,698
that you're shouting all day?

1756
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:26,699
I can, yeah.

1757
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:28,068
You know, thin walls,
but don't worry, though.

1758
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,668
I'm sure you hear
all kinds of crazy shit

1759
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:30,637
from my place, too.

1760
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:33,172
No. No, not at all.

1761
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:38,110
I mean, except that you've had
32 dicks in your body.

1762
01:12:38,144 --> 01:12:39,913
- That was the TV.
- Oh.

1763
01:12:39,945 --> 01:12:42,849
Yeah. Okay, well,
I was just making sure

1764
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,083
that no one was dead out here,

1765
01:12:44,117 --> 01:12:46,753
like exploded into pieces,
so check.

1766
01:12:46,786 --> 01:12:48,922
I'm gonna go back inside.

1767
01:12:48,954 --> 01:12:50,724
Wait.

1768
01:12:50,756 --> 01:12:54,293
Um, if you're not
doing anything,

1769
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:58,632
do you wanna come over
and have a drink?

1770
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:02,068
Oh. Oh, uh...

1771
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,304
Yeah, I think probably not,
but thank you.

1772
01:13:04,337 --> 01:13:06,172
And, you know, don't sweat it,

1773
01:13:06,204 --> 01:13:08,841
'cause I know that
you're going through a lot,

1774
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:12,612
but sooner or later,
you'll hook up with someone hot!

1775
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:14,748
Trademark.

1776
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:18,018
- That was the TV.
- Right.

1777
01:13:18,051 --> 01:13:20,620
You know what?
Ah, fuck it, let's do it.

1778
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:22,789
- Really?
- Yeah, just...

1779
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:24,324
just know that
if this ends up in your vlog,

1780
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:25,725
I will key your car.

1781
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:28,561
- That's fair.
- All right, come on.

1782
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:31,331
- Lucky number 33!
- Oh, fuck off!

1783
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:33,165
Hey, um, sorry
I got you in trouble

1784
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:36,168
- with that ginger.
- It's okay, he's whatever.

1785
01:13:36,202 --> 01:13:38,070
It's kinda nice
having someone care enough

1786
01:13:38,104 --> 01:13:40,039
to recognize a bad influence,
you know what I mean?

1787
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:42,042
Totally.

1788
01:13:42,074 --> 01:13:44,243
So, are you gonna stick
with this whole sober thing?

1789
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:46,078
I think I am.

1790
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:47,614
After hearing
about Amy and Peter,

1791
01:13:47,646 --> 01:13:48,948
it's made me think,

1792
01:13:48,981 --> 01:13:50,216
if I don't quit
on this rehab thing,

1793
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:52,786
I might have a chance
to restart, you know?

1794
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,988
Yeah, I do know.

1795
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,057
It's made me realize
that I can't quit on Gabriel.

1796
01:13:58,091 --> 01:13:59,226
You know?

1797
01:13:59,259 --> 01:14:02,162
I have to go back and try
to fuck my boyfriend in the ass.

1798
01:14:02,194 --> 01:14:04,363
Oh, so that's something
I think you should quit on.

1799
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:05,798
Okay.

1800
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,934
Just relax, you know?

1801
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:10,903
Let all your bee stings soak.

1802
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:14,106
Man, you got stung
so many times.

1803
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,775
No one could've
seen that coming.

1804
01:14:15,807 --> 01:14:17,109
I saw it coming,
until they started

1805
01:14:17,143 --> 01:14:18,912
- going after my eyes.
- Sh-sh-sh.

1806
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:20,346
No, no, no.

1807
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,984
But how do you feel?

1808
01:14:24,016 --> 01:14:25,751
This is actually really nice.

1809
01:14:25,784 --> 01:14:27,252
I know.

1810
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:29,088
It's a little bit tight,

1811
01:14:29,122 --> 01:14:32,392
so I'm just gonna
slip into here,

1812
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:34,961
and you're gonna dip
and give me your bottom.

1813
01:14:34,993 --> 01:14:35,996
Okay.

1814
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:37,664
Oh, this is good.

1815
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:39,798
I feel really vulnerable
in this position.

1816
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:42,102
I feel great,
I feel very powerful.

1817
01:14:42,135 --> 01:14:44,304
I feel like I could do
anything to you,

1818
01:14:44,337 --> 01:14:46,139
and I wouldn't get in trouble,

1819
01:14:46,171 --> 01:14:48,173
because I would have
better lawyers than you

1820
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:50,110
and it would be
my word against yours.

1821
01:14:50,143 --> 01:14:52,378
That's a very specific fantasy.

1822
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:54,079
Deep breath.

1823
01:14:54,113 --> 01:14:56,883
Now I'm going to insert
my little finger

1824
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:58,318
into your little butthole.

1825
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:59,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1826
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:01,054
What's happening here?

1827
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:03,089
This is going
from like zero to 60.

1828
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:04,791
I thought you just wanted me
to tie you up

1829
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:06,960
- or lightly choke you.
- What is this?

1830
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:08,094
Amateur Night at the Apollo?

1831
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:11,430
Why are you so paranoid
about us losing the passion?

1832
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,333
We have great sex, we're going
to keep having great sex,

1833
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:18,738
because I love you, okay?

1834
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:20,907
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

1835
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:22,741
I know it's really soon
for me to say that,

1836
01:15:22,774 --> 01:15:26,745
but I do.

1837
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:30,450
I do, too.

1838
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:33,720
I guess... I guess I was trying

1839
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:35,087
to make you do
all that crazy stuff

1840
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:37,724
because, you know,
my friends Amy and Peter

1841
01:15:37,756 --> 01:15:40,159
are getting divorced
and they're our age,

1842
01:15:40,193 --> 01:15:42,762
and I just feel like
if the passion can die for them,

1843
01:15:42,795 --> 01:15:44,698
then it can die for us.

1844
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:47,701
I won't let that happen.

1845
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:49,436
Pinky swear?

1846
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:52,872
Not that.

1847
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:54,306
Okay, just this once.

1848
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,009
Right, just this once.

1849
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,243
Because next time,
it will be this.

1850
01:15:57,275 --> 01:15:59,045
- Vanessa, no.
- Yes.

1851
01:15:59,078 --> 01:15:59,979
No, Vanessa, drop it.

1852
01:16:00,012 --> 01:16:02,181
- I'm...
- It's a deal breaker for me.

1853
01:16:02,215 --> 01:16:03,483
- Drop it.
- It's a deal breaker!

1854
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:04,983
Just the pinky.

1855
01:16:05,016 --> 01:16:07,854
Put it to the side,
just the pinky.

1856
01:16:07,886 --> 01:16:09,021
Okay.

1857
01:16:16,362 --> 01:16:19,265
Your grandparents really knew
how to keep the love alive.

1858
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:20,434
Yeah.

1859
01:16:22,769 --> 01:16:24,971
How long were they married for?

1860
01:16:25,003 --> 01:16:27,273
About 63 years.

1861
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:29,742
- That was before my grandma...
- Died?

1862
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:32,144
Right.

1863
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:36,115
So can I have this?

1864
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:37,751
You want a photo
of my dead grandparents?

1865
01:16:37,783 --> 01:16:38,751
Yeah!

1866
01:16:38,784 --> 01:16:42,322
I mean, they're dead,
and she always loved us.

1867
01:16:42,354 --> 01:16:47,526
So can I have this
or are you just... what?

1868
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,463
Why don't we come back
to the photo?

1869
01:16:50,496 --> 01:16:51,463
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1870
01:16:51,497 --> 01:16:53,033
- Okay.
- Great.

1871
01:16:59,337 --> 01:17:00,840
What about Bubbles?

1872
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:01,940
You want Bubbles?

1873
01:17:01,974 --> 01:17:02,976
You always hated my fish!

1874
01:17:03,009 --> 01:17:04,877
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1875
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,546
Well, then what are you saying?

1876
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:10,549
I think we should
split her 50/50.

1877
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:11,617
How the fuck
do you split a fish?

1878
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,353
You get half, I get half,
it's the only way.

1879
01:17:13,386 --> 01:17:14,354
All right, I'm confused,

1880
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:16,322
are you saying
that you want to kill my fish?

1881
01:17:16,354 --> 01:17:19,024
You said you wanted to be fair,
and this is fair!

1882
01:17:19,057 --> 01:17:22,528
So we've just gotta burn her up
and split the bitch's ashes.

1883
01:17:22,561 --> 01:17:23,896
What is wrong with you?

1884
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,131
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1885
01:17:25,163 --> 01:17:29,168
You... you care more
about a fish dying

1886
01:17:29,202 --> 01:17:32,405
than our death,
our proverbial death.

1887
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:34,173
- You should be sad.
- I am sad!

1888
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:35,975
Oh, yeah, you have
a funny way of showing it.

1889
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:38,978
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1890
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:45,585
Amy.

1891
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:46,386
What if I lit this book on fire,

1892
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:48,220
- would that make you sad?
- Amy.

1893
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:50,923
Would that make you
feel sad, Peter?

1894
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,992
Amy, no.

1895
01:17:53,024 --> 01:17:54,560
No, you... you wouldn't do that.

1896
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:55,994
You know how much
Michelle means to me.

1897
01:17:56,028 --> 01:17:57,163
You gonna cry, Peter?

1898
01:17:57,195 --> 01:17:58,864
You're looking
a little teary-eyed.

1899
01:17:58,898 --> 01:18:00,867
You are acting insane right now.

1900
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:03,001
- I just want you to care.
- I do care!

1901
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:03,970
Oh, yeah?

1902
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:06,371
But clearly I can't
convince you of it,

1903
01:18:06,404 --> 01:18:08,207
so if you're gonna
burn that book,

1904
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,309
burn the fucking book.

1905
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:10,242
We're getting off track.

1906
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:14,279
The point is
a 10-year relationship is ending

1907
01:18:14,313 --> 01:18:16,315
and you haven't shed
a single fucking tear.

1908
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:17,550
Oh, so just because
you've cried,

1909
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:18,416
you're better than me.

1910
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:20,019
Yes, that is exactly
what that means.

1911
01:18:20,051 --> 01:18:22,020
I cry, okay? I can cry.

1912
01:18:22,054 --> 01:18:23,056
- Oh, yeah?

- Come on,

I need like a...
like a physical push.

1927
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,161
I'm clearly not getting there
emotionally.

1928
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:03,196
You know, just like a...

1929
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:04,597
- and then I'm there!
- No!

1930
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,498
What if I, like,
hit an artery or something?

1931
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:07,667
What the fuck do you know
about arteries?

1932
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:10,168
Nothing, and I don't want
to fuck around with them!

01:19:10,202 --> 01:19:11,971
Okay, fine.

1934

1940
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:25,652
Good point, so, um...

1941
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:27,153
- Punch me in the stomach.
- Okay!

1942
01:19:27,185 --> 01:19:28,688
- Perfect.
- Okay, yeah, I can do that!

1943
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,289
It won't be too bad,
but it'll be enough.

1944

has really affected me,

down a real spiral

2005

that ended with her
setting up a call

2006

with my former youth pastor

2007

- And where are Amy and Peter?

2013

It's like one depressing
group call was bad enough,

2014

a second one

2015

looking forward to seeing Peter.

happened to be in the room...
