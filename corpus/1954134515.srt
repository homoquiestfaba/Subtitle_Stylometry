1
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,146
You and your whore mother.

2
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,851
Might be a bit more appreciative.

3
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,454
Without me you'd both
be out in the streets.

4
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,969
Now be a good girl and make nice.

5
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,573
Come on.

6
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,544
Now you're gonna get it.

7
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,150
What are you doing?

8
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,751
Hey take it easy buddy.

9
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,127
Your full name?

10
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,462
A-N-N-A.

11
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,997
Spell your last name?

12
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,532
N-I-X.

13
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,536
He came into my room and
he started touching me.

14
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,539
He never touched her
inappropriately

15
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,041
I swear.

16
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,876
I didn't mean to kill him.

17
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,747
I was an accident. I didn't mean to kill
him. I just tried to push him off me.

18
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:42,087
The defendant, Anna Nix is here

Line up! Heals on the curb.

26
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,926
Last 3.

27
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,930
Ok open your mouth.

28
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,432
Ah.

29
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,466
Ah.

30
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,768
Ah.

31
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,104

00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,414
Cough.

35
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:16,948
Cough.

36
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,018
Alright.

37
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,920
We're good!

38
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,123
Here it comes!

39
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,527
Alright that's it.

40
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,563
Alright ladies!

41
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,732
Take a towel.
Take your orange.

42
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,544
Side by side!

43
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,280
Hurry it up! Move it Move it!

44
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,831
Welcome to your new home.

45
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,300
My name is Frank.

46
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,535
I'm the warden.

47
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,873
You do exactly what I say! Or you
do exactly what my staff say!

48
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,509
How are we doing everybody?
Are we doing good?

49
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,311
Have a good day.

50
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,279
Let's go! Move out!

51
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,614
Face to the left!

52
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,649
Let's move out!

53
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,641
This is you.

54
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,086
What's your name?

55
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,422
Genie.

56
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,600
You don't talk much.
Do you Genie?

57
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,873
How long you been in here?

58
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,776
5 years 7 months 22 days.

59
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,748
Fuck.

60
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,451
OK LIGHTS OUT!

61
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:33,952
Let's go!

62
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,856
Lights out!

63
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,561
Bedtime sweetie. Come on.
Let's go. Move your ass.

64
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,343
Lock it up.

65
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,416
Hey.

66
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,654
Hey.

67
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,026
Don't mind them.

68
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,528
They're just curious.

69
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,564
I'm Kody.
What's your name?

70
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,299
Anna.

71
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,467
Where you from?

72
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,702
Rancho.

73
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,004
I thought I smelled smoked ham.

74
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,539
You got an edge.

75
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,673
It's on the inside.

76
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,876
Didn't see one single tear yet.

77
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,379
Most first cry day one.

78
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,715
I don't want any trouble.

79
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,451
No cuts. No marks.

80
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,454
Who the hell you fall from?

81
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,856
Oh you're one of those?

82
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,891
You must have fucked up big time.

83
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,996
Just trying to be your friend.

84
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,632
I know you think there's juts a
bunch of little girls in here.

85
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,201
But some of these
bitches are monsters.

86
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,869
You're real cute.

87
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,372
Cute don't last long around here.

88
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,941
Frank. Brown.

89
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,943
Can get real nasty.
You know what I mean?

90
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,379
Gotta pick a side.

91
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,114
You know what I mean?

92
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,121
In here, things are different.

93
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,923
Get the fuck outta here.

94
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,792
Nice to meet you Anna.

95
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,240
Hello again.

96
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,811
Sit down. I'm not playing.

97
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,114
That's better.

98
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,418
What I'm offering you is,

99
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,756
Friendship and Protection. Trust me,
you need us more then we need you.

100
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,492
You see that girl over there?

101
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,358
In case you haven't noticed, a lot
of people have been looking at you.

102
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,103
Ok, I appreciate what you're doing
but I just wanna be left alone.

103
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,476
Before you walk away
and disrespect me,..

104
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,713
know that there is a consequence
for everything around here.

105
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,884
Hey!

106
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,953
She fell. She's clumsy.

107
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,489
Learn how to walk.

108
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,363
Bitch!

109
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,943
This is called a blind spot.
Means you can't see anything.

110
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,248
Body shots.
Means no visible marks.

111
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,151
Never ever disrespect me in
front of my people again.

112
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,753
Ya dig?

113
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,961
One last thing, you say
anything you're dead.

114
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,529
Think about it.

115
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,685
You mean to tell me
you saw nothing.

116
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,487
It was dark.

117
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,689
You sure?

118
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,957
Yes.

119
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,095
Lift up please.

120
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,940
Good news is nothing is broken.

121
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,376
Bad news is that you have
one hell of a bone bruise.

122
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,411
It's gonna hurt for a while.

123
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,947
You new here?

124
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,349
You do drugs?

125
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,317
No.

126
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,853
You a trouble maker?

127
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,057
Just asking to see how
you're gonna fair here.

128
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,028
You have an attitude you're gonna get
into trouble, that much I know for sure.

129
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,263
You don't know me.

130
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,999
No but I know what
it's like in here.

131
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,437
They maybe you can tell me how to
get everyone to leave me alone.

132
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,840
I wish I could.

133
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,044
It's a nasty place.
The people are cruel.

134
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,780
It's prison sweetie.

135
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,485
If you get into real trouble again,
you can always talk to Frank.

136
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,558
20 minutes on and
20 minutes off, OK?

137
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,330
Thank you.

138
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,898
You're welcome.

139
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,900
She's all yours.

140
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,517
Hi.

141
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,686
What are you doing in here?

142
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,588
I'd like to talk to
you for a minute.

143
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,557
Have a seat.

144
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,829
What can I do for you?

145
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,631
I'd like to be on my own.

146
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,268
I heard about that incident.
That was-that was horrible.

147
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,038
I really wish you would've gotten
a good look at those assailants.

148
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,706
It was dark.

149
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,142
Anna, right? Anna Nix?

150
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:15,380
Solitary is a room about
maybe, 1/4th this size.

151
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,416
And you're in there 23 hours a day.

152
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,852
You get 2 showers a week.

153
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,021
Believe me, you don't want lock up.

154
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,256
Let me get your file
really quick, hold on.

155
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,893
Anna I'm gonna say something.

156
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,462
We do the very best that we can...

157
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,865
To protect you.

158
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:40,338
But we've got 214 of the nastiest meanest
girls in the whole state of California.

159
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,607
This becomes very very difficult.

160
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:48,212
I did look at your file. You, this
is so interesting about you...

161
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,217
You are pretty much a model student. I mean
you made straight A's and B's in school.

162
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,453
You play Cello.

163
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,624
I gotta tell you something.
Every year we have a talent show here.

164
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,927
Alright, so you're not interested
in that. I can see that.

165
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,930
Ok I'm gonna tell you something.

166
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,766
If you help me Anna, I'll help you.

167
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,103
I'll tell you the way this works.

168
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,640
Doesn't mean much about
the girls out there.

169
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,475
They're so mean.

170
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,844
But I have the power
to protect you.

171
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,913
And I'll do that for you.

172
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,348
How?

173
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,118
It just sort of like, you know...

174
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,619
Just take care of me.

175
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,257
Ok.

176
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,330
That's all. We're done.

177
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,966
You can go now.

178
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,840
Good luck out there.

179
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,613
Did he come on to you?

180
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,984
I saw you go into his office.

181
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,820
Everyone here is perverted.

182
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,222
Fuck you.

183
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,958
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,494
Is that Kody got to you?

185
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,796
Been here since I was 12.

186
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,464
Use to run with her.

187
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,335
What happened?

188
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,703
You'll see.

189
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,140
She doesn't mess with you anymore?

190
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,474
She did.

191
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,677
I served 5 years in this place.

192
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,347
One more year and I'm getting out.

193
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,681
Time.

194
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,319
Time's passing as we speak.

195
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,894
All the girls in here are so ugly.

196
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,997
You...

197
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,771
Stop it.

198
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,042
What's the matter?

199
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,546
I think you're pretty.

200
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,179
Ok a noun. A noun is a
person, place or thing.

201
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:46,083
A good way to remember is "A noun
is a clown, he made me frown".

202
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,320
I've been expecting you.
Grab a seat.

203
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,158
Can you read?

204
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,126
Yes.

205
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:55,927
Good.

206
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,529
Follow along on page 24.

207
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,598
Alright, where was I?

208
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,368
Oh yeah, who can tell me
what an adjective does?

209
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,517
What good bitch?

210
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,053
I said what's really good?

211
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,055
What's your problem?

212
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,557
I don't fucking like you.
That's the problem.

213
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,894
I'ma cut you. I'ma cut
you up so fucking good.

214
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,463
Walk off.

215
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,765
What the fuck off.

216
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,938
Whack ass bitch.

217
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,077
You ok?

218
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,745
This shit's gotta stop.

219
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,117
I have no choice.

220
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,755
What are you doing?

221
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,830
You got something to say chica?

222
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,665
I want to speak to Kody.

223
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,066
She don't want to talk to you.

224
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,935
I said I want to talk to Kody.

225
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,805
This isn't fall back bitch before
I smack the shit out of you.

226
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,873
Get her Jo!

227
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,631
Shut you face!
Stop!

228
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,033
Play nice.

229
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,001
You doing what I
think you're doing?

230
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,202
Yeah.

231
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,837
So you realize you can't
make it on your own?

232
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,406
Don't trust that bitch.

233
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,240
It's cool.

234
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,474
You sure about that?

235
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,976
Pretty sure.

236
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,546
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,881
Don't apologize.

238
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,351
If you didn't do what you did,
I wouldn't respect you.

239
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,520
Let's take a walk.

240
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,756
Anna Lynn Nix.

241
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,092
Involuntary manslaughter.

242
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,895
You shoved you stepfather
out of a window.

243
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,730
I have my sources.

244
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:18,102
I didn't shove him. I pushed him.
He was on top of me, drunk.

245
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,237
Bastard was molesting you huh?

246
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,709
It's ok. Most of the girls in
here have been raped or molested.

247
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,044
I was. I'm not ashamed to say it.

248
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,312
I messes you up huh?

249
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,947
It fucks you up completely.

250
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,118
Look, you want to run with me,
you gotta prove yourself.

251
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,454
Lunch count! Line up!

252
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:37,855
Talk later.

253
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,030
Come with us.

254
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,433
Welcome.

255
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,135
Have a seat.

256
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,105
Wow.

257
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,741
How did you get all this shit?

258
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:02,480
Let's just say, you do them favors...
sometimes they return the gesture.

259
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,148
Have a drink.

260
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,318
This is Bella, tory, switch, Jo.

261
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,621
Not bad huh.

262
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,798
Now, as much as I would like to welcome
you, It's just not the way it works.

263
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,434
I saw that bitch fucking with you.

264
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:26,637
You're gonna walk up there and
you're gonna clock her in the head.

265
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,007
And we're gonna
record it with this.

266
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,581
That way if you try to bring us
down, we got out asses covered.

267
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,784
What's the matter? Shook?

268
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,702
What's good bitch?

269
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,596
Remove your clothes inmate.

270
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,915
Get in there.

271
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,296
Alright sir.

272
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,531
Thank you.

273
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,734
Did you have fun?
That was only 47 hours.

274
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,403
Can you imagine what 2
whole weeks would be like?

275
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,906
They tell me that you're
with the low riders now.

276
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,407
The low riders.

277
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,143
You know how I know that?
I have 119 cameras around here.

278
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,313
I can see everything,
every time everywhere.

279
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,149
If I didn't like you...

280
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,387
I could put you in
there for 2 weeks.

281
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,990
They would have left you alone.
They really would have.

282
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,825
But you didn't take my deal.

283
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,996
You should uh,
consider yourself lucky.

284
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,500
I'll tell you what, you don't
want to go back to solitary...

285
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,939
Then whatcha gonna do...

286
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,443
You're gonna give me the
best blow job you've given.

287
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:25,282
Either that or what I'ma do is lock
you up 23 hours a day for a month.

288
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,119
That's gonna be bad. I mean you get outta
you're not gonna even know your name.

289
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,021
Ok?

290
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,027
Ok.

291
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,221
God stop twitching.

292
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,124
Be happy. This is a celebration.

293
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,295
Don't worry, when they new
shipment of new girls comes in...

294
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,163
He's gonna forget all about you.

295
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,468
All done.

296
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,802
Badass, right?

297
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,472
You better like it.
That shit is art yo.

298
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,674
Give us a minute.

299
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,547
Shut the door.

300
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,920
Relax.

301
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,190
You're in now. It's official.

302
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,563
Damn girl.

303
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,400
You drank the whole thing.

304
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,204
I told you I don't do that shit.

305
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,539
Don't be a pussy.

306
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,940
It's not a needle.

307
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,077
It's when you start shooting up,
that's when you become a zombie.

308
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,755
I can't.

309
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,317
I wouldn't give it to you, if I
didn't think you could handle it.

310
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,872
What are you giggling about?

311
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,911
Last month I was in my room,
playing with my...

312
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,479
Playing with you what?

313
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,313
Your pussy?

314
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,215
No.

315
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,117
I was playing with my cello.

316
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,518
You know how to play the cello?

317
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,754
Yeah. My grandma taught me.

318
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:49,226
That's the only thing what would ease my
mind, we he was doing that stuff to me.

319
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,629
I would close my eyes
and think of the music.

320
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,467
You have the most beautiful smile.

321
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,636
You should smile more.

322
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,607
I'm usually not into girls but,
You...

323
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,809
You're special.

324
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,581
If anybody try to hurt you.
They'd have to go through me first.

325
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,346
Lights out!

326
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,837
Don't look at me like that.
I fuck who I want to fuck, Bitch!

327
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,212
What the hell is going on in here!

328
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,548
Nothing.

329
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,251
0822 this is not your cell.

330
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,685
Get out!

331
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,795
Do me a favor Ma'am.
Sign in for me please.

332
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,499
You told me that
next week you're gonna get me out!

333
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,568
I'm gonna bail you out!
Just hang fucking tight! Alright!

334
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,404
Hey! Visitation is over!

335
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:51,341
Keep you fucking mouth shut!

336
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,064
- Keep your fucking mouth shut!
- I'ma fuck you up! I'ma fuck you up!

337
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,392
How are you?

338
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,094
Talk to me.

339
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,430
What do you want me to say?

340
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,731
You tell me.

341
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,836
You really think I did it, do you?

342
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,406
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

343
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,341
He was a good man.

344
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,610
He took care of us.

345
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,413
You call that a good man?

346
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,916
He did everything in
the world for you.

347
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,385
You're fucking delusional.

348
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,621
You're fucking crazy...

349
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,623
Hey!

350
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,897
He treated you like you
were his own daughter!

351
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,399
He cooked! He fixed things!

352
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,704
He fucked me every single day since I was
a little girl and you knew all about it!

353
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:54,871
You knew all about it!

354
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,206
Hey!

355
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,911
Oh my god! I can't believe
you're doing this?

356
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,983
If you don't want the visitation
to end, keep-the-volume-down.

357
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,153
You deserve to be in here.

358
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,154
Yeah.

359
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,491
Just leave me alone.

360
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,326
Don't ever come back here.

361
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,571
You wouldn't be here if she
wasn't with that perv.

362
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,673
She picked him. Not you.

363
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,276
The way I see it, you did the world
a favor by taking his ass out.

364
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,983
Hey she's got a knife.

365
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,796

366
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,170

372
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,960
You told me that last week.

373
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,163
You know what I'm saying?

00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,733

Ok. Bye bye.

Ok.

377
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,140
Now the department of corrections
have stop by here and have told me,

378
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:41,011
That inmate 0822 which is of course you,
has a large number of infractions...

379
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,679
She was going to stab me.

380
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,916
I can see on the monitor, it
looked like you attacked her 1st.

381
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,184
She had a knife.

382
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,286
Ok she had a weapon.
She didn't have a weapon.

383
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,021
I mean it, it really
doesn't matter does it?

384
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:54,157
Because I put her away fro 2 weeks.
Now, but you!...

385
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,526
What?

386
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,495
What do you mean what?
Don't "what?" me.

387
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,530
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

388
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,532
I don't know what
you're talking about.

389
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,268
You know that shit will kill you.
But you like it.

390
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,071
So why don't you take a little hit.

391
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,679
Take a hit. You know you
like that stuff. You like it.

392
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,747
There you go.

393
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,824
Now here's the way this deal works.

394
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:32,162
You take care of me now. And this
little incident that you did.

395
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,664

Then send me home.

444
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,835
Well that's not

445
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,037

Rape.

448
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,345
You know the thing about Rape, It's if
you really wanna know what Rape is...

449
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,682
I can send you up, there's a

A little piece. And I send you up there,

00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:15,091
This is kiddy prison. This is the
equivalent to Disneyland right here.

00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,328
Pack me a bowl now.

453
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,863
What the hell is the
matter with you?

00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,965
Can't believe you ask
me that question.

455
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,794
You gotta learn how to control your rage.
You're got gonna make it in here.

456
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,778
Keep this up, you're going to

00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,516
Can't keep floating you.

459
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,117
You're not a fish anymore.

460
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,986
What the hell is wrong with you?

461
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,255

Nobody cares about me.

466
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,433
I do.

467
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,868
I just want to be left alone.

468
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,936
Fine.

469
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,640
Get out. Take your stuff and go.

470
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:06,176
You're such a little kid Anna.

00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,162
I don't do first timers.

483
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,834
Are you sure about this?

484
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,771
Fuck.

485
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,572
You're so stupid.

00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,430
No veins girl.

488
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,951
Fuck you. You a total idiot?

489
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,387
You're gonna fuck up your life?

490
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,022
I can handle myself.

491
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,523
Obviously you can't.

492
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,425
Stop talking to me like
a dumb fucking kid.

493
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,726
You are a dumb fucking kid.

494
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,327
Fuck you!

495
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,166
I will blind you bitch.

496
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:13,403
Don't fuck with me.

497
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,243
Done.

498
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,744
You're out.

499
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,446
You're on your own.

500
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,030
Raise the bitch up.

501
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,299
What? You though I wasn't
gonna catch up to you?

502
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,502
Who in the fuck do you think I am?

503
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,804
Cracker bitches like you amuse me.

504
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,139
Come in here all hard and shit.

505
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,710
3 weeks later you crying
home to your mama.

506
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,824
Breathe girl.

507
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,492
Breathe.

508
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,962
That's right. Keep it up.

509
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,001
Take care now.

510
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,016
Breath in.

511
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,051
And out.

512
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,123
You got a death wish?

513
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,893
I hate to see you like this.

514
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,316
Let's go easy.

515
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,588
Crazy. Crazy world baby.

516
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,157
What are your thoughts on suicide?

517
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,426
Mmh.

518
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,797
I tried to kill myself twice.

519
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,938
My only advice is, If you mess up
they through you in the psych ward.

520
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,741
Those fuckers are crazy.

521
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,914
You whore.

522
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,116
You killed me for it.

523
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,718
You asked for it.

524
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,724
You're gonna die in jail.

525
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,821
What the fuck is this shit?

526
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,456
Just do me.

527
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,558
Please.

528
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,893
Chill.

529
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,236
I feel sick.

530
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,408
There's a drug counselor I
think you should talk to.

531
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,110
She's good.

532
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,745
She helped me.

533
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,380
You?

534
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,581
Al long time ago.

535
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,616
Yeah well figures.

536
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,086
You know what?

537
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,288
I don't care what happens to you.

538
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,256
Do as many drugs as want.

539
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,293
They only bring withdrawal.

540
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,563
I hope you fucking die bitch.

541
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,289
What the fuck are you
doing over here bitch?

542
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,159
You hear me?

543
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,961
Aah!

544
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,226
Sobered up I see.

545
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,230
How you feeling?

546
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,702
If I let you sleep in your
bed will you be a good girl?

547
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,270
Come on.

548
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,523
That's withdrawal for you.

549
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,125
I gotta talk to you.

550
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,561
No you don't.

551
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,230
Shootin' up?

552
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,364
What are you? Retarded?

553
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,099
Half those bitches go AIDS.

554
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,534
You should get tested.

555
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,969
Leave me alone.

556
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,606
This yours?

557
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,409
I'm talking to you,
is this your book?

558
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,711
I didn't write it.

559
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:02,411
Getting smart?

560
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,512
Hey!

561
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:04,413
Fuck you!
You little junkie bitch.

562
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:06,115
Hey stop it.

563
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,919
Either you're my friend or my enemy.
What is it?

564
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,821
Neither.

565
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,758
Making some bad decisions girl.

566
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:40,349
From now on, I'm just gonna
keep to myself if I can.

567
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,318
Just stay in here.

568
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,876
Your breathe smells like puke.

569
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,784
You're gonna be like
this for a few days.

570
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,052
I can't.

571
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,520
You can.

572
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,956
Come on.

573
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,294
Don't. Stop.

574
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:31,567
I'm so sick. Gotta get some.

575
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,825
Get away from her.

576
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,664
I'm taking you. I care too
much to see you like this.

577
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,468
Girl, you come with me
one way or another.

578
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,837
This is strike 3.
You don't want that.

579
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:12,708
Girl you disrespect me like this. I swear
to god I'm gonna fucking kill you.

580
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,643
This is your last god damn chance.

581
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,846
Come with me or I'm gonna
bet you down girl.

582
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:21,851
Get off me!

583
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,627
You get any closer and
I'm gonna kill myself.

584
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,539
I'm gonna kill myself.

585
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,541
You don't know what it's like!

586
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,212
I need you to remove that object
from your throat and calm down 0822.

587
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,313
Now!

588
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,085
Get off of me.

589
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,490
0822.

590
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,259
My name is Anna!

591
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,895
Alright, calm the fuck down, Anna.

592
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,164
Anna just calm down.

593
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,965
I can make this easy for you.

594
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,768
I know what it's like
to work with you.

595
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:18,107
Awe well then, would you like one day.
Would you like one month?

596
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,909
I don't care anymore.

597
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,084
Everybody stay down!

598
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,952
Stay down!

599
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,422
Some body let me out of here!

600
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,458
Let me out of here!

601
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,759
Somebody!

602
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,194
Please!

603
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,531
Let me out!

604
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,112
Tray.

605
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,198
You want to fuck me?

606
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,567
You can look.

607
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:22,605
Stop talking. Shut up!

608
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,173
Faggot.

609
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,548
Tray!

610
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,858
Take the Tray.

611
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:18,961
Shit.

612
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,900
Shit!

613
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,068
Medic.

614
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,451
My name is Dr. Han.

615
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,720
Where am I?

616
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,255
Suicide watch.

617
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,191
You do remember what happened, no?

618
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,227
I was in there for a while.

619
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,329
How do you feel now?

620
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:54,597
I'm tired.

621
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,566
Are you aware of the
severity of your actions.

622
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,669
You do recall
attempting suicide, no?

623
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,071
Yes.

624
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,207
So you do want to end your life?

625
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,576
No. I just wanted out.

626
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,011
Out?

627
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,347
Out of that room.

628
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,693
I swear to you,
I didn't want to kill myself.

629
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26,629
I just lost my mind.

630
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,036
How do you feel?

631
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,103
Like shit.

632
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,005
Withdrawal will do that.

633
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,143
If I take these of you will you
do something you'll regret?

634
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,778
No.

635
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,425
Let me ask you something...

636
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:34,596
Why would you give up a free
scholarship to Pacific Conservatory?

637
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,700
You do right, you could be
out of here in 2-3 years.

638
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,045
Been here 3 years.

639
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,981
See girls throw their
lives everyday.

640
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,517
Why don't you worry about yourself?

641
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,822
Trust me, It's the first
thing on my mind.

642
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,389
Please shut up.

643
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,461
Please shut up.

644
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,298
Are you ok?

645
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,605
Hey are you ok?

646
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:53,075
Help! Help! Someone come here!
Help!

647
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,676
Somebody help!

648
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,345
Help!

649
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,782
She's having a seizure.

650
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:02,384
Her airwave is obstructed,
get Dr. Jacobs.

651
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,850
I'm sorry about earlier.

652
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,286
Would you like to talk to somebody?

653
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,221
I wanna see my mom.

654
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:47,830
How are you?

655
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,898
They're taking the house.

656
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,069
Mom, just listen to me.

657
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,138
He's dead.
He can't hurt us anymore.

658
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,309
I'm the one that deserves
to be in here. Not you.

659
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,777
I'm sorry.

660
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,113
I'm so so sorry.

661
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:09,485
You have a gift.
You have such a talent.

662
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:13,722
And when you get out of here,
cause you will.

663
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:16,725
I want you to go to
that conservatory.

664
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,595
I'll go with you.

665
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,001
How do you know they
still want me there?

666
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,905
I'll go with you. I promise.

667
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,007
I promise.

668
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,409
I'll talk to the lawyer.

669
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,245
I'll talk to the judge.

670
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,081
And I'll tell him the truth.

671
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,951
Relax!

672
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,920
Relax!

673
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:57,599
Hey.

674
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,502
The warden what's to see you.

675
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,146
You're doing better I hear.

676
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,015
I feel better.

677
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,150
You see this?

678
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,886
19 years of corrections.

679
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,156
I've been bit. Scratched.
Kicked.

680
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,958
Nobody has left a mark.

681
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,427
Not permanent one.

682
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,828
But you have.

683
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,131
I'll always remember you.

684
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,666
I'm sorry.

685
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,167
You're lucky I like you.

686
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,304
I was just about ready
to ship you off.

687
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,872
That was drugs.

688
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,207
Are you ready to go into Gen.
Pop.?

689
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:40,809
No.

690
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,738
You can't say anything
in front of my fiancé.

691
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,916
I'll do what it takes. I give you
my body. Whatever you want.

692
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,386
Just please keep them away from me.

693
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,021
Alright.

694
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:56,024
Anna, I have mentioned this to
you a couple times before...

695
00:59:56,026 --> 01:00:01,697
But it's really important to me. Because
I think it's important for you too.

696
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,833
Dead huh?

697
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,735
We'll see about that.

698
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:33,996
Yeah.

699
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,864
How'd you do that?

700
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,600
Gotta be tough.

701
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,379
What do you want me to say?

702
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,216
You're the nicest person in here.

703
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:58,787
If I was nice.
I wouldn't be in here.

704
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,790
Why are you in here?

705
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,826
I don't talk about it.

706
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,966
Look at that skinny bitch.

707
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,021
Look who it is.

708
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:16,832
What up bitch?

709
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,691
Put the mop down.

710
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,392
Go ahead.

711
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:47,662
What I do?

712
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,231
Just come with me.

713
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,019
What's going on?

714
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,354
Come on in.

715
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,560
Sorry the room is all dusty.
We um,

716
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,596
don't really use it anymore.
Ever since the digital age.

717
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,700
What do you think?

718
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,805
I had it restrung for you and,

719
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,606
Polished and nice and everything.

720
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:35,844
So what I want you to do, I want you
to practice. I want you to get good.

721
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,445
For the talent show.

722
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,715
I want you to be really ready.

723
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,119
Come on.

724
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,688
Play it.

725
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,558
Right now?

726
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,092
Yeah.

727
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,261
Come on.

728
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,499
Get her. Get her.

729
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,434
What's good bitch!

730
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,507
No you did not.

731
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:15,210
That's the most disrespectful
shit I have ever seen.

732
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:23,285
Oh I ain't gonna kill you. But this
time I'm not afraid to leave a mark.

733
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,698
Don't worry about that
shit with Frank so much.

734
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,533
You're not that pretty anymore.

735
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,504
Which hand is the
cello playing hand?

736
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,639
I heard you are going to
grace us at the talent show.

737
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,976
Or is it the left one?

738
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,513
Fuck her up.

739
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,930
Did Kody do this?

740
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,399
Yes.

741
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,302
She'll be punished.

742
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:22,277
If it means anything, I'm sorry.

743
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:54,175
Can I talk to you for a second?

744
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,677
Off limits.

745
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,645
Give us a minute please.

746
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,321
Frank?

747
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,556
Yeah.

748
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,658
It's bad.

749
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,662
Who's gonna believe me?

750
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,831
I believe you.

751
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:22,003
Nobody ever believed me.
My own mother never believed me.

752
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,639
My sister's husband
works for the governor.

753
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:28,943
If I can get to him we can bring the
bastard down before he ever finds out.

754
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,413
You would do that for me?

755
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,282
Not just for you.

756
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,583
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

757
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,322
You ok?

758
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:20,028
Have a good day. I love you.

759
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,663
Ok, bye bye.

760
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,565
Hi Jane, how you doing?

761
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,167
Is this because of you?

762
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,269
Lord honey, what happened to you?

763
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,371
Did you do something to Anna Nix?

764
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:32,040
Anna? Listen Anna...

765
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:36,111
I'm telling you about Anna. And
here's something about her, ok?

766
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:40,682
She's a troubled little girl and
we're working our butts off

767
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:43,518
to get her life all cleaned up.
You know that?

768
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,919
Right?

769
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:47,589
She told me some things about you.

770
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,290
Yeah. Yeah.

771
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:53,261
Oh Jane I'm so sorry about your eye.
I really am. Hope it gets better.

772
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:57,799
And probably take some Advil.
I will really help. Ok?

773
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,135
Thank you. Thanks for
telling me everything.

774
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,947
Yeah. Yeah Jane?

775
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,949
Uh huh. Yeah.

776
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,985
Let's go ahead and finish her off.

777
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,534
Security!

778
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,916
Oh my god.

779
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,889
Come on. Come on.

780
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,948
Anna, do you know why
I called you in here?

781
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,204
No.

782
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,072
Because I think you
know who killed Jane.

783
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,041
I don't.

784
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,742
My gut feeling...

785
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,545
It's the same person who
did that to your face.

786
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,214
Why would she do that?

787
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,882
Cut the crap.

788
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,686
If you haven't noticed she's crazy.

789
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,187
Rumor has it that you're next.

790
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,158
Anna, good luck at the talent show.

791
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,952
I'm really looking forward
to watching you play.

792
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:41,440
♪ Rapping ♪

793
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,284
Give it up to killa Kal
and the K block crew.

794
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:01,356
Ya ya that was ill. Up next I got
some classy shit for your ass.

795
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,658
Anna Nix on the cello.

796
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,595
Yeah you heard me right.
The mother fucking cello.

797
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:11,299
So put your hands together
and make some NOISE!

798
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,401
Anna Nix.

799
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,410
Is that good princess?

800
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,635
That was amazing.

801
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,973
My who twelve years of doing this,

802
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,477
I've never heard or seen
anything quite like that.

803
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,819
No no no no no no.
I want you to keep that.

804
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,322
Keep it. It's yours.

805
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,560
You've done me right.

806
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:26,100
You've done me right.

807
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,237
You know...

808
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,975
When I heard you playing tonight,

809
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,645
When I looked up
there and I saw you,

810
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:49,457
So you deserve a chance.

811
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,762
You deserve a REAL chance.

812
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,001
So what I've done,

813
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,907
I've schedules a parole
hearing for you.

814
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:06,607
Really?

815
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,043
Mmhmm. Next month.

816
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,846
Now take it off.

817
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,831
That's good. Mmhmm.

818
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,409
Oh.

819
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,744
All of it.

820
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:50,551
Yeah.

821
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,156
Oooh yeah.

822
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,727
Lay down.

823
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,207
There we go.

824
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:21,682
You know you could look like
you're enjoying it a little bit.

825
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,867
There we go.

826
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,539
I got a parole hearing.

827
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,140
Next week.

828
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,443
I wouldn't be so quick
to trust Frank.

829
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:55,116
He likes to pump people
up then crash them.

830
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,318
I got a deal with him.

831
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,223
Well what does he have
to gain if you're gone?

832
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:13,734
What's up?

833
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:16,771
Hey! Keep moving. Keep moving.

834
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,739
Have fun Cinderella.

835
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,445
Keep mopping.

836
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,921
Talking shit bitch! Talking shit!
Huh?

837
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,134
Letter up.

838
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,478
Parole hearing. September 13th.

839
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,287
What up bitch?

840
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,290
Huh what! What up bitch!

841
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,394
Hey!

842
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,067
What up?

843
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,338
Either kill me or help me.

844
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,540
Help you do what?

845
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,576
Bring down Frank.

846
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,011
Shut the fuck up.

847
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:33,180
I should fucking stab you
in the throat right now.

848
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,349
How?

849
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,421
Have a seat.

850
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:44,992
You ready?

851
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,494
Yeah.

852
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,029
On. Off.

853
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:49,530
It's really easy.

854
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,261
You sure you want to do this?

855
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:56,937
I got no choice.

856
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,546
I missed you.

857
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,465
What?

858
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,804
You fucking idiot.

859
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,573
God damn you bitch!

860
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,624
So you nervous?

861
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,126
A little.

862
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:55,896
What do you think my
recommendation should be?

863
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,364
We had a deal.

864
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,233
You're right.

865
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,968
I'm totally fucking with you.

866
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:04,238
So this is our last one, so I
really want to enjoy this.

867
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,774
So let's make it... slow.

868
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,111
Come here.

869
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:41,375
You're next.

870
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,045
Come on.

871
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,590
0822?

872
01:19:56,592 --> 01:20:00,761
Anna Nix? Sentenced for 4 years
for involuntary manslaughter.

873
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:02,930
Served 1 year 3 months.

874
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:06,600
How are you today Ms. Nix?

875
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,236
I'm just really grateful for
the opportunity to be here.

876
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,139
Tell us why you feel like
you should be released?

877
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:16,043
I feel like I am
100% rehabilitated.

878
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,712
Do you feel remorse
for your actions?

879
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:20,514
Yes.

880
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:22,850
I feel terrible that it happened.

881
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:27,221
I'm really sorry.
I was young and stupid.

882
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:32,827
From the review of your file it looks like you
have had numerous infractions in your intake here.

883
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,528
Care to explain?

884
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:40,534
Those infractions were mainly due to
trying to adjust to life in here.

885
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:46,907
I'm truly sorry for everything that
happened and I have since matured.

886
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,076
Warden.

887
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,416
Anna Nix is a special girl
with a wonderful talent.

888
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,120
She's an amazing Cello player.

889
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,961
She was gracious enough
to perform for us.

890
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:13,667
It was one of the most amazing
displays of talent...

891
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:18,439
I've ever seen and I
really really mean that.

892
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:27,348
And as much as I would like to say
that Anna Nix is a model inmate,

893
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:33,020
Unfortunately she has a real
problem with authority.

894
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:38,759
I don't think it's just her necessary
acting out. I just think it's a matter of

895
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:42,930
circumstance. Perhaps it would be better
if she remain in here for a while longer

896
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:45,733
before she goes to the outside.

897
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:49,803
Wow.

898
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,307
In light of the warden's
recommendations,

899
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,844
and your numerous infractions
here, I have no choice but deny

900
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:59,013
you parole at this moment.

901
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,748
Wait!

902
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:01,782
What?

903
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:03,484
Before you lock me away again.

904
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:06,921
I would like you to see what your
trusted does behind closed doors.

905
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,867
What is this?

906
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,904
Let me take a look at this.
What the hell is that?

907
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,773
Let me see that.
I can take a look at this-

908
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,841
- Don't move! Don't move.
- Let me see it, Let me see.

909
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:31,011
What the hell is this?
Officer get her out of here.

910
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,518
You have a lot of explaining to do.

911
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,155
That is obviously a staged performance.
Can you not see that?

912
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:43,390
It is not a staged performance.

913
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,626
Officer, please detain this man!

914
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:05,145
Knock it off ladies!
Knock it off!

915
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,815
If I was you I would get too happy.

916
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,783
You still go me.

917
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:15,723
Uh huh.

918
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:17,324
Yeah.

919
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,727
Well this whole place is messed up.

920
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:22,062
Did you see that video?

921
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,865
That was some messed up stuff.

922
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:28,235
Well we need to get internal
affairs involved on this.

923
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,378
Ms. Nix.

924
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,114
What you did today
was very very brave.

925
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:43,884
And on behalf of the state of
California, We apologize.

926
01:23:43,886 --> 01:23:47,354
We promise you a full on
investigation will take place,

927
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,590
and justice will be served.

928
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,259
In light of today's events,

929
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:55,195
We grant you parole today.

930
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,466
You're free.

931
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:07,107
Come on. Let's go.

932
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,613
Thank you.

933
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:14,615
Good luck.

934
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:24,158
I'm sorry about the
ways things turned out.

935
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,893
I'm sorry too.

936
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:27,061
See you in the outside?

937
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,685
Don't come back.
