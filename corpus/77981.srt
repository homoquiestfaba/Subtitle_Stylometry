# Who feel that life
is but a joke #

877
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,854
# But you and I,
we've been through that #

878
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,417
# And this not our fate... #

879
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,928
Howard: I had, like,
no listeners,

880
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,692
and the couple of listeners
I did have

881
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,562
Would call in and tell me
how bad I sucked

882
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,124
on a regular basis.

883
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,830
Although, I did manage to convince
one of them to be my weather lady.

884
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,497
Irene...
the weather girl.

885
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,835
Irene,
are you there?

886
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,103
It's cold, real cold,

887
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,338
but your ass
is gonna be plenty hot

888
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,539
when I give you a good,
hard butt-whipping.

Yeah.

Irene, thank you
for the weather forecast.

894
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,488
Shut up.

895
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,024
We hope to hear
from you tomorrow...

It's great to see you.

902
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,444
I'm feelin' so miserable
since you left.

903
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,575
I am just so uncomfortable
in this Detroit. I'm...

00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,181
I'm willing to believe
you didn't sleep with that girl.

906
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,486
OK? And I understand
you're a somewhat abnormal person

907
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,788
with a somewhat abnormal job.
That I can accept.

908
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,726
I deal with abnormality
every single day.

909
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,661
I don't need everything
in my life to be normal.

910

And on the air,
you do what you do. That's your job.

911
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,663
But off the air,
for me to be in this marriage...

912
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,365
I need to know
I'm the only one.

913
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,431
And I'm not saying that
to pressure you.

914
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,070
I'm saying it because it's
just something I know about myself.

or whatever...

any more time.

in love with you.

anyone else in my life.

anyone else in my life.

to forgive me.

Detroit has too many rock stations,

954

we're starting a new format,

I went to college,

[Sniff Sniff]
Ahem.

1048
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,230
DC 101. Good morning.
This is Howard Stern.

1049
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,864
Welcome to the show.

1050
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,171
I have a confession
to make.

1051
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,541
I did not get, uh,
laid last night.

1052
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,911
In fact, I haven't gotten laid
in a really long time.

1053
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,246
Now, give me a call
here at DC 101

1054
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,218
if you have
the same kind of problem.

1055
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,219
Having trouble
with your woman?

1056
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,915
Give me a call.
I'll help you out.

1057
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,889
Let me introduce,
over here to my right,

1058
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,655
my beautiful new newswoman
Robin Quivers, who looks so beautiful,

1059
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,755
I'm sure she doesn't have
any of these sexual problems.

1060
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:38,700
But I must tell you,
my life is, um, very odd.

1061
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,703
I get hornier
and hornier.

1062
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,672
My wife, she comes home from work,
she goes to sleep.

1063
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,698
The whole week goes by,
she never gets horny.

1064
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,040
Robin, as a woman,
what is it?

1065
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,137
Do women get horny?

1066
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,083
Sometimes.

1067
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,248
Why is he talking
to his newsperson?

1068
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,723
I'll have him stop.

1069
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,316
What about you
specifically, though?

1070
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,988
When is the last time
that you were with a man...

1071
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,156
sexually?

1072
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,590
About a year.

1073
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,363
You're serious?

1074
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,631
- A year?
- Yeah.

1075
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,002
A year,
ladies and gentlemen.

1076
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,335
Someone more pathetic
than me.

1077
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,068
This is good. This is good.
We're getting somewhere.

1078
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,235
This is a good
discussion.

1079
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,835
Uh, you know,
I bought a book,

1080
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,403
"How to Score with Babes,"

1081
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,880
and listen
to what it says.

1082
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,143
I think
it's rather revealing.

1083
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,515
"When attempting
to score with a babe,

1084
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,520
"make sure to wear
tight pants.

1085
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,682
"If necessary, stuff
a semirigid, large object

1086
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,952
"into your pants

1087
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,426
to create the appearance
of having a large penis."

1088
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,360
Women like large penis.

1089
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,694
Did he say "penis"?

1090
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,233
I know about this stuff.

1091
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,599
I have no bulge in my crotch.
I have a small penis.

1092
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
And I've never told
anyone this before...

1093
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,266
And I don't think
you should start now.

1094
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,672
Well, I've done it.
Now the cat's out of the bag.

1095
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,335
But this guy
wrote a good book.

1096
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,572
The author has slept
with over 16,000 women,

1097
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,137
and, uh,
take it from him.

1098
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,683
He says
wear tight pants.

1099
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,311
If he slept
with 16,000 women,

1100
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,151
he wouldn't have time
to put on pants.

1101
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,987
That is true, too.
I didn't consider that.

1102
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,320
Why don't you
give me a call at DC 101

1103
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,327
if you want
to talk about this.

1104
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,159
We'll be back
right after these words.

1106
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,731
You're a genius.

1107
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,995
That was great.

1108
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,400
That was interesting.

1109
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,495
Didn't that feel good?
That was great.

1110
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,904
You say
whatever you want.

1111
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,340
You have carte blanche.

1112
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,345
You and Robin must not talk
to each other on the air.

1113
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,176
And don't sing along
with the music.

1114
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,841
And you know
what else you could do?

1115
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,146
I'd like you to memorize
the names of the local high schools.

1116
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,982
And don't criticize
Washington.

1117
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,680
It's not good for ratings.

1118
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,055
Now, if you'll excuse us, we'd like
to talk to Robin alone for a second.

1119
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,422
Wait. I wanted...

1120
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,927
You know what I want you
to do for me,

1121
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,793
is to make up a grid
of all your comedy bits

1122
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,297
and the corresponding
days of the week,

1123
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,596
so that I'll know on which day
you'll be doing which bit.

1124
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,933
I told you I work spontaneously.
I think that l...

1125
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,669
Robin...
don't encourage him.

1126
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,714
He's better
when he's toned down.

1127
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,876
We need you to be
a friend here, Robin.

1128
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,147
I'll see
what I can do.

1129
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,052
Great.

1130
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,385
Appreciate it,
Robin.

1131
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,549
- OK.
- Thanks.

1132
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,528
I think we should
separate them.

Orioles over the Red Sox
3-2 last night,

1134

extending the Os'
winning streak to 7.

1135
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,535
And finally,
today is Memorial Day.

1136
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,038
Sunny skies and warm temperatures
for veterans marching in parades

1137
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,539
across the metropolitan area.

1138

Highs today in the 70s.
It's 58 degrees...

1139
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,546
You know, Robin, let me
interrupt for a second.

1140
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,548
I'm glad you brought up
Memorial Day.

1141
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,550
I was in Vietnam.
I'd like to talk to you about it.

1142
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,552
I had 11 kills
in Vietnam,

1143
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,055
and I'm telling you,
I really should've had more.

1144
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,057
Officially, I should've
had more kills.

1145
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,059
Let me tell you
what I'm talking about.

1146
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,095
I was in a gook village,
and I come upon a schoolhouse.

1147
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,926
So I grab one of
my grenades off my belt,

1148
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,761
and I throw it right
into the schoolhouse.

1149
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,028
And I blow up
the whole damn thing.

1150
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,161
So I'm out there
counting all the bodies.

1151
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,330
You threw a grenade
into a school?

1152
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,340
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

1153
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,171
I must've killed, like,
200 kids.

1154
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,871
My dickhead lieutenant
comes up to me, and he says,

1155
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,847
"Stern, those are little kids.
That counts as one person."

1156
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,850
Howard, I was
in the military.

1157
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,318
I was a captain in the Air Force.
What were you?

1158
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,820
What was I?

1159
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,412
Yeah, what were you?

1160
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,492
- What were you again?
- I was a captain.

1161
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,493
That's what I was.
I was a captain.

1162
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,994
And what were you in?

1163
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,529
I was in Vietnam.

1164
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,292
Ohh! Army? Navy?

1165
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,298
In the Army.

1166
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,301
Did you have a division?

1167
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,301
103rd.

1168
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,302
103rd what?

1169
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,804
I was in the 103rd...

1170
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,305
I don't know
what I was in, Robin,

1171
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,399
But I'm saying I was
in the 103rd.

1172
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,410
And the point
of this whole thing

1173
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,242
is that I think a kill
is a kill is a kill,

1174
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,748
and killing a kid should be
just as good as killing an adult.

1175
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:51,412
Well, I suppose even if you're killing
children, they should count them.

1176
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,480
I got some music
for you now at DC 101.

1178
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,684
Ha ha!

1179
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,722
You're not even old enough
to have been in Vietnam.

1180
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,728
Duh.

1181
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,765
I couldn't sit there
and not say something.

1182
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,268
I knew they had told me
not to talk.

1183
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,771
I knew I was going to get
in trouble if I did.

1184
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,773
But he was really
onto something,

1185
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,777
and I knew that there was
something going on there...

1186
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,279
and I just went for it.

1187
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,318
Well, this just came
from the FCC.

1188
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,820
Did you say "testicles"
on the air?

1189
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,856
Wait a second.

1190

We just lost Muffler Man.

a real problem here.

that the commercial sponsors
are there once you get the ratings.

you just cost us $40,000.

1200

Wait a second. If I do a lame show,
it's never gonna take off.

one thing.

starting to take off.

There's a buzz
on the street about it.

if we just take some time with it,

gonna be OK.

1213
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,594
is getting closer.

1214
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,501
We're going to
have winners take...

1215
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,504
Hey!

1216
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,597
Hi, honey.

1217
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,074
Robin Leach says we
should move to Antigua.

1218
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,577
Oh, yeah?
Come on, hurry up.

1219
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,442
Snap to it.
I'm ovulating.

1220
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,449
I'm in the middle of
important show research.

1221
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,452
Howard, seriously,
come on.

1222
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,454
You know what?
You're getting baby fever here.

1223
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,955
And you know, maybe
it's a little premature.

1224
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,958
I'm about 3 days away from being fired,
the way I figure it.

1225
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,960
And do you want
to know something?

1226
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,461
You got to think about
the economics of this.

1227
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,463
You're gonna be the best morning man
in the history of radio.

1228
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,123
At any minute, you're
gonna be number one.

1229
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,461
- Is that so?
- Yeah! Strip!

1230
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,796
Let me tell you something.
Look at yourself.

1231
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,302
You're completely on fire
about having a baby.

1232
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,304
You don't understand.
I'm not a piece of meat.

1233
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,033
I mean,
I have to be romanced.

1234
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,972
Oh, yeah. Please.

1235
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,978
Ooh, look at that bra.
Where did you get that?

1236
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,206
You like this?

1237
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,713
OK. That's it.
That's it!

1238
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,647
I am making a baby!

1239
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,776
It's baby time!
I'm ready to give you a baby.

1240
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,784
Thank you.

1241
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:04,785
Hold on.

1242
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,923
OK. Now I'm hot.

1243
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,425
Now I actually
want to have sex.

1244
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,119
I didn't before
and now I do.

1245
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,560
Announcer On TV:
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous...

1246
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,064
Robin, watch this.

1247
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,865
What am I doing?

1248
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,735
Uh, having a seizure?

1249
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,741
No, that's not a seizure.
That's me dancing

1250
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,903
because I'm happy
'cause I got laid last night.

1251
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,240
- Oh!
- Yeah, I really did.

1252
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,247
In fact,
it was not for lust.

1253
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,907
It was 'cause I was
making a kid.

1254
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,918
- Oh.
- In fact, my wife's eggs are very old.

1255
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,783
They're very, you know,
she's getting older.

1256
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,287
But my sperm
is like supersperm,

1257
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,516
so I'm pretty sure everything
was delivered in one shot.

1258
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,525
Oh, yeah.
Your sperm are fine.

1259
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,527
My sperm are fantastic.
I'm fantastic.

1260
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,029
I'm in a good mood.
Let's take some phone calls

1261
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,531
and see what's doing
out there.

1262
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,032
- OK.
- Hi, you're on the air.

1263
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,591
Woman Caller: Hi,
is this Howard Stern?

1264
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,761
This is Howard.

1265
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,270
Oh, whoa.
Anyway, I was calling

1266
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,101
because I have
a really big problem.

1267
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,333
What's your problem?

1268
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,898
Well, every morning
I lie in bed,

1269
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,443
and the only thing
I can do is think of you.

1270
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,105
Oh, really? Well, let's see if we
can't help you with your problem.

1271
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,442
What do you look like?

1272
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,076
Well, I've got blond hair,
and I've got blue eyes,

1273
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,588
and my measurements
are about 38-24-34.

1274
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,453
Some people tell me I look
a lot like Farrah Fawcett.

1275
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,550
I can help you.
Robin, I can help this girl.

1276
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,061
You know, we have the most
beautiful audience.

1277
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,621
We certainly do. We're
very fortunate that way.

1278
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,064
You know what we're gonna do
to solve your problem?

1279
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,102
I'm gonna have sex with you
right now over the radio.

1280
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,568
Caller:
How are we gonna do that?

1281
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,901
Very simple.
I've thought this through, Robin.

1282
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,567
First of all, what kind of radio
are you listening to us on?

1283
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,577
You have a transistor radio, or you
have one of those big sound systems?

1284
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,112
Caller: I have
one of those big sound systems.

1285
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,238
Good. OK.

1286
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,077
Could you turn the treble
all the way down

1287
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,378
and put the bass
all the way up?

1288
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,719
OK. The treble's down,
and the bass is up.

1289
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,188
Howard: Take your speaker...
You got a big speaker?

1290
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,121
Caller: Yes, I do.

1291
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,625
Lay it flat
on the floor.

1292
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,390
And I want you to sort
of straddle the speaker.

1293
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,896
- Howard!
- Caller: Do what?

1294
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,763
A woman cannot be aroused
in that way.

1295
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,098
Howard: No. This is really wrong, Robin.
You're absolutely wrong.

1296
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,104
In fact, my father
was a radio engineer,

1297
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,265
and he proved
this theory years ago.

1298
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,831
You've got to believe.

1299
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,276
Now, what I need you to do is put
your private area over the woofer.

1300
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,608
Caller: I can't believe you're
really making me to do this.

1301
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,170
Howard: Come on, do it.

1302
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,547
Right up against it
so you can feel me.

1303
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,021
I'm on.

1304
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,148
Robin: Oh, I have
to ask her a question.

1305
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:25,354
What kind of a woman are you
to have sex this way on the radio?

1306
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,123
Don't answer that question.
Bad question.

1307
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,960
You're gonna ruin
this woman's mood.

1308
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,966
She might start
second-guessing.

1309
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,228
Are you ready
to have sex?

1310

Ooh. It kinda tingles.

1316
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,606
See? It tingles.
She likes it.

1317
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,616

Listen to her.
She's going wild.

A woman on the air
had an orgasm.

Have you lost your mind?

1342
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,441
But you got to admit,
it was a funny bit.

The audience loved
that stuff.

1344

there's gonna be other sponsors.

00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:15,932
I mean, things really
started to take off.

1381
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,024
I mean, things really
started to take off.

1382
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,796
It was then that I made
a startling discovery.

1383
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,202
She's a beautiful girl. You're telling
me this beautiful woman is a lesbian?

1384

Howard: Lesbians
equal ratings.

1385
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,167
Now let me say something.

1386
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,870
I am the hero
of the lesbian community,

1387
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,037
am I not, Robin?

1388
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,205
I guess you are.

1389
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,407
I absolutely am.

1390

All right. Now,
let's get into it.

1391
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:38,345
Julie, I want you to tell us
about your first lesbianic experience.

1392
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,547
OK.

1393
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,056
Tell me about the secret world
of lesbian sex.

1394
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,059
Well, Howard, I was 18.

1395
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,560
Oh, you were so young.

1396
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,062
Right. And I was working
at a summer camp.

1397
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,063
Yes?

1398
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,396
And I was lying
in my bunk,

1399
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,561
and the camp director's wife
walked in.

1400
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,035
Ooh, now, that's hot.

1401

Uh, everyone was asleep,

1402
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,070
and I'm lying
in my bunk,

1403
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,575
and she sees me
looking at her.

1404
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,076
Howard: And then
what happens?

1405
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,579
She, like, signals
for me to go with her.

1406
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,080
What are you sleeping in?

1407
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,582
'Cause this is
what I picture.

1408
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,584
Little cotton panties,
a tight little undershirt.

1409
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,813
No. I'm wearing, like,
little baby-doll pajamas.

1410
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,981
Oh, you tease.

1411
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,992
So then she takes me
into this tent.

1412
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,029
When you walk in, lesbians
all over the place, right?

1413

sex festival, right?

Maybe she wants to play.

You want a date with Julie?

Yes, honey, of course
you're on the air.

I told them I wanted
to talk to you off the air.

1426

But, honey, you're in the middle of
interrupting a beautiful, sexy moment.

You've got to tell everyone. My audience

It's my supersperm. I knew
my supersperm would do it, Robin.

You're so blessed.

Can we talk privately now?

Absolutely, sweetheart.

Wait a minute. Does she
know what she's gonna have?

1442
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,279
Is it gonna be a lesbian?

You've gone too far.

No offense, Julie.
Please, I don't need this aggravation.

Did you call your mother?

I feel so different.

looks like a pig,

2050
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,232
I'm looking forward
to joining the team.

2051
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,029
Now, old Ross here's
quite lively,

2052
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,227
and I think he'll
fit in well

2053
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,462
with your special
brand of humor.

2054
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,505
As a matter of fact,

2055
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,667
I'm a bit of
an old comedy man myself.

2056
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,836
I've done quite a bit
of light comedy in my younger years.

2057
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,471
Summer stock... mostly.

2058
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,613
Hundreds of people gathered
in Central Park this afternoon

2059
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,688
to remember former Beatle
John Lennon,

2060
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,452
who was murdered 2 years ago
today. Lennon's killer...

2061
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,025
Hey, let me
ask you something, Ross.

2062
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,560
Were you a Beatles fan?

2063
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:17,325
Uh... y-yes,
l... I was, once.

2064
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,866
Lennon's killer,
Mark David Chapman...

2065
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,927
Now, Mark David Chapman, now,
there's a guy we gotta talk about, Ross.

2066
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,903
Mark David Chapman,
what do you make of him?

2067
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,873
I mean, he's probably in a prison cell
right now enjoying himself.

2068
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:31,504
I say electrocute him. You gotta be
with that program, huh, Ross?

2069
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,513
I hope this was a good idea.

2070
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,015
Ross: Uh, I think
we're supposed

2071
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,779
to be having
the news now.

2072
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,683
Howard: Forget that.
Just repeat after me, Ross.

2073
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,449
I want to kill
Mark David Chapman.

on the phone with us.

2080

I really have no idea.

2081

Do it right off the top of your head.

What an ad-libber, Ross.

01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,848
All right, I don't want to
put you under too much pressure.

2087
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,246
Hi. Is this
Betty Jean Rushton?

01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,284
Yes, it is.

2089
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,944
Betty Jean, hi.
It's Howard Stern,

2090
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:12,951
W N BC.

2091
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,578
I work with
your husband Kenny.

2092
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,520
Yes. Kenny's
mentioned you.

2093
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:17,888
Oh, I bet Kenny has.

2094
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,655
The reason I'm calling
is because your husband

2095
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,889
has been very bitchy
around here lately,

2096
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:26,058
and I'm thinking that maybe
if you gave him some more sex...

2097
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,566
More sex?

2098
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:30,103
Yeah. He's backed up.
Isn't he backed up, Ross?

2099
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,299
Yes. You know, you might
be right about that, Howard.

2100
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,807
Oh, really?
I am right.

2101
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,378
Howard!

2102
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,240
You ever do that again,
I'll kill you.

2103
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,474

She's the anchor on the show.

That's
what's missing.

2105
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,980
You have violated
my wife.

2106
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:43,983
I did not.

2107
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,213
You soiled the sanctity
of my home!

2108
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,845
What are you saying?
I didn't do anything.

2109
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,150
I wouldn't even be
doing bits like that

2110
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,657
if Robin was with me.

2111
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:52,590
I never would have even
called his wife on the air

2112
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,592
if I had Robin
sitting there.

2113

She's the voice
of reason.

2114
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,898
You know what?
You know what you are, Stern?

2115
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,399
You're the Antichrist.

2116
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,934
- What?
- Yes, that's what you are!

2117
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,994
You are the motherfucking
Antichrist!

2118
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,302
Kenny, take it easy.

2119
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:16,406
Well, this is an exciting day
for us here in the studio

2120
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,883
because we have a stage star
with us.

2121
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:19,852
This is Donna Porter
with us on the show,

2122
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,788
and she's here to talk
about life in the theater,

2123
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,415
and, Donna, I don't know
if you know this,

2124
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,585
but our own news guy
Ross Buckingham

2125
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,323
actually has some theater experience
as well, don't you, Ross?

2126
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,093
Do you want to tell us
about that?

2127
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,000
Yes. Um... I once did
some summer stock.

2128
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,332
I know you're very,
very proud

2129
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,871
of your summer stock
experience.

2130
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,270
When you went on stage
the very first time,

2131
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,307
did you ever
get nervous?

2132
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,368
No, I was...
quite comfortable.

2133
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,107
Howard: I see.
That's very interesting.

2134
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,614
Then, in 1926,

2135
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:50,845
General Sarnoff
formed NBC radio,

2136
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,546
America's first network.

2137
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,646
I guess you could say
I was a little nervous

2138
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:58,851
the first time I was ever
on stage with a 12-inch kielbasa.

2139
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,394
Now, why is that?

2140
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,054
Can I show you?

2141
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,624
Sure. I think we'd like
to see what you have.

2142
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,168
Right now, you're getting
a look at a live broadcast

2143
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,294
of The Howard Stern
Show.

2144
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:10,530
That's about 13 inches,

2145
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,664
and you're licking
whipped cream off a kielbasa,

2146
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:13,866
and you're putting it
in your mouth,

2147
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,705
and you're jamming
the kielbasa

2148
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,244
all the way down
your throat.

2149
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,574
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

2150
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,240
The entire kielbasa
is going down.

2151
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,251
She has swallowed an entire
13-inch kielbasa.

2152
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,811
Look at that.
A full 13 inches, ladies and gentlemen.

2153
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,221
Wow. You gotta
love that, folks.

2154
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,851
You gotta love it,
don't you, Ross? Ho ho.

2155
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,895
Ross Buckingham,
have you ever seen a woman

2156
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,931
swallow
an entire 13-inch kielbasa?

2157
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,090
When you were
in the theater,

2158
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,359
did you ever work
with a kielbasa?

2159
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:40,924
What he did to me today

2160
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:45,462
was the most unprofessional
and insulting experience of my life.

2161
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,839
I hold you and this station
personally responsible.

2162
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,174
If you want to fire me,
fire me. Go ahead.

2163
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:54,215
But I refuse to work with
this man one minute longer.

2164
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:57,710
Good day.

2165
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,585
OK, it's 5:35 at W N BC.

2166
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,624
Time for the news.

2167
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,283
I'm not real good
at this, I confess,

2168
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,555
but I'm trying...

2169
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:09,597
Who the fuck
are we gonna get?

2170
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,531
Beats me. No one wants
to work with him.

2171
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,830
Is it Monaco or Mon aco?

2172
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,801
Monaco?

2173
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,863
That's what I thought.
Monaco.

2174
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,238
Well, anyway, she's dead.

2175
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,901
You know,
I'm thinking about...

2176
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,774
What about Kelly Landers?

2177
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,905
Absolutely refuses.

2178
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:27,913
Says she'd rather quit.

2179
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,745
I have a theory
that he is the one

2180
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,341
who cut the brakes
on the car.

2181
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,887
Now, I could be crazy, but I figure
a guy who's been married

2182
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,856
as long as Prince Reindeer
is ready for a new wife.

2183

I mean, Princess Grace...
beautiful woman and all that...

2184
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,688
but she was losing
her looks. Let's be honest.

2185
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:41,888
There were bags
under those eyes.

2186

highest-ranking police officials,

2194

right now.

I am begging you,
please...

2198
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,781
send a hit man to

01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,842
You're gonna like it here.

2218
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,069
[Rhythmic Knock On Door]

2219
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,441
Excuse me for a second.

2220
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,110
You're back.
I got you back.

2221
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,239
It's a miracle
of all miracles.

2222
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:09,611
I can't talk right now.

2223
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:11,242
Oh, hello.
How are you?

2224
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,344
I even got you an office.
You're all set.

2225
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:14,820
I'm showing
my apartment now.

2226
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,356
You're looking
at this apartment?

2227
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:18,085
Let me tell you something.
There are roaches the size of dogs here.

2228
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,592
- I don't advise you living here.
- Excuse me.

2229
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,754
It is disgusting.
Take a look behind the fireplace.

2230
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,888
You'll see. Excuse me.
I'll come back and tell you.

2231
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,092
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

2232
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,032
Robin, you got your job back,
so what's the problem?

2233
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,127
The problem is that
when I needed you,

2234
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,364
you didn't stand
behind me.

2235
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,066
Robin, those guys are assholes.
They screwed you,

2236
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,405
and they screwed me. We gotta
get back in there and beat them.

2237
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,137
We were supposed
to be a team.

2238
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:38,542
We are a team,
for God's sakes.

2239
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,103
We're gonna be the greatest team
in the history of radio.

2240
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,780
Come on.
What's the big deal?

2241
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:46,149
Look at me, Robin.
Robin...

2242
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,152
See this?

2243
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,483
Look what I'm doing.

2244
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,716
You know what I'm doing?
I'm begging you.

2245
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,258
I'm begging you.

2246
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,793
I'm serious.

2247
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,225
Come here.
I'm gonna kiss your feet.

2248
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,353
Look at these gams.

2249
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,624
Look at these feet.

2250
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,393
I'm worshipping your foot.

2251
01:28:58,466 --> 01:28:59,728
Look at me, Robin.

2252
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,166
What are you doing?

2253
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,361
People are looking
at us.

2254
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,530
I'm begging you to...
I'm liking it down here.

2255
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,436
Hey, Robin,

2256
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,668
you love this,
don't you?

2257
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:09,937
It gives me
great pleasure now

2258
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,239
to welcome back
on our show

2259
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,746
the very beautiful,
multitalented...

2260
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,079
uh, vivacious...

2261
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:17,811
tight-sweatered...

2262
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,979
beautifully big-breasted
Robin Quivers. I love her.

2263
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,750
Thank you.

2264
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:25,019
May I say that you are
beautifully big-breasted again?

2265
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:26,424
No.

2266
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,928
Thank God you're back,
'cause the show sucked without you.

2267
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,396
Actually, I just want to say
how much I really missed you and...

2268
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,398
Aww.

2269
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,593
That I really do love you,

2270
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,329
and I'm just
so glad you're back.

2271
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:37,701
OK there, Mr. Rushton,

2272
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:41,640
You pick up the phone,
and it rings right into my booth.

2273
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,267
Good, but don't
answer it.

2274
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,040
Immediately disconnect
Stern's microphone,

2275
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,241
dump out of the delay,
and go straight to a record.

2276
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,442
That would be it,
sir.

2277
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,611
Always have a record
ready to go.

2278
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:54,177
Yes, sir.

2279
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:59,922
This little puppy's finally
gonna get housebroken.

2280
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,222
Oh, look at this, Robin.
This is unbelievable.

2281
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,991
Oh, the underpants
are coming off.

2282
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:07,330
That is the first naked lady
in the history of radio.

2283
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:08,960
Sans panties, sans bra.

2284
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,469
I am shocked.

2285
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:11,971
So am I.
This is disgraceful.

2286
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,063
We should be taken
off the air.

2287
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:15,074
You've finally done it.

2288
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:17,270
Ohh! Beautiful. You're a work of art.
Did you know that?

2289
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,277
Thank you, Howard.

2290
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,472
Let me tell you
something.

2291
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:21,845
Now, to ensure our place
in the history of radio,

2292
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,544
Mandy has agreed to actually
get on the floor with me

2293
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,177
and give me a massage
while she is nude.

2294
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,779
What does a massage have to do
with making it into history?

2295
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,790
Who knows? I don't know.
Massage, schmas.

2296
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:31,790
I just gotta
get touched.

2297
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:32,951
I can't wait, Howard.

2298
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:33,994
You can't wait?

2299
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,153
Let me tell you something...

2300
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,493
I'm not kidding around...
You are beautiful,

2301
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:38,998
and my thoughts
are right in the gutter.

2302
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,363
You understand what I mean?

2303
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,595
This is the Tudor,
right?

2304
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,500
Center hall plan,
very traditional.

2305
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:44,765
Naked Woman: I've been
thinking about you, too.

2306
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:48,036
Only reason it's for sale
is they're divorcing.

2307
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,943
Would you believe 80%% %
of my listings are from divorces?

2308
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,207
Howard: Mmm.
For God's sakes.

2309
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,646
Now, what do you suggest
we do here?

2310
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:58,378
Why don't you come lay
over here and get comfortable?

2311
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,216
I could do that.

2312
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,220
All right.

2313
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,654
I can't believe
my luck here.

2314
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,315
Don't hurt yourself
getting over there.

2315
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:05,324
I won't.

2316
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:06,519
All right,
hold on a second.

2317
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,188
Let me get
my cans on.

2318
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:10,195
OK.

2319
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,095
Ooh, you know what?
You know... Oh, man.

2320
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,098
Let me soak you in.

2321
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:14,361
Holy cow,
are you naked.

2322
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:15,595
You know what I like
about you?

2323
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:16,602
What?

2324
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:17,695
I like that you're
the perfect height.

2325
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:18,704
I could have sex
with you standing up.

2326
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,400
Look at that. Ooh.

2327
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:23,171
Robin:
Howard! You're married.

2328
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,768
I am? I mean, I am.

2329
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:26,108
Well, I'm not really
married anymore.

2330
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,147
What do you mean?

2331
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,579
Take a seat. I'll
Tell you what happened.

2332
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,810
My wife was suffering from cancer...
I never told you this...

2333
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:31,817
and she died last night.

2334
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:33,376
I've been single
for exactly 6 hours.

2335
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,251
Honey, if you're
up there now,

2336
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,257
I know you can hear me,
and you're at God's side,

2337
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,589
but I want you to cover
your ears and eyes.

2338
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,150
Besides, you're married
to God now...

2339
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,196
Your husband's
quite a character.

2340
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:46,825
Only on the radio.
It's just an act.

2341
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:49,836
Oh, oh, that's nice. No one's ever
touched me like this before.

2342
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:50,871
Let me ask you
something.

2343
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,064
You have the look
of love in your eyes,

2344
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,334
but I'm an ugly man.
I know this.

2345
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,171
You couldn't be physically
attracted to me, could you?

2346
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,802
Physically, I am.

2347
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,245
I mean, you're smart,
you're sexy.

2348
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,282
Wait. Excuse me
for one minute. Robin...

2349
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,476
I didn't say a thing.

2350
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:06,553
Robin, go up to the cafeteria
and get some lunch.

2351
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:07,849
Yeah, go ahead.
Tell me more about me.

2352
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:08,946
You're funny.

2353
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,787
You know what I would
do to you physically?

2354
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,156
What would you do?

2355
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,195
I don't know what I'd do,
but let me just say something.

2356
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,264
Whatever it is,
it would last 3 seconds.

2357
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,764
3 seconds,
I'd be finished.

2358
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,802
We would have sex, like,
10 times a day. You would love it.

2359
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,064
I kind of want to
wrap my legs around you.

2360
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:25,070
You do?

2361
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:31,036
The average radio listener
listens for 18 minutes.

2362
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:32,079
Mm-hmm.

2363
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:34,113
The average Howard Stern fan
listens for...

2364
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:35,409
are you ready for this?

2365
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:37,314
An hour and 20 minutes.

2366
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,511
How can that be?

2367
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:40,019
Answer
most commonly given:

2368
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:42,521
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

2369
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,023
All right, OK, fine.

2370
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:46,150
But what about the people
who hate Stern?

2371
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,218
Good point.
The average Stern hater...

2372
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,162
listens for
21/2 hours a day.

2373
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,969
Look, but if they hate him,

2374
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,368
why do they listen?

2375
01:32:57,438 --> 01:32:58,496
Most common answer:

2376
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,439
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

2377
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:02,339
- Kenny.
- Fucking twisted. What?

2378
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,537
You'd better listen to this.

2379
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,112
Howard: This is nice.
You wanna know something?

2380
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,613
This is
the God's honest truth.

2381
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,081
Come here.
I want to tell you closer.

2382
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,551
I am fully aroused right now.
I am totally engorged.

2383
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:13,517
Oh, my God.

2384
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:14,816
Naked Woman:
Well, after the show,

2385
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,722
why don't we go someplace else
and see how it feels?

2386
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:19,259
Really? That's great.

2387
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,827
You know why I love you?
'Cause you're smart.

2388
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,158
- And you're practically a virgin, right?
- [Telephone Buzzing]

2389
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,891
Practically.

2390
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:27,696
You have a sharp ass.

2391
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,668
I'm gonna be so honest
with you now.

2392
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:31,364
- I've never said this before.
- [Music Plays]

2393
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,168
I'm telling you,
I'm a full 21/2 inches,

2394
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,367
and I've never been 21/2...
What's the music?

2395
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,671
We're off the air.

2396
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:38,678
Are we off the air?

2397
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:42,113
Oh. Would you do me a favor?
Just stay right there, OK?

2398
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:43,980
What the hell's going on?
What are you doing, man?

2399
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,643
Look, Rushton told me,
this phone...

2400
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,518
Oh, come on, man.
Don't listen to Kenny.

2401
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:49,851
I'm just doing what
he told me, that's all.

2402
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,357
Shit, man, you don't
take me off the air

2403
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:52,392
in the middle
of a fucking bit.

2404
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,484
Come on.
Don't listen to Kenny.

2405
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,585
You're supposed
to listen to me.

2406
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:55,719
He's the boss.

2407
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,560
Forget it.
You believe this?

2408
01:33:58,599 --> 01:33:59,861
What the hell
are they doing?

2409
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,095
Yeah, hi.
Can I speak to Kenny?

2410
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:05,138
It's Howard over
in the air studio.

2411
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,206
Just hold the line.

2412
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,296
As soon
as they get him on,

2413
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,340
just keep him on the line.

2414
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:09,740
Fred, get me back
on the air.

2415
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,005
Just patch the phone call
onto the air, OK?

2416
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,479
Just put it right through
as soon as you can.

2417
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:15,708
Fuck, man.

2418
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:19,184
# Oh, the canvas
can do miracles #

2419
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:20,311
# Just you wait and see... #

2420
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,049
Patch it in.

2421
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:23,590
I said patch it in!

2422
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,589
Yes, Robin, he's
running in right now.

2423
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,757
Can I have the phone, please,
just for a second?

2424
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,356
Hi, Robin.
We back on the air?

2425
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,627
Robin: Yeah.
Everybody can hear.

2426
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,192
OK, I'm right outside
Pig Vomit's office.

2427
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:37,395
I'm gonna knock
on his door.

2428
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:38,403
All right.

2429
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:39,905
Hey, Pig Vomit.

2430
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,805
Come on, Kenny.
Why don't you open up?

2431
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:44,208
I want to know why
this guy had to cut my show off.

2432
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:45,438
Come on, Pig Vomit.

2433
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,707
Mr. Stern,
he's in a meeting.

2434
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,873
I'd like to know
what meeting

2435
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:49,108
is more important
than my show.

2436
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,480
He took the show
right off the air.

2437
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,849
What'd you take the show
off the air for, Pig Vomit? Huh?

2438
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,512
This isn't funny, Howard.

2439
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:55,520
Oh, it's not funny?

2440
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:56,920
What are you
talking about?

2441
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:58,015
I think
it's very funny.

2442
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,081
How would you know
what's funny, anyway?

2443
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,320
You're not bringing
that in here, Stern.

2444
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,022
I don't see anybody
in here in a meeting, do you?

2445
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,029
You gotta go.

2446
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:05,030
Why would I have to go?

2447
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:06,657
Why don't you explain
to my audience

2448
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:07,734
why you had to
shut down the show?

2449
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,325
I don't answer
to you, Stern.

2450
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:11,132
Yes, you do,
you big idiot scumbag.

2451
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,332
I'm your boss.
I'm your boss.

2452
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:14,396
Hey, what's this?

2453
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,204
Robin, it's everybody's
salary on his desk.

2454
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:18,540
God damn it,
get out of here!

2455
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,273
He hit me, Robin.
He's hitting me.

2456
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:21,279
Robin: Hit him back.

2457
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,248
I'm gonna
hit you back.

2458
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,114
I hit him back.
He hit...

2459
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,585
You're not getting
the phone from me, Kenny.

2460
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:27,586
Gimme the damn phone.

2461
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:28,622
No!

2462
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:29,621
Oh!

2463
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,884
Oh, my God, Robin.

2464
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:33,119
Kenny just hit himself
in the face. He's bleeding.

2465
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:34,161
Give that to me.

2466
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,593
Hey, come on.

2467
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:36,630
Oh!

2468
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,187
Robin: Oh, goodness,
what's going on?

2469
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:39,596
Vince just got hit
by Kenny.

2470
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:40,793
God damn it, Stern!

2471
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:43,200
You look! See that?!
Blood, Stern!

2472
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,965
- Are you OK?
- No!

2473
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:45,971
Broke my nose!

2474
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,302
It wasn't my fault.

2475
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,398
I'll sue your ass!

2476
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:49,476
Get out of here!

01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,826
Walk over there
and have a seat.

2486
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:15,300
Now, uh, Howard,
you know, uh...

2487
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:17,200
I admire you, you know?
I love what you do.

2488
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,465
I think
you're a pioneer.

2489
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:20,200
You're on the cutting edge
of radio entertainment.

2490
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,606
You and I both work
for NBC.

2491
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:23,643
You have
the radio show,

2492
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:25,336
I have the little
TV show here.

2493
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:27,209
How do you get along
with the folks here?

2494
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:28,373
You enjoying
the experience?

2495
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:29,848
I hate it at NBC, Dave.

2496
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,249
It's the worst. It sucks.
I gotta tell you something.

2497
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:33,616
All the management at NBC...

2498
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:36,281
bunch of creeps, and I'm not
afraid to say it right now,

2499
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:38,018
and, you know,
it's funny,

2500
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:40,652
because I know you feel
the same exact way I do about NBC

2501
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:42,593
because you told me on the phone
personally last week

2502
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:43,630
that you feel
the same way.

2503
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,892
I couldn't be happier.
Everything is fine.

2504
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:47,365
I don't understand
them at all.

2505
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:49,664
Now, Howard, let's get
back to the issue
of them being creepy.

2506
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,227
Now, when you say
they're creep...

2507
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:55,241
He makes us sound like
a bunch of idiots on the radio.

2508
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,243
He criticizes us
on television.

2509
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,541
I thought you were going
to control this guy.

2510
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:01,444
Oh, well,
we are, sir.

2511
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:04,780
In fact, we're designing
a more restrictive program

2512

- To make sure...

How are his numbers?

2514
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:10,656
The official ratings don't
come out until tomorrow,

2515
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:11,959
but we've got
some projections.

2516
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:17,489
Stern... has gone...

2517
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:21,501
from a 2.9 to a 5.6.

[Cough]

2522
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:33,278
Kind of weird,
you know?

2523
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,178
I thought there was
a mistake or something,

2524
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,878
but...
mm-mmm... no.

2525
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:42,821
My girlfriends think i'm crazy for
letting you behave like that on the air.

2526
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,824
What are you
talking about?

2527
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:46,325
You know what it is?
It's those yentas you hang around with.

2528
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:47,826
They're... they're
driving you crazy.

2529
01:37:47,895 --> 01:37:49,522
It's not yentas, Howard.
It's everybody.

2530
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:51,531
I can't even go... I can't
even get my hair done.

2531
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,089
I can't even walk in
and get my hair done

2532
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,499
without people looking at me like,
"Oh, God, that poor little thing."

2533
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:56,763
Then you know
what you gotta do?

2534
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:57,861
You gotta go to a different
hair shop or something.

2535
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,337
- Please!
- For God's sakes,

2536
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:00,930
If the place is driving
you crazy, don't go there.

2537
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:02,441
It's not that!
It's not that!

2538
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,669
God, no wonder they think
you're sleeping around!

2539
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:04,904
Look at me!
Look at me!

2540
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:06,446
- I'm disgusting!
- What about you?

2541
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:09,175
- You're not disgusting.
- Yes, I am! I look like a house!

2542
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,979
- I look like an elephant!
- You don't look like a house.

2543
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,746
- You do not. You look beautiful.
- I look like Babar!

2544
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,412
- You don't look like an elephant.
- I do.

2545
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:16,922
You don't look like Babar.
You look gorgeous.

2546
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,356
This is the most beautiful
you ever looked.

2547
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,619
You're carrying our baby.

01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:22,025
Come over here. You want to
sit down on this couch?

2549
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:24,030
You know what the problem is?
You're tired.

2550
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:25,224
I am tired.

Florence, Alabama.

Yeah. It's the number one
mall in Colbert County,

2788
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:41,076
and it's number 4
in the state,

2789
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,917
So, it's not
too bad, you know?

01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:47,358
Uh, I play golf
several times a week, you know?

2791
01:47:47,427 --> 01:47:50,419
Uh, but
I'll tell you,

2792
01:47:50,497 --> 01:47:53,557
if Howard would have
listened to me,

2793
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:57,262
I'd still be
up there in radio.

2794

I'll tell you
this much.

There ain't no God while
Howard Stern's walking the earth,

2811
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:47,979
I'll tell you that.

2812
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:49,043
I gotta go.

2813
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,990
