1
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,480
This is J.T.L. Morning News.

2
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,523
This is Holly Chadwick.

3
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,691
Thanks forjoining us.

4
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,277
We have a great show
in store for you this morning.

5
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, it's a great morning
to be in the studio.

6
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,365
Authorities have confirmed
an avian flu outbreak.

7
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,784
Forecast, cloudy skies...

8
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,869
Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.

9
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,122
This will be a different scenario

10
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,542
if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.

11
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,503
So, let's get started.

12
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,963
Yet again today,

13
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,050
another group of dolphins
became stranded.

14
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,220
CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

15
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,138
Are there any
real threats that you know of?

16
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,389
Not at all.

17
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,225
Environmentalists are trying

18
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,726
to determine the cause of death.

19
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,520
At alert level six,

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,730
W.H.O. guidelines for governments...

21
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,066
Your socks are so cutei I like them.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,484
Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,736
of people behaving strangely.

24
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,239
The U.N. health agency is not likely

25
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,574
to recommend official travel restrictions.

26
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,409
It's a little bit unsettling.

27
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,995
They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,413
They think it's just gonna go away.

29
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,873
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

30
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,418
Right on top of the man, beating him.

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,837
The man is bleeding.

32
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,672
Twenty-one confirmed cases.

33
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,842
All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

34
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,093
The subject growled at him

35
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,262
and continued to maul the victim.

36
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,431
The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U.K.

37
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,766
We don't know if this is spreading.

38
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,434
Rhythms of change...

39
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,520
So far there's no manifestation.

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,568
Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...

41
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,861
With that much
public at risk, we cannot...

42
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,947
They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.

43
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,298
Wake upi

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,926
Oh, creatures in our bed...

45
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,888
No sleepingi

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,557
Oh, you're getting very big.

47
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,560
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakesi

48
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,062
We got a lot more sunshine today.

49
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,481
You have to only say one word.

50
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,067
Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,402
Say a puppy.

52
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
A puppy.

53
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,405
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,990
Because that we can do.

55
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,245
Good morning. That looks yummy.

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,748
She gets the bigger one?

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,333
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,335
Did you pack your inhaler?

59
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,670
Bathroom sink.

60
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,089
- In a minute?
- Scootchi Go.

61
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,759
The government
has declared martial law.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,594
Daddy, what's martial law?

63
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,183
Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,604
Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,608
But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,859
Do you miss it?

67
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,448
No, I like my new job.

68
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,284
All you do is make pancakes
in the morningi

69
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,661
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

70
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,454
Look who I foundi

71
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,373
Here comes the number 12 train!

72
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,791
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

73
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,627
You want more pancakes?

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,545
Good.

75
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,048
Go, go, go. Come on, scootchi

76
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,883
- At least...
- Move it on out.

77
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,718
Heyi Plates in the sinki

78
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,012
- Lateri
- Do that when we get backi

79
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,396
Does it live in the jungle?

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,483
No.

81
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,859
Do you eat it on Sundays?

82
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,069
No.

83
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,030
Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

84
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,574
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

85
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,911
Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

86
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,538
- That's really grossi
- Grossi

87
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,706
Dadi

88
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,000
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

89
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,668
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?

90
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,003
Yes.

91
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,838
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.

92
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,090
You totally got onei

93
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,425
Why are there so many?

94
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,176
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

95
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,887
What is going on?

96
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,269
The World Health Organisation
has been

97
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,521
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies

98
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,025
that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.

99
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,111
Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...

100
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,696
Can we try BBC?

101
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,365
You're not British any more, baby.

102
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,950
You lost your accent a long time ago.

103
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,453
Except after two bottles of wine.

104
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,704
Am I British?

105
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,039
Yeah, your grandma is.

106
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,042
Heyi

107
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,462
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

108
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,546
Hold on, guys.

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,714
Daddy, be careful on the road.

110
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,466
It's okay, baby.

111
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,472
Can be transmitted between species

112
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,807
commonly from a bite
from an infected animal.

113
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,232
Our best recommendation is to stay
away from densely populated areas.

114
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,901
Hey, yoi You all right?

115
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,319
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

116
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,654
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?

117
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,239
No, man, I don't know anything.

118
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,783
It's crazy.

119
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,913
Gerry?

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,088

What are we doing?

123
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,348
That's our way out of here.

124
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,698
I want my blanketi

125
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,866
Baby, it's packed right now.

00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,284

129
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,968
Rachel, baby, you've got

- Baby, we need you in your seat.

- Connie?
- Are you okay? it's okay.

136
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,662
We should get out.

137
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,038
Everybody out of the car.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,049
We've got to get out of the city.

139
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,594
Her door won't openi
Rachel, go out that side.

140
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,181
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

Come on, honey. Come on.

144
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,196
Sweetheart, are you okay?

145
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,387
We got to get off the street.

146
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,481
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

147
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,899
I don't knowi

148
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,442
Get to the RV.

149
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,818
Subway Sami

150
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,655
Here comes
the number twelve train! One.

151
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,949
Two.

152
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,493
- What's happening?
- Three.

153
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,578
Four.

154
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
Five.

155
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,583
Six.

156
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,001
Seven.

157
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,003
Eight.

158
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,506
Nine.

159
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,633
Ten.

160
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,843
Eleven.

161
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,137
Twelve.

162
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,808
Train's in the station!

163
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,858
Watch outi

164
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,184
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!

165
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,894
Containment is a fail.

166
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,701
Try to relax.

167
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,578
Give yourself air.

168
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,413
In and out.

169
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,249
Come on, baby, try to relax.

170
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,627
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

171
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,754
Where's her spare?

172
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,632
I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

173
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,926
Do you want to be with her?

174
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,437
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

175
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,814
Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

176
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,609
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

177
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,944
You're gonna be all right.

178
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,781
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,909
Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

180
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,037
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

181
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,789
We gotta move.

182
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,833
Okay.

183
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,169
Good. Good. Look.

184
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,172
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

185
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,632
No, no, no, no...

186
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,258
You're gonna be all right.

187
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,094
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?

188
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,304
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

189
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,852
It's Thierry.

190
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,104
Where are you?

191
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,107
Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.

192
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,902
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

193
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,321
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.

194
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,864
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

195
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,158
What is this?

196
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,827
We don't know. How close were you?

197
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,286
Face to face.

198
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,830
Good, honey, good.

199
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,874
Daddy.

200
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,001
Connie, give me that.

201
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,837
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

202
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,130
Where are you?

203
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,339
95, heading north.

204
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,676
Okay. Okay.

205
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,929
All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.

206
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,014
I'll call you back with an extraction point.

207
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,225
Can you hold out for another hour?

208
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,810
Do we have a choice?

209
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,520
This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.

210
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,021
I'll need you.

211
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,982
I need you back.

212
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,150
Don't forget about us.

213
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,734
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

214
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,361
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

215
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,405
Okay.

216
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,491
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

217
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,673
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.

218
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,341
Take my hand.

00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,263
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

220

I'll meet you back here.

221
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,742
Stay close, honey.

222
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,088
What do you need?

223
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,591
Albuterol.

224
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,231
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

225
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,904
And this shit, too. it's magic for my kid.

226

Apartment buildings, 23rd.

252
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,782
If we can get to the roof,
can you get someone to us?

- Not tonight.

Sunrise.

We'll be on the roof with flares.

258
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,709

My mom's cooking everything

289
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,423
The following message

290
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,051
is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.

291
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,346
Authorities recommend
that the following actions

292
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,182
should be taken
by all the members of the public.

293
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,851
Stay indoors if at all possible.

294
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,063
Have enough food
and water supplies for sheltering

295
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,982
for one to two weeks.

296
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,693
The following message
is transmitted at the request

297
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,904
of the New Jersey State
Police Department.

298
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,865
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly

299
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,034
spreading across
the state of New Jersey.

300
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,412
She was crying.

301
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,546
Thanks, Tommy.

302
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,716
I used to work in dangerous places

303
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,928
and people who moved survived,
and those who didn't...

304
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,267
Movement is life.

305
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,605
You have a better chance
if you come with us.

306
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,325
You need anything else
before you leave?

307
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,413
Okay. Come on. Come on.

308
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,773
We should have left with them.

309
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,191
There is nowhere to go.

310
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,193
What's going to happen
when the food is gone?

311
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,953
Okay, come on.

312
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm scared.

313
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,211
Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

314
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,005
Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

315
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,340
Be ninja quiet.

316
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,884
Just a walk in the park.

317
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,512
How do we know they're coming?

318
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
They're coming.

00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,634
Cleared for take-off.

366
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,802
Tango five. Wilco.

367
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,989
Karin, to the right.

368
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,824
This is good, right?

369
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,493
Bunk bedsi

370
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,621
Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

371
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,164
Please make yourself at home.

372
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,582
You want to get up here?

373
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,253
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.

374
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,255
We're not dropping anchor again.

375
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,798
You're safe.

376
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,091
It's not me I'm worried about.

377
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,634
They're safe.

378
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,678
Baby.

379
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,473
It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

380
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,809
Need anything, Karin?

381
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,435
Water.

382
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,145
I'll organise.

383
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,816
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

384
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,695
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

385
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,321
Okay.

386
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,623
The President is dead.

387
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,669
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

388
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,131
Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

389
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,215
Your parties are panicking.

390
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,801
The bigger cities are the worst off.

391
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,846
The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

392
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,392
Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

393
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,186
Twenty seven knots south and closing.

394
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,480
How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

395
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,607
The provisional
government currently considers

396
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,026
northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

397
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,446
Have you recorded any instance where
a person was bitten but not infected?

398
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,870
How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

399
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,501
Sir, I cannot action that order.

400
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,337
Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

401
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,213
an evacuation for you or your men.

402
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,550
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

403
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,386
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

404
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,805
No gas for the winter or transportation.

405
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,183
No bullets to fight.

406
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,934
And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

407
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,519
The question
that we have got to address

408
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,854
is what the hell is it?

409
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,190
About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

410
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:16,069
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

411
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,406
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

412
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,242
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr Fassbach.

413
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,078
Virologist from Harvard.

414
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,705
The analogy I keep coming back to

415
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,123
is Spanish Flu.

416
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,666
Spanish Flu?

417
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,502
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

418
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,295
it killed 3% of the world.

419
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,007
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

420
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,842
You all read the same email I did,

421
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,761
and it said "zombies."

422
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,348
Are you completely out of your mind?

423
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,017
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

424
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,686
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

425
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,688
We haven't had contact with them since.

426
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,190
But this could lead us to the origin.

427
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,900
If we knew where this thing started,

428
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,112
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

429
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,031
So we send in Dr Fassbach
there to look for the source.

430
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,699
He's just a kid.

431
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,743
You're right.

432
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,037
Attention on decki

433
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,793
At easei

434
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,631
Mr Under-Secretary.

435
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,135
The Under-Secretary
here says you were

436
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,887
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

437
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,390
I want to send you in. With a team.

438
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,476
Help Dr Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

439
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,228
You brought...

440
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,021
I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

441
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,273
No.

442
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,152
Captain, I'm not your guy.

443
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,156
You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

444
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,243
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

445
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,288
Places you and I both know
Dr Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

446
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,540
Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

447
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,875
No.

448
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,960
My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

449
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,254
pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

450
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,173
We do the heavy lifting.

451
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,177
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

452
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,389
Take a look around here, Mr Lane.

453
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:13,269
Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

454
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,857
There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

455
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,609
There's a long line of people

456
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,402
waiting for one of those bunks.

457
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,907
You want to help your family,

458
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,659
let's figure out how we stop this.

459
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,370
It's your choice, Mr Lane.

460
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,872
Simple.

461
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,001
You don't work for them any more.

462
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,336
- Karin...
- You might not remember

463
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,671
what this job did to you, but I do.

464
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,590
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

465
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,716
I have to go.

466
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,594
They're going to kick us off the ship.

467
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,514
What?

468
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,059
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

469
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,978
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

470
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,273
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

471
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,319
Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything any more.

472
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,571
You keep this with you.

473
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,739
I'll call in once a day.

474
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,200
As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

475
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm coming back.

476
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,164
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

477
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,917
As we do.

478
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,585
Like we do.

479
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,266
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

480
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,476
I'm not a baby.

481
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,603
Okay.

482
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,106
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

483
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,526
I'll be back soon.

484
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,819
Yeah?

485
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,155
All right, tough guy...

486
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,949
Take care of the ladies for me?

487
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,117
Yeah.

488
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,326
Deal.

489
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,580
You're awesome.

490
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,797
Daddy's coming back.

491
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,701
This way, sir.

492
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,870
Look.

493
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,288
We don't know what we're walking into.

494
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,374
So we do what they say. Okay.

495
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,043
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

496
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,795
If things were to get crazy,

497
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,380
just focus on their boots,

498
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,881
focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

499
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,509
These guys are hammers.

500
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,302
And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

501
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,428
I heard that.

502
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,097
You were meant to.

503
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,224
So, you see something that's important,

504
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,476
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

505
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
Okay.

506
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,981
You think we're gonna find anything?

507
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,817
Yeah.

508
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,944
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

509
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,448
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

510
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,076
No one's better.

511
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,911
More creative.

512
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,497
But like all serial killers,

513
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,291
she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

514
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,502
What good are all those brilliant crimes

515
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,671
if no one takes the credit?

516
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,048
So she leaves crumbs.

517
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,843
Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

518
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,887
is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

519
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,432
Sometimes the thing you thought

520
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,144
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

521
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,188
turns out to be the chink in its armour.

522
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,319
And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

523
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,365
She's a bitch.

524
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,962
Attention. D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,

525
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,380
D.C. has gone dark.

526
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,299
The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

527
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:58,012
All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.

528
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,474
All non-essential personnel

529
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,226
given F-6 status
and in groups A through E

530
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,146
need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.

531
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,567
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando

532
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,069
should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.

533
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:20,284
I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status

534
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,369
need to report to the flight deck.

535
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,206
Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.

536
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,342
Mommy, is this dinner?

537
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,802
Yes, sweetheart.

538
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,720
Water here tastes funny.

539
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,931
It's jet fuel, young lady.

540
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,682
He's joking.

541
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,687
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

542
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,858
Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

543
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,204
Everybody wake up.

544
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,332
We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.

545
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,794
Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.

546
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,879
We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,

547
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,339
I've got to put us down.

548
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
So buckle up.

549
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,368
Hold up.

550
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,204
Keep your finger off the trigger.

551
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,254
Okay.

552
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,321
Fassbachi Waiti

553
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,283
Damn it.

554
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,081
Move backi

555
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,044
Friendlyi Friendlyi
Keep it down. Keep it down.

556
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,879
What is this? What happened to him?

557
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,297
He slipped. He's dead.

558
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,466
Come oni Come oni Let's goi Let's goi

559
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,401
Okay, I'm goodi

560
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,862
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.

561
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,031
- Holdi Clear.
- Hold.

562
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,451
I want an ammo count,
then you reload your magsi

563
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,577
Yes, siri

564
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,579
My boy who just died out there was 23.

565
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,706
He was 23.

566
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,042
You want to tell me why?

567
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,671
Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

568
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,881
What are you talking about?

569
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,758
He was supposed to be our best hope.

570
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,468
Well, he's not our best hope any more.

571
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,553
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

572
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,222
He didn't have to, you know.

573
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,556
None of them did.

574
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,809
We're trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

575
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,728
Well, shit happens.

576
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,440
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

577
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,984
How do we go about refuelling?

578
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,237
When I say so. And very carefully.

579
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,532
The noise, are they drawn to it?

580
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,326
Yeah. Sound draws them.

581
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,079
Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

582
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,581
Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

583
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,500
we tend to burn them when we can.

584
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,044
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.

585
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,588
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.

586
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,048
Bad?

587
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,261
- What about Houston?
- St Louis?

588
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,387
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?

589
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,763
Detroit?

590
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,015
Guys, I'll be honest with you...

591
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,143
I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

592
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,602
All right...

593
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,190
if the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

594
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,819
There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

595
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,362
It had the word "zombie" in it.

596
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,364
Do you know anything about it?

597
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,574
Yeah.

598
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,368
It was an email, not a memo.

599
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,872
Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

600
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,463
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

601
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,799
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

602
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,010
trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

603
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,430
Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

604
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,515
This colonel, is he around?

605
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,892
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

606
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,110
The guy who's shackled, do you know

607
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,987
who bit him, what bit him?

608
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,406
He was the base doctor.

609
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,160
He'd just returned from the field.

610
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,330
He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier

611
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,749
who had just gone AWOL
the week before.

612
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,418
Some villagers had found this guy

613
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,962
foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.

614
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,840
Then he tried to bite one of them.

615
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,051
They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.

616
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,942
That's all we know, except the doctor

617
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,112
comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

618
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,781
This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

619
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,032
No.

620
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,077
Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

621
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,203
No.

622
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,746
There's got to be records.

623
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,542
You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

624
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,422
Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

625
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,966
It's a shame you had to fly

626
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,051
all the way out here to figure that out.

627
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,723
How did you all escape this?

628
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,309
The expenditure of ammunition.

629
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,646
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

630
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,358
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

631
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,195
This fool stands right in the mix,

632
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,613
while seven or eight of them

633
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,574
turn Zeke all at the same time.

634
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,742
But they got no time
for Ol' Dirty Bastard here.

635
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,120
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

636
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,331
Got no time for his lucky ass.

637
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,083
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

638
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,420
The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

639
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,921
Five or 10 minutes.

640
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,341
Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

641
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,801
"Stevie?

642
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,263
"Captain Spekesi Oh, my Godi
My Godi Are they eating me?"

643
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,931
Who's that?

644
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,725
Waste no time on that freak.

645
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,185
He's C.l.A.

646
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,187
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

647
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,605
Davidson,

648
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,274
he turned in 10 minutes.

649
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,944
That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fansi

650
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,657
You're with the C.l.A.?

651
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,704
But they're not with me.

652
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,501
And who are you?

653
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,794
U.N.

654
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,796
Oh, my Godi

655
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,468
Captain, put on the World Musici

656
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,470
The day

657
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,889
is savedi

658
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,891
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

659
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,059
Why not?

660
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,393
Are they surviving this?

661
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,686
Indeed they are.

662
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,230
Using your guns.

663
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,149
Guns are half-measures.

664
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:50,651
How then?

665
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,238
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

666
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,325
in less than 24 hours.

667
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,829
The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

668
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,748
It's brilliant.

669
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,416
No teeth,

670
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,669
no bite.

671
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,921
No great spread.

672
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Bullshit.

673
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,010
More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

674
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,012
Now, why do you have to burn them

675
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,098
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

676
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,724
Why do they move like a plague?

677
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,434
Why is lsrael winning?

678
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,187
How is lsrael winning?

679
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,190
They sealed off their entire country

680
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,902
days before the undead attacked man.

681
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,696
First to know,

682
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,698
first to act.

683
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,117
People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

684
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,869
Right. Yeah, but,

685
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,579
finish all those

686
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,374
thousands of years of work a week ago?

687
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,710
Impeccable timing is all.

688
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,048
You want answers?

689
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,719
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

690
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,765
That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

691
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,268
You ever seen anything like that?

692
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,561
Hell, no.

693
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,106
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

694
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,739
Oh, hang on.

695
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,574
Hang on a minute.

696
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,909
Hello?

697
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,620
Gerry?

698
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,498
- Honey?
- Gerry, can you hear me?

699
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,624
Karin?

700
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,626
Hello?

701
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,423
God damn iti

702
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,143
Give me your hand.

703
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,855
No way. No.

704
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,190
My mother. Dallas.

705
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,776
Probably pacing a hole
in the floor right now if she's still there.

706
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,487
Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

707
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,031
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

708
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,117
Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

709
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,287
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

710
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,539
Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

711
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,707
pointed towards the sun.

712
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,835
Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

713
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,629
Tell me 10 more times.

714
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,172
- You good?
- Right here.

715
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,299
All right. Don't rush.

716
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,677
We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

717
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,930
If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

718
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,056
just get Zeke on the ground.

719
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,142
Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just finei"

720
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,228
Let's go, lights outi

721
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,792
Alpha in position.

722
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,919
Bravo moving out.

723
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,422
Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.

724
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,591
So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.

725
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,052
Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,

726
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,513
and that's quietly.

727
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,127
Shiti

728
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,920
God damn iti Shut that thing offi

729
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,051
Looks like we just woke the dead.

730
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,304
Out of respect for others,

731
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,055
please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.

732
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,727
We got to move.

733
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,396
We've got to get out of here, let's movei

734
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,112
Go, go, goi

735
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,373
I'm gonna clear a path through Zekei

736
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,750
You pedal like helli

737
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,088
Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!

738
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,757
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!

739
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,297
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

740
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,801
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.

741
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,471
It's all right, boys. I got this one.

742
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,642
- God damn it.
- We got enoughi

743
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,019
We need to detach the fuel linei

744
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,815
lsrael better pay off.

745
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,577
All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

746
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,828
You'll have to talk me through it.

747
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,165
Okay, we're clear.

748
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,709
Okay. Give me all the lights.

749
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,546
Switch on the anti-icing.

750
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,964
- Where?
- The red knob.

751
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,341
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.

752
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,511
- We got to movei
- Set flaps 15 degrees.

753
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,013
Flaps 15.

754
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,515
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of herei

755
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,352
Make it steep.

756
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,832
- Gerry?
- Hi, baby.

757
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,958
Hi. Hi.

758
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,962
I tried to call you.

759
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,381
I know, I was...

760
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,092
it was bad timing, I was running around.

761
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,386
Are you okay?

762
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,101
Yeah, everything's okay. I'm okay.

763
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,271
That's the spirit.

764
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,939
Yeah.

765
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,067
Listen...

766
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,902
Korea didn't work out.

767
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,532
Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to lsrael.

768
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,743
Try to get some rest on the flight.

769
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,245
How are the kids?

770
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,084
I think...

771
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,254
They're really... They're good.

772
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,924
I got Connie right here.

773
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,436
Baby?

774
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,956
Attention, unidentified aircraft.

775
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,292
You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.

776
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,962
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

777
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,089
Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.

778
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,675
Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

779
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,969
Special Envoy, United Nations.

780
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:09,274
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

781
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,247
The problem with most people is that

782
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,041
they don't believe
something can happen

783
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,210
until it already has.

784
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,378
It's not stupidity or weakness.

785
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,089
It's just human nature.

786
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,594
How did you know?

787
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,387
Gerald Lane.

788
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,098
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

789
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,894
about his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.

790
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,856
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

791
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,235
Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

792
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,195
No nose for profit.

793
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,239
How did lsrael know?

794
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,243
We intercepted a communique
from an lndian general

795
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,037
saying they were
fighting the Rakshasha.

796
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,748
Translation, zombies.

797
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,417
Technically undead.

798
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,547
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

799
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,091
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

800
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:03,221
Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

801
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,808
And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

802
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,102
that mentions the word "Zombie"?

803
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:14,107
Well, when put like that,
I'd be sceptical as well.

804
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,734
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

805
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,404
they could be sent
to concentration camps.

806
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,950
In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be
massacred in the Olympics.

807
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,496
In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

808
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,332
and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

809
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:36,838
Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

810
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,674
So we decided to make a change.

811
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,093
A change?

812
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,761
The Tenth Man.

813
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,265
If nine of us
look at the same information

814
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,893
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

815
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,645
it's the duty of the tenth
man to disagree.

816
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,481
No matter how improbable it may seem,

817
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,609
the tenth man has to start digging

818
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,028
on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

819
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,615
And you were that tenth man.

820
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,366
Precisely.

821
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:16,336
Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

822
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,505
I began my investigation
on the assumption

823
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:24,052
that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

824
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,304
Was patient zero from lndia?

825
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,139
That's the problem.

826
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,766
There's so many
potential sources in play

827
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,643
that no one knows where it began.

828
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,520
The organ trade in Germany.

829
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,733
Strange examples of violent behaviour
across the Asian peninsulas.

830
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,363
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

831
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,533
These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

832
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,911
Two of 10 portals

833
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,747
through the security perimeter
into fortified lsrael.

834
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,253
You're letting people in.

835
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,882
Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

836
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,426
It's okay.

837
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,914
If I could get into lndia, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

838
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,791
India's a black hole.

839
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,793
Forget about patient zero.

840
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,463
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

841
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,303
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

842
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,555
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.

843
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,766
All you can do is find a way to hide.

844
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,482
Get troops down there.

845
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,163
It's too loudi it's too loudi

846
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,877
They're coming over the topi

847
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,307
Shiti

848
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,734
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

849
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,583
She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your planet

850
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,271
Wrong wayi Wrong wayi

851
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,733
Go to landing point B.

852
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:10,862
Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

853
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,651
Hawk 5, almost there.

854
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,738
Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.

855
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,990
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.

856
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,660
The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.

857
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,343
One thousand one.

858
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:40,594
One thousand two.

859
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,764
One thousand three. One thousand four.

860
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,433
One thousand five.

861
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,935
One thousand six.

862
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:49,895
One thousand seven.

863
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,565
One thousand eight.

864
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:57,778
We got to move.

865
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:04,952
You'll be all right.

866
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,955
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turni

867
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,792
We got to move.

868
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:13,627
We got to movei

869
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,074
Chopper 5 is down.

870
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,658
I say again, chopper 5 is down.

871
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,494
LZ is overrun.

872
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:51,374
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

873
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,918
Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.

874
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,211
Good luck out there.

875
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,363
Noi

876
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,701
Therei That onei

877
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,668
Stop. Stop.

878
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,064
Goi Goi

879
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,370
Get them out of herei

880
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,295
Stay calm, please. Stay calm.

881
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:31,390
Come on. Go, go, go.

882
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,398
What's your destination?

883
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,442
I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

884
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,088
I'm Gerry, by the way.

885
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,507
Segen.

886
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:30,551
Segen.

887
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,720
First or last?

888
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,389
Just Segen.

889
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,724
So, what we're doing,

890
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,601
we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

891
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,768
Okay?

892
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:45,858
You okay? Okay?

893
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,280
Okay.

894
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,201
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

895
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,079
Here we go.

896
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,082
We're almost there.

897
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,377
Okay. Big breaths.

898
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,422
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

899
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,549
Here we go.

900
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,056
Come on. Good.

901
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,059
Last step. Last step.

902
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,769
Big breath.

903
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:26,398
Good job. There it is. Okay.

904
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,613
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

905
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,785
Very good. Okay.

906
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,412
You a doctor?

907
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:41,914
No.

908
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,916
I've had some training in the field.

909
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,960
How did you know?

910
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,172
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

911
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,924
I didn't.

912
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,472
Now I'm just a liability.

913
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,559
This fool

914
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,020
stands right in the mix,

915
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:06,188
while seven or eight of them

916
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,190
turn Zeke all at the same time.

917
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,442
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

918
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,612
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

919
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,615
Got no time for his lucky ass.

920
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:20,411
Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs

921
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,204
for the clues they are.

922
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,291
And sometimes the thing you thought

923
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,461
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

924
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,507
turns out to be the chink in its armour.

925
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,134
I don't have answers.

926
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,973
All you can do is find a way to hide.

927
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,324
Gerry?

928
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,826
Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?

929
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:01,994
I love you. I'm sorry.

930
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,162
But you've got to get Thierry now.

931
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,329
I'll find him.

932
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,293
- Thierryi Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.

933
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,753
Gerry needs you. I love you.

934
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,839
Gerry? Where are you?

935
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,174
On the last flight out.

936
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,301
Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

937
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,470
You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

938
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:22,222
A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

939
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,516
- And the closest airport to it.
- I don't understand.

940
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,268
No time to explain.

941
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,478
Just make it happen, man.

942
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,729
Okay, okay.

943
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,024
But Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

944
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,114
Well, go and find out what he needs.

945
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,576
You're gonna want to take this.

946
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,412
Take it.

947
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:58,801
Your battery is dead.

948
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,013
We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

949
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,057
Your people directed us.

950
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:08,101
There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

951
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,729
but they are not sure
it's still operational.

952
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:12,064
This is location.

953
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,899
Can we make it?

954
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,993
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.

955
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,454
I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach

956
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,206
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.

957
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,000
All European airports
are under lockdown.

958
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:36,171
But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.

959
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,924
We will be allowed to disembark.

960
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,261
We are very, very lucky.

961
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,121
Hey. Who do you belong to?

962
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,960
What's there?

963
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,045
What is it?

964
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:00,505
You... Bags.

965
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,717
We need trolley and bags.

966
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,561
Mayday, mayday, maydayi
Bravo 160 heavy.

967
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,146
Emergency descenti

968
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,029
Prepare for impact.

969
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,656
Got to move.

970
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:38,450
Got to move.

971
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,452
Got to move.

972
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,559
Come on, come on.

973
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,374
Give me something good.

974
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,835
Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

975
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,212
Lane is M.l.A. I'm sorry, sir.

976
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,730
Chopper inbound for
immediate relocation.

977
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:32,981
I say again.

978
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,650
All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status

979
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:38,278
need to report for immediate relocation.

980
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:42,073
Ma'am?

981
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,950
Thierry would like a word with you.

982
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,375
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

983
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,128
He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

984
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:59,090
Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

985
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:01,259
Yes, sir. I understand.

986
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:08,016
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

987
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,285
Daddy!

988
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,495
Daddyi

989
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,189
You're a tough bastard.

990
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,565
And a lucky one.

991
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,692
Who are you?

992
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,655
I came here with a... With a woman.

993
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,781
Is she still...

994
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,287
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

995
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,210
Why do you keep looking at him?

996
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,880
'Cause he's the one in charge.

997
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:49,427
You know what this place is?

998
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,888
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

999
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,474
Then you understand
how this must look to us.

1000
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:56,976
This

1001
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,562
is important to you?

1002
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,857
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.

1003
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,192
Give me the phone.

1004
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:05,735
Just give me the phone.

1005
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,112
Give me the God damn phonei
Give me the phonei

1006
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,156
As soon as you answer my question.

1007
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,159
Call it.

1008
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,496
Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

1009
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,633
Gerry?

1010
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,261
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- My God.

1011
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,346
We thought you were dead.

1012
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:34,973
Gerry, where are you?

1013
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,141
Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

1014
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,018
They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.

1015
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,436
Of course.

1016
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,522
This is Thierry Umutoni.

1017
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,191
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

1018
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,360
To whom am I speaking?

1019
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,112
Where's Karin?

1020
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,655
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

1021
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,204
I'm sorry, Gerry.

1022
01:21:58,664 --> 01:21:59,998
I did what I could.

1023
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:03,876
What does that mean?

1024
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,503
You've got to calm down.
No, stopi Stop.

1025
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,422
You're going to hurt yourself.

1026
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,150
You're okay.

1027
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,530
His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

1028
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,408
I'm sure they'll be safe.

1029
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:39,495
Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

1030
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:40,747
Yeah.

1031
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,915
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

1032
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,086
I understand how you feel.

1033
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,005
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.

1034
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,923
Do you have a family?

1035
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,343
- No.
- No.

1036
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,012
Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

1037
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,557
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

1038
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,062
Rather, I lost my son to

1039
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,524
something that had once been my wife.

1040
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,280
We have all lost someone, Mr Lane.

1041
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,367
In your case, there is hope at least.

1042
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:18,868
I'm sorry.

1043
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:21,871
I'm sorry.

1044
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,373
Now,

1045
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,125
why did you come here?

1046
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,128
What do you need from us?

1047
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,547
Your worst disease.

1048
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,178
He wants a what?

1049
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,971
Deadly pathogen.

1050
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,182
With a high mortality rate.

1051
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:44,143
- But curable.
- Okay, well, um...

1052
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,646
You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

1053
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:47,980
I would think. Typhus?

1054
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,274
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

1055
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,484
Rocky Mountain Fever.

1056
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,320
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

1057
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:58,574
Mr Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

1058
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,286
I would give you points
for originality, Mr Lane,

1059
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,288
if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.

1060
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:10,002
One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

1061
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,295
A functioning circulatory system.

1062
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,840
I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

1063
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,591
You can't make a dead person sick.

1064
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,636
It's not for them.

1065
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,847
It's for us.

1066
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,017
I believe these things have a weakness.

1067
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,645
And that weakness is weakness.

1068
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:29,480
Our weakness.

1069
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,275
I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

1070
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,153
Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

1071
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,197
I think, because those people were sick.

1072
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,116
I think they were terminal.

1073
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,701
And these things could sense it.

1074
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,036
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

1075
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,830
and they need a healthy host.

1076
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:48,166
But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

1077
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,376
with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.

1078
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,379
It's not a cure. it's camouflage.

1079
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,384
It's camouflage.

1080
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,766
There's a natural precedent.

1081
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,519
Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

1082
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:11,355
Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

1083
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,566
would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

1084
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,945
You understand the only way to prove
this theory of yours is

1085
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,906
for some idiot to infect themselves

1086
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,908
with a lethal pathogen and then...

1087
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,995
...meet with her, face to face.

1088
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,333
Yes.

1089
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,169
Do we have what we need to try it?

1090
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:34,420
We have all he could want.

1091
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,840
Typhus, H1 N1, SARS.

1092
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:39,967
The problem is,

1093
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,220
they're all stored in B-Wing.

1094
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,931
What's the matter with B-Wing?

1095
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,477
Dr Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.

1096
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:53,523
Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

1097
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,775
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

1098
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,239
Unfortunately...

1099
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:07,119
This is B-Wing now.

1100
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,878
God damn it.

1101
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,384
How many?

1102
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,594
How many are there?

1103
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,388
There were 80 people working there.

1104
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,978
I've never seen them move like that.

1105
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,354
They're dormant.

1106
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,857
They're awaiting stimulus.

1107
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,942
Now, this

1108
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,319
is vault 139.

1109
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,697
That's where your samples would be.

1110
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:47,034
This is the skybridge.

1111
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,829
That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

1112
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:55,167
And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

1113
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:56,419
So,

1114
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,089
what do you propose, Mr Lane?

1115
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,606
You are not serious.

1116
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:20,026
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

1117
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,445
We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

1118
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:25,448
Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

1119
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,535
Each has its merits.

1120
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,876
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.

1121
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,254
Let's go.

1122
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:43,966
Try not to kill one.

1123
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:49,055
It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

1124
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:51,349
Yeah.

1125
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,867
You sure you want to do this?

1126
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,662
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

1127
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,622
Good luck.

1128
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,583
See you all shortly.

1129
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:23,923
Good luck.

1130
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:31,263
If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

1131
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,474
- Understood?
- Okay.

1132
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,497
There they are.

1133
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,454
Go, go.

1134
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,221
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1135
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,973
Come oni

1136
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,831
They're fine. They're fine.

1137
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,408
Shit.

1138
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,934
The vault we need is in 139.

1139
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:04,805
Goi

1140
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:10,644
Oh, my God.

1141
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,569
Left, left, lefti

1142
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:21,530
What are you doing?

1143
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,365
She'll get you to the vault.

1144
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:36,855
That's the vault.

1145
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,315
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.

1146
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,319
We can't make it. Let's goi

1147
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:09,138
They're not gonna make it.

1148
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:10,681
You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

1149
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,266
They're not alone, we can't open iti

1150
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,684
They are coming backi

1151
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:17,354
We can't leave them there.

1152
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,231
Come oni

1153
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,235
Open the doori

1154
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:26,905
- Runi
- Runi

1155
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,575
Runi Faster, come oni

1156
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:30,826
Runi

1157
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,579
In, in, ini

1158
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,378
Come oni

1159
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:43,922
Now where is Gerry?

1160
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,427
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

1161
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:52,055
Come on, come on, where are you?

1162
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,464
5-6-9-6-4.

1163
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,093
5-6-9-6-4.

1164
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,582
What happened to Gerry?

1165
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:58,015
Not that one. Not that one.

1166
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,503
Oh, shiti

1167
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:29,880
Shiti

1168
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,320
Jesus.

1169
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,739
He's going to inject himself.

1170
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,955
We have no idea
which one's going to work.

1171
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:06,416
We don't know if any of them will work.

1172
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:09,461
If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

1173
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:11,797
he's dead anyway.

1174
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,990
What's he doing?

1175
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:31,793
How long does he have to wait?

1176
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:34,796
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

1177
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:37,549
that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

1178
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:29,828
Look at them.

1179
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,934
He just walked right past himi

1180
01:43:58,733 --> 01:43:59,858
He walked right past himi

1181
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,193
Like it was nobodyi

1182
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:13,890
Okay.

1183
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,773
This isn't the end.

1184
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,784
Not even close.

1185
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:17,078
Hi, there. This is...

1186
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:18,747
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?

1187
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,665
Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.

1188
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,834
We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.

1189
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:24,502
We've lost entire cities.

1190
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:27,172
When there's
no more people left to infect,

1191
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:29,174
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.

1192
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:30,717
The World Health Organisation

1193
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:32,677
reports today that help may soon...

1194
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:34,512
...a hybridized meningitis strain

1195
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:37,140
with components of smallpox and H1N1 .

1196
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:38,600
We still don't know how it started.

1197
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,643
The World Health Organisation
has created

1198
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:43,605
a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,

1199
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:47,150
making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.

1200
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:48,693
We bought ourselves some time.

1201
01:46:48,778 --> 01:46:51,196
Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine

1202
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,281
to areas that have been cordoned off.

1203
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:56,117
Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...

1204
01:46:56,202 --> 01:46:57,577
The importance
of getting the information

1205
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,788
out to those still alive
within the quarantine...

1206
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,415
But it's given us a chance.

1207
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:20,725
If you can get to a colder area,

1208
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:22,727
to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.

1209
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:26,022
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.

1210
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:30,902
lnitial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.

1211
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:37,909
Others have found a way to push back.

1212
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,288
Move, movei All right, juice 'em upi

1213
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:53,258
Approaching target.
Permission to engage.

1214
01:47:53,592 --> 01:47:54,676
Permission granted.

1215
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,845
All clear. Light 'em up. Light 'em up.

1216
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,473
It's permanent!

1217
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:03,685
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!

1218
01:48:03,853 --> 01:48:05,854
There's no forgiveness in hell!

1219
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:09,566
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!

1220
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:12,777
This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.

1221
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,738
If you can fight, fight.

1222
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,990
Head north if you can.

1223
01:48:17,283 --> 01:48:20,034
Hello?
ls there anyone out there hearing this?

1224
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,327
Help each other.

1225
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:24,372
Mexico City has been
declared a complete loss.

1226
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:35,341
Be prepared for anything.

1227
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,849
Our war has just begun.
