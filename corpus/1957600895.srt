00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,900
-JIM

00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:07,934
GET UP!

3
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:11,734

00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,767
GET UP!

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,433
-GET UP!

6
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:29,467
-UGH! OHH, UGH... HMMM...

7
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:38,066
NARRATOR:<i> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</i> <i>MR. JIM GAFFIGAN.</i>

8
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,233
-WHOO!

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
WHOO-OO! EEE!

10
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,400
EEEE!

11
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,333
EEE!

12
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,934
EEE!

13
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,367
EEEEE!

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,734
EEE!

15
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,533
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT STOP IT.

16
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,867
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ON DRUGS.

17
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,533
OH, HERE'S A PILL FELLA.

18
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,600
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE SO PALE.

19
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,600
OH, THAT SHIRT LOOKS LIKE A TABLECLOTH.

20
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,500
IS THAT A SHIRT OR A BLOUSE?

21
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:25,834
I THINK HE'S WEARING

22
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,333
HIS MOTHER'S BLOUSE.

23
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,266
HIS PANTS LOOK DIRTY.

24
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,867
I WONDER IF HE'S WEARING A THONG.

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
I DIDN'T WONDER THAT AND NOW I DO.

26
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,200
IS THIS ALL HE DOES?

27
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,867
THIS IS WEIRD.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,166
I CAN BARELY HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING.

29
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,200
IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE IN CHICAGO.

30
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,100
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT, APPRECIATE IT.

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,900
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.

32
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,266
I GUESS I SHOULD OPEN UP.

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,166
I'LL TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF.

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,233
I AM KOREAN.

35
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,233
I COME FROM THE COUNTRY OF KOREA.

36
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,734
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR, HOW DO YOU SAY, ONE DAY.

37
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,233
ACTUALLY I WISH I WAS KOREAN, CAUSE THEN MY INTEREST IN

38
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,233
ASIAN WOMEN WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED SO CREEPY.

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,700
HE LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

40
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,100
HE LOOKS LIKE A MORMON.

41
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,867
WHAT'S WRONG WITH

42
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,200
LOOKING LIKE A MORMON?

43
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,266
ACTUALLY, I ONLY DATED ONE ASIAN GIRL.

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,533
BUT SHE WAS VERY ASIAN.

45
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,600
SHE WAS A PANDA.

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,900
HEY, I LIKE PANDAS.

47
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,166
THEY'RE ENDANGERED FELLA.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,400
YOU AND YOUR GIRL SHIRT.

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,900
NOT KOREAN.

50
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,066
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT ME.

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,166
BUT BOTH MY PARENTS WERE WHITE.

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,033
I THINK ONE OF THEM WAS A POLAR BEAR.

53
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,166
THAT'S WHY HE WENT OUT WITH A PANDA.

54
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,900
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE DOING

55
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,100
BEAR JOKES.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,066
HE'S DOING A BIG SPECIAL.

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,166
HE'S DOING JOKES ABOUT BEARS.

58
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,100
SEEMS WEIRD TO ME.

59
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,066
HE LOOKS LIKE HE EATS A LOT OF CANDY.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,667
I DO LOVE FOOD.

61
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,700
I EVEN ENJOY WATCHING PEOPLE MAKE FOOD.

62
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,000
BUT YOU EVER NOTICE THE FOOD NETWORK IS FAR MORE

63
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,066
INTERESTING WHEN YOUR HUNGRY?

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,767
WHEN YOU'RE FULL YOU'RE LIKE, THIS IS STUPID.

65
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,266
BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY THE FOOD NETWORK'S LIKE PORN.

66
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,834
YOU'RE LIKE, OH YEAH.

67
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,233
WHIP IT UP BABY.

68
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,066
MAKE IT FOR ME.

69
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,567
IT IS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING WHEN SOMEONE CATCHES YOU

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
WATCHING THE FOOD NETWORK.

71
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,934
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

72
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,166
UH-UH THE FOOD NETWORK.

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,700
WELL WHY ARE YOUR PANTS OFF?

74
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,533
I LIKE FOOD.

75
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,834
A LOT.

76
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:21,834
I DO LOVE FOOD.

77
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,934
I LIKE TO EAT LATE AT NIGHT, TOO.

78
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,033
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT LATE AT NIGHT.

79
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:29,266
THEN AGAIN YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK BOOZE IN THE MORNING.

80
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,066
AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SMOKED CRACK.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
WHATEVER.

82
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,166
I'M NOT TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPICS.

83
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,700
SORRY, AFTER AN ENTIRE HOUR OF WORK I WANT TO UNWIND WITH A

84
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,767
BURGER AND A CRACK PIPE.

85
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,000
IF I DO THAT EVERY NIGHT DOES THAT MAKE ME SOME CRACKHEAD?

86
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,333
THIS GUY'S A CRACKHEAD.

87
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,900
THAT'S WHY HE'S SO PALE.

88
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:57,033
HE'S THE FATTEST CRACKHEAD I'VE EVER SEEN.

89
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,600
I HAVE GAINED SOME WEIGHT.

90
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,033
BUT MOST OF THIS IS A STOMACH IMPLANT.

91
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,433
CASE  YOU ALL REGRET IT, LIKE WHEN I'M TALKING TO A

92
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,834
WOMAN AND I'LL CATCH HER STARING AT MY BELLY.

93
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,667
I'LL BE LIKE, HELLO, I'M UP HERE.

94
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,500
NOT SOME PIECE OF FLAB FOR YOU OOGLE AT.

95
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,567
I DON'T CARE IF I'M IN A TUBE TOP AND I'M RUBBING COCOA

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,567
BUTTER, WHILE I'M RIDING A UNICYCLE,

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,166
GOING LA, LA, LA, LA!

98
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,533
THAT WAS THE WORST IMPRESSION OF A

99
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,233
UNICYCLE I'VE EVER SEEN.

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,400
IT'S LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

101
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,166
I'M STARTING TO REALIZE I'M A PIG.

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,233
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A PIG WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING THAT TASTES

103
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,500
HORRIBLE BUT YOU DON'T NOTICE TIL THE LAST BITE.

104
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,867
WELL THIS WASN'T EVEN GOOD.

105
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,100
I GOTTA EAT SOMETHING ELSE, GET RID OF THAT FLAVOR.

106
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,033
YOU EVER EAT SO MUCH A FEEL SICK?

107
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,266
ISN'T THAT THE BEST?

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,166
THEN YOU FEEL LIKE A REAL AMERICAN.

109
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,033
OH, THAT WAS STRANGELY PATRIOTIC.

110
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:10,734
WEIRD.

111
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,734
I'M A PIG.

112
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,100
EVER GET HUNGRY WATCHING A COMMERCIAL?

113
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,233
AND THEN YOU REALIZE IT'S A COMMERCIAL FOR DOG FOOD?

114
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,233
HM, THOSE ARE SAVORY CHUNKS OF BEEF.

115
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,033
RICH, CREAMY--

116
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:27,200
WAIT WHY ARE THEY GIVING IT TO THE DOG?

117
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,100
OH NO.

118
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,533
THANK GOD FOR PACKAGING.

119
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,200
I LOVE PACKAGING.

120
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,066
PACKAGING'S LIKE THE CLOTHING OF FOOD, ISN'T IT?

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
OH, WHAT ARE WEARING THERE COOKIE?

AND THE FANCIER THE FOOD, THE MORE ELABORATE THE PACKAGING.

126
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,066
YOU EVER SEE GENERIC CEREAL?

127
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,033
IT COMES IN A PLASTIC BAG.

128
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:00,734
LIKE IT'S HOMELESS.

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,233
OH WE SHOULD FIND YOU A BOX TO LIVE IN.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
LIVING IN A BAG ON THE BOTTOM SHELF.

131
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:13,367
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

132
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,100
I BUY THE GENERICS.

133
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,233

I GET ALL MY GROCERIES FROM SHARPER IMAGE.

SKYMALL.

138
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:33,233
NO ONE BUYS ANYTHING FROM SKYMALL.

139
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,500
HEY BUDDY, I WORK FOR SKY MALL.

BUT I GUESS I'LL JOIN.

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,066

THEY'RE BAGGING MY GROCERIES.

TALK ABOUT FEELING LAZY.

165
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,166
HEY THANKS FOR PUTTING MY GROCERIES IN MY BAG.

YEAH, I COULD HELP BUT I'LL JUST WATCH.

167
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,934
I'M EXHAUSTED FROM PICKING THAT CRAP OUT.

168
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,667
YOU WANT TO COME HOME AND WATCH ME EAT THEM?

169
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,100
I'M LOOKING FOR A BUDDY.

170
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,867
THIS GUY TALKS A LOT ABOUT FOOD.

171
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,500
BUT REALLY WE'RE A COUNTRY THAT LOVES FOOD.

172
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,500
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

173
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,700
ONCE A WEEK ON THE NEWS THERE'S A

174
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,934
PIECE ON AMERICAN OBESITY.

175
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,400
THEY ALWAYS SHOW A BIG GUY WALKING.

176
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,100
THEY'LL BLOCK OUT HIS FACE.

177
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,000
BUT THAT GUY KNOWS IT'S HIM.

178
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:17,233
WELL THAT SHIRT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

179
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,433
OH, CRAP.

180
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,266
CAN'T WEAR THAT SHIRT AGAIN.

181
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,200
POOR GUY GETS TO WORK, HEY BILL SAW YOUR

182
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,600
FAT ASS ON THE NEWS.

183
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,166
OH, I KNOW.

184
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,200
WE'RE NEVER SATISFIED WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD.

185
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,500
YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE GOOD ON THIS BURGER?

186
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,900
A HAM SANDWICH.

187
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,900
INSTEAD OF A BUN LET'S

188
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,900
USE TWO DOUGHNUTS!

189
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,166
THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE IT

190
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
FOR BREAKFAST.

191
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,633
LOOK OUT MCGRIDDLE, HERE COMES THE DOUGHNUT HAM HAMBURGER!

192
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,500
YOU GUYS LAUGH, BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE AT DUNKIN'

193
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,567
DONUTS GOING, THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

194
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,033
THEN WE CAN HAVE THE DIET DOUGHNUT HAM HAMBURGER.

195
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,266
CAUSE WE NEED THE VARIETY.

196
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,166
I BOUGHT SOME PEANUT BUTTER RECENTLY.

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,767
THERE WAS CREAMY, CHUNKY, EXTRA CHUNKY, AND NOW EXTREME

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER.

199
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,834
I BOUGHT THE EXTREME CHUNKY.

200
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,433
I OPENED IT UP.

201
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,433
IT WAS JUST PEANUTS.

202
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:27,100
THAT IS EXTREME, TRYING TO SPREAD THAT STUFF.

203
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,533
AW, THIS IS RADICAL!

204
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
THOSE EXTREME PRODUCTS, YOU FEEL LIKE A COWARD EATING THE

205
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,400
REGULAR STUFF.

206
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,867
HEY CHECK OUT THAT PUSS EATING THE REGULAR DORITOS.

207
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,166
CAN'T HANDLE THE EXTREME ONES.

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,100
I'M WORKING MY WAY--

209
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,667
YOU GOT SERVED SUCKER!

210
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,934
THAT JOKE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

211
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,266
HE'S WEIRD.

212
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,900
WE WANT OUR FOOD FAST, DON'T WE?

213
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,600
THAT'S WHY WE REALLY LOVE THOSE VALUE MEALS.

214
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,734
JUST HAVE TO SAY A NUMBER.

215
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,700
TWO!

216
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,233
SOON YOU WON'T HAVE TO SPEAK.

217
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,433
IT'LL JUST BE A NOISE.

218
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,100
EH!

219
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,433
EHHHH!

220
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,233
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SUPERSIZE IT.

221
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,066
WE NEED OUR FOOD FAST. THAT'S THE REAL APPEAL OF CHINESE

222
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,066
FOOD, YOU KNOW?

223
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,600
BUT CHINESE FOOD ALMOST COMES TOO QUICKLY.

224
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,900
YOU'RE LIKE, YEAH I WILL HAVE, OH THERE IT IS!

225
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,367
HOW'D YOU KNOW I EVEN WANTED THAT?

226
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
FAST AS TO PREPARE, SLOW AS TO EAT.

227
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,533
I PREFER THE CHINESE RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE THE

228
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,400
SILVERWARE ON THE TABLE ON YOU ARRIVE.

229
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,834
CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE HUMILIATING THAN STARTING WITH

230
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,767
CHOPSTICKS AND HAVING TO TURN TO THE WAITER AND BE

231
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,233
LIKE, OH YEAH, HI.

232
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:49,333
I'M TOO WHITE.

233
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,200
DO YOU HAVE A SHOVEL BACK THERE?

234
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,233
CHOPSTICKS ARE FUN BUT I'D RATHER

235
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,734
EAT THAN PLAY OPERATION.

236
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,200
YEAH.

237
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,433
HE'S WEIRD.

238
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,266
WE'RE LAZY ABOUT OUR FOOD.

239
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,500
WE HAVE PEOPLE DELIVER IT TO US.

240
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,200
YEAH, I LIKE YOUR FOOD.

241
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,166
JUST NOT ENOUGH TO GO DOWN THERE AND GET IT.

242
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,166
DELIVERY IS REALLY A COMBINATION OF MY TWO FAVORITE

243
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
ACTIVITIES.

244
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,066
EATING AND NOT MOVING.

245
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,667
WORST PART OF DELIVERY IS GETTING UP AND

246
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,066
ANSWERING THE DOOR.

247
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:28,266
OH, THIS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

248
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,500
WHO AM I THE BUTLER?

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,166
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON PANTS.

250
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,266
HAND IT OVER.

251
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,400
WE'RE GETTING LAZIER.

252
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,433
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

253
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,100
YEAH, I WANT DELIVERY AND I'M GOING TO NEED

254
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,367
SOMEONE TO FEED ME.

255
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,834
NO, NO I'LL BE IN THE TUB.

256
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,233
YEAH, KEY IS UNDER THE MAT.

257
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,500
CHIP CHOP CHIP.

258
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,233
CHIP CHOP CHIP?

259
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,767
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT CHIP CHOP CHIP

260
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,100
IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN.

261
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:02,066
I'M NOT GOOD AT ORDERING DELIVERY.

262
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,066
I ALWAYS THINK I'M READY, I NEVER AM.

263
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,533
I ALWAYS GET THAT ORDER PANIC.

264
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,900
DELIVERY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

265
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:11,100
UH

266
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,166
YES WE HAVE FOOD, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

267
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
UH-UH-UH, LET ME WRITE IT DOWN I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

268
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,400
OH I WASN'T READY FOR THE TRICK QUESTIONS.

269
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,734
IT'S EXCITING WHEN THAT DELIVERY GUY

270
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,100
ARRIVES, ISN'T IT?

271
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,400
IT'S LIKE SANTA COMING TO YOUR HOUSE.

272
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,266
HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE!

273
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,266
THE GUY'S HERE, WHAT DO WE DO?

274
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,200
WHAT DO WE DO?

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,900
BUT WE DON'T TREAT HIM LIKE SANTA.

276
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:37,066
WE TREAT THE SITUATION LIKE IT'S A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE.

277
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,834
WOAH, WOAH WEIRDO, YOU WAIT OUT THERE.

278
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,066
HERE'S THE DEAL.

279
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,166
I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY, YOU HAND OVER THE FOOD.

280
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,000
THEN I WANT YOU TO BACK AWAY SLOWLY.

281
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,834
I DON'T NEED YOU CASING THE JOINT.

282
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,700
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

283
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,200
HERE'S SOMETHING FUN TO DO NEXT TIME YOU GET DELIVERY.

284
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,266
TREAT THE DELIVERY GUY LIKE HE'S YOUR WAITER.

285
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,333
BE LIKE, HEY, THANKS A LOT COULD YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT

286
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,367
THE MUSIC IN HERE?

287
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,900
I COULD GO FOR SOME MORE ICE WATER.

288
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,500
HE'S WEIRD.

289
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,934
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THOSE CONDIMENT

290
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,500
PACKETS THEY GIVE WHEN YOU GET DELIVERY.

291
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,233
THEY GIVE YOU LIKE 50 KETCHUPS.

292
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:13,033
SUCH A WASTE.

293
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,166
MY WIFE'S ALWAYS LIKE, SAVE THEM.

294
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,100
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN GO UP TO A HOMELESS GUY, CASE YOU GET

295
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,100
THAT FOOD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, HERE'S SOME KETCHUP.

296
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,200
I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU BUDDY.

297
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,200
HE'S RIDICULOUS.

298
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:29,033
IT IS CONVENIENT THOUGH.

299
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,266
WE WANT OUR FOOD EASY.

300
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,200
I MEAN HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EXPLAIN SPRAY CHEESE?

301
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,000
I MEAN I'M LAZY, BUT I GUESS THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE

302
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,533
LIKE, YOU KNOW I LIKE CHEESE BUT IT'S JUST TOO MUCH WORK.

303
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:43,500
TIRED OF OPENING IT UP, TAKING IT OUT.

304
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,600
I'D BE WILLING TO EAT CHEESE IF I COULD DO,

305
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,266
I DON'T KNOW, THIS.

306
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,834
HERE'S THE DEAL.

307
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,166
I'LL DO THIS AND THE CHEESE WILL SPRAY OUT AND I COULD

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,433
WRITE MY NAME WITH IT.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,166
CAUSE I GOTTA SIGN SOME CHECKS TO MAYOR MCCHEESE.

310
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,033
AND AS YOU KNOW HE ONLY TAKES CHEESE CHECKS.

311
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,367
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S ACCURATE.

312
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,433
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MAYOR

313
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:12,200
MCCHEESE, BUT I DON'T THINK HE EVEN TAKES CHECKS.

314
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,266
I LOVE CHEESE.

315
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,000
I THINK I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT THOUGH.

316
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,767
CAUSE LAST NIGHT I HAD FOUR MILKSHAKES

317
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,266
AND I FELT LIKE CRAP.

318
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:25,934
I THINK IT'S THE LACTOSE.

319
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,166
IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT DON'T BE ASHAMED.

320
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,600
JUST BECAUSE YOUR TUMMY CAN'T HANDLE THAT SPICY MILK.

321
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,700
UH, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING MILDER THAN MILK?

322
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,200
BUT NOT WATER, THAT GIVES ME GAS.

323
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,000
YEAH.

324
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,734
TRYING TO LAY OFF DAIRY.

325
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,500
I BOUGHT SOME OF THAT COUNTRY CROCK MARGARINE.

326
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,000
DIDN'T STICK IN THE FRIDGE RIGHT AWAY.

327
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,734
IT TURNED INTO GASOLINE.

328
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,233
THAT'S GOT TO BE A TOUGH PRODUCT TO MARKET.

329
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,200
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT A BUCKET OF WHIPPED GREASE,

330
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,500
SOMEONE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CALL IT CROCK.

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,066
DO YOU THINK THIS IS BUTTER?

332
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,934
IT'S CROCK.

333
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
WE ALL TRY TO WATCH WHAT WE EAT, BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO SO

334
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,533
CONSUMED WITH OUR BODIES.

335
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,033
SO AT THE GYM I SAW THIS WOMAN WORKING OUT.

336
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,066
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HER RIBS.

337
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,367
AND ALL I COULD THINK IS, I HADN'T HAD A MCRIB IN FOREVER.

338
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,200
DELICIOUS.

339
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,166
THANKS FOR THE REMINDER.

340
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,867
THIS GUY'S OBSESSED ON FOOD.

341
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
I AM.

342
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,233
I TRIED TO RATIONALIZE WHAT I EAT.

343
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,834
BUT THERE'S SOME FOOD THERE'S NO REASON TO EVER EAT.

344
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,767
LIKE A CINNABON?

345
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,900
I MEAN, TELL ME THAT PLACE ISN'T RUN BY SATAN.

346
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,667
YOU EVER EAT A CINNABON?

347
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,834
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A NAP HALFWAY THROUGH.

348
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,066
I THINK I NEED SOME INSULIN.

349
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,233
AND A WHEELBARROW FOR MY HALF OF BUN.

350
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,900
IT'S KIND OF GENEROUS CALLING THAT A BUN.

351
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,500
IT'S THE SIZE OF A BEANBAG CHAIR.

352
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:05,200
SHOULD I SIT IN IT OR EAT IT?

353
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,767
HEY I COULD SIT IN IT AND EAT IT.

354
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,900
OH, THIS IS STICKY WITHOUT PANTS ON.

355
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,100
HE HAS HIS PANTS

356
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,100
OFF IN A LOT OF JOKES.

357
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,066
HOW ABOUT THAT--

358
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,667
HOW ABOUT THAT CINNABON ODOR?

359
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
YOU EVER BEEN WALKING THROUGH THE MALL, YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT'S

360
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:32,934
THAT SMELL?

361
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,200
OH I JUST GOT A CAVITY.

362
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,100
DAMN CINNABONS.

363
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,066
TELL YA, I'VE DONE SOME HUMILIATING THINGS, BUT

364
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,400
STANDING IN THAT CINNABON LINE IS UP THERE.

365
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,200
EVERYONE'S SO FILLED WILL SHAME.

366
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,567
NO ONE'S TRYING TO MAKE EYE CONTACT.

367
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,867
UH, I'M JUST HERE FOR THE NAPKINS.

368
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,166
I'M NOT A PIG LIKE YOU GUYS.

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
CAUSE THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE A CINNABON.

370
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,333
I'VE TRIED TO FIND ONE.

371
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,834
SO I'M ABOUT TO GET ON A PLANE.

372
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,400
HOW ABOUT 8 POUNDS OF CAKE?

373
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,033
SOUNDS REASONABLE.

374
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,066
A LITTLE DESSERT ON THE GO.

375
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,166
THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S TRULY UNIVERSAL.

376
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,834
WE ALL LOVE DESSERT.

377
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,767
YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU GO OUT TO DINNER THERE'S ALWAYS

378
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,367
SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO SHARE A DESSERT?

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,100
HEY, YOU WANT TO SHARE A DESSERT?

380
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,100
LET'S SHARE A DESSERT.

381
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,900
JUST GET YOUR OWN DAMNED DESSERT.

382
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,066
OH I JUST WANT A BITE.

383
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,834
JUST A BITE.

384
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:27,266
AND THEN DESSERT COMES AND THEY TURN INTO A VACUUM.

385
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,066
AH, APPARENTLY IT WAS A BITE FROM A SHOVEL.

386
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,433
YEAH, I HAVE A BIT OF A SWEET TOOTH.

387
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
NO YOU'RE A PIG.

388
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:43,100
BUT SO AM I. TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

389
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,100
I DO LOVE OUR EXCUSES.

390
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,900
I HAVE A SWEET TOOTH.

391
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,266
OH SO YOU'RE ORDERING IT FOR YOUR TOOTH, THAT'S

392
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,066
INTERESTING.

393
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,066
BECAUSE IT'S GOING STRAIGHT TO YOUR ASS.

394
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,333
I THINK YOUR ASS OWES YOUR TOOTH AN EXPLANATION.

395
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,166
I MEAN NO ONE'S EVER REALLY NEEDED DESSERT.

396
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,667
WHO WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT WAS LIKE, THAT WAS A GOOD

397
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,767
MEAL WE JUST HAD.

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,066
I'M FULL, ARE YOU FULL?

399
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,767
YEAH.

400
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,233
YOU WANT TO EAT A CAKE?

401
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,200
LET'S EAT A CAKE.

402
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,233
LET'S EAT TIL WE THROW UP.

403
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,100
JUST KEEP GNAWING AND GNAWING.

404
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,033
WE HAVE DESSERT BECAUSE IT'S SPECIAL.

405
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,834
IT'S ALWAYS SPECIAL DESSERT.

406
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:20,367
I LOVE WHEN YOU GO IN A TRUCK STOP OR A DINER THEY ALWAYS

407
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,767
HAVE DESSERT AND THAT ROTATING GLASS JEWEL CASE LIKE IT'S

408
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,166
SOME ARTIFACT OR SOMETHING.

409
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,166
HOWS THAT SUPPOSED TO WORK?

410
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
YOU'RE LIKE, YEAH I DON'T FEEL LIKE DESSERT.

411
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:33,100
BUT WHEN I SEE PUDDING AT THAT ANGLE?

412
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,734
AH, I GOTTA GET ME SOME.

413
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,200
MY FAVORITE DESSERT IS CAKE.

414
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,266
YEAH.

415
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,367
CAKE'S A TRUE SYMBOL OF GLUTTONY THOUGH.

416
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,867
IF YOU EAT A WHOLE PIZZA PEOPLE ARE LIKE,

417
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
WOW YOU WERE HUNGRY.

418
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,066
BUT IF YOU EAT A WHOLE CAKE PEOPLE ARE

419
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,400
LIKE, YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

420
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,100
ADDICTED TO CAKE.

421
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,567
IT'S NOT LIKE DRINKING.

422
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,567
YOU NEVER HEAR SOMEONE BRAG, YEAH LAST NIGHT I HAD FOUR

423
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,767
PIECES OF CAKE.

424
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,734
WHY ARE YOU TELLING US?

425
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:02,000
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I PARTIED.

426
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,533
WHY DON'T YOU GET AWAY FROM ME.

427
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,333
CAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS CAKE'S BAD FOR US.

428
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:14,200
SOMETIMES WE TRY AND DISGUISE THE FACT WE'RE EATING CAKE.

429
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,367
IT'S BREAKFAST I CAN'T HAVE CAKE.

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,166
I'LL HAVE A MUFFIN!

431
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,200
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CAKE AND A MUFFIN?

432
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:21,900
NOTHING.

433
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,166
A MUFFIN IS A BALD CUPCAKE.

434
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,533
AND WE KNOW IT.

435
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,600
HAVE YOU SEEN THE MINI MUFFINS?

436
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:34,500
HOW MUCH DENIAL ARE WE IN WHEN WE'RE EATING MINI MUFFINS?

437
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,667
OH I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE LIKE 1 OR 12.

438
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,233
SO SMALL THEY DON'T REALLY COUNT.

439
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,100
THEY'RE LIKE, THEY'RE LIKE MUFFIN VITAMINS.

440
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,266
WHEN I EAT THEM I FEEL LIKE AN ASTRONAUT.

441
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:52,433
IT'S WHY I HAVE THEM FOR BREAKFAST. CAN'T HAVE CAKE FOR

442
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:56,200
BREAKFAST. UNLESS IT'S A PANCAKE.

443
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,667
HOW'D THAT SLIDE THROUGH?

444
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,000
YOUNG MAN YOU'RE NOT HAVING CAKE FOR BREAKFAST, YOU'RE

445
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,867
HAVING FRIED CAKE WITH SYRUP

446
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,266
FOR BREAKFAST.

447
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,734
LOADS UP ON THAT AND TRY NOT TO NAP.

448
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,600
PANCAKES.

449
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,767
PANCAKES DEFINITELY MAKE YOU LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

450
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,166
YOU'RE LIKE, WELL IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT SHOWERING TODAY.

451
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,567
I'M GOING TO BE DIGESTING THOSE CARB CAKES FOR HOURS.

452
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,533
BAD IDEA.

453
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,200
THIS GUY TALKS A LOT ABOUT CAKE.

454
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,900
CAKE'S A POWERFUL FOOD.

455
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,200
CAKE CAN ACTUALLY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

456
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,000
IT'S BILL'S BIRTHDAY.

457
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,734
I HATE THAT GUY.

458
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,433
THERE'S CAKE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

459
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,200
WELL, I SHOULD SAY HELLO.

460
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,400
SEE HOW HE'S DOING.

461
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:46,333
I MEAN, ADMIT IT WHEN YOU HEAR THE SONG "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" ALL

462
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,934
YOU'RE THINKING IS, HEY I'M GETTING SOME FREE CAKE.

463
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,166
DURING THE SONG YOU'RE JUST WONDERING WHAT KIND IT IS.

464
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,767
HOPE IT'S CHOCOLATE FOR ME.

465
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,066
WE'RE ALL BASHFUL WHEN WE'RE OFFERED A PIECE AREN'T WE?

466
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,066
WE'RE ALWAYS LIKE, WELL I GUESS I'LL TRY IT.

467
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,066
WHAT'S THIS CALLED, CAKE?

468
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,600
YEAH I'VE NEVER HAD CAKE BEFORE.

469
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,600
YARRGGH!

470
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,066
IF HE DOES ANOTHER CAKE JOKE I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.

471
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,767
OK, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING BESIDES CAKE, PIE.

472
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,834
THAT'S LIKE LIQUID CAKE, ISN'T IT?

473
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,100
PIE CAN'T COMPETE WITH CAKE THOUGH.

474
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,500
PUT CANDLES IN A CAKE, IT'S A BIRTHDAY CAKE.

475
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,033
PUT CANDLES IN A PIE?

476
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:41,900
SOMEONE'S DRUNK IN THE KITCHEN.

477
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,000
GO CHECK ON GRANDMA.

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,100
PIE CAN'T COMPETE, YOU KNOW?

479
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,367
NEVER HEAR ABOUT A HOT CHICK JUMPING OUT OF A PIE.

480
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,333
IT'S TOO MESSY.

481
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,100
I'M HERE!

482
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,166
GO TAKE A SHOWER.

483
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,100
CAKE.

484
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,100
THERE'S SO MANY TYPES OF CAKE TOO.

485
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,200
THERE'S RUM CAKE, WHICH MAKES SENSE.

486
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,000
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN EATING CAKE AND THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

487
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:09,867
THIS NEEDS BOOZE.

488
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,700
SHOT 'A LIQUOR.

489
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,033
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EAT AND DRINK.

490
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,667
I ONLY GOT TWO HANDS, BUDDY, AND ONE OF

491
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,667
THEM'S HOLDING A CIGARETTE.

492
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:22,800
MEET ME HALF WAY WILL YA?

493
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:29,567
THERE'S FUNNEL CAKE, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A GIANT FRENCH FRY

494
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,934
COVERED IN SUGAR.

495
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,900
THEY'RE SERVING THAT AT THE IHOP NOW.

496
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,233
IT'S A WEIRD NAME FOR THAT PLACE.

497
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,700
I'VE NEVER LEFT THERE FEELING LIKE HOPPING.

498
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:43,834
IT SHOULD BE CALLED I BARELY MOVE.

499
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,100
I NEED A WHEELCHAIR.

500
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:51,233
HEY BUDDY, I LIKE THE IHOP.

501
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,767
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE.

502
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,333
I THINK THE MOST DISAPPOINTING CAKE HAS TO BE

503
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,367
FRUITCAKE YOU KNOW?

504
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,333
YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER.

505
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,600
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

506
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,667
FRUIT, GOOD.

507
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,266
CAKE, GREAT.

508
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,233
FRUITCAKE, NASTY CRAP.

509
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,533
HAVE YOU TRIED FRUITCAKE?

510
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,066
I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT'S FRUIT IN THERE.

511
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,400
YOU'RE LIKE , WHAT IS THAT A SKITTLE?

512
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,100
WHAT IS THIS, SEED HERE?

513
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,066
WHAT'S THIS, A TREASURE MAP

514
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,266
WHAT IS THE RECIPE OF FRUITCAKE?

515
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,166
ANYTHING BUT FRUIT?

516
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,100
IT'S LIKE THE BAKER WAS JUST CLEARING OFF THE COUNTER.

517
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,066
PUT ALL THIS CRAP IN THERE.

518
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,000
NOBODY EATS THIS STUFF THEY JUST MAIL IT TO RELATIVES.

519
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,767
THAT IS SO TRUE.

520
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,066
BIG HOLIDAY TRADITION FRUITCAKE.

521
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,600
I LOVE OUR HOLIDAY TRADITIONS.

522
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:49,667
LIKE THE CHRISTMAS TREE, WHERE WE GO OUT AND WE CHOP DOWN A

523
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,367
TREE AND WE PUT IT IN OUR LIVING ROOM.

524
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,567
KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE THE BEHAVIOR

525
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,700
OF A DRUNK MAN REALLY.

526
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,867
SOME WOMAN WAKES UP.

527
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,166
HONEY, WHY IS THERE A--

528
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,500
A PINE TREE IN OUR LIVING ROOM?

529
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,333
I LIKE IT.

530
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,000
WE'RE GONNA-- WE'RE GONNA

531
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,533
DECORATE IT FOR JESUS.

532
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,900
AND THEN I'M GONNA HANG MY

533
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,400
SOCKS OVER THE FIREPLACE.

534
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,066
FILL THEM WITH CANDY.

535
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,667
MAYBE I'LL TIE SOME LEAVES TO THE CEILING, SEE IF I CAN GET

536
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,266
SOME ACTION.

537
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:38,066
AND NOW I GOTTA PUKE ON THAT COUCH.

538
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,233
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

539
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,066
SOME PEOPLE GET SO INTO CHRISTMAS THEY

540
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,834
DECORATE THEIR YARDS.

541
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:47,033
IT SEEMS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.

542
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:47,934
OK, CHOP DOWN THAT TREE.

543
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,033
BRING IT IN HERE.

544
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,266
TAKE ALL THESE LIGHTS, PUT THEM OUT THERE.

545
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,934
OH, I JUST GOTTA--

546
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,600
I REALLY GOT TO GET A JOB.

547
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,533
HE'S ANTI-CHRISTMAS.

548
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,033
EASTER THAT'S A WEIRD TRADITION.

549
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,266
EASTER, THE DAY JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

550
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,266
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

551
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,767
HOW ABOUT EGGS?

552
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH JESUS?

553
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,734
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HIDE THEM.

554
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,200
I DON'T FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC.

555
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,500
DON'T WORRY THERE'S A BUNNY.

556
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:27,934
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

557
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,100
THANKSGIVING.

558
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,667
THANKSGIVING, IT'S LIKE WE DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO COME UP

559
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
WITH A TRADITION.

560
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,767
THE TRADITION IS WE OVEREAT.

561
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:41,266
HEY, HOW ABOUT AT THANKSGIVING WE JUST, UH, EAT A LOT.

562
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,233
WE DO THAT EVERY DAY.

563
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,166
OH, WHAT IF WE EAT A LOT WITH PEOPLE THAT ANNOY

564
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
THE HELL OUT OF US?

565
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,934
OH, HE'S ANTI-FAMILY.

566
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,200
MOSTLY WE USE HOLIDAYS SO WE CAN EAT MORE.

567
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:58,367
I NORMALLY DON'T HAVE A BURGER, A BRAT, AND A STEAK,

568
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,900
BUT IT IS FOURTH OF JULY.

569
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,166
AND I NEED THE ENERGY IF I'M GOING TO START

570
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,367
BLOWING CRAP UP.

571
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,600
THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS WOULD WANT.

572
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,700
MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY IS HALLOWEEN.

573
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,166
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WOMEN USE IT AS AN EXCUSE TO DRESS LIKE

574
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,900
PROSTITUTES.

575
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,867
YOU LADIES TOTALLY DO.

576
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,533
I'M A WITCH!

577
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,600
IF SHE WAS A HOOKER.

578
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,066
I'M LITTLE MISS MUFFET!

579
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

580
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,500
HEY, THAT ALMOST SOUNDED DIRTY FELLA.

581
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,500
AS A KID HALLOWEEN WAS AMAZING.

582
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,000
YOU DRESS LIKE A SUPERHERO.

583
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:38,233
YOU BANG ON YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOOR.

584
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,900
AND THEY GIVE YOU CANDY.

585
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,166
I DO THAT TODAY AND MY NEIGHBOR WANTS ME ARRESTED.

586
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,100
PROBABLY BECAUSE I MAKE A HOT CATWOMAN.

587
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:53,266
KITTY WANTS SOME CANDY.

588
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:09,367
REMEMBER THAT FROM MR. ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD?

589
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW.

590
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:14,667
AND THEY WONDER WHY WE DO DRUGS.

591
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:16,867
OH THAT WAS NEGATIVE.

592
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,834
HOW ABOUT THOSE TRADITIONS FELLA, WHY

593
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,066
DON'T YOU GO BACK TO THAT?

594
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,266
VALENTINE'S DAY THE TRADITION IS WE GIVE EACH

595
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,000
OTHER THOSE BIG RED HEARTS FILLED

596
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,400
WITH THE GAMBLE CHOCOLATE.

597
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,100
HAVE YOU EVER EATEN ANY CHOCOLATE OUT OF THOSE BIG RED

598
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,500
HEARTS WITH ANY CONFIDENCE?

599
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,066
WELL THIS COULD EITHER BE REALLY GOOD OR TOTALLY NASTY.

600
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,567
AND I'M JUST PIG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT.

601
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,934
AW, I GOT THE ONE FILLED WITH TOOTHPASTE!

602
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,667
I'M GONNA HAVE TO EAT ANOTHER NINE TO

603
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,200
GET RID OF THAT FLAVOR.

604
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,367
THERE'S THE BIG RED HEARTS FILLED

605
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,567
WITH THE GAMBLE CHOCOLATE.

606
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
OR THE TINY, CHALK, HEART SHAPED ANTACIDS.

607
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:07,867
I KNOW I MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS, HERE'S A TUMS WITH "HUG ME"

608
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,033
WRITTEN ON IT.

609
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,233
MAYBE THAT'LL HELP.

610
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,533
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SAINT VALENTINE.

611
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:21,033
I ASSUME HE'S THE PATRON SAINT OF OVERPRICED GREETING CARDS.

612
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,400
THAT'S AN ODD RITUAL REALLY.

613
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,934
YOU KNOW, WE GO OUT AND WE BUY CARDS THAT ALREADY HAVE THINGS

614
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,200
WRITTEN IN THEM.

615
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:29,900
IT' IT'S LIKE, HEY, THAT'S SOMETHING I'D SAY.

616
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:33,700
JUST ADD MY NAME HERE AT THE BOTTOM.

617
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,100
HERE YOU GO!

618
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,600
YOU LIKE WHAT THAT OTHER GUY WROTE IN THERE?

619
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,934
IT TOOK ME 5 SECONDS TO FIND IT.

620
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,000
COST ME $2 BUCKS.

621
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,533
GREETING CARDS WOULD MAKE SENSE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING

622
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,000
PROFOUND WRITTEN IN THERE.

623
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:54,600
BUT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

624
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,367
COULDN'T THINK OF THAT YOURSELF?

625
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,900
I'M NOT A SLOGAN MACHINE.

626
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,400
BIRTHDAYS.

627
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,734
EVERYONE ACTS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AROUND THEIR

628
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:05,200
BIRTHDAY, DON'T THEY?

629
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:07,700
YOU EVER HAVE THAT FRIEND THAT GIVES YOU THE BIRTHDAY ALERT?

630
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:08,867
HEY, JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, NEXT

631
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,367
TUESDAY IS MY BIRTHDAY.

632
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M NOW GETTING YOU ANYTHING.

633
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,900
WE GIVE THE--

634
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,600
THEY GIVE THE ALERT CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE

635
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:21,900
IN OUR SOCIETY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

636
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,934
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO WORK ON

637
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,367
MY BIRTHDAY.

638
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING LAUNDRY ON MY BIRTHDAY.

639
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:32,600
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M PAYING FOR SEX ON MY BIRTHDAY.

640
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
RIP-OFF.

641
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,166
IT IS FUN GETTING THOSE GIFTS, EH?

642
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,233
IT CAN BE HARD TO GIVE A GIFT.

643
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:42,834
IT'S A GAMBLE.

644
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,200
YOU KNOW, I--

645
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,400
IT'S HARD.

646
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GIVING CLOTHING AS A GIFT.

647
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,500
CAUSE WHENEVER YOU GET CLOTHING AS A PRESENT YOU OPEN

648
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,233
IT UP AND YOU THINK, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

649
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,567
AND THE PERSON THAT GIVES IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, YOU CAN TAKE IT

650
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,100
BACK IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

651
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,867
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST THROW IT OUT.

652
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,367
DON'T GIVE ME AN ERRAND.

653
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,400
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WHY DON'T YOU HEAD TO THE MALL FOR ME?

654
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,667
IF YOU GET MY DRY CLEANING THAT'D BE AWESOME.

655
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,867
I GOT A ROBE FOR CHRISTMAS.

656
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,166
I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE ROBE THINKING, WOW HOPE I GET THE

657
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,266
FLU SO I CAN WEAR IT.

658
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,600
I MEAN, WHO HAS THE TIME TO ENJOY A ROBE?

659
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,600
WHAT ARE WE, ABOUT TO SHOOT A PORNO?

660
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,700
IT'S A WEIRD PIECE OF CLOTHING.

661
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,867
HOW'D WE EVEN COME UP WITH THE ROBE?

662
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,667
WAS SOME GUY LIKE, HEY I GOT AN IDEA, HOW ABOUT WE MAKE A

663
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,533
COAT OUT OF A TOWEL?

664
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,600
THERE COULD BE A BELT THAT GOES AROUND.

665
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,367
YOU COULD DUNK THE BELT IN THE TOILET.

666
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,600
BE A TOILET BELT.

667
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,333
THE INDOOR JACKET, THE ROBE.

668
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,934
YOU EVER SEE SOMEONE OUTSIDE IN A ROBE?

669
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,867
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ESCAPED FROM THE LOONY BIN.

670
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,233
UH, JUST GETTING THE PAPER.

671
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,166
BEFORE THE MONSTERS DO RIGHT?

672
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,667
THE ONLY TIME I EVER WEAR A ROBE IS WHEN I'M STAYING IN A

673
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,667
FANCY HOTEL.

674
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,066
YOU HAVE THAT ROBE IN THE CLOSET.

675
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,000
I ALWAYS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN ROOM SERVICE COMES AND

676
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,834
I'M IN A ROBE.

677
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,100
LIKE I'M TRYING TO SEDUCE THE ROOM SERVICE GUY.

678
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,867
HELLO WELCOME TO MY ROOM.

679
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,600
I'M IN MY ROBE AND HERE'S THE BED I RENTED.

680
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,600
IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD DO TO BE MORE CREEPY?

681
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,900
OH, HE WAS BELIEVABLE

682
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:33,066
AS THE CREEPY GUY.

683
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,066
IT REMINDED ME OF HIS CATWOMAN.

684
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,867
SCARY.

685
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,100
DO YOU EVER GET A CANDLE AS A GIFT?

686
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,033
HEY, THANKS.

687
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:45,033
YOU KNOW I HAVE ELECTRICITY, RIGHT?

688
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
LOOK, IF MY PLACE SMELLS JUST LET ME KNOW.

689
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,900
NO, THIS PERFECT.

690
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,867
NOW I KNOW WHAT I'M GIVING YOU NEXT YEAR.

691
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,266
THIS.

692
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,834
YOUR CANDLE GIFTS.

693
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,066
IT'S A GAMBLE WITH GIFTS.

694
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,834
YOU KNOW?

695
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,166
STATUE OF LIBERTY WAS A GIFT.

696
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,166
BIG BEAUTIFUL STATUE, GIFT FROM THE FRENCH.

697
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,233
GOOD THING THAT STATUE'S BEAUTIFUL CAUSE IF IT WAS UGLY

698
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,233
THAT WOULD HAVE AN AWKWARD.

699
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:16,166
FRENCHMAN WOULD COME OVER, WHERE'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY?

700
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,600
YEAH UH, THAT'S IN THE DESERT IN ARIZONA.

701
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:22,567
YEAH, WE THOUGHT IT REALLY COMPLEMENTED THE DESERT.

702
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,433
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE AWKWARD IF WE

703
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,533
REGIFTED THE STATUE.

704
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,767
WHERE'S THAT GIGANTIC STATUE?

705
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,767
UH, JAPAN WAS HAVING A BIRTHDAY.

706
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,100
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO GET THEM.

707
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,233
WE SAID IT WAS FROM BOTH OF US.

708
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,900
AND THEY JUST LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT,

709
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,166
LOVE IT, LOVE IT.

710
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,066
MY FAVORITE GIFT I'VE EVER RECEIVED IS A FLASK.

711
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I THINK GIVING SOMEONE A FLASK IS A NICE WAY OF SAYING, HEY

712
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,433
YOU SEEM LIKE A DRUNK ON THE GO.

713
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:59,266
YOU STRIKE ME AS NEEDING HARD LIQUOR AT ALL TIMES.

714
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:02,500
IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN YOUR CAR.

715
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,233
DON'T YOU LOVE HOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT CONTAINERS THAT WE

716
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:14,767
DRINK DIFFERENT ALCOHOL OUT OF?

717
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,233
LIKE, YOU EVER TRY AND DRINK WINE OUT OF ANYTHING BUT A

718
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,834
WINE GLASS?

719
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,166
YOU FEEL LIKE A DRUNK.

720
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
HEY, CAN YOU REFILL MY YAHTZEE SHAKER?

721
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:27,100
HIT THE SIPPY CUP TOO, WILL YOU?

722
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:28,266
DANKE.

723
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:33,033
SO MUCH FORMALITY WITH WINE.

724
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,233
LIKE THAT WINE MENU?

725
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,867
DOES ANYONE REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHEN THEY

726
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,734
LOOK AT A WINE MENU?

727
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,266
BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC.

728
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:40,533
OH YEAH, I HAD THREE OF THESE

729
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,266
FOR BREAKFAST.

730
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,533
I ALWAYS MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASKING FOR THE WAITER'S

731
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,066
SUGGESTION.

732
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,066
YES, THAT WINE WOULD COMPLEMENT YOUR MEAL.

733
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,900
YEAH, I'M GOING TO GO WITH

734
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,867
THE $5 BOTTLE

735
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,200
THAT COMPLEMENTS MY WALLET.

736
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,767
I AM ALWAYS ASKING THE WAITER'S ADVICE,

737
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,233
WHICH IS ODD, YOU KNOW?

738
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,600
IT'S LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT WHAT DO YOU

739
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:00,867
THINK I SHOULD EAT?

740
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,066
IS IT TIME FOR A HAIRCUT?

741
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
IT'S UP TO YOU CAUSE YOU'RE A STRANGER.

742
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,233
AND I'M WEIRD.

743
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,500
YOU EVER HAVE THE WAITER STRONGLY RECOMMEND SOMETHING?

744
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:15,200
YOU FEEL KIND OF GUILTY NOT GETTING IT.

745
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:18,367
YEAH I KNOW YOU REALLY WANT ME TO GET THAT, BUT I'M JUST

746
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
GOING TO GET WHAT I WANT.

747
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,400
CAUSE I'M STILL PAYING, RIGHT PUSHY?

748
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,100
BACK OFF.

749
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:30,533
BUT WE SHOULD BE NICER TO THE WAITSTAFF.

750
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,767
IT'S AN ODD RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE WAITER.

751
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,500
OCCASIONALLY THE WAITER WILL TELL YOU THEIR NAME.

752
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:35,367
WE NEVER GIVE OURS.

753
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,333
THEY'RE LIKE, HEY HOW YOU DOING?

754
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:39,066
I'M YOUR WAITER, MY NAME'S PHIL.

755
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,266
YEAH, I'LL HAVE THE CHICKEN.

756
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,100
WHY DON'T YOU BEAT IT.

757
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,900
YOU NEVER REALLY USE THE NAME.

758
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:47,567
YOU KNOW, I'M OUT OF WATER.

759
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,500
PHIL!

760
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:50,667
PHIL!

761
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,900
WOO-HOO PHILLY!

762
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,967
I DO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THE

763
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,533
WAITER'S DOING THE SPECIALS.

764
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,667
IT-- IT'S KIND OF A SEMI-CONVERSATION.

765
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,200
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, SPECIALS.

766
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,433
WE HAVE A SEA BASS WHICH IS BROILED.

767
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:10,100
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, UH, AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY SOMETHING?

768
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:12,233
UH, PASS!

769
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,400
I EXERT SO MUCH ENERGY ACTING LIKE I'M INTERESTED IN THE SPE--

770
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,934
HUH, THAT'S THE SOUP OF THE DAY?

771
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:21,934
OH MY GOD!

772
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,166
I'M NOT GETTING ANY OF THIS CRAP.

773
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,233
HERE'S A CLUE, IF IT'S THAT SPECIAL PUT IT ON THE MENU.

774
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,367
OH THAT IS SO TRUE.

775
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,266
I DO LOVE GOING OUT TO DINNER.

776
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,700
YEAH, I ALWAYS GET THE APPETIZER.

777
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,867
BECAUSE THE APPETIZER'S JUST AN EXCUSE FOR AN EXTRA MEAL.

778
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,033
LET'S SEE I WILL START WITH THE 80 BUFFALO WINGS.

779
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,433
AND DO YOU HAVE A LOW

780
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:49,934
CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FILL UP TOO MUCH.

781
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,233
IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT AN

782
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:58,934
APPETIZER IS TO SOMEONE FROM A STARVING COUNTRY.

783
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,667
YOU'D BE LIKE, YEAH THE APPETIZER, THAT'S FOOD WE EAT

784
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,066
BEFORE WE HAVE OUR FOOD.

785
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,500
NO, NO YOU'RE THINKING OF DESERT.

786
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,233
THAT'S FOOD WE HAVE AFTER WE HAVE OUR FOOD.

787
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,200
YEAH, WE EAT TONS OF FOOD.

788
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:11,433
SOMETIMES THERE'S SO MUCH, WE JUST STICK IT IN A

789
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:14,166
BAG, BRING IT HOME.

790
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,266
YOU EVER GET THE DOGGY BAG?

791
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,500
YOU'RE LIKE, NO, NO PUT THIS IN A BOX, IN A BAG.

792
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,000
AND I'LL BRING IT HOME AND THROW IT OUT TOMORROW.

793
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,100
THAT IS SO TRUE.

794
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,333
THAT'S WEIRD.

795
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,166
GOING OUT TO DINNER IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

796
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,867
I MEAN I ENJOY BREAD IN EVERYDAY LIFE, BUT WHEN I GO

797
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,667
OUT TO DINNER SUDDENLY I CRAVE BREAD.

798
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:34,700
BREAD?

799
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:35,700
THEY'VE GOT BREAD HERE?

800
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,233
OH, WE SHOULD HAVE BREAD AT HOME.

801
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,266
WE GOT TO GET THE RECIPE FOR BREAD.

802
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,066
YOU EVER EAT THE WHOLE BASKET OF BREAD AND

803
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,066
YOU STILL WANT MORE? IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD

804
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,066
ASKING THE WAITER FOR SECONDS ON BREAD.

805
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,734
YEAH, CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE OF THAT FREE BREAD?

806
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,500
CAN YOU CANCEL MY ENTREE?

807
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,200
I'M JUST GOING TO LOAD UP ON THE BREAD.

808
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,033
ARE THERE OTHER FREE THINGS HERE?

809
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,266
I PREFER THE FREE STUFF MORE.

810
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,934
I AM TRYING TO LAY OFF THE CARBS.

811
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,166
I'M VEGETARIAN NOW, ANYONE A VEGETARIAN?

812
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,100
YEAH, VERY GOOD.

813
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:13,934
I'M NOT A STRICT VEGETARIAN.

814
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,066
I EAT BEEF AND PORK.

815
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:17,867
AND CHICKEN.

816
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,100
BUT NOT FISH, CAUSE THAT'S DISGUSTING.

817
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,066
HOW CAN YOU TELL WHEN FISH GOES BAD?

818
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,533
IT SMELLS LIKE FISH EITHER WAY.

819
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:29,166
WELL THIS SMELLS LIKE A DUMPSTER, LET'S EAT IT.

820
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,834
NO ONE REALLY LIKES FISH.

821
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:34,500
THEY JUST WON'T ADMIT IT.

822
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:36,033
THEY'RE LIKE, I LIKE FISH, JUST AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T

823
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:38,233
TASTE LIKE FISH.

824
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:40,400
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE FISH.

825
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,066
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE FISH IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE FISH.

826
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOOD ON FISH?

827
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,233
ANYTHING THAT KILLS THE TASTE OF FISH.

828
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,066
HOW ABOUT RELISH AND A GALLON OF MAYO?

829
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,166
THAT'LL DO THE JOB.

830
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,066
WHAT IF WE SQUEEZE A LEMON AND WRAPPED IT IN SEAWEED AND

831
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,200
COVER IT IN SOY SAUCE.

832
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,700
HE'S ANTI-FISH.

833
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,433
AND WE'RE RIGHT NEXT TO LAKE MICHIGAN.

834
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,100
I AM AMAZED THAT WE'RE STILL SERVING FISH WITH

835
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,333
THE HEADS ON THERE.

836
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,700
DON'T YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THAT EYE IS LOOKING AT YOU?

837
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:19,233
HEY, YOU DON'T MIND IF I WATCH WHILE YOU EAT MY BODY, DO YOU?

838
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,533
DON'T BE DISTRACTED IF A LITTLE TEAR COMES OUT.

839
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,900
YOU CAN JUST TELL YOURSELF IT'S BUTTER.

840
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,867
OH, WHAT IF A FISH WAS IN THE AUDIENCE?

841
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:32,567
THAT WOULD BE

842
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,567
AWKWARD FOR ALL OF US.

843
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,500
IT COULD HAPPEN, LAKE MICHIGAN'S RIGHT

844
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,767
THERE, BUDDY.

845
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,800
THE FISH WOULD LAUGH BUT ON THE INSIDE

846
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:41,834
IT'D BE CRYING.

847
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,567
SAD.

848
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,734
YOU AND YOU'RE FISH HEAD JOKE.

849
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,533
OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE PREFER IT LIKE THAT.

850
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:51,600
YEAH, I'LL HAVE FISH.

851
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:52,900
KEEP THE HEAD ON THERE AND, UH, FIND

852
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,033
OUT IF IT HAD A NICKNAME.

853
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,333
ANYWHO.

854
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,734
PIG ROAST. PIG ROAST WE ALWAYS HAVE THAT PIG

855
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,333
HEAD SITTING THERE.

856
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:06,233
WHICH IS SAD, BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL THEY KILLED THE PIG WHEN

857
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:07,567
IT WAS EATING AN APPLE.

858
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,333
HEY PIG, YOU WANT AN APPLE?

859
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:12,500
SURE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT SPEAR?

860
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:13,400
OW!

861
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,433
MID-BITE EVERY TIME.

862
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,900
AT LEAST THOSE ANIMALS AREN'T ALIVE.

863
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:22,567
I ALWAYS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN I GO INTO A SEAFOOD

864
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,767
RESTAURANT.

865
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,834
THEY HAVE THAT LOBSTER TANK SITTING THERE.

866
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,867
ALL THE LOBSTERS ARE PEERING OUT LIKE, HEY WHAT

867
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,333
ARE YOU HERE FOR?

868
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,233
UH, I'M HERE TO EAT YOU.

869
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:32,400
YEAH RIGHT.

870
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:33,867
HEY HARVEY, THIS GUY--

871
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,500
HARVEY?

872
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:39,767
OH AND HARVEY WAS GONE.

873
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,233
MY NIECE IS NINE YEARS OLD.

874
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:45,834
SHE INFORMED ME SHE'S A VEGETARIAN.

875
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:47,867
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PULLED THAT WHEN I WAS A KID.

876
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,667
UH, NO THANKS DAD.

877
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,200
I'M A VEGETARIAN.

878
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,433
NO SON OF MINE'S GAY.

879
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,900
EAT YOUR MEAT PUSSY.

880
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,834
HIS DAD SOUNDED SCARY.

881
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:02,166
HE'S WEIRD.

882
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,934
YOU EVER EAT FAST FOOD IN FRONT OF A VEGETARIAN?

883
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,734
THEY LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE BARBECUING A KITTEN.

884
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,100
OH MY GOD YOU'RE EATING THAT?

885
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:13,066
YEAH, AND I'M NOT GOING TO DIGEST IT FOR A DECADE.

886
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:18,333
COME ALONG WITH ME.

887
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,066
I DO LOVE THE VEGETARIANS THOUGH.

888
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,533
I ALWAYS GET A KICK OUT OF WHEN THEY TRY

889
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,834
AND IMPRESS YOU.

890
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,266
THEY'RE LIKE, I HAVEN'T HAD MEAT IN FIVE YEARS.

891
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,433
I HAVEN'T HAD A BANANA IN A MONTH.

892
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,400
YOU DON'T SEE ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT.

893
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,033
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO THOSE CHICKENS?

894
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:34,767
NO, BUT IT'S DELICIOUS.

895
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,233
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE ANIMALS.

896
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:48,900
I JUST LOVE TO EAT THEM MORE.

897
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,700
FUN TO PET, BETTER TO CHEW.

898
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,667
I DO FEEL BAD THEY HAVE TO BE KILLED.

899
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,734
I'D PREFER IF IT WAS LIKE AN ANIMAL SUICIDE.

900
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:00,700
MAYBE THE ANIMAL DESERVED IT.

901
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,166
THIS IS A GOOD CHICKEN SANDWICH I THINK THIS BASTARD

902
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,000
TRIED TO STEAL MY CAR.

903
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,533
GOOD WORK ROGER.

904
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:10,533
WHO'S ROGER?

905
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,667
I WAS JUST GETTING USED TO HARVEY.

906
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO SOME OF

907
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:19,033
THESE PEOPLE ARE

908
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,767
I CAN NEVER REALLY BE A VEGETARIAN THOUGH.

909
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,700
I LOVE STEAK TOO MUCH.

910
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,000
STEAK'S LIKE THE TUXEDO OF MEAT, ISN'T IT?

911
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,567
AND BOLOGNA'S THE RETARDED COUSIN.

912
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EATEN STEAK, SOMETHING SPECIAL'S HAPPENING.

913
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,734
IF YOU'RE EATING BOLOGNA, YOU MIGHT BE SPECIAL.

914
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:38,567
HEY, I LIKE BOLOGNA JERK HEAD.

915
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,400
YOU ACT IS BOLOGNA.

916
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,100
YOU'RE BOLOGNA HAS A LAST NAME AND

917
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,100
IT'S GAFFIGAN.

918
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:48,400
BOLOGNA HATER.

919
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,834
WHENEVER I DO GET A STEAK I ALWAYS GET A SALAD THINKING

920
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,433
THAT'LL BALANCE IT OUT.

921
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,166
YEAH, I'LL HAVE 20 POUNDS OF MEAT AND 2 LEAVES OF LETTUCE.

922
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:02,000
COVER IT.

923
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:03,166
I DO LOVE SALAD.

924
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,066
WELL, I SHOULD SAY I LOVE SALAD DRESSING WITH JUST A

925
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
TOUCH OF LETTUCE.

926
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:09,867
OTHERWISE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE EATING A BAG OF YARDWORK.

927
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:13,533
IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH CHEESE YOU HAVE TO PUT ON A SALAD TO

928
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,433
MAKE IT APPEALING.

929
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,400
YEAH, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE CHEESE AND CAN YOU THROW IN A

930
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,000
SNICKER'S BAR?

931
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,166
INSTEAD OF THE LETTUCE CAN I GET FRENCH FRIES?

932
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:25,233
WHEN YOU GO OUT TO DINNER THEY ALWAYS TRY

933
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,266
AND IMPROVE THE SALAD.

934
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,367
THEY'RE LIKE, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FRESH

935
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,100
PEPPER ON YOUR SALAD?

936
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,667
CAN ANYONE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

937
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,834
FRESH AND STALE PEPPER?

938
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,166
HEY WAIT A MINUTE!

939
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,667
THIS ISN'T FRESH PEPPER.

940
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,600
I GREW UP ON A PEPPER FARM.

941
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:41,100
SOME STALE ASS PEPPER.

942
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:44,834
I CAN'T EVEN TASTE THE PEPPER.

943
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:46,700
THEY MIGHT AS BE LIKE, WOULD YOU LIKE US TO WAVE THIS

944
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,567
WOODEN WAND OVER YOUR SALAD?

945
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,500
UH, ALL RIGHT.

946
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:54,066
LA, LA, LA, LA LA.

947
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,166
ENJOY YOUR MAGIC SALAD!

948
00:44:57,867 --> 00:45:01,367
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GETTING A MAGIC SALAD.

949
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,000
CAUSE REALLY, NONE OF US WANT SALAD.

950
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,033
WE HAVE TO TRICK OURSELVES INTO EATING SALAD.

951
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:16,767
YOU WANT A SALAD?

952
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,600
NO, NO.

953
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,734
YOU CAN GO TO THE SALAD BAR.

954
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:19,934
BAR?

955
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,000
ARE THERE GOING TO BE WOMEN OVER THERE?

956
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,900
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL OF A SALAD BAR.

957
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,734
I GO OUT TO DINNER SO I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN FOOD.

958
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,367
WHY WOULD I WANT TO MAKE MY OWN SALAD?

959
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,600
HERE'S OUR SALAD BAR AND OVER THERE'S OUR DISH-WASHING BAR.

960
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,500
AWESOME!

961
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,400
SOME OF THOSE ITEMS AT THE SALAD BAR, TOO.

962
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:46,200
THEY'VE GOT LETTUCE, TOMATOES, A TUB OF CHOCOLATE PUDDING.

963
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:51,200
WHO'S PUTTING CHOCOLATE PUDDING ON THEIR SALAD?

964
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,266
WHAT IS THIS, FEAR FACTOR?

965
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:56,066
OH THAT'S A GOOD SHOW.

966
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,900
I LIKE THAT SHOW, IT'S NEAT.

967
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,333
IT'S HARD TO EAT HEALTHY.

968
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,767
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, TOO.

969
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,900
SHOULD I HAVE THIS SALAD FOR $12 OR THESE EIGHT HAMBURGERS

970
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:07,166
FOR A NICKEL?

971
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,066
SORRY SALAD.

972
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,233
MOST HEALTH FOOD GETS CORRUPTED ANYWAY.

973
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,367
LIKE THE GRANOLA BAR.

974
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,734
THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY CORRUPTED.

975
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:19,867
BECAUSE YOU KNOW INITIALLY SOME GUY WAS LIKE, HEY KIDS

976
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,500
ARE EATING CANDY BARS, RIGHT?

977
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:24,500
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS SHAPE GRANOLA LIKE A CANDY BAR, KIDS

978
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,033
WILL EAT THE GRANOLA.

979
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:29,166
AND THEN LIKE A WEEK LATER, UH BILL, KIDS ARE NOT EATING

980
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,533
THESE GRANOLA BARS.

981
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,100
WELL, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PUT CHOCOLATE CHIPS

982
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:35,333
IN THE GRANOLA BAR.

983
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,000
KIDS WILL EAT THE GRANOLA.

984
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:40,100
UH, BILL KIDS ARE PICKING THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS OUT OF THE

985
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:42,734
GRANOLA BAR.

986
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:45,266
ALL YOU GOT TO DO WAS COVER IT IN CHOCOLATE.

987
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:47,667
GET RID OF FREAKING GRANOLA.

988
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,333
I GOTTA TELL YOU HOW DO EVERYTHING?

989
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,934
HE'S GOING TO BE SUED BY KUDOS.

990
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,934
WHEN DID THE MAFIA

991
00:46:57,967 --> 00:46:59,834
GET INVOLVED IN GRANOLA?

992
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,500
RIDICULOUS.

993
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,200
YOU EVER EAT A KUDOS AND YOU'RE LIKE, WELL

994
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:07,934
MIGHT AS WELL FINISH OFF THE WHOLE BOX.

995
00:47:11,066 --> 00:47:13,333
IF I'M GOING TO EAT HEALTHY, I'M GOING TO EAT REAL HEALTHY.

996
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:17,233
IT'S ALL RELATIVE, EATING HEALTHY.

997
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:19,600
I MEAN I EAT KIND OF HEALTHY, COMPARED TO SOME OF THE

998
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:22,200
ESKIMOS UP IN ALASKA.

999
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:24,934
THEY'RE EATING BLUBBER UP THERE.

1000
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,066
I'M PRACTICALLY STARVING MYSELF ON MY CINNABON.

1001
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:31,934
I'M MEAN, WHALE BLUBBER, THAT'S LIKE EATING A

1002
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:33,367
FAT GUY, ISN'T IT?

1003
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:36,900
THAT'S WHY ALASKA IS PART OF THE UNITED STATES.

1004
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:39,100
CANADIANS WENT IN THERE, SAW THEM EATING BLUBBER AND WERE

1005
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:41,266
LIKE HUH THE AMERICANS ALREADY GOT HERE.

1006
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,867
HEY THAT'S LIKE A GEOGRAPHY JOKE.

1007
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,333
BUDDY I WOULD'VE BROUGHT MY GLOBE IF I NEEDED IT.

1008
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,333
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1009
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:55,233
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS ANTI-ESKIMO.

1010
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,200
I'M MOVING A LITTLE SLOW TONIGHT.

1011
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:00,200
I HAD A HOT POCKET FOR DINNER.

1012
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:09,333
GOOD TO SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY WHITE TRASH HERE.

1013
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:12,767
I BUY THE HOT POCKETS.

1014
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,066
I GO IN GROCERY STORES, I'M LIKE, EH, I'LL GET THESE.

1015
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,066
I'VE NEVER EATEN A HOT POCKET AND THEN AFTERWARDS BEEN, I'M

1016
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,367
GLAD I ATE THAT.

1017
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:22,500
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, I'M GOING TO DIE.

1018
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,166
I PAID FOR THAT?

1019
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,567
DID I EAT IT OR RUB IT ON MY FACE?

1020
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,033
MY BACK HURTS.

1021
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,033
OW.

1022
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:38,900
I WAS LOOKING AT A BOX OF HOT POCKETS.

1023
00:48:38,934 --> 00:48:41,700
THEY HAVE A WARNING PRINTED ON THE SIDE.

1024
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:42,667
IT'S LIKE, WARNING!

1025
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,834
YOU JUST BOUGHT HOT POCKETS!

1026
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:47,900
HOPE YOU'RE DRUNK OR HEADING HOME TO A TRAILER.

1027
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,333
YOU HILLBILLY, ENJOY THE NEXT NASCAR EVENT.

1028
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:55,934
HOT POCKETS!

1029
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,100
I LIKE NASCAR, HE'S A JERK.

1030
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,200
NEVER REALLY SEE THAT ON A MENU WHEN

1031
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:10,700
YOU GO OUT TO DINNER.

1032
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,767
LET'S SEE I'LL HAVE THE CAESAR SALAD AND THE HOT POCKET.

1033
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,033
UH, TONIGHT'S SPECIALS, WE HAVE A SEA

1034
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:18,333
BASS WHICH IS BROILED.

1035
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:22,233
AND WE HAVE A HOT POCKET, WHICH IS COOKED IN A DIRTY

1036
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:22,934
MICROWAVE.

1037
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,033
AND THAT COMES WITH A SIDE OF PEPTO.

1038
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,166
IS YOU'RE HOT POCKET COLD IN THE MIDDLE?

1039
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,700
IT'S FROZEN.

1040
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:34,033
BUT IT CAN BE SERVED BOILING LAVA HOT.

1041
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:36,900
WILL IT BURN MY MOUTH?

1042
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:38,734
IT'LL DESTROY YOU MOUTH.

1043
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:41,934
EVERYTHING'LL TASTE LIKE RUBBER FOR A MONTH.

1044
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,166
I'LL HAVE THE HOT POCKET.

1045
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,166
HOT POCKET.

1046
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:51,066
HOT POCKETS, YOU KNOW?

1047
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,333
HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG.

1048
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,734
LIKE, 10 YEARS?

1049
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:55,166
HOW'D THEY COME UP WITH THAT?

1050
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,567
WAS THERE SOME GUY IN A MARKETING MEETING LIKE, HEY I

1051
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,567
GOT AN IDEA.

1052
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,166
HOW ABOUT WE FILL A POP

1053
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,500
AND IF YOU COOK IT IN A SLEEVE THING YOU COULD

1054
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:07,900
DUNK IT IN THE TOILET.

1055
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,300
HE'S WEIRD.

1056
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:16,066
THERE IS THE VEGETARIAN HOT POCKET, FOR THOSE OF US THAT

1057
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,667
DON'T WANT TO EAT MEAT, BUT STILL WOULD LIKE DIARRHEA.

1058
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:23,233
HOT POCKET.

1059
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,166
IT SHOULD JUST COME WITH A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER.

1060
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,433
DIARRHEA POCKET.

1061
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:31,367
YOU EVER NOTICE THERE'S NO DIGNIFIED WAY

1062
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,734
TO BUY TOILET PAPER?

1063
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:36,667
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BUY THAT MULTI-PACK OF LIKE 18 ROLLS.

1064
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,867
STICK IT IN YOUR CART.

1065
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,200
EVERYONE IN THE STORE'S LIKE, DOES THAT GUY

1066
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:41,266
EVER LEAVE THE BATHROOM?

1067
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:44,400
WHAT'S HE LIVING OFF OF HOT POCKETS?

1068
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:47,834
HOT POCKET.

1069
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:49,867
THERE'S THE LEAN POCKET.

1070
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,333
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE.

1071
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:53,266
IMAGINE THE DIRECTIONS.

1072
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,533
TAKE OUT OF BOX, PLACE DIRECTLY IN TOILET.

1073
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,166
FLUSH POCKET.

1074
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,100
POCKET, POCKET, POCKET POCKET.

1075
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:15,100
RECENTLY THEY INTRODUCED THE BREAKFAST HOT POCKET, FINALLY.

1076
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,533
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO START THE DAY.

1077
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:21,066
GOOD MORNING!

1078
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,934
YOU'RE ABOUT TO CALL IN SICK.

1079
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:26,767
HOT POCKET.

1080
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,734
NOW YOU CAN HAVE A HOT POCKET FOR BREAKFAST, A HOT POCKET

1081
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:39,266
FOR LUNCH AND BE DEAD BY DINNER.

1082
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,266
DEAD POCKET.

1083
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,934
I DO LOVE THAT JINGLE.

1084
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:47,500
DO YOU THINK THEY WORKED HARD ON THAT SONG?

1085
00:51:47,533 --> 00:51:49,100
WHAT DO YOU GOT SO FAR, BILL?

1086
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,567
UH, UH.

1087
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,433
HOT POCKET.

1088
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:54,934
THAT'S GOOD.

1089
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:56,200
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

1090
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:57,967
NOT AS GOOD AS YOUR "BY MENNEN," BUT IT'S GOOD.

1091
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:03,233
NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO RUN IN MEXICO?

1092
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,400
CALIENTE POCKET.

1093
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,166
YOU'VE GOT A GIFT MY FRIEND.

1094
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,500
DON'T HIDE THAT IN A BUSHEL BASKET!

1095
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:13,066
HOT POCKET.

1096
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:19,433
I SAW A COMMERCIAL FOR A CHICKEN POT PIE HOT POCKET.

1097
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:21,667
NOW THEY'RE JUST MESSING WITH US.

1098
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,100
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

1099
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:25,000
HAVE YOU TRIED THE HOT POCKET HOT POCKET?

1100
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,200
IT'S A HOT POCKET FILLED WITH A HOT POCKET.

1101
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,166
TASTES JUST LIKE A HOT POCKET.

1102
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,567
I'M GOING TO AN STICK MY HEAD IN THE MICROWAVE. HOT POCKET!

1103
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,900
HE WENT CRAZY UP THERE.

1104
00:52:37,934 --> 00:52:39,533
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE END THERE.

1105
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:42,233
I THOUGHT HE WAS ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING.

1106
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,567
VERY WEIRD.

1107
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:48,266
I UH-- I AM ALSO AN ACTOR.

1108
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,700
BUT I UH--

1109
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,667
I WISH I WAS A FILM DIRECTOR, JUST IN EVERYDAY LIFE.

1110
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,433
SO WHEN SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME A REALLY BORING STORY I COULD

1111
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:56,233
JUST GO, AND CUT.

1112
00:52:57,467 --> 00:52:58,667
I DIDN'T FINISH.

1113
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,934
WE GOT IT!

1114
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,166
THAT'S A WRAP.

1115
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,266
THAT WOULD COME IN HANDY.

1116
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,433
YOU COME HOME LATE.

1117
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:06,000
YOUR WIFE'S LIKE, WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?

1118
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:06,867
AND CUT.

1119
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,066
OK, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

1120
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,033
THIS TIME YOU DON'T CARE WHERE I WAS.

1121
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:13,233
IN FACT YOU'RE HAPPY TO SEE ME.

1122
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:14,433
LET'S TRY IT TOPLESS.

1123
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:15,367
ACTION!

1124
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,867
HE'S A JERK.

1125
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,667
THAT GUY'S A JERK.

1126
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,734
I DO HAVE A WIFE.

1127
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,734
I GOT MARRIED.

1128
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,233
MY WIFE CHANGED HER NAME.

1129
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:28,367
I KNOW SOME WOMEN HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

1130
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,200
BUT I WANTED HER TO HAVE MY OLD GIRLFRIEND'S NAME.

1131
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:35,233
SO CALL ME OLD FASHIONED.

1132
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:38,367
BUT THIS FELLA DOES WHAT THE BIBLE TELLS HIM.

1133
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,233
THE BIBLE DOESN'T

1134
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,233
SAY THAT AT ALL.

1135
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,200
HE'S DUMB AS A ROCK.

1136
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:48,266
I DON'T THINK MY WIFE'S PARENTS LIKE ME THOUGH.

1137
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,867
BECAUSE APPARENTLY WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE'S MOTHER YOU'RE

1138
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,533
NOT SUPPOSED TO HUG HER AND GO, OH YEAH.

1139
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,266
THIS FEELS RIGHT.

1140
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,734
AND IF THEIR DAD'S SHORT, DON'T TRY AND PICK HIM UP.

1141
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,900
OH YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE BABY DADDY.

1142
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,934
IT'S A BABY DADDY.

1143
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:10,033
WHEE!

1144
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,367
STRANGE.

1145
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,233
I DO LOVE BEING MARRIED.

1146
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:18,200
I HATED BEING SINGLE, YOU KNOW?

1147
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:19,500
THE WORST IS WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE OUT AND

1148
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:20,900
THEY TURN YOU DOWN.

1149
00:54:20,934 --> 00:54:22,767
CAUSE REALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1150
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,767
I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE EATING A FREE MEAL AROUND YOU.

1151
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,166
YOU MAKE ME WANT TO GO ON A DIET.

1152
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
IT ALWAYS GOES BACK

1153
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
TO FOOD WITH HIM.

1154
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:34,166
SAD.

1155
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,266
IT'S AN ISSUE.

1156
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,400
I LOVE MY WIFE.

1157
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:39,567
BUT RECENTLY SHE HAS GOTTEN VERY LAZY.

1158
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,867
OR AS SHE DESCRIBES IT, PREGNANT.

1159
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,834
I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT.

1160
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:47,500
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MOVE THOSE CINDER BLOCKS.

1161
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:50,734
OK, HE BETTER BE JOKING.

1162
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,100
CAUSE THAT AIN'T FUNNY FELLA.

1163
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,000
PREGNANCY IS AN AMAZING SACRIFICE, ISN'T IT?

1164
00:54:58,033 --> 00:54:59,567
OCCASIONALLY MY WIFE DOES COMPLAIN.

1165
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED, I'M HUNGRY

1166
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:03,266
I'M COLD, LET ME BACK INSIDE.

1167
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:08,100
MOVE THOSE CINDER BLOCKS, I'LL LET YOU BACK IN.

1168
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:12,200
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

1169
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,166
WE ALREADY HAVE ONE DAUGHTER.

1170
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,567
WE DID A HOME BIRTH.

1171
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,266
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT, THAT MEANS YOU TAKE THE

1172
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,033
HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND

1173
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:21,900
JUST THROW THAT AWAY.

1174
00:55:22,934 --> 00:55:24,900
AND YOU WING IT!

1175
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:26,934
HEY, I CAN'T PROGRAM A VCR.

1176
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:28,033
I'M HERE TO HELP.

1177
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:30,734
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STAND TERRIFIED?

1178
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:35,166
CAUSE THAT WILL BE MY CONTRIBUTION.

1179
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,400
I DID LEARN A LOT. I TELL YA.

1180
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,600
I COULD NEVER HAVE A BABY CAUSE I DON'T HAVE A UTERUS.

1181
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,033
BUT EVEN IF I DID HAVE A UTERUS, I DON'T THINK I COULD

1182
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:44,033
DO IT, LADIES.

1183
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:46,033
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE SEX WITH A MAN.

1184
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:49,266
UNLESS HE LOOKED LIKE ME.

1185
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,200
THEN IT WOULD BE HOT.

1186
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,100
SOME JIM ON JIM ACTION.

1187
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,667
HE'S WEIRD.

1188
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,934
I DO LOVE BEING A DAD THOUGH.

1189
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:08,734
PEOPLE TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING A NEWBORN.

1190
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:10,734
ESPECIALLY IN STRIP CLUBS.

1191
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:14,533
HEY THAT WAS A TRICK

1192
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:14,533
JOKE, FELLA.

1193
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,200
IT WAS A TRICK ONE.

1194
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:20,233
TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, TRICK.

1195
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:22,266
I DID NOTHING TODAY.

1196
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,266
THAT'S MY FAVORITE ACTIVITY.

1197
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,567
I, UH--

1198
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,567
SOME OTHER LAZY PEOPLE.

1199
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:27,266
THERE YOU GO.

1200
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,900
I LOVE DOING NOTHING.

1201
00:56:28,934 --> 00:56:30,867
YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE YOU DO NOTHING THOUGH.

1202
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,266
THEY'RE LIKE, WE WENT SHOPPING TODAY, WHAT'D YOU DO?

1203
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,066
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1204
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,533
OH, WELL YOU COULD'VE COME WITH US.

1205
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,100
I'D RATHER DIE.

1206
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,400
THAT'S WHY I LOVE RAINY DAYS.

1207
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,867
YOU WAKE UP YOU'RE LIKE, WELL IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT DOING

1208
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,567
CRAP TODAY.

1209
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,200
HUH?

1210
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:48,233
IT'S TOO BAD. I WAS PROBABLY GOING

1211
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:49,266
TO GO KAYAKING.

1212
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:52,000
CLIMB A GIANT ROCK OR SOMETHING.

1213
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,200
BUT NOW I'LL PROBABLY JUST NAP.

1214
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:57,233
YOU EVER NOT GO OUTSIDE ALL DAY AND THEN WHEN YOU FINALLY

1215
00:56:57,266 --> 00:57:00,500
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE EXPLORING ANOTHER PLANET?

1216
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:02,834
OH IT IS LOUD OUT HERE.

1217
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,400
THE AIR MOVES AND EVERYTHING, HUH?

1218
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,367
AND IF YOU STAY UP LATE ENOUGH THERE'S NO

1219
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,200
PRESSURE TO DO ANYTHING.

1220
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:15,734
YOU'RE LIKE, 3:00 AM I'M NOT GOING TO DO

1221
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:18,100
LAUNDRY LIKE A WEIRDO.

1222
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:21,333
I'M GOING TO DOWNLOAD PORN LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

1223
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:25,100
THAT'S NOT NORMAL AT ALL.

1224
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:29,266
IT IS CRAZY HOW THE INTERNET AND

1225
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:29,266
EMAILS CHANGED OUR LIVES.

1226
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,900
YOU EVER GET A HAND WRITTEN LETTER IN THE MAIL TODAY?

1227
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:33,667
YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT THE HELL?

1228
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,200
HAS SOMEONE BEEN KIDNAPPED?

1229
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:40,266
HUH, I'M NOT OPENING IT, IT'S PROBABLY FILLED WITH ANTHRAX

1230
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,266
OR SOMETHING.

1231
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:45,867
AND EMAILS DEFINITELY MADE SENDING REGULAR MAIL A CHORE.

1232
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,000
YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT I STUCK IT IN AN ENVELOPE, NOW I GOT TO

1233
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,500
GO OUTSIDE?

1234
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,233
WHAT AM I, A TRIATHLETE HERE?

1235
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,934
WORK, WORK WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK.

1236
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,367
YOU EVER HAVE THAT FRIEND THAT SENDS REALLY LONG EMAILS?

1237
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,033
YOU OPEN THEM UP, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT HOMEWORK.

1238
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:05,200
I CAN'T READ THIS DISSERTATION NOW.

1239
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:07,367
I'M GOING TO KEEP THAT AS NEW.

1240
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,433
I NEVER EVEN READ THEM HALF THE TIME.

1241
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,266
I JUST HIT REPLY, SOUNDS GOOD.

1242
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,600
DON'T WRITE BACK, EVER.

1243
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:18,400
EMAIL IS SO EASY THOUGH.

1244
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:19,667
EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE TO WRITE AN EMAIL TO A

1245
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,900
REALLY SMART PERSON.

1246
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:22,200
I GET ALL TENSE.

1247
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:23,667
I'M LIKE, GREAT, NOW I HAVE TO BE SURE THIS

1248
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,934
IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE.

1249
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:28,567
GUESS I'LL CAPITALIZE A LETTER OR TWO.

1250
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:32,166
THAT'S A SYMPTOM OF BEING LAZY WHEN YOU CAN'T QUITE

1251
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,533
REACH THE SHIFT KEY.

1252
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:38,433
UHHHH!

1253
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:40,400
THEY GET THE IDEA.

1254
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,867
THANK GOD FOR SPELL CHECK, HUH?

1255
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,166
SPELL CHECK SAVES ME CONSTANTLY.

1256
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,266
I GET SUCH AN ATTITUDE WITH SPELL CHECK THOUGH.

1257
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,200
LIKE, NO!

1258
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:52,166
THAT'S A PERSON'S NAME SPELL CHECK.

1259
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:56,367
SO ARE SO DUMB SPELL CHECK.

1260
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,934
I WAS RIGHT.

1261
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,333
YOU WERE WRONG.

1262
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:02,533
OH, THAT IS HOW YOU SPELL WEDNESDAY.

1263
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:05,266
THANKS SPELL CHECK.

1264
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,734
HE WAS TALKING TO SPELL CHECK.

1265
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,700
SPELL CHECK.

1266
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:12,867
I AM A HORRIBLE SPELLER.

1267
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,266
YOU KNOW YOUR A POOR SPELLER WHEN YOU'RE WRITING SOMETHING

1268
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,166
AND YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT BASED ON

1269
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,100
THE WORDS YOU KNOW HOW TO SPELL.

1270
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,500
HMM, NO ONE'S HERE, I'LL LEAVE A NOTE.

1271
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,500
GUESS I'LL SEE YOU, TOMOR-- TOMORR--

1272
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:25,500
NEXT WEEK.

1273
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:29,400
I GOT TO GET SPELL CHECK FOR THIS PEN.

1274
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,533
THIS GUY IS WEIRD.

1275
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,400
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE WEIRD.

1276
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:37,533
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE TO THINK THERE'S SOMEONE WEIRDER.

1277
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:38,900
I'M SURE SOME OF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME GOING, WELL AT

1278
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:41,600
LEAST I'M NOT AS WEIRD AS GAFFIGAN.

1279
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:43,367
AND THEN I'M THINKING, WELL AT LEAST I'M NOT AS WEIRD AS

1280
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,266
THOSE PEOPLE IN THE LOONY BIN.

1281
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,567
AND THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE LOONY BIN ARE GOING, WELL AT

1282
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,033
LEAST I'M AN ORANGE.

1283
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,934
HEY, I LIKE ORANGES.

1284
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:57,333
THERE'S SO MANY WEIRD

1285
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:57,333
SITUATIONS IN LIFE ANYWAY.

1286
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:59,333
YOU EVER MIX TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FRIENDS?

1287
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:01,033
THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL.

1288
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:03,266
YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO PREP THEM.

1289
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,400
YOU'RE LIKE, HEY YEAH UM, UH THESE PEOPLE OVER HERE, UH,

1290
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:09,000
THEY DON'T THINK I DRINK.

1291
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,767
DON'T BE THROWN BY MY BRITISH ACCENT.

1292
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,200
GO ALONG WITH IT.

1293
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:23,066
I LOVE WHEN I'M IN BIG CITIES LIKE CHICAGO AND I SEE A

1294
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,400
POLICEMAN ON A HORSE.

1295
01:00:24,433 --> 01:00:28,066
FOR A SECOND I'M ALWAYS LIKE, DID CANADA INVADE?

1296
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,100
WHAT'D, WHAT'D YOU COME FROM A TIME MACHINE?

1297
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,266
YOU EVER SEE THE POLICEMAN ON THE HORSE?

1298
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,233
THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT LOOK LIKE, WHY IS

1299
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:36,667
EVERYONE LOOKING AT ME?

1300
01:00:38,033 --> 01:00:40,834
JUST ON A 2 TON ANIMAL IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY.

1301
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,700
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

1302
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,934
YOU THINK THAT HORSE EVER COMES IN HANDY?

1303
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,066
THERE'S SOME ROBBERY, YOU KNOW--

1304
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,266
COP, I'M GOING TO KILL EVERY

1305
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,867
I LOVE PONIES.

1306
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,533
CAN I PET YOUR PONY?

1307
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:57,767
POLICEMEN ON THE HORSE.

1308
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,700
THEY PROBABLY RARELY GO UNDERCOVER, HUH?

1309
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,600
CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM INFILTRATING THE MAFIA.

1310
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:06,600
HEY, IT'S VINNY THE HORSE.

1311
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:09,633
VINNY THE HORSE, WHY YOU ALWAYS ON A HORSE?

1312
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,934
THAT WAS THE WORST

1313
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,934
ITALIAN AMERICAN

1314
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:13,333
IMPRESSION I'VE EVER HEARD.

1315
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:18,433
HEY, IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY.

1316
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,934
I LOVE HOW WE MEASURE THE

1317
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,934
DIFFICULTY OF EVERYTHING

1318
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:22,400
VERSUS BRAIN SURGERY.

1319
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:25,000
HEY IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY.

1320
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:27,100
IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY.

1321
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:28,233
WHAT DO BRAIN SURGEONS SAY?

1322
01:01:28,266 --> 01:01:32,166
LIKE, HEY IT AIN'T LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO TALK TO WOMEN.

1323
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,500
HEY I'M A BRAIN

1324
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,500
SURGEON, BUDDY.

1325
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:39,900
AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT.

1326
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:43,066
HE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

1327
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,533
I DO WANT EVERYONE TO

1328
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,533
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

1329
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,100
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JESUS.

1330
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:52,066
HE BETTER NOT.

1331
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,433
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR RELIGIOUS OR NOT.

1332
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:57,734
DOES ANYTHING MAKES YOU FEEL MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN SOME

1333
01:01:57,767 --> 01:02:00,600
STRANGER GOING, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JESUS.

1334
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,567
YEAH, I'D LIKE YOU NOT TO.

1335
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,000
WE COULD SAY THAT TO THE POPE.

1336
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:06,934
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JESUS.

1337
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:09,066
YOU'D BE LIKE, EASY FREAK.

1338
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,266
GOT TO KEEP WORK AT WORK.

1339
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,767
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WAS A GOOD IMPRESSION OF THE POPE.

1340
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:20,400
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1341
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:25,700
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE BIBLE MYSELF.

1342
01:02:25,734 --> 01:02:28,033
I HAVEN'T READ IT, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO,

1343
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:29,433
BECAUSE I'M CATHOLIC.

1344
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,700
OH, HE'S GOING TO HELL.

1345
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:35,000
NOT A LOT OF CATHOLICS HAVE READ THE BIBLE.

1346
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:37,333
IT'S A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON RULES FOR CATHOLICS.

1347
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,100
IT'S NOT LIKE OTHER RELIGIONS.

1348
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:42,066
HINDUS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT MEAT, THEY DON'T EAT MEAT.

1349
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,667
CATHOLICS ARE LIKE, ONLY EAT FISH ON FRIDAYS.

1350
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,900
UNLESS YOU FORGET.

1351
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:50,266
EH, DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.

1352
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,066
WE'LL SEE YOU AT EASTER.

1353
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:54,700
MY WIFE--

1354
01:02:54,734 --> 01:02:56,166
MY WIFE'S REALLY CATHOLIC.

1355
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,266
SHE'S LIKE A SHIITE CATHOLIC.

1356
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,233
SHE'S ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT DIABLO.

1357
01:03:03,266 --> 01:03:05,166
SO I JOKE AROUND WITH HER, I'LL CALL HER UP.

1358
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,400
SHE'LL SAY, WHO IS THIS?

1359
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,333
AND I'LL JUST GO, THE DEVIL.

1360
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,033
SHE BRINGS ME TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

1361
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:16,166
IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A CATHOLIC MASS THAT IS THE

1362
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,166
LONGEST EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE.

1363
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,233
MAKES YOU LOOK FORWARD TO

1364
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:23,033
GOING TO THE DMV.

1365
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,333
AT TIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE DRAGGING

1366
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,834
CHURCH OUT ON PURPOSE.

1367
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:29,767
AH, AH AH!

1368
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,734
AH, AH AH!

1369
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,700
AH, AH, AH! AH, AMEN, ALREADY!

1370
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:40,567
LET'S WRAP IT UP I'VE GOT SOME SINNING TO DO.

1371
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:45,033
TOO MUCH STANDING INVOLVED IN CHURCH.

1372
01:03:45,066 --> 01:03:47,200
CAN'T I LIE DOWN AND WORSHIP?

1373
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,333
WHILE I'M EATING A  HOT POCKET!

1374
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,400
GOD POCKET!

1375
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,767
I MOSTLY DAYDREAM IN CHURCH.

1376
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,867
I ALWAYS HAVE THAT INTROSPECTIVE LOOK IN MY FACE.

1377
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,066
LIKE, HMM.

1378
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,767
BUT ON THE INSIDE I'M LIKE, DID I GO TO

1379
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,233
WENDY'S TWICE YESTERDAY?

1380
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:11,233
NOT A GOOD CATHOLIC.

1381
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,200
I DON'T EVEN FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN SOMEONE'S PRAYING NEXT TO

1382
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:14,200
ME IN CHURCH.

1383
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,200
I'M LIKE, CAN YOU DO THAT OUTSIDE?

1384
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,433
I'M TRYING TO CHECK OUT SOME OF THE LADIES IN HERE.

1385
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,934
I DO HAVE THE DIRTIEST THOUGHTS IN CHURCH.

1386
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:25,667
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, PEACE BE WITH YOU AND AN

1387
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,533
EXTRA PEACE FOR YOU.

1388
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,233
YOU DESERVE IT.

1389
01:04:32,266 --> 01:04:34,600
MY WIFE ALWAYS WANTS ME TO GO TO CONFESSION.

1390
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:36,567
DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY

1391
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,100
LYING TO A HOLY MAN.

1392
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:42,200
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW HONEST PEOPLE ARE BEING IN THERE.

1393
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:44,266
THEY GO IN THERE FOR LIKE A MINUTE AND A HALF, YEAH I

1394
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,333
LIED, I DOUBLE PARKED, CAN WE WRAP THIS UP?

1395
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:47,533
I'M MEETING A HOOKER.

1396
01:04:48,533 --> 01:04:49,800
YEAH, GRAZIE PADRE.

1397
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:53,467
IT'S SILLY.

1398
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,266
SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH AT CHURCH

1399
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,266
IS MEMORIZATION.

1400
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,834
I HAVE A HORRIBLE MEMORY.

1401
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:59,600
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN WITHOUT THE

1402
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,100
APPROVED WRITTEN CONSENT OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.

1403
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,266
I LOVE DOING THAT JOKE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS ONE FACING IN

1404
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,367
THE AUDIENCE, YOU'RE GOING TO HELL.

1405
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:14,433
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO BUMP INTO IN HEAVEN.

1406
01:05:14,467 --> 01:05:16,233
BE LIKE, HEY REMEMBER ME?

1407
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,100
YOU'RE HERE?

1408
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,100
YEAH. PETER LOVES MY STUFF.

1409
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:24,867
I'M GOING TO BE DOING A SHOW DOWN NEAR THE

1410
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,367
PEARLY GATES LATER ON.

1411
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,066
PEARLY GATES.

1412
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,600
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT FINDS IT ODD THAT HEAVEN HAS GATES?

1413
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:33,834
GATES?

1414
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:36,233
WHAT KIND OF A NEIGHBORHOOD IS HEAVEN IN?

1415
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,767
WHAT DO YOU DIE AND YOU GO TO A GATED COMMUNITY?

1416
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,567
ARE THE GATES NECESSARY?

1417
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,934
YEAH, WE HAD A LOT OF KIDS SNEAKING IN USING THE POOL.

1418
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:49,200
THOSE GATES WEREN'T EASY.

1419
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:51,533
WE HAD TO GO DOWN TO HELL, GET A CONTRACTOR AND EVERYTHING.

1420
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,400
HEY I'M A CONTRACTOR.

1421
01:06:04,934 --> 01:06:08,166
IN TV AND FILMS WHENEVER THEY SHOW SOMEONE GOING TO HEAVEN

1422
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,266
THEY ALWAYS SHOW THEM GOING UP AN ESCALATOR.

1423
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,367
LIKE HEAVEN'S IN THE MALL OR SOMETHING.

1424
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:15,367
HEY CAN WE STOP BY ORANGE JULIUS?

1425
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:20,166
THAT PLACE ISN'T EVEN

1426
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:20,166
OPEN ANYMORE.

1427
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:23,433
I THINK RELIGION'S FASCINATING.

1428
01:06:23,467 --> 01:06:26,767
ADAM AND EVE KICKED OUT OF PARADISE FOR EATING AN APPLE.

1429
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,033
AN APPLE.

1430
01:06:28,066 --> 01:06:30,100
WOULD YOU EVER HAVE BEEN TEMPTED BY AN APPLE?

1431
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:33,266
I'D BE LIKE, COVER IT IN CARAMEL AND COME BACK TO ME.

1432
01:06:34,133 --> 01:06:36,200
YOU GOT CAKE BACK THERE?

1433
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:39,233
I LOVE CAKE.

1434
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:41,233
JESUS, OF COURSE, WAS A CARPENTER.

1435
01:06:41,266 --> 01:06:42,166
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

1436
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,233
YOU THINK JESUS WAS A GOOD CARPENTER?

1437
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,033
BECAUSE THE BIBLE DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS IT.

1438
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:47,867
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS BACK THEN PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN, GOOD

1439
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,734
THING THAT MESSIAH THING WORKED OUT.

1440
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:52,367
YEAH, HE BUILT A SHED FOR MY COUSIN.

1441
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,867
WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.

1442
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:57,333
AND THE ENTIRE TIME HE'S LIKE, I'M THE SON OF GOD.

1443
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:59,333
WELL RIGHT NOW YOU'RE BUILDING A SHED.

1444
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:05,166
SO HOP TO IT, "HEY-ZEUS".

1445
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,600
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF I WAS ELECTROCUTED RIGHT NOW?

1446
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:12,867
HE DID A JESUS JOKE AND

1447
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:12,867
HE WAS ELECTROCUTED.

1448
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,200
IT WAS THE BEST SHOW

1449
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,200
I'VE EVER SEEN.

1450
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,033
AND IT'S HELPED MY FAITH.

1451
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:24,066
I THINK IT'S FASCIN-- I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE

1452
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:24,066
OVERHEARD THAT CONVERSATION,

1453
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,700
WHERE MARY EXPLAINED TO JOSEPH THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

1454
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:30,433
JOSEPH WASN'T THE FATHER?

1455
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,567
JOSEPH? - YEAH.

1456
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,533
YEAH, UM UH.

1457
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:37,066
YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER MADE LOVE?

1458
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,266
YEAH.

1459
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:42,500
YEAH UM ANYWAY, UH.

1460
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:46,433
LAST NIGHT AN ANGEL VISITED ME--

1461
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:49,400
AND NOW I'M PREGNANT.

1462
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,734
JESUS CHRIST!

1463
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:55,667
OH, YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT.

1464
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,233
IT WOULD'VE BEEN HARD TO GET JESUS A PRESENT BACK THEN.

1465
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:05,734
CAUSE WHATEVER YOU GOT HIM AS A PRESENT BACK THEN IT MUST

1466
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:07,934
HAVE BEEN, OH PAIR OF SOCKS, THANKS.

1467
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:10,200
YOU KNOW I'M DYING FOR YOUR SINS, RIGHT?

1468
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,834
YEAH, BUT THANKS

1469
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,834
FOR THE SOCKS.

1470
01:08:13,867 --> 01:08:16,166
THEY'LL GO GREAT WITH MY SANDALS.

1471
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,266
WHAT AM I, GERMAN?

1472
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,767
I'M OFFENDED ON SO MANY

1473
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,767
DIFFERENT LEVELS.

1474
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:27,900
WHAT IF MOSES WAS HERE?

1475
01:08:29,867 --> 01:08:31,734
WE ALL KNOW MOSES LED THE ISRAELITES OUT OF EGYPT.

1476
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:34,433
THEY WANDERED IN THE DESERT FOR 40 YEARS.

1477
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:36,100
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT AFTER A YEAR I WOULD HAVE

1478
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:38,533
BEEN, THIS MOSES DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL HE'S GOING!

1479
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:41,200
I APPRECIATE HIM GETTING US OUT OF EGYPT.

1480
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:43,066
BUT WE'RE IN THE DESERT, FOLKS.

1481
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,500
AS IN NO AGUA.

1482
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,834
THEY WOULDN'T SAY AGUA.

1483
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:53,066
AND AFTER MOSES PARTED THE RED SEA DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

1484
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,066
WAS HE LIKE, TA-DAH!

1485
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:57,166
HOW ABOUT THEM APPLES?

1486
01:08:58,367 --> 01:08:59,433
THAT'LL STOP SOME OF YOUR BITCHING.

1487
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,166
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

1488
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,166
CHRONOLOGICALLY ACCURATE.

1489
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,600
THIS GUY'S GOING TO HELL IN TWO RELIGIONS.

1490
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:11,200
HE'S PRACTICALLY SPRINTING THERE.

1491
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,700
DON'T WORRY, YOU KNOW GOD HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

1492
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:19,934
BECAUSE HE WAS TALKING TO MOSES AS A BURNING BUSH.

1493
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:21,934
A BURNING BUSH?

1494
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:24,166
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON MOSES TOLD

1495
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,567
ABOUT THAT?

1496
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,200
YEAH, GOD JUST TALKED TO ME AS A BURNING BUSH.

1497
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:32,900
SURE HE DID.

1498
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,200
MOSES WE THINK MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN BURNING SOME BUSH.

1499
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,166
ALL RIGHT THAT IS ALL FOR ME.

1500
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,166
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU GUYS.

1501
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,300
-JOSH.

1502
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:21,033
FIRST LINE WOULD BE AWESOME.

1503
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:24,900
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I WRITE THANKS FOR THE KISSES?

1504
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:25,233
-YES.

1505
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:26,200
-OK.

1506
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:28,400
-HEH-HEH-HEH! -UH-HUH, HUH!

1507
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:29,433
-HI.

1508
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,500
-HA HA HAH HA!

1509
01:10:34,633 --> 01:10:36,600
-AHHHHH! -AH HA HA HA!

1510
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,633
HOT POCKETS.

1511
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,066
POT PIE EXPRESS.

1512
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,233
THAT'S WEIRD.

1513
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,066
-I LOVE YOU... -I AM TELLING YOUR WIFE.

1514
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,533
-SHE'S RIGHT AROUND HERE.

1515
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,200
-YOU CAN SIGN IT TO WHOEVER YOU LIKE.

1516
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:55,000
-YOU. -YES.

1517
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:59,500
-CAN YOU MAKE IT TO KYM, K-Y-M, MARK, AND BEAN .

1518
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:00,433
THIS IS BEAN.

1519
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:02,700
YOU KNOW  MY WIFE'S PREGNANT.

1520
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:03,667
WHEN ARE YOU DUE?

1521
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,066
-UH, SIX WEEKS.

1522
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:08,000
NOVEMBER 16TH.

1523
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:09,333
I'M NOVEMBER 20TH.

1524
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:10,200
-OH WOW!

1525
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,200
-WE SHOULD HAVE OUR BABIES, YOU KNOW--

1526
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:13,266
-WE'RE HAVING A BOY, I DON'T KNOW...

1527
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,767
-WE'RE HAVING A BOY TOO.

1528
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,834
MAYBE THEY'LL BOTH BE GAY

1529
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,834
AND THEY COULD HANG OUT.

1530
01:11:16,867 --> 01:11:18,233
-HA HA HA HA!

1531
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,066
-OH THAT IS SO FUNNY. -OH YEAH!
