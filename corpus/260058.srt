1
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,421
It's not their problem.
It's ours.

2
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,218
Like it's not theirs,
it's our problem.

3
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,698
Fucking assholes of the world.

4
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,830
Leaking their shit into my yard.

5
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,841
Fuel-leaking motherfuckers.

6
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,617
It's bullshit, man.
It's bullshit.

7
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,802
<i>All right, in case Mrs. Wilson</i>
<i>hasn't said so...</i>

8
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,680
<i>seniors who are late see her,</i>
<i>sophomores and juniors see me.</i>

9
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,279
Mr. Wimms, you're late.

10
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,551
Yeah, special situation. I had to get
my cousin Nikki. It's her first day.

11
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,717
Tough break. She's late too.

12
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,261
- Go ahead.
- <i>This is the office.</i>

13
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,559
<i>Kelvin Macrae</i>
<i>is returning to school.</i>

14
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,532
- Says who?
- <i>Says Kelvin.</i>

15
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,625
Oh, yeah?
You send him to me right now.

16
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,965
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

17
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,201
One more time, and it's ice for you
for a week, my friend.

18
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,767
You know, Mr. C., you ain't makin'
a good impression on my cousin here.

19
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,403
- Bye.
- Later.

20
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,142
- Name?
- Nikki Patterson.

21
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,616
Oh, yeah. Midterm transfer
from Brooklyn, right?

22
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,119
- Yeah, East New York.
- East New York, right.

23
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,816
Well, things are different
here in Detroit.

24
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,951
- Yeah, you have more walkie-talkies.
- Exactly. Very different.

25
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,519
- Mr. Cimino.
- Hello, Michelle.

26
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,464
- Look, this isn't my fault.
- It's my fault, Mr. Cimino.

27
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,867
By the way, that's a nice tie. MyJeep
broke down and had to be towed.

28
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,371
Towed?

29
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,101
And I have a note here
from my mechanic.

30
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,700
- Your mechanic?
- Glazer!

31
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,412
- Come on, Michelle.
- What? YourJeep didn't break down.

32
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,748
- Lovers quarrel, huh?
- No, Mr. Cimino.

33
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,880
This has nothing to do with lovers.
Not anymore.

34
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,297
This one's on me, pal.

35
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:49,203
Nut, get down here.
Take off the hat.

36
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,576
Off with the hat!

37
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,207
Didn't I tell you next time I see you,
I want to see you with your parents?

38
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,716
Where's your mother?

39
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,213
- Where's your father?
- How many times do I gotta tell you?

40
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,314
When a teacher tells you
to leave the room, you leave the room.

41
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,382
- But I wasn't doin' nothing!
- I don't care.

42
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,894
Next time, your ass is gonna be
out on the street.

43
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,090
Don't embarrass me in front of a
beautiful sister. It's not that serious.

44
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,134
- I ain't your sister.
- Shit.

45
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,897
- That's right, I ain't your sister.
- Don't mess with her, Nut.

46
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,200
- She'll be in your face.
- We'll see about that.

47
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,207
Yeah, we will too.

48
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,869
Don't worry about him.
He's in special ed.

49
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,639
- For the gifted.
- Yeah.

50
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,115
It's our gift to you that
you're still here. A week in ice.

51
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,558
Two weeks in ice.

52
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,425
- Go for three.
- Enjoy the hat.

53
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,315
Dad?

54
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,497
- Zack.
- How ya doin'?

55
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,237
- What's up?
- What are you doin' home?

56
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,249
What's it look like?

57
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,982
Downtown store was dead,
so I closed up early.

58
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,384
I don't know. People just aren't
walking in off the streets.

59
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,396
People aren't walking in off the streets
because there are no one on the streets.

60
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,901
Well, well! Figured that all out
by yourself, did you?

61
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,765
It's all right.

62
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,509
It's a specialty business.

63
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,481
Besides, downtown's
bouncin' back anyway.

64
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,744
Dad, you know I split up
with Michelle today.

65
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,449
She wasn't puttin' out, huh?

66
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,182
Not like some.

67
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,725
Keep laughing, Richard.

68
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,354
See what happens next time
you want a blow job off the turnpike.

69
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,582
Don't listen to any of that.

70
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,092
Yeah.

71
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,530
- So we losin' the store?
- No, but I'm losing money.

72
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,493
It's suckin' off every buck
we make at the mall.

73
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,369
So maybe Diane's right.

74
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,169
Fuck Diane.

75
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,409
So, what happened with Michelle?

76
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,577
- She wasn't right for me.
- Fuck her too.

77
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,589
Thanks, Dad.

78
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,975
Yo, Zack, hey,
the big spenders are here.

79
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,411
Those are my grandparents, man.
Watch your mouth.

80
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,923
- Hello, Zack.
- Hi, Nana. Hi, Pops.

81
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,787
I'd kiss you, but the garlic's
a little heavy today.

82
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,387
A kiss is a kiss, honey.

83
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,865
That's my boy.

84
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,732
Want some bread?
How come you guys don't eat my bread?

85
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,766
Well, if you're gonna give it to him,
give it to him.

86
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,741
Zack, it's been 12 years
since Mommy died.

87
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,245
- What's this?
- It's a Yortzeit candle.

88
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,311
Light it next week
on the anniversary of her death.

89
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,954
I gotta get back inside,
finish up work.

90
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,803
You guys are gonna smell
like garlic now.

91
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,467
- I'll see you at the store later.
- All right, Pops.

92
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,695
What's up, man?
What's going on?

93
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,600
- Out of my locker, man.
- Ten dollars each.

94
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,542
- Ten dollars apiece, boy.
- I ain't got nothin' for you.

95
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,637
- She wasn't right for you anyway.
- Nah?

96
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,844
She was too smart, too mature,
too beautiful, too suave.

97
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,684
- Hey, fellas, what's up?
- How you doin', man?

98
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,714
- Yo, let us have two for twenty.
- This shit is fifteen apiece, man.

99
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,557
Oh, but you give it to the brothers
for ten each, right?

100
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,494
You see how he does me, man?

101
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,657
We were bar mitzvahed together,
and he's hustling me.

102
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,634
Hustling you? Are you stupid, man?
This shit is flavor, B.

103
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,194
- Let me get a taste.
- No, you gotta get that on your own.

104
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,070
- You forgot, huh?
- Yeah.

105
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,574
Yeah, whatever.

106
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,810
Damn, man! Look at your eyes.
All fucked up on crack.

107
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,784
Yo, Nut, check this brother's eyes.
He fucked up or what?

108
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,689
What's up with you, bitch? Smokin'
the commercial weed joints and shit.

109
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,159
Just get the fuck out of here
and leave my homeboy alone.

110
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,163
My shit ain't weak, man.
My shit's sent down from the gods.

111
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,529
- Let me hit that shit, then.
- It's for special people, man.

112
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,501
- That's why you don't have none.
- Let me hit it. You just frontin'.

113
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,698
- Ain't no future in that shit, man.
- What kind of name is Nut, anyway?

114
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,535
Check these nuts, man.

115
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,772
You do look fucked up, don't you?
Come on, let's take somebody's food.

116
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,582
- Shit! Dee, give it back.
- No, Connie. Yo, yo, yo.

117
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,058
- Let me just see it!
- No! Give it to me!

118
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,427
- I want to see it.
- Fuck you!

119
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,763
- Give it back!
- I'd go out with him.

120
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,396
- Nah, I ain't even with that.
- I would. He's fine.

121
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,303
No, he ain't.
I don't want no white boy.

122
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,070
- Why wouldn't you date a white boy?
- I just wouldn't.

123
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,772
All right, then, would you
go out with a Dominican?

124
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,709
Yeah, the right one.
Not a motherfucker on crack.

125
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,019
- Would you go out with a Chinese boy?
- Yeah.

126
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,786
You'd go out with a Chinese boy
before you'd go out with a white boy?

127
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,589
- Hell, yeah.
- By yourself.

128
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,655
Say he gets angry at you and starts
cursing you in that Oriental talk.

129
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,133
You're not gonna understand
a word he's sayin'.

130
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,101
All right, then, would you
kick it with an Italian boy?

131
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,508
- Why not? Yeah.
- You'd kick it with an Italian boy?

132
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,375
- Yep.
- Italian's not white?

133
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,472
- No, not really.
- It's not.

134
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,382
They may look white,
but they damn sure don't act white.

135
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:24,752
- Let me see it, then.
- Come on, stop playin', Nut!

136
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,190
Give me that, man!
You fuckin' can't even read.

137
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,195
- What's up then, nigga?
- You a stupid-ass basehead, man.

138
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,527
- Just 'cause I ain't livin' like you.
- That's all you is!

139
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,500
- So what you sayin', man?
- What's up, fool?

140
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,834
Nut! Get over here!

141
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,399
Ice. I-C-E.

142
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,743
- Take off the hat.
- Ice.

143
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,751
- You're too rough on the brother, man.
- Shut up.

144
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,447
Why don't you show the brother
some respect?

145
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,490
Same respect you show Zack here.

146
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,117
Look, man, don't even start
with that shit, all right?

147
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,127
- Where do you belong?
- Wherever I want.

148
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,492
Take off the hat.

149
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,262
You don't have to put up
with that nigga's bullshit.

150
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,634
- Yeah, I do.
- Busted, where you live?

151
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,503
Yo, doesn't matter where I live.
We're all African.

152
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,543
You live in a white neighborhood.
You don't have to deal.

153
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,135
So don't give me
that "we're all African" bullshit.

154
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,807
- Where are you going?
- I have to deal.

155
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,248
- I have to deal with you right now.
- Go on.

156
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,912
Tweedledum follows Tweedledee, huh?

157
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,520
<i>Check this out.</i>

158
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,614
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,182
<i>Yo, my name is Dee</i>
<i>and this is Zachary</i>

160
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,525
<i>I'm in the front</i>
<i>He's in the back of me</i>

161
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,860
<i>People say</i>
<i>"Zack, you act too black for me"</i>

162
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,901
<i>But, yo, I like the way</i>
<i>the brother acts to me</i>

163
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,034
You get props for that. You hear that,
Mr. Wimms? Your son can rhyme.

164
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,099
My eight-year-old daughter can rhyme.
But can he read and write?

165
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,671
Gonna break my drinkin' glasses, and he
won't be readin', writin' or rhymin'.

166
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,842
Hey, man,
you gonna be his promoter?

167
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,079
You gonna take half
of every dollar he makes?

168
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,644
- Don't be mean, Otis.
- I'm just teasin' him.

169
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,021
He knows that.
He better know that.

170
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,189
You know about Reverend Calvin Butts
from the Abyssinian Baptist Church?

171
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,324
- I know you know.
- No, Mr. Wimms, I don't. I'm sorry.

172
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,734
He's goin' around
with children aboutJasmine's age.

173
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,965
They paintin' over liquor
and tobacco billboards aimed at blacks.

174
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,745
What do you think about that?

175
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,040
That's right. Think about it.
You think about it too.

176
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,087
- Come on, Pop.
- Come on what?

177
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,918
He come over here, he needs to think
about where he's at, that's all.

178
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,788
I sure as hell have to think about it
when I go over there.

179
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,794
Please don't start.

180
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,057
It took me a goddamn year
to get those crackheads...

181
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,622
out of my house
that your aunt is in now.

182
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,691
Leave it alone, baby.

183
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,663
Remember when they cleared those
houses to build a community center?

184
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,866
- Yeah.
- You do, don't you?

185
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,171
- Yeah.
- The Mac Avenue Center.

186
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,940
Now they sellin' crack
and shit all over there.

187
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,141
Took me a goddamn year to get those
motherfuckin' crackheads...

188
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,709
out of my goddamn house!

189
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,223
You wanna rhyme somethin'?
You rhyme about that!

190
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:29,129
I gotta make up at the airport.

191
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,194
He just gets wound up
and starts buggin' out, man.

192
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,467
Don't worry about it.

193
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,873
Dee, get that other mattress
over to your cousin's...

194
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,776
so she doesn't have to sleep
on her hardwood floor again.

195
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,677
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,621
They probably got
all kind of black-headed...

197
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,753
- Where we goin', man?
- Elbowed, ankled...

198
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,263
animals in here
just ready to tear me up.

199
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,266
Your sister could be in here.

200
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,428
Yo, they can have lions
and tigers and bears. Oh, my!

201
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,477
- This shit is heavy, Dee.
- I know, man. I know.

202
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,673
- Goddamn!
- You're a weak son of a sucker, man.

203
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,642
- Your cousin better be lookin' good.
- That runs in the family, dog.

204
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,019
- Better be.
- Ugly motherfucker.

205
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,457
- Goddamn!
- Yo, juggle my nuts, Zack.

206
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,395
- You got some lemonade?
- Over here.

207
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,904
Thanks, y'all.

208
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,911
- Hard labor's a bitch.
- Oh, man, think it ain't what it is.

209
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,778
Look, y'all needed
the workout, okay?

210
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm Zack. And you're...

211
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,246
- Nikki.
- You're from East New York?

212
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,413
- Where's that?
- It's in Brooklyn.

213
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,923
My mother was from there.
What's it like?

214
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,926
It's rough.

215
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,896
- Why'd you move?
- It was time.

216
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,023
Got any brothers or sisters
in Brooklyn?

217
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,625
- He likes to ask questions.
- I see that.

218
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,670
He wasn't askin' too many
the other day, though.

219
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,206
- The other day?
- Oh, you should have seen this boy.

220
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,640
It was terrible.
His girl just dissed him.

221
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,802
I'm surprised you're still
on your feet still standin'.

222
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:23,211
- Yeah, well, I'm not really.
- Yeah, okay.

223
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,886
- I guess I got what I asked for.
- You admit it. You were doggin' her.

224
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,326
We were just goin' through the motions.
There was no real intensity involved.

225
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,921
- It looked pretty intense to me.
- That ain't the first time, either.

226
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,330
I remember this one time at the movies.
Remember that, Zack?

227
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,029
Yeah, I remember that time
at the movies, too, Dee.

228
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:49,335
- Forget it. Remember, it was the mall.
- I remember that time at the mall too.

229
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:53,777
That was the time at the mall, yeah.
I ain't gonna say. I'll tell you later.

230
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,775
- Are you Italian?
- No, I'm Jewish. Why?

231
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,843
'Cause you smell like garlic, and I'm
gonna need to spray that bed with Lysol.

232
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,750
All right.

233
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,692
That's really funny, Dee.
That's really funny.

234
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,066
Don't call me if you need somebody
to carry your mattress out.

235
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,702
All right.
And be careful, Zack.

236
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,474
Make sure she don't plant
no bombs in your mailbox.

237
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,042
Yeah, well, I live at 148 Burnside,
if you wanna come check it out for me.

238
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,110
That's where I live.

239
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,486
Yeah, okay. I don't think so.

240
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,963
What?

241
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,629
- Nikki.
- Yeah? What about her?

242
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,196
- Well, she's beautiful, man.
- Yeah, she's fine.

243
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,903
- Yeah, she's your cousin.
- So ask her out.

244
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,277
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man. Why not?

245
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,873
I don't think I'm ready.
You know, I just broke up.

246
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,478
- Yeah, you better give it some time.
- Right. I need to give it some time.

247
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,648
Yeah. Plus, she's new...
new at school.

248
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,591
- And I don't want to pounce on her.
- Yeah, you don't wanna sweat her.

249
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,560
- Not right away.
- Yeah.

250
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,994
'Cause I will sweat her.

251
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,499
She's probably not ready
to get into anything right now.

252
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,593
- She needs time to get acclimated.
- Yeah, acclimated.

253
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,969
- Do you think?
- Yeah. I guess.

254
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,768
- Would you mind?
- Who?

255
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,812
You. Would it bother you?

256
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,609
What?

257
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,546
If we did go out.

258
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,983
Me, man?
Why would it bother me?

259
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,486
- She's your cousin.
- Yeah.

260
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,524
- And I'm your friend.
- Uh-huh.

261
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,082
- And I'm white.
- No!

262
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,953
Technically, I am white.

263
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,624
I hear you, man.

264
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,691
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

265
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,566
I hear you.

266
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,837
But still, ask her out.

267
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,109
And don't be smellin'
like garlic when you do, all right?

268
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,273
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, I know what you're sayin'.

269
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,856
- Come on.
- Strike.

270
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,539
Hey, girl.
Wanna kick it with me?

271
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,200
Not really.

272
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,676
This is the real nigga here.
Not like them bullshit punks there.

273
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:47,309
- Yeah, I know what you are.
- You got that figured out right, girl.

274
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,354
You don't know me.
You don't know nothin' about me.

275
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,483
Do you know I used to live in this house
till your punk-ass uncle kicked us out?

276
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,619
I used to sleep butt-naked
right in that room up there.

277
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,955
Now I stay over there.

278
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:07,901
And now we're neighbors.
Bet you didn't know that, either, huh?

279
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,500
As you can see,
the crib needs a lot of work.

280
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,137
Shit oughta torn down and built again,
it needs so much work.

281
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,288
Come inside, baby.

282
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,898
Well, see ya.

283
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,056
Are we talkin' about love,
or are we talkin' about sex?

284
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,853
We're talkin' about infatuation.

285
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,928
Infatuation? What is that?
That's nothing.

286
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,899
You wanna look for that, go look
in the easy listening section. Go ahead.

287
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,496
- So what about sex, Dad?
- That's my boy. Sex.

288
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,905
If we're talking about sex,
fuck the lyrics. Who needs words?

289
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,467
Then we're talking about rhythm.

290
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,207
It's like we're talking
aboutJames Brown.

291
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,707
Wilson Pickett.

292
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,844
- Sam and Dave. I mean...
- I got you, Dad.

293
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,423
So, what about love, Dad?

294
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,994
Love?

295
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,470
Love. That's a horse
of a different color now, son.

296
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,064
We're talkin' about...

297
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,671
Well, when we talk about love...

298
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,740
we're talking about the idea...

299
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,786
expressed in the essence of a song...

300
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,818
in a sexy arrangement.

301
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,519
They want to hearJohnny Mathis,
Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra.

302
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,155
Silky, smoothy, satin voices.

303
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,165
It comes from here.

304
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,904
This Johnny Mathis album?

305
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,537
You put this on for her
if you really...

306
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,808
I promise you,
her nipples will melt.

307
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,777
I gotta take care of this customer.
Don't scratch the albums, huh?

308
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,786
They're priceless.

309
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,291
Hey, come here.

310
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:24,501
I love your father, but he's
a little bit of a schmuck, you know?

311
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,662
You know what love is?

312
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,468
Love is about communication.

313
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,475
Love is about commitment.

314
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,239
Love is about responsibility.

315
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,406
- Do you like this girl?
- Yeah, I like her.

316
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,714
Give her a chance to get to know you.
You get to know her.

317
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,186
Everything will be all right.

318
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,518
Think. Okay?

319
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,327
All right.

320
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,930
- Thanks, Pop.
- You'll be all right.

321
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,060
Now, let's get back
to the question...

322
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,766
of why prices go up
when people steal.

323
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,104
Don?

324
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,111
Would you quit it, idiot?

325
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,147
Mr. Spera? Thank you, Kathy.

326
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,013
- Would you answer the question?
- Go ahead, Vinnie.

327
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,110
Yo, for the person who steals,
the prices go down.

328
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,020
Raise your hand, Mr. Wilson,
if you want to be heard.

329
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,355
- Connie?
- They need more security guards?

330
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,386
More security guards in the stores.
That's very good, Connie.

331
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,160
Yo, it's a natural
redistribution of wealth.

332
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,762
The rich pay more to subsidize people
who can only get stuff by stealing it.

333
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,237
- That's right.
- Who pays for that?

334
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,137
- Your mother.
- We do.

335
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,199
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,809
What's up?

337
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,411
It's fly. Who's that?

338
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,082
Oh, hey, that's my man Z.
He's the best DJ out here.

339
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,719
Nah, my brother, nah.
Listen, y'all, it isn't possible.

340
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,855
Even if he is, he ain't.
You know? Only brothers can be.

341
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,092
Yo, Nikki, why ain't you modeling
clothes like they is?

342
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,795
- You look good modelin' clothes.
- You look good modelin' nothin' at all.

343
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,498
Check your history, man. Every great
musical innovation of this century...

344
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,040
has been made by who?

345
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,737
The African. And every one of them
stolen and reshaped by who?

346
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,474
Yo, homeboy, the white man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

347
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,749
- Why you always holding your dick?
- Waitin' for you to suck it, fool.

348
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,584
Well, why don't you go suck on a book?
Why don't you learn about yourself?

349
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,681
Read about your culture
and your history, all right?

350
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,285
Kumbaya, motherfucker.
Farrakhan Annie.

351
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,857
That's what I'm talkin' about.

352
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,456
- You like that?
- Who is that?

353
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,627
Could be Frank Zappa.
Could be Captain Beefheart.

354
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,227
Captain Beefheart?

355
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,207
Oh, I know him.
My mother listens to that.

356
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,217
- You like that?
- Yeah.

357
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,124
- Check this out.
- Ooh, let's go!

358
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,658
Hurt that shit, Z. Yeah.

359
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,566
What you makin' faces for?

360
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,161
Perpetrator. That's all you are.
You know what I'm sayin'?

361
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,072
You know nothin'. The drums
are African. We created them.

362
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,302
Just leave music alone!
You know what I'm sayin'?

363
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,368
Went into Africa,
took our music, took our people.

364
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,506
Now here in America,
you gonna take rap? Bull! Not anymore.

365
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,550
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just leave it alone.

366
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,557
- Puccini.
- Puccini?

367
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,028
He need his motherfuckin' ass beat.

368
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,935
I should go over there straight
and knock his motherfuckin' head off.

369
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,269
He need to go <i>The Simpsons</i> show
with that shit.

370
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,572
Punk-ass. Nigga can't DJ. Probably
scratchin' up the records and shit.

371
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,840
- Do you like that?
- I like that.

372
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,372
You can sample anything.
Anything.

373
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,741
- Looks good.
- We was just gonna throw it away.

374
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,753
It's all right.

375
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,055
She gonna be redoin' the whole house.

376
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,891
Wanted to know
if we could use the curtains.

377
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,765
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

378
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,035
They could look all right.

379
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,497
So, I got a date this weekend.

380
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,337
- A date?
- Yeah.

381
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,240
Saturday night.

382
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,747
- He picks up and he pays?
- I think so.

383
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,978
You think so? Girl,
I think you better know so.

384
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,986
- Who is he?
- This guy from social studies class.

385
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,992
He's funny. He's cute.
He's real smart.

386
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,857
Yeah. That sounds
just like the last one.

387
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,898
Oh, and the one before that
and the one before that.

388
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:24,264
I don't think so.
This one's kind of different.

389
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,139
Yeah. They all different.

390
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,104
Watch.

391
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,342
One hit on a crack pipe
don't make you a basehead.

392
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,885
- Nigga, you a basehead.
- No, I'm not.

393
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,683
- Look at you. Paranoid and shit.
- I ain't no damn basehead.

394
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,883
- Look at you. Eyes all read.
- I'm not a fuckin' basehead.

395
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,155
Sit your motherfuckin' ass down.
Motherfuckin' basehead.

396
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,061
You all shakin' and shit.
This ain't no motherfuckin' rehab.

397
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,929
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Eyes all red and shit.

398
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,027
Motherfucker, what's wrong with you?
Look at this motherfucker.

399
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,902
Hey, yo, white boy!

400
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,374
- Sorry ass.
- Bart Simpson head-ass bitch.

401
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,844
Nigga frontin' 'cause he with
a black girl and shit. Punk-ass.

402
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,711
Blond-haired motherfucker.
Sorry ass.

403
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,650
- You ain't shit!
- Bart Simpson head motherfucker!

404
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,654
Reminds me of a motherfuckin' zebra
tryin' to date a black bitch.

405
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,681
- She should stay with her own color.
- Hi. I'm here to get Nikki.

406
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:26,492
- You're here to get Nikki?
- Sorry-ass motherfucker!

407
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,930
You ain't shit! Straight up!

408
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,934
- What the fuck you lookin' at?
- Your date's here.

409
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,062
Turn your ass around before
I bust you in the mouth, motherfucker.

410
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,539
What the fuck you lookin' at?
Punk-ass!

411
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,109
White punk!

412
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,274
Let me ask you somethin'.
Is this a curiosity thing?

413
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,410
Curiosity thing?

414
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,421
You datin' my daughter.

415
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,824
You slummin' or what?

416
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,027
See you later.

417
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,939
She's got a curfew.

418
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,380
Don't worry, Mrs. Patterson.
I'll have her back on time.

419
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,821
What the fuck is this?
Look at this motherfucker.

420
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,090
Punk motherfucker.
You ain't shit. Need your ass whipped.

421
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,427
Sorry motherfucker.

422
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,729
Dumb-ass bitch.

423
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,198
Nikki is a hooker!
So I took her!

424
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,639
- Shut up!
- Bitch!

425
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,906
Yeah, why don't you come over here
and give me head, motherfucker?

426
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,075
They just talkin' shit.
Just let that stuff slide, you know?

427
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,118
Fuck y'all!

428
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,626
Nikki, what do you wanna do?
Where you wanna go?

429
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,787
I don't know. It's your city.
You tell me.

430
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:10,493
Go to a movie, go to a mall,
go to the zoo, go get somethin' to eat.

431
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,661
- I can't believe you.
- Roller skating.

432
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,137
Go play miniature golf.

433
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,401
Go to a driving range
and hit long balls.

434
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:21,206
- What are you laughin' at, Nikki?
- You're different that what I expected.

435
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,839
Oh, yeah?
What do you mean, different?

436
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,940
You know what I mean.

437
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,578
You're more on the homeboy side
than on the white boy side.

438
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,886
This is Detroit, you know?
This is where I live.

439
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:38,258
I may not live downtown, but it's
still a predominately black city.

440
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,600
This is me, though.
This is who I am.

441
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,342
Listen to this song.

442
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,411
I made this with Dee.

443
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,451
This is Saul's Medley Land.

444
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,357
My grandfather opened this store
after the Second World War.

445
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,869
He was always on the cutting edge.

446
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,634
Blues, big band, bebop,
R & B, cool...

447
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,973
free jazz, fusion, everything.

448
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,296
So much music, history.

449
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,073
Listen to this.

450
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,160
- Do you like that song?
- Yes.

451
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,435
This is my home.

452
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,613
This is my treasure.

453
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,709
This is me.

454
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,561
Fuck that camera.

455
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,165
Yo, Nut, wait up.

456
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,498
Get away from me,
you stupid-ass basehead.

457
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,066
My money! Bitch!

458
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,071
Your ass still ugly.

459
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,647
What's up, white boy?

460
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,448
Just 'cause you listen to black music,
that don't make you black.

461
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,455
That's my tape.
I made that tape.

462
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,458
You should listen to that tape.
That tape is all that.

463
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,256
- I don't wanna listen to that shit.
- It's your loss, Nut.

464
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,402
What's goin' on, Z?
Chillin'?

465
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,869
You know that.

466
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,101
Hey, watch she gonna get tired
of your white ass, you punk!

467
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,639
Motherfucker!

468
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,680
Fuck that kid, man.

469
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,544
He's a stupid motherfucker.

470
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,574
Let me ask you something.

471
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,736
- The answer is no.
- Why?

472
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,178
I never went out
with a black girl before.

473
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,374
How'd you know
what I was gonna ask you?

474
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,111
I'm psychic.

475
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,888
You ever went out
with a white guy before?

476
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,392
In East New York? No.

477
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,195
What does your mother
think about this?

478
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,595
What does she really
think about this?

479
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,965
She's not trying to
hear it at all.

480
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,695
What does your father think?

481
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,942
My father doesn't care
who I date.

482
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,944
As long as I date regularly...

483
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,942
he don't care.

484
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,049
What do your friends think?

485
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,021
You know my man Dee's
cool with it, right?

486
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,458
The rest of them
I don't care about.

487
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,463
I don't care what they think.

488
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,898
- What are we doing here?
- Come on.

489
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,161
I wanna show you something.
You're not gonna believe this.

490
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,918
- What is this?
- Watch this.

491
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,820
You see what I'm talkin' about?

492
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,524
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

493
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,832
- This is private property.
- What are you doing?

494
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,498
- Why you hurting me?
- Come on.

495
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,508
This is a fucking game
to you, right?

496
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,510
It's Disney.
I'm a fuckin' clown, right?

497
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,513
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck out!

498
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,845
It's a fucking game, right?

499
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,065
- Dad.
- Zack.

500
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,902
When did you get home?

501
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,135
What difference does it make?

502
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,178
- You must be Nikki.
- Hi.

503
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,042
Of course she's Nikki.
Who do you think she is?

504
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,674
Hey, hey.

505
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,274
How you doing, Nik?

506
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,753
Listen, don't be so sensitive.
I just wanted to make sure, okay?

507
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:13,360
I'm assuming that you two took
the necessary proper precautions.

508
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,803
- Yes.
- Hey.

509
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,864
- Hey.
- Yes.

510
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,432
Lighten up.

511
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,877
Good.

512
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,609
You know why?
Because I got a shitload...

513
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,914
excuse my language...
of Chinese takeout, as you can see.

514
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,081
Nikki, come over here.
Sit over here.

515
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:36,126
Don't mind him.
He's a brooder. Sourpuss.

516
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,461
- Thank you.
- There you go.

517
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,397
You hear that sound?

518
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,003
That's like...

519
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,873
That's great.

520
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:01,043
That is the classic example
of the Philadelphia sound.

521
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,915
Oh, freedom.

522
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,319
It's very romantic.
It's like a teardrop.

523
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,453
For lovers only.

524
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,929
Right after Motown.

525
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,229
They had bands like Billy Paul...

526
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,736
The O'Jays, The Spinners...

527
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,898
Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.

528
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,535
<i>Don't leave me this way</i>

529
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,513
<i>Don't you understand</i>

530
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,174
This chick is all right.

531
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,248
That's great.
She's great.

532
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,321
Hey, what are you...
Come over here and sit down.

533
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,653
Come on. Sit next to
your girlfriend.

534
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,987
Come on.

535
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,595
Stop being a mooch.

536
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,629
Yeah, I'll tell you...

537
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,998
Teddy Pendergrass,
he had some set of chops.

538
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,302
Yeah.

539
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,307
Wow, those were the days.

540
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,310
Actually, these are
the good old days.

541
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,039
Right?

542
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:07,174
Hey, I propose
that we make a toast.

543
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:11,017
To all the souls of the great
vocalists wherever they may be.

544
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,165
Drink up.

545
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,631
Let's go, Dad.

546
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,512
We broke out with bebop.

547
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,659
Come on, Dad.

548
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,421
We gotta close up.

549
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,398
Come on.

550
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,201
I'll wait for you outside.

551
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,075
You all right, man?

552
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,163
- Don't be a stranger.
- You know I won't.

553
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,666
See you later.

554
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,238
Talk to you too.

555
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,120
Somethin' on your mind?

556
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,185
Maybe I should invite
my man over here too.

557
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,992
Your man?

558
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,632
I don't think so.

559
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,361
Take his bishop with that knight,
and his king is vulnerable.

560
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,264
- Dad, I'm about to crush him.
- You stupid.

561
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,498
How long does this game
last, anyway?

562
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,561
For hours.
Sometimes for days.

563
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,539
Not if you stop
giving him hints.

564
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:27,550
Come on, Nikki. What's up?
Hold on. I'm tryin' to concentrate.

565
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,552
- Just let him win.
- Hey, wait.

566
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,849
- Come on!
- Stop playin', man. Damn!

567
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,689
Nikki, why don't you come over,
give us a hand?

568
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,261
Biscuit head.
It's your move, man.

569
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,198
- Come on.
- I'm gonna see what's up with that.

570
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,898
The game ain't over, though.

571
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,038
- She's been like that all day.
- She'll be all right.

572
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,544
Yeah, as long as
he ain't usin' her.

573
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,070
Usin' her? Zack's not usin' her.
He don't use people.

574
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,549
I wouldn't worry about Zack.
He's a good kid.

575
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,552
Yeah, he's a good kid,
but he is white.

576
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,588
And she's black,
and this is America.

577
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,022
- And that's a problem.
- Why that's a problem?

578
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,823
This is 1992. Things changed
since back in the days.

579
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,296
- Y'all gotta get with it.
- Man, you gotta get with it.

580
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,299
- I don't care what year it is.
- I'm not tryin' to hear you.

581
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:21,303
Come on, man.
Now look, you got to hear me.

582
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,805
Look, Dee.
Zack is all right with us, okay?

583
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,775
That's not what we're talking about.
But anytime you got a couple...

584
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,710
made up of a black person
and white person in this society...

585
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,713
anything is liable to happen.

586
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:36,013
We're at home here. We're at home
among our home, and so is Zack.

587
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,487
That's all I'm sayin'. Okay?

588
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,818
Come on.

589
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,492
Nikki, what's the matter?

590
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,833
What's wrong?

591
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,898
I'm playin' chess.

592
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,965
My queen is exposed.
My king is defenseless.

593
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,273
I gotta concentrate, you know?

594
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:06,247
- Your cousin's good.
- I don't like to be ignored.

595
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,755
I'm not ignorin' you.

596
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,732
What's wrong?

597
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,894
What's the matter, Nikki?

598
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,369
I want my respect.

599
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,937
If you don't give it to me,
I'm gonna be all up in your face.

600
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,446
You understand?

601
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,979
I understand.

602
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,852
I understand. All right?

603
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,877
- What's up?
- Hey, Zack.

604
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,970
- How you guys doin'?
- Hi, Zack. How are you?

605
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,072
I'm doing good.
Working hard. The whole thing.

606
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,640
- How's your father?
- He's surviving.

607
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,277
I guess, you know,
I'm surviving him.

608
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,618
Yeah, well, you know your dad.
Don't let him push you around.

609
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,623
All right, Phyliss.
I gotta go back inside.

610
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,092
- I'll talk to you guys later.
- I'm having a party Friday night.

611
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,652
It's gonna be great.
Why don't you bring Nikki?

612
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,995
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

613
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,365
Really. It's cool.
I really want you to be there.

614
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,564
- All right, I'll be there.
- Okay.

615
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,107
- Thanks.
- Bye.

616
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,665
- You guys take it easy.
- See ya.

617
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,579
- Who's Nikki?
- Zack's new girlfriend.

618
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:47,174
- She's black.
- So?

619
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,310
So nothing. He's going out with her
to get back at you, that's all.

620
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,288
No, I don't think he is.
I think he really likes her.

621
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,983
We'll see.

622
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:56,426
Don't wait up, all right?

623
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,859
Don't wait up, all right?

624
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,866
How you feeling, all right?
Praise be to Allah.

625
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:09,234
Yo, it just feels good to get out
of my parents' house for a while.

626
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,399
Get to these study meetings,
you know?

627
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,875
You hear that music, Akim?
Nothin' but shay time in my ears.

628
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,208
They're always dropping
parties around here.

629
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,607
Yo, with the will of Allah...

630
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:25,416
I won't be saying I'm the onlyJones's
in my neighborhood, you know?

631
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,389
Down there livin' amongst
the masses of my people.

632
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,358
With the will of Allah.

633
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,590
Nikki, I'm telling you, we don't have
to stay long if you don't want to.

634
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,463
Get outta here. I get to talk
to your ex and compare notes.

635
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,468
All right.

636
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,332
Hey, you guys. I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

637
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,670
- Good to see you, Nikki.
- How you doin'?

638
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,801
Hey, you guys made it.
I was getting worried.

639
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,209
- How you doin', Bobby?
- Good, man.

640
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,805
Someone's lookin' at you, Zack.
Better go check it out.

641
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,249
- Be right back.
- Yeah, where have you been?

642
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,383
I was waiting for you.
How you doing?

643
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,755
- Doing good.
- Takin' care?

644
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,961
Did you bring Nikki? Hi.

645
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,400
Nikki, right?
You need a drink.

646
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,459
Step into my office.

647
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,710
Those are oceanic pieces
of the Eskimo tribe.

648
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,340
You have a lot of
interesting things.

649
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,113
Yeah. My mom, she studied art
and anthropology in college.

650
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,518
- Hey, Zacky.
- How you doin', Phyliss?

651
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,988
- Oh, you havin' a good time?
- Yeah, I am. Thank you.

652
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,049
- It's a nice party.
- Good. She's very pretty.

653
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,357
Yeah, she is.
Thank you very much.

654
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,263
You're just like your old man,
you know that?

655
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,599
This is, I think,
your boyfriend's new tape.

656
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,429
My boyfriend.

657
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,137
Yeah, that's him.
That's him.

658
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,701
He's really into
this black thing.

659
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,542
Yeah, I guess so.

660
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:39,115
And he's really nice.
I like him.

661
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,386
He is.

662
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,893
I liked him too.

663
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:49,289
So, Zack, I'm speechless, man.

664
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,060
We need to talk.
Come on.

665
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:59,865
We grew up together, right?
So, I gotta ask you one question.

666
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,501
What's it like
fuckin' a black chick?

667
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,513
- She won't go down on you, I bet.
- It's totally taboo. Am I right?

668
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,071
They hate it.
That's what I hear.

669
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,980
Do you wanna shed some light
on that subject, Zack?

670
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,985
What about those big lips?

671
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,613
You guys sound like a bunch
of fuckin' clowns, you know?

672
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,920
Oh, man, I bet she wails
like a banshee.

673
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,620
There it is. I knew it.
You are a fuckin' pioneer.

674
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,858
Once you go black,
you never go back.

675
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,331
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

676
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,302
- Hey, Nikki.
- Nikki, wait a second.

677
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,362
I don't wanna even hear it.

678
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,406
Nikki, wait a second.

679
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,177
Listen. They were
just being stupid.

680
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,946
They didn't mean anything
by it, all right?

681
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:47,012
They were just bein' stupid?
They didn't mean anything by it?

682
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,955
What about you?

683
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,051
Man, you wanna be so different?
You ain't no different from them.

684
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,688
Just 'cause you walk the walk
and you talk the talk.

685
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,063
Just 'cause you listen to the music
you think you know about the culture.

686
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,659
It doesn't mean a thing.

687
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,527
I can't believe him.

688
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,630
How about this?

689
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,904
Why don't you go get something
by Nikki Giovanni?

690
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,504
"Spin a Soft Black Song"
is a good one.

691
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,753
Yo, I'll talk to Zack,
all right?

692
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,814
Don't worry about it.

693
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,224
All right.

694
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,762
"The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice."

695
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,959
This chick is too much.

696
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,096
You want her?
She's yours.

697
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,971
Good morning.

698
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,213
She wore me out.

699
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,486
Been us since 4:00 a.m.

700
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,352
Every time I close my eyes...

701
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,551
I get bugged.

702
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,822
Oh, I mean, you know...

703
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,920
I can fuck 'em,
but I can't sleep with 'em.

704
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:41,568
It's weird.
The moment that I get off, I'm gone.

705
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:46,905
I mean, my body is still there,
but my head is in outer space.

706
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:49,772
You know what I mean?

707
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,044
You don't, do you?

708
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,748
What's up?

709
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,328
Nothin', Dad.

710
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,927
Get me some of that
granola stuff, will you?

711
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,573
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Mrs. Patterson. Is Nikki there?</i>

712
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,146
It's Zack.

713
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,778
- No, she's not.
- <i>Tell her I called, please.</i>

714
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,822
Okay.

715
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,023
Hey, baby girl,
wanna play some gin later on?

716
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,622
- I'll tear you up.
- Maybe.

717
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,705
- Hey, y'all, what's up?
- Where you been?

718
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,037
Yeah, girl, you been hangin'
in the wrong 'hood.

719
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,202
Girl, you ain't never
gonna mean shit to them.

720
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,438
- Just a dash of color.
- No, it ain't about all that.

721
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,845
Y'all are just talkin' shit.
I get my respect.

722
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,180
Nikki, ain't no white boy gonna give
you your respect. That's straight up.

723
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,948
Shut the fuck up, Nut. Like you're
gonna give any bitch her respect.

724
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,148
- Shut up, bitch!
- Fuck you, ho!

725
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,426
Why you always gotta make
so much noise?

726
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,428
Why I always gotta
make so much noise?

727
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,656
Oh, shit.

728
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,698
Why's I always gotta
make so much noise?

729
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,930
To be heard.

730
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,370
Yeah, to be heard.

731
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,902
Well, you don't need
to be so loud...

732
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,913
'cause I can hear you fine
without all that.

733
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,145
Come on.

734
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,278
Come on.

735
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,307
Well, I guess
you're scared of me. Shit.

736
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,319
I don't know
where you're takin' me.

737
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,786
Just come on.

738
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,585
I ain't gonna bite you.
Neither are they.

739
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,956
I ain't afraid of you.

740
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,884
Little cat.

741
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,521
Why do they call you Nut?

742
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,717
'Cause I'm crazy.

743
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,386
'Cause I used to
be real small.

744
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,985
'Cause of the shape of my head.

745
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,521
Peanut.

746
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,795
What's your real name?

747
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,999
Kelvin Macrae.

748
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,735
Kelvin Macrae.

749
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,939
It's nice.

750
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,879
But Nut fits you better.

751
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,979
- Come on. What did you stop for?
- I gotta go.

752
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,981
I'm just getting comfortable.

753
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,056
Hey, yo, Nikki, wait up.

754
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,460
Just stay away from me.

755
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,875
Yo, Dee, it's dope, man,
but it ain't faithful.

756
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,876
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- We're here to teach, man.

757
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:25,744
- And you've got to learn, all right?
- Education's our passport to the future.

758
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,909
- Sure.
- Yo, you're laughing, man.

759
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,919
But we come into this world
mentally dead.

760
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,217
Programmed from birth.
You know what I'm saying?

761
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,382
The devil's setting up a structure
to keep you down...

762
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,892
to keep you and I
from being strong.

763
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,088
Yeah, and speakin' of the devil,
your homeboy.

764
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,654
Why don't you leave him alone, man?
Zack ain't doin' nothing to you.

765
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,861
Man, the way he disses your cousin,
and you still act the same?

766
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,268
- You oughta be ashamed.
- We don't dis our women?

767
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,272
No, we programmed to dis our women.
Come on, sister, let's go.

768
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,740
We programmed to dis our women.
I don't dis our women.

769
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,972
We programmed to dis our women
like your homeboy.

770
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,844
Hey, what's his problem, man?

771
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,645
You, man.

772
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:07,417
Yo, Dee, man, it wasn't my fault,
what happened with Nikki.

773
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,186
I mean, you know how it is
when guys get together, man.

774
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,693
Zack, I don't. How is it
when guys get together?

775
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:16,220
You know, they say things
they really don't mean to say.

776
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,001
Dee, man, I apologize,
all right?

777
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,630
I didn't mean
to disrespect your cousin.

778
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,368
Don't tell me, man.
Tell her, all right?

779
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,605
Look. Call her up, all right?

780
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,673
'Cause you messed up.
You messed up big time.

781
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:39,084
We all mess up.
Ain't nobody perfect.

782
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,181
And if she can't see that,
then she ain't worth the trouble.

783
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,193
Listen to you, man.

784
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,729
- What?
- The insight.

785
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:51,893
Where does it come from?
How do I get some?

786
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,333
You don't, dog, you don't.

787
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,871
The faggot devil
tryin' to get some soul!

788
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,566
It's cool, though.

789
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,769
I fucked up, man.
I apologize, all right?

790
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,778
- Yeah.
- All right?

791
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,780
But make sure
you tell my cousin that.

792
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,215
All right, I'm gonna do that.
My man, I apologize.

793
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,752
Get the fuck off me.

794
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,899
She ain't a dog.

795
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:02,761
I know that.

796
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,075
Nikki, I'm sorry.

797
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,246
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

798
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,575
I'm sorry that I was so stupid.

799
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,686
I screwed up.

800
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,319
But I miss you, Nikki.

801
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,918
And I wanna be with you.

802
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,591
I'm sorry.

803
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,362
All right, you apologized.
Now you can leave.

804
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,041
You know, you're lucky, Nikki.

805
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,981
You're really lucky.

806
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:57,888
You were able to go to that party
that other night and fit right in.

807
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,730
I can't do that,
and I never could.

808
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,464
You have a mother...

809
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,574
and I can't remember mine.

810
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,869
And you know how it is
with my father.

811
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,513
I'm sorry.

812
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,691
Maybe I'll see you
later on at the rink.

813
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,026
Okay.

814
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,348
Still tryin' to throw
that tired rap. No.

815
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,282
Girl, don't talk to him.

816
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,900
- Hey, yo, what's up?
- Get the fuck outta my face.

817
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,631
Hey, yo, what you gonna do?

818
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,784
Yo, Nikki.
You all right?

819
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:14,186
- Yeah.
- You are? You know Zack's coming.

820
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:18,124
It could be so easy to forget about.
But he made me so mad...

821
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,559
I almost didn't want to have
anything else to do with him.

822
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:24,656
- But, you know.
- Yeah, I wanted to bust his shit too.

823
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,963
He was just being stupid
lookin' for that rep.

824
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,232
- Dogs. Y'all dogs.
- Look. Zack ain't no different.

825
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,796
Since you're my cousin, let me
tell you, let me bust it for you.

826
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,036
See, we get hurt at a young age,
and when we grow up...

827
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,011
we don't wanna feel
like that again, so we hurt ya.

828
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,139
We don't show you
our real feelings.

829
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,876
Ruff, ruff.

830
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,384
- Watch some real skatin'.
- By yourself.

831
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,121
You know, you treat me
like a complete stranger and shit.

832
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,057
- I'm sorry. Will you move?
- Come on, girl, once around.

833
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,034
- No, I ain't tryin' to get killed.
- Why you trippin' and shit?

834
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:05,540
Damn, give me a chance. Come on.
You wanna get close to me, right?

835
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,382
Yo, what's up, fella?

836
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,380
What's up?

837
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,222
- Yo, coolin', checkin' out the women.
- Hey, Dee.

838
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,282
- Hey, Connie.
- You wanna dance?

839
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,254
Yo, go ahead, Dee.
You the man.

840
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,301
Dance with the girl.
Dance with all the girls.

841
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,323
Looks like love to me, Dee.

842
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,324
Yo, Brother Dee,
you call that black magic?

843
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,429
You need to give me
a chance and shit.

844
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,437
Get close to me, all right?

845
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,804
Yeah, you with me now.
Fuck him, all right?

846
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,900
If we're gonna be together,
I do for you.

847
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,639
That punk ain't gonna
do shit for you, you know?

848
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,647
Don't be treating me
like that, shit.

849
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,683
Just forget about it.
She don't want no part of you.

850
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,684
She want a real man,
not no wannabe.

851
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,014
Fuck you.

852
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,823
Don't be treatin' me
like I ain't nobody.

853
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:33,225
Gimme a chance at least
before you say somethin'. You know?

854
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,856
You been hidin' from me all through
this whole thing, you know?

855
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,505
Nut's dissin' you, man.
Look at him.

856
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,375
Don't even fight me, you know?
You with me now, all right?

857
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,708
Yo, Nikki!

858
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,614
Why don't you leave it alone, old man?
Still chasin' after the sisters.

859
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,621
- Stop!
- You're with me now.

860
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,951
Don't trip.

861
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,321
Don't you ever fuckin' touch me.
You ain't got nothin' to do with this.

862
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,424
I didn't do nothing to you
that you didn't do to your damn self.

863
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:16,198
- Why don't you leave her alone, Nut?
- You gonna be a hero, white boy?

864
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,738
Why don't you
just leave her alone?

865
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,740
Punk-ass. What you gonna do, nigga?
You can't get 'em up anyway.

866
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,742
- You can't get 'em up anyway.
- Why don't you get a job or something?

867
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,778
- Get a life. No one likes you.
- Fuck you!

868
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,676
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong with you?

869
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,146
You skate up like
a motherfuckin' cop and shit.

870
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,342
Why don't you take your boy home,
you motherfuckin' homo?

871
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,716
Both of you are bitches.
You motherfuckin' bitch!

872
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,763
Get the fuck outta my way!

873
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,340
Help! Somebody get
some fuckin' help!

874
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,041
Dee, don't die!
Please don't die!

875
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,448
Somebody call an ambulance!

876
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:18,419
"For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God...

877
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,519
in His wise providence,
to take out of this world...

878
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:24,360
the soul of our deceased brother...

879
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,368
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

880
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,700
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...

881
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:32,365
dust to dust.

882
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,501
Looking for a general resurrection
in the last day...

883
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:39,172
and the life of the world to come
through our Lord Jesus Christ...

884
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:43,274
at whose second coming in His
glorious majesty to judge the world."

885
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:23,157
"And the life of the world to come
in our Lord Jesus Christ."

886
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:51,680
"According to His mighty workings,
whereby He is able to subdue...

887
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,221
all things unto Himself."

888
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,944
How was it?

889
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,403
Is everything a fuck to you?

890
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,803
I was only asking a question.

891
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:54,512
Well, how was it when Mom died?
How was that?

892
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,950
- Mom?
- Mom.

893
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:02,456
- You know how that was.
- No, I don't know how that was.

894
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,958
How was it?
Where is she buried?

895
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,756
- In Boston.
- What's it like, Dad?

896
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:09,820
'Cause I've never been there.

897
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:13,429
I don't know.

898
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,795
It's 20 minutes
outside the city, Zack.

899
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,135
It's...

900
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,040
a cemetery.

901
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,608
Why wasn't I there?

902
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,479
We felt you were too young.

903
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,882
We?

904
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,559
I should have been there, Dad.

905
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,963
I should have been there.

906
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,493
I don't know
if I should blame Nut...

907
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,502
or I should blame Dee.

908
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:32,542
- How y'all doin'?
- What's up?

909
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,846
Takes a lot of guts, man.

910
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,785
A lot of nerve.

911
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,720
A lot of heart.

912
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,120
What's up?

913
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,059
How ya doin'?

914
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,261
Don't say shit! Don't!

915
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:06,335
All I wanted was to be with you.
That's all I wanted.

916
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:09,241
But your punk-ass cousin
got in the way.

917
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,904
I don't give a fuck!

918
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,244
I could kill you too!

919
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,452
- Nikki?
- Yeah?

920
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,961
Where you been?

921
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,194
Down at the center.

922
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,928
The police was here.

923
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,034
They said they wanted
to ask you a few questions.

924
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,465
I ain't got nothin' to tell them.

925
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:20,207
They said you was dancin'
with that boy...

926
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,146
before he killed Dee.

927
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:26,346
I was dancin' with a lot of boys.

928
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,514
Yeah.

929
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,756
Yeah. I'm goin' to bed now.

930
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:12,890
You was dancin' with a whole lot
of boys, huh, Nikki?

931
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,934
Nikki, do you know
what those boys really want?

932
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,237
Your cousin is dead, Nikki.

933
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:30,117
And you were dancin'
with a whole bunch of boys?

934
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:36,749
- Dee is dead, goddamn it!
- Don't you think I know that?

935
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,009
Mom?

936
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:42,915
Oh, Nikki.
I don't wanna lose you, baby.

937
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,323
It's okay, Mom.

938
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,691
I don't wanna lose you.

939
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:19,252
This is so stupid!

940
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:23,988
Zack, are you all right?

941
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,756
You all right?

942
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,445
- This don't make no damn sense!
- It does.

943
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,455
- No, it don't.
- Yes, it does. She asked for it.

944
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,514
- No, she didn't.
- She did. She went out with him.

945
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,617
- So?
- Nadine, shut up!

946
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:02,162
- I know. Just be quiet.
- She deserved it.

947
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,221
- No, she don't.
- It's good for her.

948
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:07,825
- Oh, look at this.
- It's not your business.

949
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,467
Who did this?

950
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:20,980
- Is somethin' funny?
- Yep.

951
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:27,520
Who did this, Nik?

952
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,153
Did you do this?

953
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:36,963
- Did you do this?
- No. Did you do it?

954
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,556
- Glazer.
- Did you fuckin' do this?

955
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:42,125
- You did it.
- Glazer!

956
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:45,036
Yo! Fuck both y'all!

957
01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,911
Now what, sister?

958
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,750
I should have thrown Nut
out on his ass a long time ago.

959
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:12,757
Maybe I should throw
you and your girlfriend out too.

960
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:14,461
For what?

961
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:19,466
If I've said it once,
I've said it a hundred times.

962
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,031
Always, always, always...

963
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,178
stick with your tribe.

964
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,885
If it's Italian,
you stick with it.

965
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:36,117
If you'reJewish,
you stick with your tribe, boy.

966
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,557
Armenian, African...
It doesn't matter. Whatever.

967
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,824
That's how you know who you are.

968
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,294
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

969
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,338
That's how you know.

970
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,669
Are you finished?

971
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,368
Yeah.

972
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:57,434
- Can I leave?
- Yes.

973
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:03,579
- Listen to me, Glazer.
- I'm listening to you, Cimino.

974
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:05,676
- All right.
- I'm listenin'.

975
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:07,948
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

976
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:11,480
<i>Unfortunately, I have</i>
<i>some very sad news to report.</i>

977
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:14,323
<i>For those of you who don't already</i>
<i>know, one of our students...</i>

978
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:18,456
<i>a senior, Dee Wimms,</i>
<i>passed away last Saturday night.</i>

979
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:22,025
<i>Dee was truly a terrific young man</i>
<i>and a good friend to many.</i>

980
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:24,435
<i>I'm sure we will miss him.</i>

981
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:29,340
<i>There will be a grieving room set up</i>
<i>in room 112 at the language lab.</i>

982
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,174
<i>Professional counselors</i>
<i>will be there to help.</i>

983
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,644
<i>And now, there will be a school</i>- <i>wide</i>
<i>moment of silence in Dee's memory.</i>

984
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:59,067
- You won't need your books today.
- I didn't read the shit anyway.

985
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,370
Everything's a fuckin'joke
to you, man.

986
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:03,967
- You're the biggest joke of all.
- Why don't you both shut up?

987
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:07,139
- Yeah, for real.
- Just shut the fuck up.

988
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,284
It's okay to cry, Connie.

989
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:13,081
No, it's not okay.

990
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:16,521
Dee was a nice guy.

991
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:19,583
I mean, what's the point?
Why did Nut do it?

992
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,491
'Cause he's a wild motherfucker.

993
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:24,725
- You keep laughin', Guido.
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?

994
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,427
You guys are being
a little insensitive, aren't you?

995
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:32,165
Hey, Dee was all right.
But Nut? Nut had it goin' on.

996
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,935
- Word.
- All right, let's talk about Nut.

997
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,806
Anybody know where he is?

998
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:41,845
- Why do you think he did it?
- Who gives a fuck?

999
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:52,782
- I don't know.
- He just went off.

1000
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:55,351
No, they was always up
in each other's face all the time.

1001
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,828
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

1002
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:58,455
It's the truth.

1003
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:01,262
Dee got killed
because he was a Uncle Tom...

1004
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,929
and Nikki here
just another white man's whore!

1005
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:05,870
- What?
- Why don't you watch your mouth?

1006
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,432
Yo, when push came to shove, Dee
was willing to fight a black brother...

1007
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,273
to protect his white friend.

1008
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:17,017
Truth is, the white devil
didn't have Dee's back.

1009
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:20,850
Everything with you is race.
Race, race, race.

1010
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:24,220
- That's right, everything is race.
- This isn't even about race.

1011
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,522
This is about ignorance!
An ignorant fool with a gun!

1012
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:29,688
No. If she'd have been datin'
a black guy...

1013
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:32,392
and he'd have been datin' a white girl,
everything would've been squash.

1014
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,957
- That's ignorance.
- No, it's not. What you talkin' about?

1015
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,936
Nikki, I don't blame you
because you're a sister.

1016
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:39,666
- If you're gonna...
- I blame this white devil you was with.

1017
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,140
If you're gonna blame him,
then you better blame me.

1018
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,178
'Cause we were in this together, okay?
And you better blame him...

1019
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:48,807
because he thought Nut pullin'
the fuckin' trigger was wild.

1020
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:52,949
If you're gonna blame us,
then you better blame your fuckin' self!

1021
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:56,820
- You need to wake up, sister.
- No, you need to wake up!

1022
01:34:56,891 --> 01:35:01,624
That was my cousin.
My blood, not yours.

1023
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,392
Dee got killed
'cause he was my friend.

1024
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:12,633
And I was his friend, and it had
nothin' to do with me bein' white.

1025
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,175
We were like this!

1026
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,574
Can you live with that?

1027
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:22,810
Can you? Can you live with that?
Black and white like this?

1028
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,860
Asshole!

1029
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:42,867
You want truth?
Truth could be anything.

1030
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,371
- Truth is niggas killin' niggas.
- Yo, what did you say?

1031
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:48,306
Come on, man! Come on!

1032
