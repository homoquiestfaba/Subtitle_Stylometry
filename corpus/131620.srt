1
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:28,596
<i>There is a secret test</i>
<i>hidden within the SA T.</i>

2
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,833
<i>This test does not measure</i>
<i>a student's aptitude...</i>

3
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,978
<i>...at reading, writing</i>
<i>and arithmetic.</i>

4
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:37,808
<i>It measures</i>
<i>a student's innate ability...</i>

5
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:41,918
<i>...to lie, cheat, fight and kill.</i>

6
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:48,286
<i>Those who score well are recruited</i>
<i>into a secret paramilitary academy.</i>

7
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:54,924
<i>Some call them seductresses.</i>
<i>Some call them spies.</i>

8
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:59,627
<i>Fools call them innocent.</i>
<i>They call themselves D.E.B.S.</i>

9
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,130
<i>Good morning, D.E.B.S.</i>
<i>Attention, D.E.B.S.!</i>

10
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,134
<i>Attention! Emergency alert!</i>
<i>That means report right now!</i>

11
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:44,240
<i>Right this second!</i>
<i>You have no time to sleep, ladies!</i>

12
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,141
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

13
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,369
<i>-And I mean now, ladies!</i>
-Dominique.

14
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:50,207
<i>The world might be destroyed</i>
<i>while you nap!</i>

15
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,042
Come on.
Phipps is freaking out.

16
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,684
<i>-I need you guys up!</i>
-Five minutes.

17
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:59,113
And no boys allowed upstairs.

18
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,882
Out.

19
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,459
-What?
<i>-Let's go! I want everybody up!</i>

20
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:07,688
-Janet. Five minutes.
-Have you seen my gun?

21
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:10,492
<i>Move it, move it!</i>
<i>Everybody in the house!</i>

22
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,635
What did I do with it?

23
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:15,203
D.E.B.S. Max here.

24
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,333
Amy, it's for you.

25
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:21,808
Hello. No. No! I'm not--

26
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,947
I'm not talking about this anymore.

27
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,810
Get out.

28
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:28,850
And take your clothes with you.
I don't do laundry.

29
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,953
<i>Let's go! Let's go, let's go!</i>

30
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:34,182
<i>Move it, move it, move it!</i>
<i>I don't have all day, D.E.B.S.</i>

31
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:37,350
<i>I do not have all day!</i>

32
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:38,654
<i>Ten!</i>

33
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,356
-Bobby, seriously, it's not a good time.
<i>-Nine.</i>

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,194
<i>-Eight.</i>
<i>-When? When is a good time?</i>

35
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:47,667
-Stop calling.
-Amy!

36
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,671
<i>-Five. Four. Three.</i>
-I'm coming.

37
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,433
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

38
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,805
<i>-Two, one.</i>
-Goodbye, Bobby.

39
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,316
I broke up with Bobby.

40
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,955
-What?
-I broke up with Bobby.

41
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:09,490
-Oh, my God! Why?
-He was just so boring.

42
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:11,658
He's an ass.

43
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:12,988
What?

44
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,827
I like him. I think he's sweet.

45
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,329
-I'm just not in love.
-What?

46
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,631
I said, I want to be in love!

47
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,674
Why are you yelling?

48
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,859
-Hi, Amy.
-Hi.

49
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,660
-Hey, Mr. P.
-Don't call me that.

50
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,493
-Hey, Mr. P.
-What's up, Mr. P?

51
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:52,602
<i>Bonjour</i>, Mr. P.

52
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:56,569
Hey, can I get a farmer's daughter
short stack and bacon, well done.

53
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,901
Tofu scramble, peach smoothie,
non-dairy.

54
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:02,204
-Cheeseburger, extra pickles.
-Coffee, black.

55
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:05,714
We have a special guest with us
this morning.

56
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:06,817
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

57
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:07,784
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

58
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:09,613
She never comes down here!

59
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,880
Ladies.

60
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,924
I just want to say what
a pleasure it is to meet you.

61
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:19,028
No time for pleasantries.

62
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,461
Phipps, a matter of some urgency
has come to my attention.

63
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,794
Lucy Diamond is back in the States.

64
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:27,096
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

65
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,296
I'm writing my thesis on her.

66
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:32,374
I expect to be kept
in the loop on this one.

67
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:35,940
Let's show some hustle.

68
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:43,718
-I can't believe she's back.
-Who's Lucy Diamond?

69
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:45,115
Lucy Diamond.

70
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:49,355
She's the last surviving member
of the Reynolds crime syndicate.

71
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,892
Her family did battle
with the Schaffers...

72
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:55,156
...in a vicious blood feud
that lasted a decade.

73
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:58,733
After her father's death, she inherited
the keys to his kingdom:

74
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,070
Illegal arms-running,
smuggling, gambling...

75
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,639
...and her specialty, diamond theft.

76
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:09,074
She's protected by a loyal band
of mercenaries, led by this man...

77
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:10,508
...Scud.

78
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:15,243
It is believed Lucy Diamond was
behind the plot to sink Australia in '99.

79
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,786
Three attempts have been made
to apprehend her. All failed.

80
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:20,981
In 2003 she went underground...

81
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,025
...and has not been seen
or heard from since.

82
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:27,652
-Yikes.
-That's not even the bad part.

83
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,458
What's the bad part?

84
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,999
No one has ever fought her...

85
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:34,830
...and lived to tell about it.

86
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:41,609
Peach smoothie, farmer's daughter,
tofu scramble and cheeseburger.

87
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,041
Coffee.

88
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,440
So why do you think
she's back in town?

89
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:51,348
Our intel suggests she's in town to
meet this woman. Ninotchka Kaprova.

90
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,389
Ex-KGB, now freelance assassin.

91
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:57,288
They're scheduled to meet tonight,
2000 hours.

92
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,157
Find out what Lucy is up to.
Strictly surveillance.

93
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:04,563
Do not try to apprehend her
yourselves. Max, you're in charge.

94
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:08,171
Amy, you're second.
And, D.E.B.S., be careful.

95
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,741
What does a reclusive
criminal mastermind want...

96
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:19,472
...with a Russian trained killer?

97
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,481
Your scheduled meet,
2000 hours.

98
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,177
-Where'd you find her?
-Zeda tipped us.

99
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:59,345
Said she's available. She's in
from Prague. Relocating stateside.

100
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,290
-Assassin?
-Check.

101
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,858
-Where's the meet?
-Les Deux Amours.

102
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,520
Trendy, yet discreet.

103
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,270
Cancel it.

104
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,874
Why? It's all set up.

105
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:22,237
-I don't do blind dates.
-Well, it's not a blind date...

106
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,541
-...if you know what they look like.
-Tell her I'm not coming.

107
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:28,583
-Say I came down with something.
-Lucy, it's been two years.

108
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:30,811
-You have to get out there.
-I am out there.

109
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,649
I went out with that drummer,
the girl that talked loud.

110
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,315
You didn't go out with her.
We all went out together.

111
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:39,894
Then you lied and said you had food
poisoning, and you went home early.

112
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:44,124
Yeah, well, she talked really loud,
even when you were right next to her.

113
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,498
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to drown yourself...

114
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:51,402
...in your little schemes to destroy
the world, but you need to get over it.

115
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:53,304
-You were dumped.
-I was not dumped.

116
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,139
Oh, you were dumped hard.
And that sucks.

117
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,679
You took time off
to go to Antarctica or whatever.

118
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,248
Reykjavik. It's in Iceland.

119
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,614
But now it's time to get back
in the game, Lucy.

120
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:07,086
You've got a date tonight with
a beautiful Russian assassin...

121
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:09,350
...and you're gonna show up.

122
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:12,628
-Lucy.
-Fine.

123
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,560
Okay, I'll go. I'll be there.

124
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,791
Just promise me you'll be open.

125
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:22,200
-Open to what?
-Open to love.

126
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,636
Hey, look. Look. Check this out.

127
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,711
Ms. Petrie is handpicking girls
for the International Bureau.

128
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,813
I'm gonna see if
I can get an interview.

129
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,145
Think Mr. Phipps would let me
take time off after endgame?

130
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,218
What are you talking about?

131
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:13,879
I don't know. There's this
art school in Barcelona.

132
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,854
Art school?

133
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:18,654
You're the perfect score.
You could have your choice...

134
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,354
...of any assignment you want
after endgame.

135
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:25,233
-Who's your best friend?
-You are my best friend.

136
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,893
What did I say to you
the very first day of academy?

137
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,062
"That's my bunk, bitch."

138
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,209
-Okay, after I said that.
-"D.E.B.S. stick together."

139
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:34,742
Exactly.

140
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:38,040
We've been through four years
of hell, and now we're top squad.

141
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:40,547
We're just getting to the good stuff.

142
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:45,583
So you're not gonna ruin it all
by going to art school.

143
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:50,352
-Am I right?
-Yes. You are always right.

144
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:54,392
You need to put it here.
Don't be an idiot for once.

145
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,226
You need to speak
English or French.

146
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,800
"Fringlish" is not a language.

147
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,132
-D.E.B.S. Janet speaking. Over.
<i>-Janet, put her on.</i>

148
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,902
-It's Bobby.
-I don't wanna talk to him.

149
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,306
-She doesn't want to talk to you. Over.
<i>-Bullshit! I need to talk to her.</i>

150
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,279
Copy that.
He really needs to see you.

151
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,249
He should not call her.
It is embarrassing.

152
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:20,118
Bobby, I told you, it's over.

153
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:22,955
-Over.
<i>-We've gotta talk.</i>

154
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,117
I'm serious. No.

155
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,557
Amy, we need to talk.

156
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,958
Jesus, Bobby,
what are you doing here?

157
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:32,158
Think you guys are the only ones
onto Diamond? Everyone's here:

158
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,963
The feds, the CIA.

159
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:36,668
-Can't believe it.
-This is our stakeout.

160
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,469
Always sticking their heads
in our business. It's unbelievable.

161
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:43,272
Could you guys excuse us
for a minute?

162
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:47,114
Why do you have to be
such a jerk about everything?

163
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:50,481
When my girlfriend breaks
up with me for no reason...

164
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,122
-...l'm a little hostile.
-It's not for no reason.

165
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,224
-Then give me one.
-I just want more.

166
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,620
-More what?
-I don't know.

167
00:11:56,793 --> 00:12:00,194
-What are they saying?
-I'm not gonna spy on them.

168
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,195
You are a spy, dipshit.

169
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,129
-Is there somebody else?
-No. Nobody.

170
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,202
-Because if there's somebody else--
-Look, I just--

171
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,272
-Speak.
-I'm not in love with you.

172
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,442
Well.

173
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:20,981
I guess nobody's good enough
for Little Miss Perfect Score.

174
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,319
Shut up!

175
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,448
Oh, yeah, you'll be back.

176
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,393
You can do this.

177
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,899
Why is it I can hold the whole world
hostage...

178
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,163
...l'm scared of going on
one blind date?

179
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,706
Because love is harder
than crime.

180
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,268
Okay, now, knock them dead.

181
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:52,541
But not really.

182
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:54,274
Sure.

183
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:07,693
-Are you okay?
-Hey, she's arrived.

184
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,224
Okay, we've got visual.

185
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:17,939
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got lost.

186
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:22,509
It is no problem. I was early.

187
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,169
-I have that sweater.
-What?

188
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,542
I have the sweater
she's wearing, but in taupe.

189
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:28,685
Really? Where did you get it?

190
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:30,012
-Target.
-No way.

191
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,586
Silence!

192
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:34,246
I'll have the Cobb.

193
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:35,891
And some wine.

194
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,687
-Do you--? Do you want wine?
-Vodka.

195
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:41,458
Vodka. Please.

196
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:47,467
Lucy Diamond, she's....

197
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,769
-What?
-Real.

198
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,738
-I never thought I'd see her in person.
-Yeah.

199
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,207
They also have it in teal.

200
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,146
So you're an assassin?

201
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,720
How's that work?

202
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,085
It's mostly freelance.

203
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,589
So you basically, what,
you kill, like, whoever?

204
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:15,823
Sometimes maim.

205
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,297
-Maiming's more.
-What are they saying?

206
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:23,337
They are talking about killing
and how to kill and who to kill.

207
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:26,305
-Oh, God.
-But I do it just to pay bills.

208
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:29,605
-Really?
-Mostly...

209
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,873
...I want to be dancer.

210
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:40,453
-Yeah. Can I have my bracelet back?
-What are you doing?

211
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:42,649
My dad got that
when he graduated Quantico.

212
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:48,526
Greatest dance instructor in Russia,
but I can't afford to pay, so he say:

213
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:53,692
"My wife is cheating on me. You kill
her lover, I give you free lessons."

214
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:57,464
Fine, okay. Oh, my gosh.

215
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:01,441
First man was goat farmer,
so I use goat shears.

216
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:06,806
Second man, he likes chickens, so I
took six chickens and put in thro--

217
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:09,879
-What's wrong?
-Oh, you know, I just--

218
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:12,988
I'm feeling really ill.
It's my stomach. l--

219
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,681
-I think I have food poisoning.
-Are you blowing me?

220
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,451
-What?
-Off.

221
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,994
-Are you blowing me off?
-No, no, no.

222
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,644
Let's do this.

223
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:07,910
-Was it something I said?
-No. No. Look, I just--

224
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,013
I just got back into town,
you know? And-- And--

225
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:14,912
-And I just got out of this relationship--
-I'm not asking for relationship!

226
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,779
It's not you. You seem really nice,
you do. It's me.

227
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,782
Baby, I can change.

228
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,625
Guys....

229
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,061
I'm just not interested.

230
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,564
Then only you will die alone.

231
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:34,262
Head Lucy off.
Me and Dom will take the back.

232
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:37,798
Mr. Phipps specifically ordered us
not to engage her.

233
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,629
Janet....

234
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:44,429
-Who here isn't gonna graduate?
-Me.

235
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,700
-Why?
-I haven't earned my stripes.

236
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:50,808
Oh, would that be this thing here?

237
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,112
And why is that?

238
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,012
You need to give me
a recommendation.

239
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,517
I don't see why you just won't--

240
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,154
Not what I asked.

241
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:02,723
I need to show courage in the face
of unspeakable danger.

242
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,860
Exactly.

243
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:08,160
So quit your whining
and follow my orders.

244
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,630
Let's go!

245
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,639
Okay. I'll check the parking lot.
You go that way.

246
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,707
-Stay in communication range.
-But Mr.--

247
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:22,174
You can do this, Janet.

248
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,625
Janet, are you there?

249
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,041
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God.

250
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:06,154
-I am so sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

251
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,715
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

252
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,056
-You're Lucy Diamond.
-You're a D.E.B.

253
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,925
You have the right to remain silent.

254
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,693
-You're reading me my rights?
-Anything you say can...

255
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,098
...and will be used against you.

256
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,138
-Okay, here's the thing.
-Yeah?

257
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:34,112
-I am really not up for dying today.
-Me neither.

258
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:39,153
So I was thinking that....

259
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:41,722
-Why don't you put your gun down.
-Put yours down.

260
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,622
You're the criminal, and I'm the cop,
so I think I'm more trustworthy.

261
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:48,161
I was minding my own business
on a blind date...

262
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:50,731
...when you guys decided
to rain shit all over me.

263
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,499
Wait.

264
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,730
-You were on a blind date?
-Whatever.

265
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,809
-With that Russian girl?
-What?

266
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:05,505
Nothing. I just--
I didn't know you were a--

267
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,615
Why would you know?

268
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:12,618
-That really torpedoes my thesis.
-Your thesis?

269
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,917
I'm writing a term paper on you.

270
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,822
-You're kidding me.
-No, it's for Capes and Capers:

271
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,361
Gender Reconstruction
and the Criminal Mastermind.

272
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:23,658
-It's a really popular class.
-Oh, come on.

273
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,961
But it's hard because there's
only anecdotal evidence about you.

274
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:31,938
I mean, nobody's actually
ever spoken to you.

275
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,810
Until now.

276
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,807
Right. Until now.

277
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,515
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

278
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,954
Amy. Bradshaw.
D.E.B.S. Sector 1.

279
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,219
Lucy Diamond.

280
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,659
It's really nice to meet you.

281
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:02,335
You're still, you know,
under arrest.

282
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,165
-Am I?
-Amy!

283
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,974
Or you could
just let me go.

284
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:12,037
-I really couldn't.
-Come on.

285
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:15,343
Haven't you ever done anything
you're not supposed to?

286
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:18,649
-Amy, where are you?
-I'm over here.

287
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,783
Son of a bitch!

288
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,828
Are you okay?
We couldn't reach you.

289
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:28,657
-I'm fine.
-Well, what happened?

290
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,890
She was here.

291
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,195
-Lucy Diamond was here.
-That's impossible.

292
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:37,198
If she was here,
you'd be dead right now.

293
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,101
You guys....

294
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:50,849
Sweet Jesus.

295
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,551
Do you know what this means?

296
00:21:57,126 --> 00:22:01,290
You are the only one ever
to fight Lucy Diamond...

297
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:03,932
...and live to tell about it.

298
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,072
What a disaster!

299
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:15,473
I am so sorry.
Leave it to the D.E.B.S.

300
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:19,479
You're in town a week, and
they're all over you, just grabbing--

301
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,881
What?

302
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:27,556
-Really, what?
-I met somebody.

303
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,428
It was weird,
the thing about the dance...

304
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:35,564
...but I had a feeling
you and Ninotchka--

305
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:38,292
No, no, no. Scud,
Ninotchka was a train wreck.

306
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,231
I'm not following you.

307
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:43,600
Okay, first, swear to me you are
not gonna freak out about this.

308
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,832
-Freak out about what?
-You know, sometimes--

309
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,068
Oh, my God! Who is it?

310
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:51,306
Okay, what do you know
about an Amy Bradshaw?

311
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:54,314
Amy Bradshaw. The girl
from the smuggling op.

312
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:57,942
-No.
-No.

313
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,290
Oh, my God.

314
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,423
Amy Bradshaw?

315
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:11,257
Blond hair.

316
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:13,435
Plaid skirt.

317
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:16,367
She's a D.E.B.
Okay, not only is she a D.E.B...

318
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,337
...she is the D.E.B.
She is the perfect score.

319
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:21,909
What is that supposed to mean?

320
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,547
Amy Bradshaw is
the only person ever...

321
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:30,447
...to get a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

322
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,679
-Give me the keys.
-Are you listening?

323
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:34,789
Perfect score means perfect spy.

324
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,051
She is their pride and joy,
she is literally their poster child.

325
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:41,424
Well, their poster child doesn't
know it yet, but she's into me.

326
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,191
You can't be serious.

327
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,358
Would you say back on the horse?

328
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,965
Where are you going?

329
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,873
Back.

330
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:06,384
P.S. She's straight!

331
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:30,278
You stay here.

332
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,246
Lucy, I beg of you--

333
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:44,352
All right, D.E.B.S.
Show me what you're made of.

334
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:33,241
-Amy.
-Oh, my God!

335
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,442
Jesus!

336
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,170
Okay, just hold on.

337
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:46,819
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

338
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,456
Why?

339
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,353
Well, I was thinking about what
you said about your paper.

340
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,663
My thesis?

341
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,666
I think it's stupid for you
to do outdated research...

342
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:02,066
...when you could come
straight to the source.

343
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:03,802
You?

344
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:06,999
Come out with me.
I'll let you ask me anything.

345
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:10,812
-I can't go out with you.
-Why not?

346
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:14,114
Like, a zillion reasons.

347
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,817
Well, now you have
to come out with me.

348
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,872
Janet, what are you doing here?

349
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,640
I don't know who that is,
but he ruined my sweater!

350
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:49,512
-I don't know who you think you are.
-Janet, no!

351
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:57,492
Did you go to Dalton?

352
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,252
Yeah.

353
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:15,876
-Where are you taking us?
-Where do you want to go?

354
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,012
Home!

355
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,382
What are you doing?

356
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:53,047
Come on.

357
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,416
Look, these tunnels
go on for miles...

358
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:01,751
...so you guys could be lost
in there for days, even weeks.

359
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:07,259
Okay. Suit yourself.

360
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,985
I have to pee.

361
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,147
-Want a beer?
-No.

362
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,648
Come on.

363
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,396
Sit down.

364
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,379
So how long you been a D.E.B.?

365
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:14,382
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

366
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,616
I don't know what you expect
to accomplish by bringing me here.

367
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:22,526
Lighten up. I know there are a load of
questions you're just dying to ask me.

368
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:25,699
Come on, tell me about your thesis.

369
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:31,601
-It's stupid.
-Well, try me.

370
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,245
I guess my central hypothesis...

371
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:40,780
...is that as a woman operating
in a male-dominated field...

372
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,145
...you felt the need
to overcompensate...

373
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:46,116
...by being exponentially
more ruthless and diabolical...

374
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:49,121
...than your established
male counterparts.

375
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,451
I am not more ruthless.

376
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:55,290
I think an argument could be made
that you are, i.e. we're here.

377
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,664
That's interesting.

378
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:01,970
Continue.

379
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:05,301
And I think that these
psychological forces combine...

380
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,738
...to create a kind of emotional void...

381
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,641
...in which you're incapable
of loving or being loved.

382
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:14,146
-See, that is so not true.
-What?

383
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:17,979
-I'm open to love. I am!
-I'm sorry. It's just a theory.

384
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:20,452
Well, what the hell do you know
about it anyway?

385
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,417
Nothing.

386
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,097
I just broke up with my boyfriend,
like, five hours ago.

387
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,667
I'm sorry, that sucks.

388
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,130
Thanks.

389
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,877
Why did you break up with him?

390
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:46,310
I don't know, it just, it wasn't....

391
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:49,280
I think love should be irresistible,
like a drug.

392
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:53,319
I think when it happens you should
just not be able to help yourself.

393
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:56,014
I just-- I wanted...

394
00:31:56,192 --> 00:31:57,853
...more.

395
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:02,730
-Babbling.
-No.

396
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,365
You're not at all.

397
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,234
This is so weird. I....

398
00:32:08,504 --> 00:32:11,371
-Why aren't you killing me?
-Not into that.

399
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:14,165
But you killed those agents
in Antarctica.

400
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:17,243
They died of frostbite or something.
I never even met them.

401
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:19,812
-And those ATF guys in Peru?
-Ebola.

402
00:32:24,053 --> 00:32:26,749
You're so not what I expected.

403
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:29,187
Well, I think that's a good thing.

404
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:41,492
-So, what's up with Ninotchka?
-Oh, God, she was such a headcase.

405
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,161
-Where do you meet someone like that?
-Jesus Christ!

406
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:57,218
Yes!

407
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:02,956
Correct me if I'm wrong...

408
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,855
...but your friend appears
to be hitting on my friend.

409
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:09,892
-You're not wrong.
-Yeah, but my friend's not into that.

410
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:16,093
So Bobby's just, like, all over me,
and I just--

411
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:18,467
I just feel like he doesn't get me,
you know?

412
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:20,871
Do you ever feel like
nobody understands you?

413
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,567
Yes, all the time.

414
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:30,047
I am really glad I met you.

415
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,744
I'm really glad I met you too.

416
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:43,996
I should go.

417
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,031
Okay.

418
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,038
Am I gonna see you again?

419
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:57,569
Do you wanna see me again?

420
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:02,182
I mean, I'm breaking,
like, eight federal statutes...

421
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:05,252
-...being here with you right now.
-Yes, I know.

422
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,747
I could get kicked out
of the D.E.B.S. for this.

423
00:34:10,492 --> 00:34:12,426
For what?

424
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,295
Oh, my God!
She almost kissed you.

425
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:26,307
You almost let her!

426
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:34,512
You owe me 50 bucks.

427
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:36,617
-Amy.
-Take me home.

428
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,219
-It's okay.
-Take me home.

429
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,554
-Amy.
-What?

430
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:52,462
-Well, when can I see you again?
-You can't.

431
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:55,837
-Come on.
-I'm serious. We cannot do this again.

432
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,700
Amy.

433
00:34:58,173 --> 00:34:59,970
I have to go.

434
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:03,143
I'm gonna come find you.

435
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,645
-What just happened?
-Nothing happened.

436
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:17,758
She was totally going to kiss you.
You're so into her.

437
00:35:17,926 --> 00:35:19,359
I am not!

438
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:24,227
You violated a prime directive.
Plus, hello, it's a girl.

439
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,561
-You're so busted.
-No, I'm not.

440
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:28,896
You violated the section codes
as much as me.

441
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:30,834
D.E.B.S. Code Section 1, Article 2:

442
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,407
"D.E.B.S. will not consort with a known
enemy, under penalty of treason."

443
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:35,873
I was not consorting.

444
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,741
-You exchanged e-mails with Scud.
-That's not the same.

445
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,008
You got drunk and nearly got
the chancellor of Bulgaria killed.

446
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:44,846
-That wasn't my fault.
-Remember how I covered for you?

447
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,921
I never told anybody.
If Max found about that...

448
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,049
...you would never ever get
your stripes and never graduate.

449
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,297
-I can't believe you.
-Not a word. Nothing happened.

450
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,212
Where have you been?

451
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,313
I couldn't sleep, so I took a walk.

452
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,980
I was really upset...

453
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,953
...about Bobby.

454
00:36:26,128 --> 00:36:28,221
Yeah, Bobby.

455
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:31,694
Oh, yeah. I forgot, I'm sorry.

456
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:36,899
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

457
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,130
Good.

458
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:42,607
You know, I can't stop thinking
about Lucy Diamond.

459
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:45,811
-You too?
-Yeah, I feel like she's playing...

460
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:49,974
...some type of sick game
of cat and mouse with us.

461
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,415
I don't know.

462
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:55,148
Hey, but you guys
be careful, okay?

463
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,423
Good night.

464
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:12,667
Yeah. Be careful.

465
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:26,146
Oh, my God, is it true?
Did you fight Lucy Diamond?

466
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:28,551
I heard you cut off her hand.
Does she have her hand?

467
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:32,693
Yes, she still has both of her hands.
God.

468
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:35,056
-Everybody's talking about it.
-About what?

469
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:37,323
How you met Lucy
and lived to tell about it.

470
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:40,229
They're calling you a hero,
when, really, you're a slut.

471
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:42,632
-You shut up.
-A gay slut.

472
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,864
-I'm not gay!
-Ms. Petrie wants to see you.

473
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,202
What? Janet!

474
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,020
-What's going on?
-Madam Petrie.

475
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:09,062
-She's coming down.
-Here? Why?

476
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:11,096
She never comes here.

477
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:17,835
-Ms. Petrie, I would just like to say--
-Who are you?

478
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,238
-Max Brewer.
-Max Brewer, my time is precious.

479
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,177
-You're wasting it. Where's the girl?
-Bradshaw comma Amy?

480
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,211
You.

481
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,692
Excellent. Well, take one over here.

482
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,257
Right there.

483
00:38:43,398 --> 00:38:45,195
Excellent. Sit.

484
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,435
Chill.

485
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,539
First....

486
00:38:58,714 --> 00:38:59,874
-Amy.
-Amy.

487
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:03,381
Let me just say how delighted
I am to meet you.

488
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,816
When I heard that one
of our own girls...

489
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:09,480
...had actually engaged Lucy Diamond
and lived to tell the tale....

490
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:11,785
I mean, Fred, over at
Central Intelligence...

491
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,827
...nearly peed his pants,
he was so jealous.

492
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:19,161
This stunt is really going to
put the academy on the map.

493
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:22,633
Lisa from Interpol called
to extend her congratulations.

494
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:24,931
I'll bet.

495
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:27,302
This is just too much fun!

496
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,005
Now, Alice--

497
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:30,235
-Amy.
-Amy.

498
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:33,609
We are going to need a description
of the encounter.

499
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:35,909
-The encounter?
-Everything that happened...

500
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,644
...no matter how small
or seemingly irrelevant.

501
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,487
-Why?
-To develop a profile, of course.

502
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:45,184
Nobody's ever been this close
to Lucy Diamond before.

503
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,692
You, for all intents and purposes,
are our leading expert.

504
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:53,097
I don't think I'm an expert at all.

505
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:56,028
You underestimate yourself.

506
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,866
I took the liberty of accessing
your private files.

507
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,511
-What?
-"It's a Man's World:

508
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,514
Lucy Diamond and the Psychology
of Cultural Criminality."

509
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:10,479
-Oh, God.
-"Lucy Diamond...

510
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:15,112
...is at once a narcissistic sociopath
and a victimized girl-child...

511
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,986
...eternally searching for
the love of her father.

512
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,960
Her crimes could be viewed
as a desperate cry for help.

513
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:27,625
The more she steals,
the deeper her feeling of emptiness."

514
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,066
-Annie--
-Amy.

515
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:37,734
I think you identify
with Lucy Diamond.

516
00:40:37,946 --> 00:40:41,712
I think she sees your pathos.

517
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:45,683
You've got some dangerous
union symbiosis going on.

518
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:49,915
What's that movie with Jodie and the
dog falls in the well with the lotion?

519
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,754
<i>-Silence of the Lambs.</i>
-You're the lamb, Amy.

520
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:56,062
We can use that to our advantage.

521
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,734
I'm putting you in charge
of this investigation.

522
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,968
What?

523
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:08,036
You are hereby promoted
to squad captain.

524
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,234
No.

525
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:12,607
Is there a problem?

526
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:17,008
Excuse me, ma'am, but I am
the captain of this squad.

527
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:18,914
-Miss...?
-Brewer.

528
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:23,786
Brewer. There is a killer on the loose.
There is no time for egos.

529
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,483
This is not the Girl Scouts,
this is espionage!

530
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:31,597
We have a chance
to do something here.

531
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:36,135
You have a chance
to do something.

532
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:38,602
Don't let us down.

533
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:43,476
Ready your troops.

534
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:46,113
You head out at 1400.

535
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,015
That's all.

536
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,121
Max!

537
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:05,262
-Max. Max.
-What?

538
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:09,294
I didn't mean for this to happen,
I swear. I don't even wanna be captain.

539
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:12,439
That's just it.
You don't even want it.

540
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,098
Boys fall at your feet, the school
kisses your ass...

541
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:18,940
...and Mrs. Petrie makes you
squad captain.

542
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:23,581
You'd be just as happy drawing
in your stupid little book.

543
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,315
I don't understand why you have
to take away...

544
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:29,480
...the only thing I have going for me.

545
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:31,784
-Oh, Max--
-Just--

546
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:38,155
Whatever.

547
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:40,597
It's fine.

548
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:44,695
-Just promise me one thing.
-What?

549
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:47,966
You catch the bitch.

550
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:55,378
Lucy Diamond's on the move!
Robbery in progress! Code 99!

551
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:14,831
<i>The bank employees</i>
<i>are being held hostage.</i>

552
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:17,301
<i>Lucy and her cohorts</i>
<i>are still inside.</i>

553
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,997
<i>Apprehend the suspect,</i>
<i>recover the money.</i>

554
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:22,006
<i>The bank is coming up</i>
<i>on your left.</i>

555
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,304
<i>D.E.B.S., be careful.</i>

556
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,144
<i>D.E.B.S. spotted en route.</i>
<i>E TA two minutes.</i>

557
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,186
Copy that.

558
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:45,069
D.E.B.S. en route, two minutes.

559
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:47,898
Do I look okay?

560
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,836
This is retarded.

561
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:03,887
-Bradshaw?
-What?

562
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,721
The plan?

563
00:44:06,893 --> 00:44:09,487
Oh, okay. Formation
Alpha Kappa Gamma.

564
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:15,193
Let's do this!

565
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:53,831
What was that?

566
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,272
She's here.

567
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:58,770
She's watching us.

568
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,970
Jesus.

569
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:06,784
<i>Come here.</i>

570
00:45:06,953 --> 00:45:08,545
<i>I can't.</i>

571
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:11,383
-Come here.
<i>-I can't.</i>

572
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:14,619
What are you doing?

573
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:16,989
Nothing. Let's go.

574
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:32,769
We'll be right back.

575
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:41,878
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

576
00:45:43,122 --> 00:45:45,352
-What?
-It's a trap.

577
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,255
-Whatever.
-Wait!

578
00:45:49,028 --> 00:45:50,893
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

579
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:53,955
This is great.

580
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:57,000
If you're gonna do the job,
do the job right.

581
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,163
Creepy shadows, no bad guys,
enclosed space. Trap.

582
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:05,940
-You think I can't handle it?
-No.

583
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:08,546
I know that you can't handle it.

584
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:11,439
I don't care if you are
the perfect score.

585
00:46:11,617 --> 00:46:13,517
Perfect whore.

586
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:18,890
You wouldn't know Alpha Gamma
if it was tattooed on your forehead.

587
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:22,186
-Guys.
-This is stupid. We are going to die.

588
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:25,125
No, it's okay.

589
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:27,493
As your senior officer...

590
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:31,931
...I order you
to secure the vault, soldier.

591
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:36,733
-You order me?
-You heard me.

592
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:41,378
Fine.

593
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:53,749
See, that wasn't so hard.

594
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,190
I think you guys owe me an ap--

595
00:47:01,968 --> 00:47:03,026
Trap.

596
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:10,865
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to apologize for last night.

597
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:13,238
I was-- I was out of line.

598
00:47:13,412 --> 00:47:16,245
-You have to release them.
-Who?

599
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,780
The hostages.
And put back the money.

600
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:22,511
This thing has gotten
way out of hand.

601
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:26,283
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

602
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:32,423
Please don't smoke.

603
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:34,591
Please?

604
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,568
Oh, my God,
tell her not to smoke.

605
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:43,469
There's not enough oxygen.
We're gonna run out of air...

606
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,304
...and we're gonna be all faint...

607
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:48,708
...and the air that's gonna be left
is gonna be toxic.

608
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,751
This is bullshit.

609
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:06,155
This cannot get any worse.

610
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:09,327
Trap.

611
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:11,934
Don't you understand?
I can't be here.

612
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:14,402
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stress you out.

613
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:15,801
I'm not stressed out!

614
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:19,568
-No. No!
-This is not possible.

615
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:21,838
I'm such a freak.
You must think I'm a freak.

616
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:24,414
-I don't.
-I'm sorry I wigged out last night.

617
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:25,811
-It's okay.
-It's just...

618
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:28,818
...I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

619
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:33,182
-Yeah, okay.
-I mean....

620
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,691
-I mean, I really like you.
-Right.

621
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:41,163
But I don't, like, like you.

622
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:46,829
Yeah. Yeah, I gathered.

623
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:50,271
That's why I brought you here,
so we could clear the air between us.

624
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:53,537
It's really sweet of you
to go to all this trouble...

625
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:58,173
...the chute and all. But my friends
are gonna wonder where I am.

626
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:00,285
-No, they're not.
-Why?

627
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:02,284
No reason.

628
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:05,149
Lucy!

629
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:08,525
-Going to be squashed!
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

630
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:10,320
-Oh, my God. Lucy!
-Come on.

631
00:49:10,496 --> 00:49:12,828
It's not like they're gonna die
or anything.

632
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:16,798
No! No! Oh, no!

633
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:18,800
Let them out. I'm serious.

634
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:22,873
Okay. Jesus. Booby trap
deactivated. Happy?

635
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:31,812
That wasn't funny.

636
00:49:31,984 --> 00:49:33,508
It was kind of funny.

637
00:49:35,254 --> 00:49:37,017
I can't.

638
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:41,893
-I gotta go.
-No, no, I'll go.

639
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:46,823
I understand this whole thing
isn't gonna work out between us...

640
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:51,197
...because, obviously, I misinterpreted
the whole situation. But....

641
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:57,775
I just want you to know that last night
was the most alive I've felt in a while.

642
00:49:58,277 --> 00:50:02,646
So I guess I'll see you around.
Same Bat-time or whatever.

643
00:50:18,297 --> 00:50:20,458
Come with me.

644
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:23,793
Come on.
What do you have to lose?

645
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:26,936
Everything.

646
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:52,629
Oh, my gosh.
Lucy Diamond has Amy.

647
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:55,392
You guys, she's been kidnapped.

648
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,601
A D.E.B. is down.

649
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,505
We will spare no expense.

650
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:05,939
We will leave no rock unturned.

651
00:51:06,112 --> 00:51:11,209
We will not rest until we see
that she comes back safely.

652
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:20,425
No, no!

653
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:40,301
<i>No way! Are you... ?</i>

654
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:41,980
<i>I know.</i>

655
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,987
Amy, where are you?

656
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,219
I know you're out playing hooky
with Lucy...

657
00:51:56,395 --> 00:51:59,990
...but they have the whole school
looking for you. Bobby, everybody.

658
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,394
Call me.

659
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:05,003
You know where she is?
Do you know where she is?

660
00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:07,537
How about this?
Do you wanna answer me?

661
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:18,183
Amy, oh, my God, if you don't
come back, I'm telling.

662
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,808
I am telling your mother. I'm calling
her and telling her right now.

663
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:56,120
Seriously, Amy, I'm sorry I left
such a mean message. Just....

664
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,886
Please, come home.

665
00:53:13,372 --> 00:53:16,432
So then this mysterious man
shows up at my high school...

666
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:18,873
...and hands me this letter
which is, like:

667
00:53:19,044 --> 00:53:22,480
"Congratulations, you've just been
accepted into Jameson University."

668
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:26,448
And I'm like, "I didn't apply
to Jameson University."

669
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:29,782
The government's
freaky that way.

670
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:31,547
Yeah.

671
00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:37,989
So, what does it measure,
this secret test in the SAT?

672
00:53:38,163 --> 00:53:40,154
I don't know.

673
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:46,133
-You never asked?
-No. It measures spy stuff.

674
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,607
-What?
-It's just weird that you let...

675
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:55,770
...this test decide what you're gonna
be, and you don't even know what it is.

676
00:53:56,315 --> 00:54:00,809
It doesn't decide what I'm gonna be.
It's an aptitude test.

677
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,653
It measures aptitude, I guess.

678
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,517
Okay.

679
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:10,025
-You should do what you're good at.
-No, you should do what you love.

680
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:11,992
I am doing what I love.

681
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:15,156
-Why are you psychoanalyzing me?
-I'm not psychoanalyzing you.

682
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:18,770
I mean, just because I'm not
some badass master criminal...

683
00:54:18,937 --> 00:54:21,371
...doesn't mean that
what I do is not important.

684
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,703
-I didn't say it wasn't important.
-Do you love a life of crime?

685
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,708
-Yeah, I do.
-So you get a kick out of...

686
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:30,711
...taking money from hard-working,
honest people.

687
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,383
-What is your problem?
-I just--

688
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:35,486
-I don't think you should judge me.
-I'm not.

689
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:38,487
I'm not the one that got picked
out of a gajillion people...

690
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:41,785
...to be Miss Super-Duper
Crime-Fighting Goody-Two-Shoes.

691
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,859
I've never been perfect at anything.

692
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:50,795
Look...

693
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:55,296
...I didn't even wanna be a criminal.
I wanted to be a pirate.

694
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:59,936
Pirates are criminals.

695
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:03,306
Whoops.

696
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:07,042
I wanted to go to art school.

697
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,384
-Art school?
-In Barcelona.

698
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:12,383
-You should go, you should do it.
-Maybe.

699
00:55:13,158 --> 00:55:16,855
After I make the world safe
from people like you.

700
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,525
I don't know what the test saw in me.

701
00:55:23,702 --> 00:55:28,537
Everybody thinks I am gonna
make this perfect spy but me.

702
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:32,475
I guess I'm proving them
all wrong now.

703
00:55:35,848 --> 00:55:38,248
Is that what you're doing with me?

704
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,748
Sabotaging your spy career?

705
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:44,012
I'm here because I feel more
like me when I'm with you...

706
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:48,493
...than I do when I'm with me.

707
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:51,593
Look, let's just...

708
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,891
...forget we're here, okay?

709
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:56,762
Let's pretend we're in Barcelona,
you're in art school...

710
00:55:56,935 --> 00:55:59,267
...and I'm renting sailboats
to tourists.

711
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:04,866
And nobody is a superhero,
nobody is a villain, we're just us.

712
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:33,333
Max here.
This better be really good.

713
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:38,241
<i>-You are the D.E.B.S. ?</i>
-Who is this?

714
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,471
I know where your friend is.

715
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:44,311
We've got a lead on Amy. Let's go.

716
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:51,055
Oh, no, no, no....

717
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:59,188
Get your ass over here.

718
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:01,857
We got a lead on Amy.

719
00:57:03,368 --> 00:57:06,428
And no boys upstairs
after curfew.

720
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:09,464
Out.

721
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,840
Pick up, pick up, pick up....

722
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:36,890
-My God. I'm so sorry.
-Did you just snap my bra?

723
00:57:37,135 --> 00:57:38,363
-No.
-Yeah, you did.

724
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:53,978
-That hasn't happened since 6th grade.
-I was trying to be smooth.

725
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:57,620
-What? You did it first.
-You're dead.

726
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,391
And bingo!
I am the god of Bingo.

727
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,494
Breach.

728
00:58:17,175 --> 00:58:21,077
Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

729
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,214
Bingo!

730
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:30,746
Damn it!

731
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:34,392
-Say mercy. Come on. Say mercy.
-No. No. No.

732
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:38,089
-Do you give? Do you gi--?
-No.

733
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,897
Do you love me?

734
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:48,536
Yes.

735
00:58:57,215 --> 00:58:58,876
Come on.

736
00:59:00,986 --> 00:59:03,682
What the hell?

737
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:05,982
I couldn't stop them.

738
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,819
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

739
00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:10,154
What?

740
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,820
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

741
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,126
Let's go.

742
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:17,825
Sorry.

743
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:53,029
Oh, God.

744
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,631
It is not what you think.

745
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:09,385
I hope it was worth it.

746
01:00:11,556 --> 01:00:15,014
You really should
check your messages.

747
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:24,962
Look, it'll be okay.

748
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:28,336
No, it won't.

749
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,331
This is a nightmare.

750
01:00:54,499 --> 01:00:57,366
This is--
This is not happening.

751
01:01:09,614 --> 01:01:11,411
Are you kidding me?

752
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:14,074
We conduct a nationwide
manhunt for you...

753
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:16,015
...and you're boning the suspect?

754
01:01:16,421 --> 01:01:19,288
What did you think this was,
a joke?

755
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:23,394
"Let's divert federal resources
and man-hours...

756
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:26,360
...so I can have my collegiate
lesbian fling in style."

757
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:28,863
I was doing research.

758
01:01:29,034 --> 01:01:31,025
I'll bet.

759
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:36,571
Treason. Consorting
with the enemy.

760
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:39,040
Aiding and abetting.

761
01:01:39,377 --> 01:01:43,040
I'm going to be the laughingstock
of the entire intelligence community.

762
01:01:43,215 --> 01:01:46,810
I am going to send you
so far away...

763
01:01:46,985 --> 01:01:50,045
...that luxuries like
toilet paper and Diet Coke...

764
01:01:50,222 --> 01:01:52,782
...will be as a distant dream to you.

765
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,721
Ms. Petrie.

766
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:57,623
Is somebody talking to me?

767
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:00,321
Because that would be extremely
ill-advised right now.

768
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:03,491
Ms. Petrie, this infraction is
a considerable embarrassment...

769
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:07,399
-...to you and the academy, right?
-Have I not been speaking in English?

770
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:10,598
Well, there is a way that
we can turn it all around.

771
01:02:11,443 --> 01:02:13,138
Explain.

772
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:16,606
Make Amy D.E.B. of the year
next week at endgame.

773
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:20,011
Nobody knows
what happened tonight but us.

774
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:25,181
What good would it do to send
Amy to Siberia? Nothing.

775
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:30,657
Your pride and joy will be disgraced,
and for what?

776
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:33,923
Exactly.
So here's what we're gonna do.

777
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:35,999
Tomorrow we're gonna go
to class...

778
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:38,762
...and we're gonna report
that we rescued Amy...

779
01:02:38,937 --> 01:02:40,768
...just in the nick of time.

780
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:43,999
And Amy is gonna act
traumatized but cool.

781
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:47,703
And she will go to endgame
on Saturday with Bobby.

782
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:50,847
And she'll give a speech
about how she battled Lucy...

783
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,541
...and lived to fight another day.

784
01:02:53,718 --> 01:02:58,655
And you, Ms. Petrie, will get
another feather in your cap.

785
01:02:59,057 --> 01:03:02,185
And we don't lose a valued member
of our team.

786
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,222
But she's obviously in love
with our nemesis.

787
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,888
How can I make sure
she won't run off again?

788
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:11,365
Well, let's ask her.

789
01:03:16,308 --> 01:03:18,469
The Amy that I know...

790
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:23,706
...wouldn't sell out her friends
and her country for some supervillain.

791
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:26,317
The Amy that I know...

792
01:03:26,484 --> 01:03:28,679
...she must have been
brainwashed or something.

793
01:03:28,854 --> 01:03:34,053
Maybe Lucy was doing some type
of experiments with mind control.

794
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:38,225
Because the Amy that I know
would never...

795
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:41,227
...ever betray us like that.

796
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:46,766
You didn't know
what you were doing, right?

797
01:03:46,972 --> 01:03:48,337
Right.

798
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:50,770
And there's no way
that you're in love with her?

799
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:53,677
No. No way.

800
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:56,946
Good.

801
01:03:57,115 --> 01:03:59,174
-You'll keep her secret?
-Are you kidding?

802
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,210
No way I'm telling.

803
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:08,289
Perhaps we can chalk this up
to the indiscretions of youth.

804
01:04:12,063 --> 01:04:14,964
I underestimated you, Brewer.
Good work.

805
01:04:15,133 --> 01:04:17,465
I'll remember this
when I review applications...

806
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,194
...for the International Bureau.

807
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:22,067
Have Miss Bradshaw vetted
for information she may have...

808
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,707
...on Diamond's whereabouts.

809
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:27,442
She is to be placed on
round-the-clock lockdown...

810
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:31,013
...only out for missions and class.

811
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,713
Be grateful you have friends
who care for you.

812
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:38,617
Too bad it's more
than they can say for you.

813
01:04:43,895 --> 01:04:45,328
-Max--
-No.

814
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,225
D.E.B.S. stick together.

815
01:04:47,432 --> 01:04:50,265
But do not misunderstand me,
I do not forgive you.

816
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,570
-Max.
-And you.

817
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:55,228
I don't even wanna look at you.

818
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:58,968
You let me go on this whole time
believing that she was in trouble.

819
01:04:59,144 --> 01:05:02,307
You can forget about
that recommendation.

820
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:09,250
Well, you're not
as boring as I thought...

821
01:05:09,554 --> 01:05:13,320
...but you are not as bright either.

822
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,360
-Bobby--
-Don't.

823
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:22,930
Janet, I am so sorry.

824
01:05:23,101 --> 01:05:26,537
All I ever wanted
was to earn my stripes.

825
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:31,165
Because I believe in it, you know?
I believe in what we do.

826
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,376
And now....

827
01:05:43,888 --> 01:05:48,018
-Where is Lucy now?
-I don't know.

828
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:50,491
Are you gonna see her again?

829
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:37,870
Hey.

830
01:06:38,043 --> 01:06:39,533
Hey.

831
01:06:41,046 --> 01:06:45,039
So you and me going
to endgame together?

832
01:06:45,216 --> 01:06:47,275
Yeah. I guess.

833
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:52,180
I still love you.

834
01:06:52,357 --> 01:06:54,587
I know you still love me too.

835
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:01,925
Yeah.

836
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:11,700
My dad got this on a drug bust
in Malaysia.

837
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:15,240
Listen...

838
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:17,381
...l've been thinking.

839
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:20,276
That whole lezzy thing...

840
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:22,886
...it's kind of hot.

841
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:25,215
See you tonight, babe.

842
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:38,499
You did the right thing.

843
01:07:47,078 --> 01:07:48,602
Hey.

844
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:51,442
How do you do that?

845
01:07:51,616 --> 01:07:54,847
For a top-secret installation,
your security really is for shit.

846
01:07:55,086 --> 01:07:58,021
-You can't be here.
-Oh, I know.

847
01:07:58,223 --> 01:08:00,691
You say you can't see me,
and then I see you anyway.

848
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:04,090
-It's kind of this little game we play.
-Get out.

849
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:06,490
Is this about your friends?
Because if it is...

850
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:08,495
...I can just talk to them, you know.

851
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:10,361
We can work out some sort
of dtente.

852
01:08:10,535 --> 01:08:12,594
-I said, get out. I'm warning you.
-Amy.

853
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:18,871
You have to go now.

854
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:26,146
It's your stupid friends. Why don't you
just think for yourself for a change.

855
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:38,453
She's gone.

856
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:40,888
Are you okay?

857
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,897
I thought you were different!

858
01:09:01,286 --> 01:09:05,655
She thinks I'm bad news?
Oh, I'll give her bad news.

859
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:14,222
-What are you doing?
-Australia's toast.

860
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,493
-What's wrong with Australians?
-I don't like their attitude.

861
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:20,536
Okay. Hey, come on.

862
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:35,846
Scud, I don't know how this
happened to me, but...

863
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:39,389
...being bad doesn't
feel good anymore.

864
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,950
Do you love her?

865
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:51,299
You're willing to give up all this...

866
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:54,961
...the life of crime,
the whole nine yards?

867
01:09:56,274 --> 01:09:58,333
Whatever it takes.

868
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,910
All right, then.

869
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:04,810
We're going in.

870
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,712
What?

871
01:10:07,285 --> 01:10:09,651
We gots to get her back.

872
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:27,466
<i>In a remarkable twist,</i>
<i>sums of stolen money...</i>

873
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:29,630
<i>...have been reappearing</i>
<i>in bank accounts.</i>

874
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:33,402
<i>Authorities are trying to determine</i>
<i>the location of these wire transfers...</i>

875
01:10:33,578 --> 01:10:35,910
<i>...however, have been unsuccessful</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

876
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,233
<i>The Louvre received a surprise</i>
<i>package this morning...</i>

877
01:11:39,444 --> 01:11:43,642
<i>...a shipment of stolen paintings</i>
<i>estimated to be worth $ 15 million.</i>

878
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:47,182
<i>Insider sources say that the artwork</i>
<i>was originally taken...</i>

879
01:11:47,352 --> 01:11:50,344
<i>...by notorious supervillain</i>
<i>Lucy Diamond.</i>

880
01:12:22,553 --> 01:12:25,021
She's out there somewhere.

881
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:28,556
It's time for plan B.

882
01:12:28,726 --> 01:12:31,752
-There's a plan B?
-Yeah.

883
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:41,265
-Getting ready for tonight?
-Hey, Mr. P.

884
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:47,501
Tell me, Amy,
how are you getting along?

885
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:50,039
Okay, I guess.

886
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:53,543
You know, I've found
that in this business...

887
01:12:53,718 --> 01:12:56,448
...there isn't much room for love.

888
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:59,784
Love requires trust,
and trust requires honesty.

889
01:13:03,528 --> 01:13:06,497
-Mr. P., can I ask you a question?
-Of course.

890
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:09,724
I got a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

891
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:11,892
-Yes, you did.
-But...

892
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:14,594
-...what does that test measure?
-I'm sorry?

893
01:13:14,772 --> 01:13:17,570
I mean, Dominique
is a sex addict.

894
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:21,467
Janet, she has a couple
of shoplifting convictions.

895
01:13:21,646 --> 01:13:23,944
Max? Well, she's
borderline psychotic.

896
01:13:24,148 --> 01:13:28,608
But nothing in my past indicated
that I'd be good at being a spy.

897
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:31,015
So...

898
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,680
...why did I get a perfect score?

899
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:39,991
The test measures
your ability to lie.

900
01:13:41,299 --> 01:13:43,631
You are a perfect liar.

901
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:48,698
Don't get me wrong.
Perfect liars make perfect spies.

902
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:52,138
The rest we can teach,
but subterfuge...

903
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:54,210
...that comes naturally.

904
01:13:56,781 --> 01:13:59,773
Look, have fun tonight.

905
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:03,352
Endgame only happens
once a year.

906
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:06,380
Enjoy yourself.

907
01:14:40,424 --> 01:14:43,825
-Okay, what's the plan?
-There's security here, here and here.

908
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:47,260
We'll infiltrate through the rooftop
and take out the guards here.

909
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:50,025
Through the vents,
rappel down the elevator shaft...

910
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,931
...and then bungee-jump
down to the dance floor.

911
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:55,128
Okay, check. What next?

912
01:14:59,076 --> 01:15:02,011
"Tell her that you love her."
Scud, that's your plan?

913
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:06,013
-That's not a plan!
-War is easy. Love is hard.

914
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:08,684
Okay, so how's this?

915
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:10,718
"My tour of duty
behind enemy lines...

916
01:15:10,888 --> 01:15:13,618
...has taught me to remain
vigilant to my core values:

917
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,954
Bravery, loyalty and justice.

918
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:20,221
And so it is a great honor
for me to accept this award...."

919
01:15:20,398 --> 01:15:21,695
Blah, blah, blah.

920
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,266
What if she really loves her?

921
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:28,929
I mean, what if Lucy
makes her happy?

922
01:15:30,808 --> 01:15:34,938
If you were really her best friend,
you'd probably let her go.

923
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:39,172
You can't decide
matters of the heart.

924
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,481
It is madness to try.

925
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:45,380
It's time.

926
01:15:59,136 --> 01:16:01,229
Okay, so I just wrote down
a couple words...

927
01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:03,498
...explaining our version
of what happened...

928
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:06,768
...and expressing your gratitude
at being honored.

929
01:16:06,944 --> 01:16:08,502
And...

930
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:11,314
...l'm sorry that we've been fighting.

931
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:13,643
It's just I really want
what's best for you.

932
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:15,845
I know.

933
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:20,517
All right. Your speech.

934
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:39,034
Attention, D.E.B.S.!

935
01:16:39,243 --> 01:16:40,835
Dudes!

936
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:46,673
Once in a blue moon...

937
01:16:47,118 --> 01:16:49,279
...an exceptional young lady
comes along...

938
01:16:49,487 --> 01:16:55,050
...who truly exemplifies
what it means to be a D.E.B.

939
01:16:55,259 --> 01:16:59,127
Discipline. Energy. Beauty.

940
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:03,160
Lucy Diamond's been spotted
infiltrating the--

941
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:11,402
Secure every entrance
to this place, every floor.

942
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:15,136
Nobody gets in or out
without my say-so.

943
01:17:15,312 --> 01:17:17,007
Game over, Diamond.

944
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:20,241
I have spent my life defending
this great country of ours...

945
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:22,978
...and I have learned one thing:

946
01:17:23,154 --> 01:17:26,555
That sometimes
it's not on the battlefield...

947
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:28,589
...where true courage is shown.

948
01:17:39,203 --> 01:17:43,367
Amy Bradshaw survived
one of the worst tragedies...

949
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:46,271
...that could happen to a young lady.

950
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:48,605
Kidnapped...

951
01:17:48,813 --> 01:17:51,543
...held hostage...

952
01:17:51,716 --> 01:17:53,684
...for seven terrible days.

953
01:17:53,884 --> 01:17:56,079
-Matthews here.
-We're not seeing her.

954
01:17:57,054 --> 01:17:58,544
Look again!

955
01:17:58,723 --> 01:18:03,922
What fears she may have known,
none of us can fully appreciate.

956
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:07,795
But she has agreed to tell us
part of what she learned...

957
01:18:07,965 --> 01:18:10,024
...on her journey.

958
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:16,571
It gives me great pleasure tonight
to give our greatest honor...

959
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:18,902
...the Mary Jane...

960
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:21,943
...to our very own perfect score...

961
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:24,944
...Amy Bradshaw!

962
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:43,490
Courage.

963
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:46,163
"Courage" is a big word.

964
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:48,595
I did not know what courage
meant to me...

965
01:18:48,773 --> 01:18:52,800
...until I endured
seven agonizing days...

966
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:55,104
...in captivity...

967
01:18:55,946 --> 01:18:56,970
Go.

968
01:18:58,482 --> 01:19:03,010
...captured and held hostage
by a madwoman.

969
01:19:03,187 --> 01:19:05,917
-Report.
<i>-We've got nothing here.</i>

970
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:19,997
It was a routine mission
gone terribly wrong.

971
01:19:27,812 --> 01:19:31,270
I was separated from my squad
and knocked unconscious.

972
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:39,853
I awoke in the arms of the enemy.

973
01:20:15,192 --> 01:20:18,753
Just the sound of my own desperate
thoughts to keep me company.

974
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:24,967
If there is corruption in this city,
Lucy Diamond is behind it.

975
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:31,764
If there is indecency to be found,
she is the root.

976
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:36,274
If there is evil in this world,
its name is Lucy Diamond.

977
01:20:41,752 --> 01:20:44,016
It's not until moments like this...

978
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:46,782
...when you are forced
to take stock of yourself...

979
01:20:46,991 --> 01:20:50,483
...that you see what you are made of.

980
01:20:51,495 --> 01:20:53,429
It's not until moments like this...

981
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:56,532
...when you have to remember
what's right and true...

982
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,864
...because it's moments like this
when you discover...

983
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,233
...what it truly means
to be a D.E.B.

984
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:17,319
Which is why I can't accept
this award from you tonight.

985
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:19,421
Because the truth is...

986
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:24,789
...the time I spent with Lucy Diamond
were the happiest days of my life.

987
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,661
And the only brave thing
I've done this whole time...

988
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,562
...is what I'm doing now.

989
01:21:33,804 --> 01:21:36,398
So if you'll excuse me...

990
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:39,741
...I have a date with the devil.

991
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,277
-Oh, my God!
-Was that in the speech?

992
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:50,754
No, that's not in the speech.

993
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:04,167
Son of a--

994
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:08,198
Hostile has escaped and is on the run
heading towards sector 12.

995
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:25,618
It's Lucy Diamond! She's here!

996
01:22:25,789 --> 01:22:27,848
Everybody, run for your lives!

997
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,294
Let's do this.

998
01:22:53,884 --> 01:22:55,613
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

999
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:59,809
-We've gotta stop meeting like this.
-I'm so sorry. I didn't even know what--

1000
01:24:02,086 --> 01:24:03,883
Get a room.

1001
01:24:05,055 --> 01:24:07,956
-You are AWOL, soldier.
-Max, please.

1002
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,149
-Freeze!
-Scud!

1003
01:24:09,326 --> 01:24:10,486
-Yeah?
-Not helping!

1004
01:24:10,694 --> 01:24:12,457
-My bad.
-Can't you see...

1005
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:14,290
...she's breaking up the D.E.B.S.?

1006
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:16,892
What did I tell you
the first time I met you?

1007
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:20,165
High-protein diets were overrated.

1008
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:22,635
After that.

1009
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,235
-That we'd always be friends.
-I meant it.

1010
01:24:29,346 --> 01:24:31,143
Max!

1011
01:24:42,092 --> 01:24:45,653
If you break her heart, I will
hunt you down and kill you.

1012
01:24:48,665 --> 01:24:50,462
Deal.

1013
01:24:56,607 --> 01:24:58,472
I'm counting on you
to keep her honest.

1014
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:00,600
I will.

1015
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,141
You guys better get going.

1016
01:25:11,388 --> 01:25:13,652
I never really liked you...

1017
01:25:13,824 --> 01:25:16,657
...but I'm sad to see you go.

1018
01:25:21,298 --> 01:25:25,325
-So where are you going to?
-I think, Barcelona.

1019
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:28,135
I'll miss you.

1020
01:25:29,306 --> 01:25:31,297
-Can I have your room?
-Sure.

1021
01:25:32,676 --> 01:25:34,143
Okay.

1022
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:39,714
Rule the school.

1023
01:25:39,883 --> 01:25:41,714
I always do.

1024
01:25:47,991 --> 01:25:50,585
There's a service exit that way.

1025
01:25:50,827 --> 01:25:52,488
Good luck.

1026
01:25:54,198 --> 01:25:55,825
And, Amy...

1027
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,800
...be careful.

1028
01:26:08,912 --> 01:26:11,904
-Which way did they go?
-They went that way.

1029
01:26:27,631 --> 01:26:31,795
-Don't say I never gave you nothing.
-My stripes?

1030
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:34,529
-Really?
-Really.

1031
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:37,070
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

1032
01:26:37,241 --> 01:26:39,573
Okay, okay. That's enough,
that's enough.

1033
01:26:39,743 --> 01:26:41,335
Okay.

1034
01:26:42,613 --> 01:26:44,444
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted--

1035
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:46,276
Yes!

1036
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,213
I didn't ask you anything yet.

1037
01:26:48,385 --> 01:26:50,649
Whatever it is, yes.

1038
01:26:50,887 --> 01:26:52,912
Awesome.
