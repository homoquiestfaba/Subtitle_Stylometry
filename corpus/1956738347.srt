Hi, chief.

16
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,502
Let's go, cowboy.
Party's over.

17
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,981
Well, us is just, uh...

18
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,158
We just sitting around getting
to know each other here--

19
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,377
the family and I.

20
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,379
Are you going to
get up yourself,

21
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:39,077
or are we going to
have to get you up?

22
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,819
No, I...No, I ain't
lookin' for no trouble.

23
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,169
I'm just...
I'm just sitting here...

24
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,432
Just having a drink.

25
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,260
You can tell us
all about it
in the morning.

26
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,131
Let's go.

27
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,480
Now, wait a second, guys.

28
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,222
I'll need to pay for damage--
the window and all.

29
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,746
Look, I can't go to jail.
I got a job.

30
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,922
Well, you should have
thought about that

31
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,664
before you broke
the damn window.

32
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,598
Eggs is supposed to
be yellow.

33
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,601
Whatever this shit is
on my plate, it ain't eggs.

34
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:28,562
It's eggs.
It's how my old lady
used to make them.

35
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,041
No wonder
you shot her.

36
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:33,523
You'd bitch if you were
hung with a new rope.

37
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,698
You're a fuck.

38
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,439
You wouldn't know,
sweet shit.

39
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,572
You're
a goat-smokin' fuck.

40
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,096
Ha ha ha ha!

41
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,103
Everything set, bishop?

42
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,452
Yeah.

43
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,541
Good.

44
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,806
East gate locked
and crosschecked.

45
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,157
It used to be you had
the convicts--

46
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,508
guys would do
their damn time

47
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,074
and leave you alone
to do yours.

48
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:06,687
Come on, lonny.
Not the good old days,
not this morning.

49
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,037
Well, shit.
What have we got now?

50
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,952
Inmates, gang boys,
drug scum.

51
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:13,824
They'd cut you
soon as look at you.

52
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:17,393
Well, they goddamn
ruin it for everybody.

53
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,568
Ain't that so, ry?

54
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:22,529
Yeah. It ain't half the fun
it used to be.

55
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,618
Let's go.

56
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,536
New fish!

57
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,625
Put your eyes back
in your head, Billy.

58
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,888
None of them's
gonna look good
in a dress.

59
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,977
Fuck you.
I ain't lookin'
for no punk.

60
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,632
The way you've
been eyeballin'
the livestock,

61
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,068
I was beginning
to wonder.

62
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,723
Hey!
Knock it off.
Now, get on.

63
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,335
North gate,
open for the work party.

64
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:47,292
Let's go.

65
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,772
Where the hell
those guys going?

66
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,645
None of
your business.
Walk.

67
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,086
Face forward.
Eyes open.

68
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,131
Next!

69
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,531
Clay treyton,
is that you?

70
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,838
That's what I thought.
It isyou.

71
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,230
It's me--
Jimmy latrell.

72
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,710
Pondera county jail,
three years ago.

73
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,539
Jimmy latrell. Yeah.
You still owe me 20 bucks.

74
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,498
You crashed some party
or something.

75
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,716
Your sister's wedding!
Yeah!

76
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,544
You're the black sheep!
The family fuck-up!

77
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,156
You busted up
your new brother-in-law
and two other dudes.

78
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,463
So what did you do
this time, huh?

79
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,073
What? Did you
waste somebody?

80
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,162
I hit a cop.
I got two years.

81
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,469
No problem.
You'll gate in a year.

82
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,818
What the hell
you in here for?

83
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,952
Nothing.
I mean, I didn't
donothing.

84
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,170
Five fuckin' years

85
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,564
'cause some people
were looking
to get rich

86
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:42,957
without working
for it.

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,741
If I didn't
hustle 'em,

88
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,395
somebody else
would have.

89
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:47,701
Come on! Let's go!

90
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,180
I'll see you around.

91
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,487
Yeah.
I'll be around.

92
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,795
Dave, go with Bob.
Check the south end.

93
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,579
What about
the salt lick, ry?

94
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,756
Yeah. Check the salt
and the heifers,

95
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,019
and the rest
are with me.

96
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,195
O.k. Roll out.

97
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,388
I ought to head on over,

98
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,695
see if I can get
that windmill pumping.

99
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,306
Cut across from here.
Saves a long ride.

100
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,658
Thank you, 471.
Head for the windmill.

101
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,574
All right, bishop,
let's go.

102
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:52,679
Welcome to "c" wing, gentlemen.
It will be your home.

103
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,811
You will eat, shower,
and exercise with your wing.

104
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,813
There are three counts
a day.

105
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:59,294
Miss a count,
you're in the hole.

106
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:03,777
Treyton, cell 18.
Stow your gear.

107
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:08,129
Anderson, 20.
Move it.

108
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,693
You tell jaggs neff

109
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,217
to run his drugs
someplace else.

110
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,436
The next man he sends,

111
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,699
only the coyotes will know
where he's buried.

112
00:10:56,743 --> 00:11:00,224
Now, get off my ranch.
Don't come back.

113
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,913
This ain't
your table, meat.

114
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,742
Think about it.

115
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,903
I thought
you were smarter
than that, Weston.

116
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:13,733
Getting in the middle
of something that's
not your business

117
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,125
will get you hurt.

118
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,040
Maybe you'd better
take your business
where I ain't.

119
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,303
We'll have to talk
about this sometime.

120
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,479
You know where
to find me.

121
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:25,919
I sure as fuck do...
Every tick of the clock.

122
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,797
Lockdown. Lights out.

123
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,321
Lockdown. Lights out.

124
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,726
We're lean and mean.
No fat, no waste.

125
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,423
Go back
and tell them that.

126
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,730
Relax, Harlan.
Nobody's cutting your funds.

127
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,036
Damn sure thinking
about it.

128
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,168
We're looking at every
facility in the state,

129
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:01,258
reporting back
to the budget committee.
That's all.

130
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,564
Bullshit.

131
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,000
Come on, Harlan.
You know how the game's played.

132
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:07,438
Everybody talks crime tough.
Nobody wants to foot the bill.

133
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,136
Built this place
from the ground up.

134
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,008
I won't let politicians
nickel and dime it to death.

135
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,010
But when I tell
my constituents

136
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,533
about
a convict-run ranch,

137
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,318
they don't hear
"cost-effective."

138
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,972
They hear
"country club."

139
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,451
Down the road,

140
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,932
I've got 1,500 convicts
warehoused in my main facility.

141
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,891
Most of them
have nothing to do.

142
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,849
They'll be
on the street again--

143
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,982
worse off
than when they got here.

144
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,419
Now, you tell that
to your constituency!

145
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,856
Rehabilitation
through ranching--

146
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,640
is that what
this is, warden?

147
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:38,643
I think we're
finished here.

148
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,998
Nice, Harlan.
You got his vote.

149
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,784
Henry, my people...

150
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,786
Have worked
long and hard.

151
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,919
This outfit
is as proud
and disciplined

152
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,356
as any group of men
you'll ever see.

153
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,662
You got to help me.

154
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,751
I'll do what I can.

155
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,231
Same as always.

156
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,233
Thank you.

157
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,106
How much dope
was he packing?

158
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,716
I don't know
anything.

159
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,065
Don't talk me
dumb, ry.

160
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,068
I know
you tore up bishop,
and I know why.

161
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,896
Bishop fell
from his horse.

162
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,071
If you'd
let him deliver,

163
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,030
I would have had jaggs
with the stuff.

164
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,423
See, I was tipped.
I was laying for him.

165
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,816
Dope don't come in
off my ranch.

166
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,993
Yourranch?
You work here
on my say-so,

167
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,909
and I don't care
how many trophies
you have.

168
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,955
If you mess
with jaggs again,

169
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,131
you can kiss
the blue skies
good-bye.

170
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,350
You'll be
doing your time
on the inside,

171
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:37,615
and on the inside,
you're just another
fucking con.

172
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,188
Oh!

173
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,189
Easy.

174
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,409
Get out of here.

175
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,412
Is that enough, boss?

176
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,849
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead.

177
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,244
How much seed
we got left?

178
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,985
10 alfalfa.

179
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,116
10 alfalfa?

180
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,031
Hey, Weston,
I've been looking
for you.

181
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,164
Wanted
to say thank you.

182
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:05,165
Clay treyton.

183
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,906
Man, I got to
tell you something.

184
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,909
When I found out
who that fella
jaggs was,

185
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,084
I just about shit.

186
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,173
You saved my bacon.
I owe you one.

187
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,392
Without the bird seed.
What do you want?

188
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,525
Oh, no, you got me
all wrong.

189
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:20,093
I just wanted
to say thank you.

190
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,572
Good. You said it.

191
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,747
There you go.

192
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,575
O.k.,
how about a job?

193
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,794
You got a job.

194
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,274
Hell, I ain't
no sink jockey.

195
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:30,494
I can outcowboy
any of those yahoos
you got out there.

196
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,106
Give me a chance,
and I'll show you.

197
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,498
I'll think about it.

198
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,109
Well, for how long?

199
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,414
Give it a rest, kid.

200
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,200
Two years I've been
stomping around this place.

201
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,288
Welcome to my domain.

202
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,116
Sit down.
Make yourself
comfortable.

203
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,988
What do you want?
Something to eat?

204
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:46,989
Drink?

205
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,643
You don't see it,
just ask.

206
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,254
I don't know what
you got going on, latrell,

207
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,214
but you got it going
pretty damn good.

208
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,389
I'm mean, man.

209
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,217
Just because I'm
off the street,

210
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,132
don't mean
I'm out of business.

211
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,524
I got
this place wired.

212
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,832
Anything you need,
I'm the man can
get it for you.

213
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,008
Why don't you
get me a job

214
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,401
out on the ranch?

215
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:08,968
What do you want
with that?

216
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,971
Ain't nothing out there
except cow flop and flies.

217
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,842
Beats the sink,
don't it?

218
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,322
You in the kitchen?

219
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:18,151
Am I in the kitchen?
I'm in the kitchen
up to my elbows.

220
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,630
Ha ha ha!

221
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,936
Stretch out, my man.

222
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,766
We got some things
to talk about.

223
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,944
What the hell is
horny haimer doing here?
Ain't he on vacation?

224
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,992
Guess there ain't as many
hookers in New Orleans
as there used to be.

225
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,602
Hey, you old
goat-fucker.

226
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:38,171
That shriveled-up
thing you call a dick
finally fall off...

227
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,476
Or what?

228
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,087
If it did,
I don't miss it.

229
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,351
Sorry, ma'am. We thought
you was somebody else.

230
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,266
That's all right.

231
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,224
Who are you?

232
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,098
You're ry Weston.

233
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,188
Who are you?

234
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,712
I'm Maggie sinclair.

235
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:01,977
Fred haimer retired.
I bought his practice.

236
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,415
I've been a veterinarian
for 14 years.

237
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,026
I know my business.

238
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,029
Nobody
said you didn't.

239
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,729
Doc haimer was treating
one of your mares

240
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,296
for distemper--

241
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,775
little sheba.

242
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,474
I'm here to follow up.

243
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,867
Right this way.

244
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,479
Going in the barn.

245
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,096
Now, that's a woman.

246
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,358
No shit.

247
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:38,144
Got an ass
on her, too.

248
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,580
No shit.

249
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,364
There's no infection.

250
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,757
No inflammation.

251
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,586
This salve
should do it.

252
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:48,676
You can take her off
antibiotics

253
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,982
and start her
on exercise.

254
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,246
I already have.

255
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,772
This ain't no 4-h club.
You shouldn't be here.

256
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:59,513
I thought
about that.

257
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:03,082
You ain't thought
about it enough.

258
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,215
Enough to scare me.

259
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,088
Then how come
you're here?

260
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:16,095
To see if I can
handle it.

261
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:30,674
Keep your head up.
Keep walking.

262
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,465
I expect your fee
is the same as
old doc haimer's,

263
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,294
'cause I have to
sign off on it.

264
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,383
Look at me,
not them.

265
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:44,340
What?

266
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,690
Oh, yeah.
You'll get your, um...

267
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,562
Uh, copy
of the invoice

268
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,478
through
the proper channels.

269
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,616
What the hell
is wrong with you guys?

270
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,315
Ain't you ever seen
a vet before?

271
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,389
You got it?

272
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:34,912
Hurry up.

273
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:36,436
Uh!

274
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,134
Oh, we're in the bootlegging
business now, man.

275
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,398
We're gonna have
half the population
bumping into walls.

276
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,313
You just get me
out of here.

277
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,359
I'm working on it,
all right.

278
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,664
I'm not kidding,
latrell.

279
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,275
You get me
out of here.

280
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:52,408
Hey, chill out.
A deal's a deal.

281
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,169
Saddle
your best horse, boss.

282
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,171
You got yourself
a new hand.

283
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,173
I got the papers
right here,

284
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,436
signed by the warden
himself.

285
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,091
I pick my own men.

286
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:26,355
You had a vacancy.
I got the job.

287
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,010
Good thing, too.
I was getting
sick and tired

288
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:32,143
of sweating over
that stinkin' sink.

289
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,549
If you aren't
too busy...

290
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,072
Uh!

291
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,467
You could give me
a hand.

292
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:56,516
I never seen a posthole
one man couldn't dig.

293
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,436
Here.

294
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,048
Don't waste it.

295
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:16,683
"C" wing. 55 prisoners.
All in.

296
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,459
Uh!

297
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,424
Oh!

298
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,396
Here, boy.

299
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,486
Watch yourself
around that animal.

300
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,532
He's a crazy
son of a bitch.

301
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,099
He looks
sound enough.

302
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,405
What's wrong
with him?

303
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,668
Story is, he used to be
a pretty good cow pony.

304
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:32,933
Just went sour.
Threw some rancher,
busted him all to hell.

305
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,543
He got a name?

306
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,240
Rounder.

307
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,546
Rounder, huh?

308
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,115
Well, you don't look like
such a bad boy to me.

309
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,595
Then again, neither do I,

310
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:46,250
and they got me
locked up, too, huh?

311
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:04,921
Aw, shit, ry.

312
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:07,707
That boy
needs a hand.

313
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,797
Sit down, Bobby.

314
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,721
We're waiting.

315
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,092
Whoa.

316
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,876
Whoa.

317
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,444
Hey, now, there.

318
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:56,625
Unload it.

319
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:57,974
Get off my back,
Weston.

320
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,760
You've been
busting my balls
for three weeks now.

321
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:02,979
I'm not taking any
more of your shit.

322
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,155
You wanted the job.
This is it.

323
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,635
You don't
like it, quit.

324
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,029
Hey, what is it
that's eating you?

325
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,248
Huh? Is it that
I bucked you?

326
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,861
Or is it
that I'm here
without your say-so?

327
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,211
Well,
come on, old man.
Spit it out.

328
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:20,562
I'd like to know
just what it is
you got against me.

329
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:21,781
You're too slick, kid.

330
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,652
You're looking
for the easy way.

331
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,698
You got no character.
You got no spine.

332
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,874
Fuck you.
You don't know
anything about me.

333
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,964
I know you
and Jimmy latrell
are making money

334
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,487
off what you stole
from Otis.

335
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,403
Otis? Ha ha!
That stuff didn't
cost him anything.

336
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:38,406
It's not like he
had to pay for that.

337
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:39,668
Wrong thing to do, kid.

338
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,583
That kitchen's his
like this ranch is mine.

339
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,412
You violate a man's space,
you answer for it.

340
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:48,242
When you're through here,
I got more for you.

341
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,601
Ha ha!

342
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,782
Nail him, ry.

343
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,742
Whoo!

344
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,397
You're slow, boy.

345
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:17,358
You want a fight?
Give him one.

346
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:23,669
Teaching that boy
a little manners.

347
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,034
Oh!

348
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,794
Oh!

349
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,803
Stay down, son.
You ain't winnin'
this one today.

350
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,476
Ahh!

351
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,874
Jesus, kid.
Stay down.

352
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,778
Get up.

353
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:15,606
I'll give you
a hand.

354
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,919
I hear you got
a problem.

355
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,225
Yeah,
I got a problem.

356
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:28,532
I got demand
to satisfy, neff.
I need product.

357
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:29,838
You'll get product

358
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:32,232
as soon as
the warden's nose
is out of my ass.

359
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:35,365
I thought the ranch
was supposed to
take care of that,

360
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,717
or are you
going to let some
motherfuckin' cowboy

361
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,196
put you
out of business?

362
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,024
Nobody puts me
out of business,

363
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,810
and that goes for
those fuckin' spics

364
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,115
you've been talking to.

365
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,553
You buy from me, Sykes,
or you don't buy at all.

366
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:53,079
I buy
where I can get it.

367
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:55,124
You take care
of Weston,

368
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,127
we ain't got
a problem.

369
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,924
Oh!

370
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,812
Oh!

371
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,782
Better start
without him.

372
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,272
I want out, latrell.

373
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:41,535
You told me you were
going to get me
the transfer

374
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,580
back to the kitchen
over a week ago.

375
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:46,061
I told you, man.
I'm working on it.

376
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,107
Yeah, while you're
tap-dancing around,

377
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,544
Weston's out there
busting my balls.

378
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,762
Hand me that towel.

379
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:55,984
You just get me
out of there,
you hear me?

380
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:02,034
Look, man.
I can't do that.

381
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,733
What the hell
you talking about--
you can't do that?

382
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,170
I owe some people.

383
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,911
They want their money.

384
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,130
They want
you to help.

385
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,262
What the hell
you trying to pull,
latrell?

386
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,830
Nothing you can't handle.

387
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,573
Hold on now.

388
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,880
All I want to do
is my time

389
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:22,968
and get out of here.

390
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,578
Whatever you all
got planned,

391
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,449
it's got nothing
to do with me.

392
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:27,624
Yeah, it does...

393
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:31,411
If you want to
go on living.

394
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,091
Oh, shit!

395
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,962
Goddamn it!

396
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,748
Goddamn it!

397
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,750
Fuck this shit!

398
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:34,822
All right, you.

399
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,218
Easy.

400
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,132
Easy.

401
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,786
All right,
you son of a bitch.

402
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,051
Let's see
what you got.

403
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,580
Uh!

404
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:01,544
Come here.

405
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:02,545
Come here.

406
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:05,026
What the hell
is he trying to do?

407
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,527
That horse is
going to kill him.

408
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,182
It just might.

409
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:10,918
Easy.

410
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:22,277
What the hell
do you think you're
doing on that horse?

411
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,713
I got myself
a cow pony.

412
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,759
I want the job
that goes along
with it.

413
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,674
Your job is
in that mud hole.

414
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,068
Get back to it.

415
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,426
Hell, you want it
that bad,

416
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,558
it's yours.

417
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,996
You messing with me?
Don't mess with me!

418
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,129
I said
you got the job.

419
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,696
You want it or not?

420
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,177
Well, hell, yes,
I want it.

421
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,134
All right, then.

422
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,223
All right.
You got it.

423
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,182
You got it.

424
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,274
I'll bust my butt
for you.

425
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:05,364
No. I mean that.

426
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,148
Lon will
get you some boots.

427
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:10,325
I will bust my butt
for you.

428
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,240
Good. That's good.

429
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,113
Son of a bitch.

430
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,464
Howdy, warden.

431
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,466
Boys.

432
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:31,172
That back of yours
been bothering you again?

433
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:33,783
No.

434
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,222
I hear you were in
to see the doc about it.

435
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,919
But it's
all right now, hmm?

436
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,355
My back's o.K.,
warden.

437
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,749
O.k. Enough
to rodeo?

438
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,362
I got two months
to worry about that.

439
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:48,885
No. You got
two weeks.

440
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,887
Yeah. Bill renner
over at treadmore
prison

441
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,716
says he found
himself a couple
of cowboys.

442
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,198
Says one of them
is as good as you,

443
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,199
maybe better.

444
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,245
Wants me to bring
two bronc riders

445
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,855
over to
black diamond ranch

446
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:04,292
for a private
showdown.

447
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,382
Your dogs
against his dogs.

448
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:08,818
Ha ha ha!

449
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:12,039
Well, I wouldn't
sell it that way
to the prison board,

450
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,302
but, uh, yeah.
Something like that.

451
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,348
The back's
a funny thing,
warden.

452
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,437
Can't tell when it
might go out on you.

453
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,829
Oh, quit
bullshitting me, ry.

454
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:22,441
I'm offering you
eight seconds
on a bucking horse.

455
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:24,182
That's a shot
of freedom

456
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:27,097
you can't afford
to pass up.

457
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,840
We ain't got
two bronc riders.

458
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,668
We only got me.

459
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,889
Well, the treyton boy's
supposed to be a good rider.

460
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:36,672
Treyton?

461
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,108
Supposed
to be hot stuff.

462
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,633
He's green as hell.
He ain't never been
under fire.

463
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,548
Green is one thing.
Good's another.

464
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:44,811
He's the best you got,
and I want him.

465
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:46,334
I sure hope
nothing happens

466
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,423
in these next
couple of weeks

467
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,946
to aggravate
my condition.

468
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,212
Me, too.
Aggravation's something
we both can do without.

469
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:04,526
Let's go! Git!

470
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:09,488
Get him!

471
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,239
Ry, when
you get a minute,

472
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,067
I'd like
to talk to you.

473
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,855
That vet likes you.

474
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,031
All right.
Let it go.

475
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,382
You know
horses and cows.
I know women.

476
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:37,167
She's got
an eye for you.

477
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,959
You wanted
to speak to me?

478
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,265
Yeah.

479
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,441
I'm concerned about some
of these yearlings, ry.

480
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,572
They're underweight.

481
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:52,922
So are some
of those calves.

482
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,446
I noticed that.

483
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,926
Mind if I take
some blood samples,

484
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,319
run a few tests?

485
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,842
I don't think
they're diseased.

486
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,801
I didn't say
they were diseased.

487
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:04,847
I'd just like
to rule it out.

488
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,330
You handle yourself
pretty well.

489
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,551
That wasn't
your first time
in a branding pen.

490
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,770
No. I was raised
on a ranch

491
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:17,469
out near silver bow.

492
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,082
And there are times
I really miss those days.

493
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,389
I know
what you mean.

494
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:26,608
I'm sorry.

495
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,958
I didn't mean to,
you know...

496
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,090
Forget it.

497
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:34,355
I got over
feeling bad
a long time ago.

498
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,275
Let me know
how those tests
turn out.

499
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,944
Do you know
what they get

500
00:38:57,987 --> 00:39:00,250
for a saddle
like that
these days?

501
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,426
A damn fortune.

502
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,384
And they ain't
near as nice

503
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,386
as this one's
going to be.

504
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,171
This one
ain't for sale.

505
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,609
Oh, it's...

506
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,611
It's nice,
though.

507
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:16,136
You using that
at white river?

508
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,927
So what did she
have to say?

509
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,407
Come on.

510
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:29,410
I mean it doesn't
matter what she said
anyhow.

511
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,456
It's how
she looked at you

512
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,719
when she said it
that counts.

513
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,416
How close
she stood to you,

514
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,462
the way she moved,
whether she touched
you or not.

515
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:39,942
It's the
between-the-lines
stuff, ry.

516
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,683
There was no
between-the-lines stuff.

517
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,512
Oh, yes, there was.
She's a woman,
ain't she?

518
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,514
They never come
right out and say,

519
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,560
"hey, let's do it,
cowboy."

520
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:49,735
They can't, right?

521
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,432
But, man, they say
all other kinds of shit.

522
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,782
That's all I'm trying
to help you with,
is the other shit.

523
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:56,742
You're about as smart
as a bagful of hammers,
ain't you?

524
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:57,960
No. Listen, listen.

525
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:01,703
If I was you,
I'd take her
for a trail ride

526
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,401
down by cross creek,

527
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,880
lay a blanket out.

528
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:05,794
A blanket?

529
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:06,926
Yeah. Look, ry.

530
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,101
You could do this.

531
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,146
Hell,
with your connection
with Ferguson,

532
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,452
you could
make this work.

533
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:12,758
Lay out a blanket...

534
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:15,543
Of course,
I wouldn't make
my move right away.

535
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:16,718
No.

536
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:18,590
We'd sit in the sun,

537
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,592
let
the energy build.

538
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,681
Oh, man. I'd let
that work for me.

539
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,379
And then when
we started sweating,

540
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,946
oh...

541
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,296
I'd suggest a swim.

542
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,819
Only no suits.

543
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:34,562
"Well, honey,
we're going to have
to go skinny-dipping."

544
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,130
Ry, women get turned on
swimming naked.

545
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:39,611
I don't know why,
but they do.

546
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,440
You just don't
get it, do you?

547
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,529
I'm a lifer, kid.

548
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,704
Can you understand that?

549
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,141
Well, man, that's
all the more reason

550
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,490
to take
the opportunity.

551
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,536
Look. Man, you
can get the hacks
to back off, ry.

552
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,668
If anyone can do it,
you can.

553
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:55,801
Just how long you think
I'd survive here

554
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:58,586
if I let
a thought like that
enter my mind?

555
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,023
Just how many seconds
would I survive?

556
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,634
Weston...

557
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,679
Time to go.

558
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,700
The good news is
there's no disease.

559
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:26,875
The herd is healthy.

560
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:29,748
The bad news is
the lab can't tell us

561
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,838
why these cows
are underweight
and the others aren't.

562
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:36,624
Uh, it's probably
something they're eating.

563
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:37,886
Might be.

564
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,280
We could have
some bad grass
out there?

565
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,673
Larkspur,
jimson maybe?

566
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,675
Well, I know
where they're grazing,

567
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,372
so I'll go out
and check it out.

568
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:46,765
Why don't I saddle
the horses

569
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:49,507
so, doc, y'all can ride out
together and look?

570
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,596
It's too beautiful
to be cooped up inside.

571
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,859
I'm sure she has
better things to do.

572
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,338
No, he's right.

573
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,644
It's
a beautiful day.

574
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,865
It's o.K. With me.
I'll get my hat.

575
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:02,737
She went right for that,
didn't she?

576
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,086
I tell you what--

577
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,392
you play it
like I told you,

578
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,655
you are going to have
one hell of an afternoon.

579
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,831
I'll bet you
anything on that.

580
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,224
Bet you what?

581
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,879
I bet y'all find what
you're looking for out there.

582
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,577
I'll go saddle up
this horse for you.

583
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:19,711
Well, if I can
get permission,

584
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,714
it's o.K. With me.

585
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,329
Well, here it is.

586
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,070
See?

587
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:33,594
There's larkspur.

588
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,291
I was right.

589
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,858
Yeah,
you were right.

590
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:41,515
Doesn't seem like
there's too much of it.

591
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:44,474
You're
a good vet.

592
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:45,867
I appreciate
a good vet.

593
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,654
Getting rid of it
shouldn't be a problem.

594
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,572
It is so beautiful
here.

595
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,964
So peaceful.

596
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:58,314
So quiet.

597
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,881
Take away
the guards,

598
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:03,668
and you'd have
a real nice
piece of property.

599
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:06,584
Do you ever forget?

600
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:10,979
Sometimes.

601
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:19,684
You know, ry...

602
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:22,991
I've been
waiting to see
if you'd remember.

603
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,210
Remember what?

604
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:27,474
We've met before...
At belton,

605
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:30,042
4th of July.

606
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,827
I won at belton
4th of July.

607
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,307
It was
a long time ago.

608
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,484
They still send up
them rockets
after the show?

609
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,487
No. Belton closed down
a couple years back.

610
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,881
How come
you was there?

611
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:45,187
I was
with my father.

612
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,669
You borrowed
his bull rope.

613
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,760
Jack sinclair
is your daddy?

614
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:54,501
Yeah. That's right.

615
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:55,981
I should have
figured that

616
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:57,460
when you told me
your name,

617
00:43:57,504 --> 00:43:59,637
said you grew up
ranching near silver bow.

618
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,073
Man, he was one
tough bull rider.

619
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,335
How the hell
is he?

620
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:03,466
He's still tough.

621
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,554
Oh, that's good.

622
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:06,861
You tell him
hello for me,
will you?

623
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:10,125
I sure will.

624
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:16,523
Lots of memories.

625
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:17,698
I'll bet.

626
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:19,744
Winning
that gold buckle,

627
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,747
riding around
in that new
convertible,

628
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,227
chasing away all
them pretty women.

629
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,621
Ha ha! You cut
one fine figure.

630
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,797
Yeah. I was
one red-hot cowboy.

631
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,191
I know. I spent
the whole night
staring at you

632
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:33,845
across
the dinner table.

633
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:35,020
We had dinner?

634
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:37,631
With my dad
and a bunch
of other people.

635
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,763
We danced, too.

636
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:41,113
I had the biggest
damn crush on you.

637
00:44:41,156 --> 00:44:44,464
Took me almost a week
to get over it.

638
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,034
I guess I missed
my chance.

639
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,392
Last one in
tends the horses.

640
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,263
Come on!

641
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:04,136
Hank?

642
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,358
Hyah!

643
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,586
Come on!

644
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,283
Whoo!

645
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,250
Whoo!

646
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:39,824
Whoo!

647
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,913
Whoo-hoo!

648
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:45,786
Whoo-hoo!

649
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,965
That was close.
Nice try.

650
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:52,140
Nice try?
I won.

651
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:53,794
Like hell
you won. I won.

652
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,753
Here's the finish line.
Right here.

653
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,885
What do you mean
right here?

654
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:58,930
I had you
by a nose.

655
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,149
I started easing up
way back there.

656
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:02,455
You didn't ease up
nowhere.

657
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:06,546
You saw me ease up
way back there,
didn't you?

658
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:07,852
See?

659
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:10,071
They're just saying that
because you're a woman.

660
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:11,986
Oh, because
I'm a woman.

661
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,987
O.k. Fine...

662
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:14,989
If you need
an excuse,
but I won.

663
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,731
That's how
it goes down
in the record.

664
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,733
Goes down
in the record?

665
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,908
Mm-hmm.

666
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,302
Nothing like
an aggressive woman,
huh, ry?

667
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,825
So what happened?

668
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,914
Down in the record...
I won.

669
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,569
No. I mean
what happened?

670
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:32,441
Come on.
What happened?

671
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:34,748
Here.
Tend the horse.

672
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,836
Oh, come on!

673
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,055
Tend the horses.

674
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:39,013
Tend the horses.

675
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:55,638
All right.
Keep together now.

676
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:14,005
Well, there's
the competition--

677
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,484
Cody stavert.

678
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:18,096
The other guy's cutter.
Supposed to be pretty good, too.

679
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,098
What I worked out
with renner--

680
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:22,883
it's going to be
a team situation.

681
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,102
Total points win.

682
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:26,017
He suckered you.
Kid's first
go-round.

683
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,019
Total points
is a dumb bet.

684
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:28,976
I didn't bet.

685
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,891
Gambling's illegal
in this state,

686
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:31,979
but if I had,

687
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,068
it would only be dumb
if I lose,

688
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:37,593
and we didn't come
all this way to lose.

689
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:41,902
You are
with the wrong guy.

690
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,296
I've never won
a damn thing
in my whole life.

691
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:48,604
Relax. It ain't
coming out
of your pocket.

692
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,043
Go!

693
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:09,974
72?

694
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,933
Who's judging this--
your relatives?

695
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:16,545
Yeah!

696
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,504
Hey, man.
Watch where you're going.

697
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,332
You want to do
something about it?

698
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:24,336
He's got a horse to ride,
but I got time.

699
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:28,949
I could have
handled it.

700
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,951
You're scared,
and they smell it.

701
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,345
Don't let them
get to your head.

702
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,129
Who's scared?

703
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:36,174
I am.

704
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:37,915
Fear is what this game
is all about.

705
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,178
It's what
you got to fight
every time up.

706
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:42,006
You got the heart
to beat it,

707
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:44,051
you just might be
a rider.

708
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:46,532
O.k. You're up.
Let's go.

709
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:48,664
Easy.

710
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,797
Watch your head now.

711
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,059
Easy.

712
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,496
Easy now.

713
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,630
You got
any last-minute advice,

714
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:00,981
I suggest you
give it to me
right now.

715
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,722
Don't fall off.

716
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:04,071
Turn
his head out.

717
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:05,943
Bear down, Clay.

718
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,032
It's yours.

719
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:29,270
Whoo!

720
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:36,712
Good boy!

721
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:39,237
That's it.

722
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,283
Jesus,
what a shit ride!

723
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:45,069
Hell!
You stayed eight
on a good horse!

724
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:46,853
Yeah, well,
67 about buries us.

725
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:49,290
You give us a shot.
All I ever asked for
was a shot.

726
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:54,034
Go, Cody!
Show 'em what you got, boy!

727
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,801
Come on, Cody!

728
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:29,722
Come on, Cody!
Yeah!

729
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:31,637
Whoo!

730
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,074
Way to go, Cody.
Way to ride!

731
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,207
All right!

732
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,469
Whoo!

733
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:39,166
All right!

734
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,777
Look
at that animal!

735
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:45,738
You wore him
out, Cody!

736
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,261
Ha ha ha!

737
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:51,222
Ha ha ha!
Sure enough!

738
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:52,266
Yeah!

739
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,746
Boy,
is he sweet.

740
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,182
I told you
he's a rider.

741
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:58,098
You want
to see a rider,
keep watching.

742
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,104
Turn him out now.

743
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,159
Ride him, ry!

744
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:17,335
Whoo-hoo!

745
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,352
Come on.

746
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:37,224
Stick it
to him, ry!

747
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,276
Son of a bitch.

748
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:02,467
Ha ha ha!
Look at him ride!

749
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,515
Way to go, ry!
That's it!

750
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,213
Son of a bitch.

751
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,740
Son of a bitch!

752
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,663
You son of a bitch!

753
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,360
Ha ha ha!
You did it!

754
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:27,666
You son of a bitch.

755
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,843
I've never seen
a goddamn ride
like that before

756
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,758
in my entire life!

757
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,368
We whipped 'em,
boys.

758
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:38,198
Pack your gear.
We done our day's work.

759
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:41,027
See you
at white river,
Weston!

760
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,160
I'll be there!

761
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:52,081
Get your gear packed up
and get back on the bus.

762
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,523
Just got to get
my halter.

763
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,266
Special delivery,
treyton,

764
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:03,397
to jaggs neff.

765
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:05,486
You don't deliver,
you're a dead man.

766
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,749
Single file to the bus.

767
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:11,100
Let's go.
Move it.

768
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,105
Shame you're not
on the circuit,
Weston.

769
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,847
You could be
making a pile.

770
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,981
Have a line
of women, too.
That's a fact.

771
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:25,680
You're as good
as the best
of them.

772
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:32,513
No way
of really knowing,
is there?

773
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,299
Good ride.

774
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:36,561
Way to go, boys!

775
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:38,345
You're ready
for the big time!

776
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:41,740
Uh-uh. You ain't
getting away with this.

777
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:42,828
What?

778
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,438
That's my seat
you're sitting in,
son.

779
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,788
It's o.K. I'm just
fooling with you.

780
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:48,442
Ha ha ha!

781
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:50,488
Winner sits
anywhere he wants.

782
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:54,361
Had you going there,
Clay, eh?

783
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,754
Showed them
treadmore punks.

784
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:58,147
That was
a good horse.

785
00:53:58,191 --> 00:53:59,236
Yeah.

786
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:03,152
He was doing o.K.,
about three seconds.

787
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,510
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

788
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:15,774
That's it, jaggs.
No more. I'm out.

789
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:19,473
Let him go, jaggs.
We had a deal. We're even.

790
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:21,258
Uh!

791
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:22,998
I don't
make deals.

792
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,999
I own you.

793
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:27,133
We're even
when I say
we're even.

794
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:30,702
Same goes
for you, cowboy.

795
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,674
Now, that's
a pretty nice loop.

796
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,328
It's about
the only thing

797
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,982
my old man
taught me,

798
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,114
except fighting
and drinking.

799
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:55,596
Well, at least
you got the basics.

800
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:59,208
Keep your elbow up.

801
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,134
Son of a bitch.

802
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,484
Go!

803
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,312
Get down!

804
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:20,969
Close to your record!

805
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:22,362
Ho, ho!
Good run, ry!

806
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,712
This is that red
son of a bitch, Bobby.

807
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,888
You got it,
boss.

808
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:31,937
Oh, that
was sweet, huh?

809
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,112
Run another one.

810
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:35,636
Hey, I want
to go to white river.

811
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,159
Don't worry.
You're going.

812
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:38,726
No, no. I mean
I want to compete.

813
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:41,990
I want you
to get me ready
for the all-around.

814
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:44,558
You don't want to
get on no bull, son.

815
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,473
Oh, yes, I do.

816
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,607
Well,
I tell you what.

817
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,522
You got
the intelligence
for it.

818
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:56,048
So I guess let's see
what you're made of.

819
00:55:58,529 --> 00:55:59,617
There you go.

820
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,359
Well, that's going
to happen every time.

821
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:05,144
Wherever you're looking,
that's where you'll go.

822
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:06,275
Now get on.

823
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,410
Stay over your hand.
Keep your chin down.

824
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,847
Once again.

825
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:18,113
I want to see daylight
under them jeans.

826
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:21,421
Bull riding is done
with your legs.

827
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:26,513
Well, surprisingly,
that wasn't a bad run.

828
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:28,994
Get on.
One more time.

829
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:31,257
Get on.

830
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,085
All right.

831
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:35,522
Make it real,
or you're wasting my time.

832
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:37,611
Go!

833
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:41,180
Work him!
Don't baby him!

834
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,488
Chin in!

835
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:50,494
There's your eight seconds
right there.

836
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,802
Be grateful
that son of a bitch
don't have horns.

837
00:56:54,846 --> 00:56:56,804
Just bring on
a live one.

838
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:59,372
When you're ready.

839
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,027
Get on...

840
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,811
Again.

841
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,730
Go.

842
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:12,341
All inmates will return
to their cellblocks

843
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:14,082
by 1800 hours.

844
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:15,562
All inmates will return...

845
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:18,913
I heard something
I think you ought
to know, man.

846
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:21,046
Jaggs has got
a shipment coming in.

847
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:23,440
It's got nothing
to do with me.

848
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,659
Look. It's time
to hit it, man.

849
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:27,444
It's time to get
the fuck out of here.

850
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,489
Look. It ain't
no big thing,
all right?

851
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,360
I get outside the fence
on a work crew.

852
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,362
You meet me on a horse.
We jam to the highway.

853
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:36,017
My wife comes
and picks us up,
and we're gone!

854
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:38,237
And what happens
when we get caught?

855
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,978
We ain't gonna
get caught.

856
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:42,720
Yeah. Well, I ain't
riskin' five years

857
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,286
to find out.

858
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,505
What you think
you doing

859
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,160
running that shit
for jaggs, man? Huh?

860
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:50,292
How does a dime
sound, homey?

861
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:51,598
That's right.
10 years.

862
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,513
You don't get it,
do you?

863
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:57,082
He's going to work you
till you get popped.

864
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:02,348
The last time
was the last time.

865
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,568
No more. That's it.

866
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,793
Uh!

867
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,666
Is he hurt?

868
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:16,884
We'll see.

869
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:20,018
Hey, you'll
be all right.

870
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:24,370
Don't tell me.
I did everything wrong.

871
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:26,981
Well, at least
you know that much.

872
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:28,156
He'll live.

873
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,551
You know, when it
comes right down
to it,

874
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:33,074
bulldogging
is plain crazy.

875
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:35,555
Maybe we ought
to get a doctor.

876
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,078
You don't need
a doctor.

877
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:38,602
I've sewed
plenty of wounds.

878
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:40,386
Of course,
mostly on cattle.

879
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:43,128
That figures. What else
but a dumb damn cow

880
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:44,782
would let you
touch them?

881
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,784
Hey, quiet. Just
making it worse.

882
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:49,047
I mean, who
in their right mind

883
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,136
would jump
from a running horse

884
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:53,094
onto 700 pounds
of steer?

885
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:54,182
Ha ha ha!

886
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:55,575
Just hold it
right there.

887
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:59,013
Hold it. I'll get
the scissors.

888
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,887
There, you're done.

889
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,237
Now, get out there,
do it right.

890
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,152
What--you mean now?

891
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:08,545
You got a rodeo
in a month.

892
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,634
Hell, I got
a hole in my lip.

893
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:11,591
Let's go. Go, go!

894
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:12,810
You're
burning daylight.

895
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,551
That's some
mighty fine stitching.

896
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,466
I couldn't have done
better myself.

897
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,600
What are you
doing here?

898
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:21,906
It's my regular visit.

899
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:24,648
You're
a week early.

900
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,693
No, I'm not.

901
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,956
You wanna bet?Yes, you are.

902
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,568
How much?

903
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,707
See you next week.

904
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:50,935
Uh...hold on,
Dr. Sinclair.

905
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,676
Maggie.

906
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,769
Uh, I treated
some pinkeye.

907
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,509
Maybe there's
some more.

908
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:03,512
Maybe
you want to...
Check it out.

909
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:06,211
I mean you're here.
You might as well.

910
01:00:06,254 --> 01:00:07,821
Sure. If you're
not too busy.

911
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:11,042
Oh, he is kind of busy
right now, doc,

912
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,957
getting me ready
for the rodeo and all.

913
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,176
Well, if today's
no good, I can--

914
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,613
oh, today's
just fine.

915
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:18,832
You took
a nasty spill.
You need a rest.

916
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:22,096
No. I'm raring to go.
That daylight's burning, ry.

917
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,664
If I were you,
I'd take it easy.

918
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,797
When it comes
to your health,

919
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,060
you can't be too careful.

920
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,236
Ain't it something,
the way he looks
after me?

921
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:35,283
I'm taking the vet out
to check the calves.

922
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,199
I don't see any, ry.

923
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,158
If there's going to be
an outbreak,

924
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:41,986
you'd have seen it
by now.

925
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:44,684
They don't seem
thirsty.

926
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:46,643
I am.

927
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:02,354
Runs clear,
doesn't it?

928
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:05,836
The Cheyenne used to
water their horses here.

929
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:10,971
Fought the settlers
for all this land.

930
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:33,515
Do you mind
if I take a picture?

931
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:35,866
We don't have
any more calves.

932
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:38,042
Of you, I mean.

933
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:42,176
It's just something
I'd like to have.

934
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:46,790
O.k. All right.

935
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:49,618
O.k.

936
01:01:49,662 --> 01:01:51,795
Don't move.

937
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:52,926
Stay right there.

938
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:57,496
I want you
right in front
of the river.

939
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:04,764
Perfect.

940
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:08,812
Let me take
one of you now.

941
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:14,600
O.k. Where
do you want me?

942
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:18,604
Uh...

943
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:22,913
Same place, I guess.

944
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,977
It's been a long time
for me.

945
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:47,894
Maybe you'd show me
how it works.

946
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:53,204
It's pretty simple.

947
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:56,903
You just turn this
to focus,

948
01:02:56,947 --> 01:03:01,908
and you advance there.

949
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:59,009
It's all right.
I understand.

950
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:03,752
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

951
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,754
I understand.

952
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:09,454
I understand.

953
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:13,545
The crush
was on the cowboy,
not the con.

954
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,548
That's not how
I think of you.

955
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,636
That's what I am.

956
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,899
A woman like you
don't need a lifer.

957
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:23,120
I don't think of you
that way.

958
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,557
I don't.

959
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,429
I mean, you're
an attractive man.

960
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:31,911
I admire you.
You're strong and...

961
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:39,136
I don't even know

962
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,138
what I'm trying
to say.

963
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:44,968
I guess that about
covers it.

964
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,408
It'll never
happen again,

965
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,976
I guarantee you.

966
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:42,025
Go!

967
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:46,594
Take him down!
Take him down!

968
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,771
All right, Clay!
Nice ride!

969
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:53,036
Sure was!

970
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:58,345
How was that one?
Was that better?

971
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:00,130
If you ain't
going to work at it,

972
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,348
I ain't going to
sit around watching.

973
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:05,309
If you don't want it,
what am I doing here?

974
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:08,442
That's it for today!

975
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:11,010
What the hell's
wrong with you?

976
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,707
While you're
getting laid,

977
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:13,926
I'm doing my best.

978
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,275
What do you want
from me?

979
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:18,496
Don't you ever discuss
my private business!

980
01:06:20,106 --> 01:06:21,412
Said you wanted to rodeo.

981
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,936
All you want to do
is run your mouth.

982
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,242
I'm tired of it!

983
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:28,114
I'm tired of you!

984
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:56,490
Look, ry, if I said
something out there
that was wrong--

985
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:59,580
you're in my light.

986
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,632
I didn't say leave.

987
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:10,417
I said
you're in my light.

988
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:26,477
Pass me
that strap there.

989
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:38,837
Your saddle
is almost finished.

990
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,100
Good-looking saddle.

991
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:44,277
It ought to be,
with all the work
you put into it.

992
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:46,453
You're looking for
an apology,

993
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:48,107
you ain't
going to get it.

994
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,674
You ain't
my good buddy.

995
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:50,718
I killed a man.

996
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:53,069
Took away his gun
and did him cold.

997
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:54,635
Stop trying to make me
something I ain't.

998
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:56,333
I heard
there was a fight.

999
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:59,423
Yeah, there was a fight.

1000
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:03,775
I'd won the all-around
at grand forks.

1001
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,951
Went out to celebrate.

1002
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:08,649
A wild-ass cowboy,
pocket full of money,

1003
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:10,042
looking for
some action.

1004
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,045
I was going to push
till I found it.

1005
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,526
Cut in on a guy
on the dance floor.

1006
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:17,136
Started dancing
with his girl.

1007
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,356
He threw a punch.
I decked him.

1008
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,661
His buddy come running.

1009
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:21,967
I decked him, too.

1010
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,925
The bouncer grabbed me.

1011
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:26,276
I hit him hard.

1012
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,975
He had a gun.
Pulled it.

1013
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:32,325
We wrestled.

1014
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,197
I took it away from him.

1015
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,502
Hell, that's
self-defense.

1016
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:38,157
No. He was down.
I had the gun.

1017
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:40,028
Witnesses were right.
I had a choice.

1018
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,988
Could have stopped it,
but I didn't.

1019
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:44,163
Didn't then.

1020
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,513
I don't know
if I would now.

1021
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:48,167
That's who I am, kid.

1022
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:50,474
I ain't proud of it.

1023
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:59,526
I don't know
what you were like then.

1024
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:03,400
I do know what
you're like now.

1025
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:08,927
You're a good man, ry.

1026
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,017
You're a good man.

1027
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:39,436
Aw, hell you say.

1028
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:50,882
Come on in, treyton.

1029
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:55,756
Congratulations.

1030
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,237
He tells me
you're Weston's
star pupil,

1031
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:02,241
that the warden's
expecting big things
from you

1032
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:03,938
at white river.

1033
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:05,113
I'm impressed.

1034
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:07,246
You got a pen?
I'll give you an autograph.

1035
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,161
Got a package
coming tomorrow.

1036
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,381
You're going to
bring it in.

1037
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,340
No. I can't do that.

1038
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:15,689
No?

1039
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,996
Don't you use
that motherfucking
word on me, man.

1040
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:21,304
Killing me ain't going to get
your load in, jaggs.

1041
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:25,569
Don't worry.

1042
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,659
I'm not going to
touch you,

1043
01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:29,921
but your buddy
Weston's

1044
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:32,358
going to see
his last roundup.

1045
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:36,319
Tough chasing cows
down in the hole.

1046
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:38,756
Kill his ass
or lockdown.

1047
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:44,196
Either way,
your boy's going to
miss a birthday.

1048
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:56,513
O.k.

1049
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:59,516
We'll be in touch.

1050
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:53,178
Where'd you disappear to
after lunch?

1051
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:57,008
West pasture
to fix some fence.

1052
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,663
You nervous?

1053
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,882
Why should I
be nervous?

1054
01:12:01,926 --> 01:12:04,537
I was nervous before
my first big rodeo.

1055
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:08,454
Yeah, I'm a little
nervous, I guess.

1056
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:11,065
You'll be fine.

1057
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,966
You're cutting it close,
aren't you, treyton?

1058
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:43,533
Let's have it.

1059
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:45,143
I ain't got it.

1060
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:47,232
Don't fuck with me.
Where is it?

1061
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:49,365
It's in a safe place.

1062
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,762
You want a piece
of the action,
is that it?

1063
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:57,503
I got a deal in mind.

1064
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,810
I don't make deals,
you stupid motherfucker!

1065
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:00,941
I don't make deals!

1066
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:04,554
Yeah, well, that was then.
This is now.

1067
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:06,469
It's getting
a little dry out there.

1068
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,819
Everybody's getting
a little fucking edgy
around here,

1069
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:10,342
don't you think?

1070
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,430
You don't deliver now,

1071
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,258
people are going to go
someplace else.

1072
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:14,520
They might not come back.

1073
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:17,044
That's the way
I figure it.

1074
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,133
What do you want?

1075
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:20,570
I get out of here
in six weeks.

1076
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:24,661
You get half the stuff now.
You get half when I gate.

1077
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,054
But from here on out,
it's over.

1078
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:28,665
I'm out of it,
he's out of it,

1079
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,449
and Weston's out of it.

1080
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:31,711
That's the deal.

1081
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:36,412
Take your best shot.

1082
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:45,464
10 minutes.
In the boiler room.

1083
01:13:47,684 --> 01:13:49,686
Let's go.

1084
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:51,601
He stays...

1085
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:54,473
Until you deliver.

1086
01:14:03,308 --> 01:14:05,223
He's got balls.

1087
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:07,312
You're letting him
get away with it?

1088
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:09,793
He'll tell us where
the rest of it is.

1089
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:13,318
Nobody will hear him
screaming down there.

1090
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:15,494
I'll say good-bye for you.

1091
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:57,014
Jaggs is going to
kill Clay.

1092
01:14:58,232 --> 01:15:00,974
He was trying
to protect you

1093
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,367
and me, too.

1094
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,500
In the boiler room.

1095
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:05,762
Get a medic.

1096
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,416
He won't make it!

1097
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:17,687
Where's latrell?

1098
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:21,299
I get the product,
you get him.

1099
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:22,909
Relax.

1100
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,825
He's back there
with stoker.

1101
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:38,142
You did good, cowboy.

1102
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:40,753
Now let's have
the rest of it.

1103
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:41,754
Where's latrell?

1104
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:43,539
Same place
you're gonna be

1105
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:46,367
if you don't
start talking.

1106
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:51,677
Little son of a bitch!

1107
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:22,012
There's big money here,
Weston.

1108
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:23,927
I'll cut you in.

1109
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,711
Name your number.

1110
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:27,844
One-on-one
is my number.

1111
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:29,976
You and me.

1112
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,908
Everybody
stay where you are!

1113
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:33,387
Get 'em up!
Get 'em up!

1114
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:34,693
I got no weapon!

1115
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:37,087
Get him on his feet.

1116
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,872
I got him.

1117
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:43,746
Well,
latrell wasn't lying.

1118
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:46,139
We have plenty here.

1119
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:47,314
Where's latrell?

1120
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:48,185
He's dead.

1121
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:49,752
He made it to
the greenhouse

1122
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,319
after jaggs shanked him.

1123
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:54,452
Here's your weapon
right here.

1124
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,280
Murder one, jaggs.

1125
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:58,761
Bought yourself a seat
on death row.

1126
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:00,153
Get him out of here.

1127
01:18:00,197 --> 01:18:02,852
This ain't over,
asshole.

1128
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:03,896
So long, ghost.

1129
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,943
You're going to die,
motherfucker!

1130
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:12,644
There's more of that
behind the mess hall.

1131
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,907
In the vent
next to the dumpster.

1132
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:16,082
Find it.

1133
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:19,172
Ry didn't have
anything
to do with this.

1134
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,521
I brought it in.

1135
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:22,045
I brought it in
from black diamond.

1136
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:25,265
They said they were
going to kill you
if I didn't help.

1137
01:18:25,309 --> 01:18:27,920
This was
the easiest way
I knew how

1138
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:30,009
to get everyone out
from under it.

1139
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:32,577
It didn't work.
I'm sorry.

1140
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,231
All you had to do
was tell me, kid.

1141
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:37,016
I didn't have
the guts to tell you,

1142
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:41,238
not after
you trusted me.

1143
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,765
I'll take
what's coming to me.

1144
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:49,594
Might be more than
you bargained for, son.

1145
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:53,641
I wouldn't be
too hard on him, warden.

1146
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:55,861
He could have took
the easy way

1147
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:56,993
and got away with it,

1148
01:18:57,036 --> 01:19:00,692
but he stood up,
and you got jaggs neff.

1149
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,781
That's one way
of looking at it.

1150
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:03,782
You and me, warden,

1151
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:05,784
we're slammed down here
together.

1152
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:07,481
We're lifers.

1153
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:10,484
But the kid's got a shot
at something real,

1154
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:13,270
if he don't
stay caged too long.

1155
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:16,969
First time I seen you
go to bat for anybody, Weston.

1156
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,493
I put a lot of work
into him.

1157
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:22,148
Don't want to see it
go to waste.

1158
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:31,854
I'll take it all
into consideration.

1159
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,554
Lock these men down.

1160
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:56,008
We've got an outstanding rodeo
for you today, friends.

1161
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,793
An interesting match-up

1162
01:19:57,836 --> 01:19:59,533
in the all-around
cowboy competition

1163
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:01,797
between Cody stavert
from treadmore prison

1164
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,625
and the current champion,
ry Weston, out of brownwood.

1165
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:06,932
We'll watch that closely
as the day goes on.

1166
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:11,589
Right now, let's hear it for
our new rodeo queen--

1167
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:14,897
miss crystal lynne tompkins
and her court.

1168
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:18,291
Hey, now, I knew a girl
named crystal.

1169
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,990
I knew a beauty
whose hair was red.

1170
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:23,079
Had thighs
like peanut butter--

1171
01:20:23,122 --> 01:20:25,821
smooth, creamy,
and easy to spread.

1172
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:28,911
They say, "redhead, redhead,
fire in the woodshed."

1173
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:31,391
What the hell
you talking about?

1174
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:32,915
That's right.

1175
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,526
Welcome to
the best of the worst.

1176
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:40,879
This is the 22nd tri-state
prison rodeo.

1177
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:04,207
Now here's a cowpoke

1178
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,079
we've heard
some good things about.

1179
01:21:07,123 --> 01:21:10,561
In his first rodeo--
Clay treyton.

1180
01:21:16,306 --> 01:21:18,438
Yeah!

1181
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,789
Whoo!

1182
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:25,837
6 1/2 seconds for this rookie
out of brownwood.

1183
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,666
Looks like this boy
is serious about making a run

1184
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:30,015
at all-around cowboy.

1185
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:33,105
A lot of these boys
have never rodeoed before.

1186
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:35,673
We ought to make some noise
for them

1187
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:38,981
for giving us a good show.

1188
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:53,647
6 seconds flat.

1189
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:57,129
Cody stavert ties
ry Weston's old record.

1190
01:21:57,173 --> 01:22:00,959
That was
one heck of a run.

1191
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:10,926
Whoo!

1192
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,059
It's official.

1193
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:15,974
It's a 5 and 9/10th-second run.

1194
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:18,324
A new record
for ry Weston,

1195
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:22,154
breaking his old Mark
by 1/10th of a second.

1196
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:23,634
Looks like I got myself

1197
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:24,722
another championship,
bill.

1198
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:26,898
You're not in
the money yet,
Harlan.

1199
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:31,207
In the all-around, third place,
newcomer Clay treyton.

1200
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,122
In second, Cody stavert,

1201
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:34,993
right on the heels
of our leader--

1202
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:38,866
you guessed it--
ry Weston.

1203
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,042
Hey, Weston!

1204
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:42,131
You were a lucky
son of a bitch
last time!

1205
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:43,567
Today's going to be
different!

1206
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:47,571
Keep telling yourself that.
Might start believing it.

1207
01:22:57,798 --> 01:22:59,278
Oh! You're off there, son!

1208
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:03,282
Hope you have better luck
at your parole hearing!

1209
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:08,505
My! Oh, my! Oh, my!
Look at that boy fly!

1210
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:10,724
Next out of chute four--

1211
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:13,118
Clay treyton
on a hard-to-ride bronc

1212
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,512
we call zamaka.

1213
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:41,146
Whoo!

1214
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:51,243
Stay down!

1215
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,202
Get him out of there!

1216
01:23:53,245 --> 01:23:56,118
That's an official ride
for a 78.

1217
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:58,555
Treyton just made it
to the buzzer,

1218
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:01,471
and it looks like
he's all right

1219
01:24:01,514 --> 01:24:03,603
after that unbelievable wreck.

1220
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:05,562
Let's hear it for
this tough cowboy.

1221
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:10,915
Now in chute nine,
Cody stavert, treadmore.

1222
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:40,684
Stavert gets the first
80 score of the day,

1223
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:46,646
and he's got a real shot
at that gold buckle.

1224
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:50,215
All right. This is it.

1225
01:24:50,259 --> 01:24:52,217
The ride
you've been waiting for.

1226
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:55,525
This is the convict
you've been waiting for.

1227
01:24:55,568 --> 01:24:58,136
Go to chute number four
for the all-around champion

1228
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:03,054
of the tri-state prison rodeo--
ry Weston on twister.

1229
01:25:18,374 --> 01:25:19,201
Aah!

1230
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,203
What is it?
What's wrong?

1231
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,856
My back.

1232
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,338
Doc! Get the doc!

1233
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,474
Bring him over here!

1234
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:34,390
Give me a shot,
I'll be all right.

1235
01:25:34,433 --> 01:25:36,218
It's against
the rules.

1236
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,437
You need x-rays.

1237
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:40,831
You're all right,
ain't you, ry?

1238
01:25:40,874 --> 01:25:42,180
Never better.

1239
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:44,182
He's through.
Pack his gear.

1240
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:45,401
I ain't going nowhere.

1241
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:47,446
Just get me a shot.

1242
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,623
Want to ride a wheelchair
the rest of your life?

1243
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:52,147
I ain't going nowhere!

1244
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,192
I told you it'd be
different today.

1245
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:55,672
There's going to be
a new champion.

1246
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,195
You son of a bitch!

1247
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:59,241
You couldn't carry
his boots!

1248
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:02,766
Get the hell
out of my face!

1249
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,289
Treyton!

1250
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:08,206
I'm going to beat
that son of a bitch
for you.

1251
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,903
It's your ride.
You earned it.

1252
01:26:09,947 --> 01:26:11,253
Beat him
for yourself.

1253
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,602
Ah, this is too bad.

1254
01:26:12,645 --> 01:26:14,125
Because of injury,

1255
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,345
ry Weston has to withdraw
from the competition.

1256
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,650
That means we'll have

1257
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:19,217
a brand-new
all-around champion today.

1258
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:22,742
I think we should show
our appreciation

1259
01:26:22,786 --> 01:26:26,093
for a great cowboy.

1260
01:26:39,498 --> 01:26:41,326
You wouldn't be interested
in a little wager,

1261
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,762
now, would you?

1262
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:45,722
Stavert against the kid.
Straight up on the bull ride.

1263
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:47,811
My man gets hurt.
He wants to bet.

1264
01:26:47,854 --> 01:26:49,334
What do you take me for?

1265
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:51,336
Treyton boy's
a rookie.

1266
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,424
No.

1267
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:53,599
That's what I thought.

1268
01:26:53,643 --> 01:26:57,603
Unless he's backing Weston,
he's gutless.

1269
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:59,388
Ha ha ha!

1270
01:26:59,431 --> 01:27:01,259
You got yourself a bet.

1271
01:27:01,303 --> 01:27:02,782
You're on.

1272
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:05,481
All right, everybody.
Get ready for our grand finale.

1273
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:09,398
And I'm not talking about
no mamma's-boy picnic now.

1274
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:10,529
Rodeo's most dangerous event.

1275
01:27:10,573 --> 01:27:13,663
The toughest eight seconds
in sports.

1276
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:17,101
This is bull riding.

1277
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:20,496
Talk about doing hard time.

1278
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:21,975
Ouch!

1279
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:23,412
I don't know why that bull's
mad at you, Jesse,

1280
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:26,284
unless it was him you robbed.

1281
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:28,243
With ry Weston out,

1282
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:29,461
this ride could determine

1283
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,115
this year's
best all-around cowboy.

1284
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:36,120
Coming out of chute nine--
Cody stavert.

1285
01:27:36,163 --> 01:27:39,166
Get a good ride!

1286
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:11,111
Way to go, Cody!

1287
01:28:11,155 --> 01:28:12,330
Yeah!

1288
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:15,855
Son of a bitch
didn't make it easy,
did he?

1289
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:19,337
Well, if you're going to
work the circuit,

1290
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:21,383
you got to learn
to handle the pressure.

1291
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:23,080
What'd you just say?

1292
01:28:23,123 --> 01:28:24,342
You heard me.

1293
01:28:24,386 --> 01:28:25,909
Don't screw around
about something
like that.

1294
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:31,436
You're green,
but you got the instincts,
you got the tools.

1295
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:37,007
If you got it in here,
you can make it out there.

1296
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:43,230
I want it.
I want it bad.

1297
01:28:44,797 --> 01:28:47,409
I know the feeling.

1298
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:54,764
All right.
You're up. Get up.

1299
01:29:12,695 --> 01:29:16,220
Well, here's our last ride
of the day--

1300
01:29:16,263 --> 01:29:17,787
a first-year man

1301
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:20,442
who's still got a shot
at the all-around championship

1302
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,487
coming out of
chute number four,

1303
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,751
on annihilator--Clay treyton.

1304
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:23,418
Turn him loose!
Turn him loose!

1305
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:38,824
Get him!

1306
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:41,653
Shit.

1307
01:30:45,614 --> 01:30:48,138
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

1308
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:54,100
Cody stavert is the new
all-around champion.

1309
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:03,632
I almost had him, ry.

1310
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:04,633
What'd I do wrong?

1311
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:07,157
You just got throwed,
that's all.

1312
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,158
I'm sorry.

1313
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:10,769
Don't worry, kid.
You got it here.

1314
01:31:10,813 --> 01:31:12,641
Hear me?

1315
01:31:12,684 --> 01:31:13,511
Yeah.

1316
01:31:13,555 --> 01:31:15,644
You ain't
spitting up blood.

1317
01:31:15,687 --> 01:31:17,036
That's a good thing.

1318
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,823
Well, they got
us both wrecked up.

1319
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:25,001
Hell of a day.

1320
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:31,442
You'll be all right.

1321
01:32:04,388 --> 01:32:06,999
I guess this is it.

1322
01:32:11,961 --> 01:32:14,050
Guess so.

1323
01:32:17,836 --> 01:32:20,317
I don't know
what to say.

1324
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,580
Not too much, I hope.

1325
01:32:31,023 --> 01:32:32,634
Um...

1326
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:39,075
You taught me
a hell of a lot.

1327
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:43,688
Good.

1328
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:46,343
I got in touch with
the mcshay spread.

1329
01:32:46,386 --> 01:32:48,258
I got that job.
Got room and board.

1330
01:32:48,301 --> 01:32:49,912
I got six bucks
an hour.

1331
01:32:49,955 --> 01:32:54,699
Hell of a deal.
You're only worth three.

1332
01:32:56,745 --> 01:32:57,659
Here.

1333
01:32:57,702 --> 01:33:00,444
This is for you.

1334
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:01,837
I can't take that.

1335
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,621
Then you'll be
the only pro in the circuit

1336
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:06,319
without his own
bronc saddle.

1337
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:08,626
Oh, forget it.
I ain't no pro.

1338
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:10,062
Why, 'cause you
fell off a bull?

1339
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:14,632
Ain't a cowboy out there
ain't done the same thing.

1340
01:33:15,633 --> 01:33:20,595
Treat it right,
it'll last you.

1341
01:33:25,512 --> 01:33:28,777
See you, kid.

1342
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:33,782
See you, ry.
