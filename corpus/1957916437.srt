0
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,724
- Okay, smile.
- Look this way.

1
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,689
Good mornin', beautiful.

2
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:45,620
Good morning.

3
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,517
How about last night?

4
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,551
Wow, amazing.

5
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,758
Yes, it was.

6
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,965
What are you doing?

7
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,551
Turning last night
into a morning ritual.

8
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:10,655
Mm-mm. No. Mm-mm.

9
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,827
- No?
- No.

10
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,896
No, no, no, no.

11
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,862
Save some for later.

12
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:22,379
Early bird gets the worm.

13
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,655
Yeah, I know.

14
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,448
Heard it a million times.

15
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,758
I'ma just try to
go back to sleep.

16
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,827
Kiss the kids for me.

17
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,793
You know, you could stick
around yourself and do it.

18
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,517
Time waits for no one, honey.

19
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,862
Don't forget, Ashley has
her piano recital at 1:30.

20
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:48,758
It'll break her heart
if you're not there.

21
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,448
Okay, I'll be there.

22
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,413
Just make sure she wears

23
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,010
the red and white dress
I laid out for her

24
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,724
so at least this
time she's matching.

25
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,344
Yeah.

26
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,310
You do know she picked
that out herself, right?

27
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,551
Exactly.

28
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,551
Take a big breath in.

29
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,241
Leave our bodies.

30
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,862
And bring that foot
to the inner thigh.

31
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:16,724
Waiting for a moment
of awesome balance

32
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:20,862
the full expression
of this pose.

33
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,241
Fabulous.

34
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:34,413
I want it!

35
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,724
Keith, you're my
financial advisor.

36
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,689
You know what I like.

37
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

38
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,965
Why not?

39
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:53,241
Okay, well, get it done.

40
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, bye.

41
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,551
Do you want me to stop
at your usual spot?

42
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,034
You know it!

43
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:08,620
- Are you nervous?
- Kind of.

44
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:09,931
Mom's coming, right?

45
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:12,068
I wont be nervous
if she's there.

46
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,758
Yeah, she wouldn't
miss it for the world, okay?

47
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,379
Jordan, you have one minute!

48
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,734
Do you think Mom
will finally let us

49
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:21,827
have a dog this Christmas?

50
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,827
I wouldn't count on it.

51
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:25,413
Daddy, he took my bacon again!

52
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:26,827
Shh!

53
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,896
Well, look who
decided to join us.

54
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,872
Well, Dad, you know I have
to look fresh for the ladies.

55
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,896
Oh boy, sit down!

56
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,965
Shut up, bubblehead!

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,586
In your dreams, bacon head.

58
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,448
Well, if I'm a bacon
face whatever you say,

59
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,965
then what does that make you?

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,655
Y'all finish eating, okay?

61
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,931
In your dreams, troll.

62
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:45,965
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

63
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,117
And Anne and I are
getting back together.

64
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,068
Guys, hurry up!
The bus is waiting.

65
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:53,896
Come on!

66
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:57,482
Jordan.
Don't forget your sister!

67
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:58,758
Come on, let's go!

68
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,862
I'm coming, I'm coming.

69
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,793
We gotta go, the...

70
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,034
- The bus about to leave!
- Come on, come on!

71
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:06,827
Be careful and I
love you guys, okay?

72
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:09,482
Love you too, Dad!

73
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:12,551
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

74
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,827
Come on!

75
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,068
Come on, let's go!

76
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:18,862
You got everything?

77
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,896
See ya at the recital.
Bye!

78
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,724
- All right.
- Love you!

79
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,172
Me and Mom will be there.

80
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:26,010
Don't forget, she's picking
you up from school today!

81
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,482
Yeah, all right.

82
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,551
Pick you up later tonight?

83
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,044
Matt's picking me up.
Toss this, please?

84
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,000
Sure thing.
See you tomorrow!

85
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,655
It's about time.

86
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:02,551
Hey, Mercedes, I just...

87
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:05,206
Shh!

88
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,034
Proceed.

89
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,148
I've been trying to reach you.

90
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:12,896
Your phone must
still be on silent.

91
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,068
No, I got all 12 calls.

92
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:17,068
I just was hoping
you got the message.

93
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,034
And what message is that?

94
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,724
Oh my god, you can't be serious.

95
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,517
I'm playing, but we
have a slight problem

96
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,448
you may be able to help me with.

97
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,551
If I need to fix your problems,
then what do I need with you?

98
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:30,931
Let me know when it's done.

99
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,965
Okay!

100
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:39,724
Sandra and Terry...

101
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,793
Y'all ready to get started?

102
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,896
Okay, so... how's
that date life going?

103
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,793
We don't date.

104
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,586
We're married.

105
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,862
Oh!

106
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:54,103
Is that what happens?

107
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,655
When you get married,
you stop dating?

108
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:59,068
No, no, no, it's
the complete opposite.

109
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,689
Your time together
is very important.

110
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,034
Yeah, we...

111
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,586
We definitely don't date.

112
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,862
Oh.

113
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:11,241
With the kids, we can't
make time for that.

114
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,827
And they're growing up so fast.

115
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:15,620
Terry needs all the hours
he can get at the plant.

116
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,793
And for the past year,
they've been keeping him there

117
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,551
for weeks at a time.

118
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:22,206
And you know it's a very
remote place to cell phones?

119
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:24,689
They don't work so good.
Bad reception.

120
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:27,034
Very, very remote.

121
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,793
Mm-hmm.
Uh, it's real busy.

122
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you guys being
upfront with each other

123
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,103
about your relationship?

124
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,068
- Absolutely!
- Yes.

125
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,275
Sure about that?

126
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,241
Okay.

127
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,965
Well, let's do a quick exercise.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,517
Turn to each other.

129
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,517
And I want you to
repeat after me.

130
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,206
From this day forward...

131
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,793
"From this day forward..."

132
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:01,034
Say, I promise...

133
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,862
"I promise..."

134
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:04,862
To give you...

135
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:05,896
"To give you..."

136
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,103
Twenty minutes...

137
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:09,896
Wha...

138
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,000
Two zero.

139
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,000
"Twenty minutes..."

140
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,931
Of my undivided...

141
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, see, now...

142
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,758
Ah, ah, ah.
I said undivided.

143
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,793
"Undivided attention..."

144
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:34,103
Each day.

145
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,034
"Each day."

146
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:39,758
Now, Mr. Terry, I'm gon' need
you to have a conversation

147
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,689
with your boss,

148
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,182
and tell them that you're
gonna need to spend

149
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,896
a lot more time at home.

150
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,379
Mm-hmm.

151
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,655
Yeah, I think that'll
be quite all right.

152
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:55,137
Now, what I do want to
talk to you guys about

153
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:57,172
is your communication...

154
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:59,310
I think we've lost the romance.

155
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:00,562
I think that that's
what I'm looking at.

156
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,931
I think I'm looking at two
people who were once in love,

157
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:07,689
who, I mean, couldn't go a day
without calling each other,

158
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,862
coming to visit, and just
having wild and crazy sex.

159
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:12,689
And here we are,
where husband's off

160
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:16,724
having remote who knows what,
wife's feeling overwhelmed,

161
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,665
things aren't going right,
the kids are running you crazy.

162
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,310
I can feel it, I
can see it, sis.

163
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, we gotta fix that!

164
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:26,965
We can do the thing?

165
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:29,275
Girl, I'ma feel you...

166
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,586
The thing?

167
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,034
Thank you so much.

168
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,172
Thank you, guys!

169
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,217
All right, have a
great rest of the day.

170
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,103
Yeah, you too.

171
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:46,172
Y'all keep going,
keep going, yes!

172
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:47,827
We gonna keep going.

173
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:48,862
Okay, all right!

174
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, now!

175
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,034
Yes!

176
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,413
Mercedes, you are so good!

177
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:04,931
Mm!

178
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,724
Too good.

179
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:12,827
Oh, sorry for interrupting.

180
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,310
Your 4:00 PM, the Fontaines,
wanted to thank you,

181
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,275
but instead have decided
to renew their vows

182
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,068
at some country club... tonight.

183
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,103
Oh.

184
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,448
This is the second cancellation.

185
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,206
What are you telling
these people?

186
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,275
Only how to be
their best selves.

187
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,068
We can't keep them forever.

188
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:33,137
Oh, make sure to charge them
for their last 12 sessions.

189
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,862
That's good and all, but since
you've got me working so much,

190
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:39,275
I assume we can't afford
any extra help around here?

191
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,103
I mean, shouldn't we try to
keep as much business as we can,

192
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:45,068
at least until things pick up?

193
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:48,241
If we keep losing everyone
at the pace that we are,

194
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:52,413
we will be out of
business by New Year.

195
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:55,241
Oh my god, so dramatic!

196
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,931
How's Ronald?

197
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:58,103
You mean Calvin.

198
00:11:58,137 --> 00:11:59,448
Whatever his name is.

199
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:01,379
I'm sure he's, uh,
pretty excited about

200
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,172
all that extra
money you're making.

201
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:07,517
He's happy I can finally
help pay for things, yes.

202
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,517
Exactly! See?
Our business is fine!

203
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:14,034
All right, we had a few
slow months, but alas,

204
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:19,137
Christmas is only days away,
and dysfunction saves the day.

205
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,034
How long have you been with me?

206
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:22,344
Seven years.

207
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,034
And have I ever let you down?

208
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:29,241
Well, there was that one New
Year's party a few years back.

209
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,517
Get out.

210
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,310
Girl, I'm playing.

211
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:34,034
Oh, I'm almost forgot!

212
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,103
Matthew called for
the fourth time today.

213
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,148
He has to make sure you're
on time for dinner tonight.

214
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:40,379
Why didn't he just call me?

215
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,172
Because you don't
answer your phone.

216
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,965
Whatever.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,344
Oh, gosh, before I forget,
put these in the mail for me.

218
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm adopting elderly this year.

219
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:56,034
Mm, look who's in
the Christmas spirit.

220
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,344
I surprise myself.

221
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,137
Girl, this plant is dead.

222
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:01,862
That's also a surprise.

223
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,275
Water it.

224
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, oh my god.

225
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,103
Your financial advisor wants
to do a 1:00 PM meeting

226
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,044
to discuss the portfolio
you've been asking about.

227
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,413
I can't.

228
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,206
I have a 1:30 thing
with my daughter.

229
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,965
He said that's his only opening
and he has a late flight.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,586
Gosh, come on.

231
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,965
Well... Matthew
will be there.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,931
She'll be fine.

233
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:27,586
As he always is.

234
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,586
Well. Oh, make sure
to call and tell him

235
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,448
that he has to pick up
the kids from school

236
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,413
because I'm sure this
is going to run over.

237
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:38,827
Okay.
I will, uh, let him know.

238
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:42,034
And, uh, I have to leave early
on Christmas Eve.

239
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,379
We have a few friends dropping
by for a... holiday party.

240
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:47,275
I'll manage.

241
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,068
We wanna add that on to this...

242
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,620
We gotta make that happen.

243
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,344
Let's do it!

244
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:38,517
♪ Jesus Lord at thy birth

245
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,344
Good luck, Ashley.

246
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:53,310
Okay, then.

247
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,068
Hey Ashley, it's time.

248
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:16,689
She's not coming, is she?

249
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:19,379
Honey, they're waiting.

250
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:22,068
We gotta go, but you got this.

251
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:24,000
I told you so.

252
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:29,689
You got this.

253
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:35,206
So, as you can see,

254
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,413
your account has
been doing very well.

255
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,217
Yeah, this is what you have
right now in your bank account

256
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:41,241
right here.

257
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,000
- Here?
- Yes.

258
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,000
So, that's a reason to be happy.

259
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:46,217
And it's gonna get even bigger.

260
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,586
It has to be bigger!

261
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,044
So what we're trying
to do right now,

262
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,689
because the stock market
is always fluctuating...

263
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:08,068
So please, do tell me
more about this new project.

264
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:10,413
You know what?
Okay, I'll have to say this...

265
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,034
I'm super excited about it,

266
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,206
but we haven't exactly
nailed down anything yet.

267
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,620
Okay.

268
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,943
Her relationship to work,
that she's gotta stop

269
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,700
And do you know what
this girl told me?

270
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,137
I mean, woman told me?

271
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:58,793
She kept on cutting me off,
telling me that I was wrong.

272
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,655
And I'm like, see,
this is the problem.

273
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,862
Now you're trying
to boss me around.

274
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,275
You can't boss me around.

275
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,827
Babe, I thought we weren't
having business talk tonight.

276
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,034
Oh.

277
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,862
Matthew, I kind of want to
hear the rest of this story.

278
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,724
Please?

279
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,655
By the end of the session,
sis was putty in my hands, okay?

280
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,310
We had a breakthrough,

281
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,148
and then by the time
they walked out of my office,

282
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,724
they were like two newlyweds

283
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,137
on the second night
of their honeymoon.

284
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,379
Voila.

285
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:35,620
I told her that Mercedes Wright
is the baddest bitch

286
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,758
that she will ever
sit in front of!

287
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:42,724
- Period.
- Okay.

288
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,275
Matt, did you share
your great news?

289
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,827
Ah, not yet.

290
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:49,137
Ain't no secrets at this table.

291
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,206
It's not really
that big of a deal.

292
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,517
Plus I'm not trying to
talk about work right now.

293
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,275
I'll be damned!

294
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,344
What?

295
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,724
Bruh, this man here just became
the head of the biggest project

296
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,620
- in the history of our company.
- What?

297
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:05,562
And you don't wanna
share that news at the table?

298
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,448
- Babe!
- All right.

299
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,344
It's kinda cool, okay?

300
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,586
Baby! What?

301
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,689
Just don't forget about us
little folks, all right?

302
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,413
Mm, no, Caleb, uh-uh, no.

303
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,241
Your time is gonna come.

304
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,206
And we have a
two-year-old, so, uh, no,

305
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:24,413
I need you home as
much as possible.

306
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,517
True.

307
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,241
Congratulations.

308
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,517
Thank you.

309
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:33,344
Let's cheers to my brother,
his big endeavor, proud of you.

310
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,862
Salut!

311
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,137
If you ask me, it's overdue.

312
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,907
If I was him, I'd walk
right into that company

313
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:43,862
and, look, if you can't
make me partner, I'm out.

314
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:47,724
Partner? That's a bit of
a reach, don't you think?

315
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:50,551
She had too many drinks.

316
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,517
I don't think it's reaching.

317
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,793
I mean, why just continue
to make other people rich

318
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,344
instead of building
your own company?

319
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:59,758
There wouldn't be
a Mercedes Wright

320
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:02,275
had I just sat around
and waited.

321
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,448
My girl.
She's saying it right.

322
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,655
That right?

323
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:06,896
- Ha!
- Hello.

324
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,862
To that!

325
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,448
It wasn't that bad.

326
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,482
Wow, you serious?

327
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:21,896
You know, I just wish you
could see yourself sometimes.

328
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:23,689
We had guests over
for three hours.

329
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,793
Nobody was able to say anything.

330
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,655
That's ridiculous!
Everyone talked.

331
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,310
Okay.

332
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:33,379
So what did Faith
and Caleb talk about?

333
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,310
It's not my fault no one had
anything interesting to say.

334
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,551
You know, I was
hoping that tonight

335
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,310
would help us reconnect,

336
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:42,838
especially after you
stood up your own daughter

337
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:45,758
on her biggest day.

338
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,344
I'm done defending you to them.

339
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:51,344
Well, excuse me!

340
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:53,241
Okay, look.

341
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,827
I think you're being a
little dramatic about this.

342
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,448
Look, I got tipsy.

343
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,448
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:04,517
But you're not
exactly Mr. Perfect.

345
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,793
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:10,206
This isn't about that.

347
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,355
When was the last
time you thought about

348
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,310
something more
important than yourself?

349
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,689
Okay, stop it.

350
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:16,448
You and the kids
are very important.

351
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,758
Oh, really?

352
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,448
So how about you explain to them

353
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,517
why you never show up
to anything?

354
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,689
Okay, wait a minute,
now, that's not fair.

355
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,758
I never ask you to choose.

356
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:28,862
All right, what's wrong with me
being a passionate career woman?

357
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,965
And what's wrong with me
encouraging my husband

358
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,689
to become partner in a company,

359
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,620
and which he
rightfully deserves?

360
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:38,413
First off, they don't
offer partnerships, okay?

361
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,793
Secondly, I love my job.

362
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:44,241
I love being an architect.

363
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,206
But I love our
family a lot more.

364
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,965
I have no interest
in chasing something

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,586
that's going to take
me away from that.

366
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,172
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

367
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:57,689
Okay, humor me.

368
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:02,310
Why do you have a driver when
you have a Mercedes out front?

369
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,241
Because I... Don't do that.

370
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,896
I miss the woman that I married.

371
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:14,344
Mercedes Johnson.

372
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:20,344
Did you know that Ashley
lost another tooth?

373
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,862
You didn't tell me that.

374
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,586
Yes, I did.
A week ago.

375
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,689
Even told your parents.
You don't talk to them anymore.

376
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,034
I just think we need some space,

377
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,527
some time so that you
can have some clarity

378
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37,379
and figure out what's
important to you.

379
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,310
So you're really leaving?

380
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,862
You're your biggest fan.
You get you all to yourself.

381
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:47,517
I'll be at my mom's
with the kids.

382
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,931
Matthew!

383
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,482
I think there's a
major difference

384
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,689
in the way you
guys walked in here

385
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:02,068
and the way you guys are
about to walk out of here.

386
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,758
We made some
progress today, guys.

387
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:05,344
And I'm proud of us!

388
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,482
Go make some babies!
What are we doing?

389
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:10,586
We're wasting time here.
That's what I'm talking about!

390
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,000
Now we're all on the same page!
I'll see you guys next week.

391
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,655
Okay, see you next week.

392
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,379
All right! See you soon.

393
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:18,965
Ah, yes!

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,827
Ooh, baby, call me Mrs. Fix It!

395
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:22,965
You are so good, girl!

396
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,103
Yes, I know, I know,
you are so good.

397
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,586
Woo-hoo!

398
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,000
Hi, Mercedes.

399
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, he took the kids to do

400
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,551
and to see the Christmas
decorations downtown.

401
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:49,758
That's not like him to
just leave his phone.

402
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:52,448
To be honest with you,
Mercedes, he knew you'd call,

403
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:58,758
You can always come see the kids
whenever you want, Mercedes.

404
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:05,034
While you figure
out what you want.

405
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,689
I'll tell him you called.

406
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:13,758
Mm, well...

407
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,965
Okay, I'll figure it out myself.

408
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,965
I need a drink.

409
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:52,103
Cancel your Christmas Eve plans.

410
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:53,838
I need you to organize
my financial statements

411
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:55,517
for the past seven years.

412
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,034
But I told you
about my Christmas party.

413
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:01,068
Go late.
I need them done by Christmas.

414
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,758
"A woodsman, who
was chopping logs nearby,

415
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:32,931
"He grabbed that old wolf
and made him spit out

416
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,689
"that poor grandmother,

417
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,068
"who was a bit frazzled,
if I must say so,

418
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,172
"by the whole experience,

419
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:42,931
"but still in one piece.

420
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:47,000
"'Oh, Grandma, I was scared!'

421
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,655
sobbed Little Red Hiding Hood.

422
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:55,000
"'I'll never speak to strangers
or dawdle in the forest again.'

423
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:59,172
"That woodsman
knocked out that wolf

424
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,724
"and carried him
deep into the forest,

425
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:05,827
"where he wouldn't bother people
or Little Red Riding Hood

426
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:09,586
ever again. The end."

427
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,206
All right, kids, lights out.

428
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,965
Can we say our prayers?

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,724
Yeah, can we?

430
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:16,206
Of course.

431
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:20,620
Yes, Lord.

432
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:24,034
God, thank you
for today, my family,

433
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:27,000
and your love in our lives.

434
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,689
Thank you for Grandma

435
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:30,931
and the greatest
daddy in the world,

436
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:33,137
and Mommy, the greatest
mommy in the world.

437
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,896
She doesn't know
yet, but she is.

438
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,241
God, please have your angels
watch over her and change her,

439
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:42,620
and we can be a
happy family again.

440
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:44,655
Amen.

441
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,068
All right, it's time for bed.

442
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:49,172
Light's out for real
this time, okay?

443
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,689
- Another shot?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,034
Rough night, huh?

445
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:01,034
Thanks, Gary.
You have no idea.

446
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:02,348
If I had a dime for every person

447
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,000
I see like this
during the season...

448
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,689
Mm-hmm.

449
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:08,241
On the house.

450
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,241
Merry Christmas.

451
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:16,310
Merry Christmas.

452
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,344
Ah, sorry.

453
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,896
I didn't see you there.

454
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:32,206
Yeah.

455
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:34,655
The same thing
brought us both here.

456
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:38,758
I'm sure your problems are
nothing compared to mine.

457
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:42,241
What I've learned in life is
there's no problem so original

458
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,344
that there's not
an answer to it.

459
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:47,206
Hm, no advice I
can take from you.

460
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,241
Okay.

461
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:58,241
Imagine having an
ungrateful spouse.

462
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:02,448
I gave that man the world.

463
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:05,827
And one hiccup, and
that world is over.

464
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,965
Let them sleep, baby.
They'll be fine.

465
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,758
You'll all be fine.

466
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:24,275
Hey.

467
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,965
God works in mysterious ways.

468
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,896
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,448
I'm probably talking
your ear off.

470
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,137
I didn't even get your name.

471
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,413
- Oh, I'm David.
- Mercedes.

472
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:45,344
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

473
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,379
So, um...

474
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:52,275
You find you have no
fault in any of this?

475
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,689
Honestly? No.

476
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:56,103
Yes.

477
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:58,241
Look, I'm ambitious.

478
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,965
And so is he!

479
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,206
And maybe I talk
too much sometimes,

480
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:06,344
but that's what I do.

481
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:08,448
I fix relationships.

482
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,965
I am Mercedes Wright.

483
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,793
The chick from the projects who
watched her parents struggle

484
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,310
to get me through college.

485
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:20,827
There is no way I'm letting
us go back to that nightmare.

486
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:25,137
Would he?

487
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:27,896
I knew you wouldn't get it.

488
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,517
Well, seems to me you
have it all figured out.

489
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:33,034
I do!

490
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:35,827
I just wish he could
see how lucky he is

491
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,172
and how many men would
die to be in his position.

492
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,034
Is that what you wish?

493
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:42,413
Excuse me?

494
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:45,034
Is that your wish?

495
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:48,724
For him to see how empty his
life would be without you?

496
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,206
I never thought
about it that way.

497
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:56,896
Huh, if only that was possible.

498
00:28:56,931 --> 00:29:02,379
Is that your wish?
I could make it...

499
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:04,482
as if you two hadn't ever met.

500
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:17,551
I must be drunk out my mind.

501
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:19,931
I sit here two hours
talking to some nutcase

502
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:21,931
talkin' about how he
gonna grant me a wish?

503
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,965
Humor me.

504
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,241
Yeah.

505
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:37,793
I want him to see what life
is like without Mercedes Wright.

506
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,517
Your wish is granted.

507
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,000
Okay.

508
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:54,965
Well, this party is lame, so,

509
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,275
I'm gonna go home.

510
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,355
I've had a little
too much to drink.

511
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,275
So have you.

512
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,551
You get home safe, David.

513
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:05,241
Miss Perfect is going home.

514
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,931
See you soon!

515
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:11,068
Mercedes Wright...

516
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,068
Ha, ha!

517
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,551
I thought you were at
your parents' house.

518
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,413
I think maybe you
got the wrong house?

519
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,103
Matthew, I've had
a long day, okay?

520
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:58,241
Move, I'm not in the mood.

521
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,241
- Miss, Miss, excuse me!
- Whoa!

522
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,517
- Excuse me, please!
- What?

523
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:02,551
Matt, who's at the door?

524
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,310
I think somebody's lost.

525
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:07,965
Lost?

526
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,655
Hi, the Michaels
are a few doors down.

527
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,379
I know the GPS can be confusing.

528
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,000
Matthew, who is this chick

529
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,034
and why is she in the house
that I pay half for?

530
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:17,251
And stop saying I'm
at the wrong address

531
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,413
'cause I'm not.

532
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,000
What is she talking about?

533
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:20,931
What am I...

534
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,245
And how does she know your name?

535
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,620
Babe, I have no idea.

536
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:25,286
I'ma ask you to leave
or I'm calling the cops.

537
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,000
- Get the hell out of my house.
- I don't know her!

538
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,137
Are you serious?

539
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,413
Miss, please!

540
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:46,620
When I feel
a tap on my shoulder,

541
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:54,448
And he says,
"Do you have some time?"

542
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:57,068
So, we walk across the street,

543
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:00,000
and I think he's
taking me for lunch.

544
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:03,551
- And he says, "No, no."
- No, no?

545
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,482
Real stern like,
"My car."

546
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,310
- Wow!
- Girl!

547
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,137
He's gonna look at me and
ask, "How much do you want?"

548
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,551
I say, "You ain't
gotta pay me nothin'

549
00:32:13,586 --> 00:32:16,517
because I ain't no h... "

550
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:19,172
He then slams his cuffs on me.

551
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm screaming!

552
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,517
Help! Help!

553
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,172
He's gonna tell me to shut up.

554
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:26,724
What?

555
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:31,068
I froze and looked him
straight in the eye

556
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:33,310
and kicked him in
the you know what.

557
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,724
That's right.

558
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:39,310
Mercedes Johnson?
You're free to go.

559
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,034
Feel better than me, girl.

560
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:43,310
Oh, thank god.

561
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,034
Me too? Please?

562
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:46,517
Uh, excuse me?

563
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:50,034
There are more
people in here too!

564
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:50,724
What about me?

565
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,655
I just want you to know that

566
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:53,769
you will be hearing
from my attorney, okay?

567
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:56,482
How dare you lock me up
in this disgusting place!

568
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,172
Do you know who I am?

569
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,758
Look, lady, take it up
with the judge.

570
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,000
Can I get my phone call?

571
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,103
Look, where's Matthew?

572
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,586
Who?

573
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,448
Matthew, my husband?

574
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:26,103
There's no Matthew.

575
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,655
And he didn't mention
that he was your husband.

576
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,275
Hello again!

577
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:36,137
I told you I'd be
seeing you soon.

578
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,241
Where's my husband?

579
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:45,034
After all you've
been through tonight,

580
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:47,275
haven't you figured it out yet?

581
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,172
Figured out what?

582
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,655
Your wish.

583
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,034
There is no husband, no family.

584
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:55,310
No one to be responsible
for or accountable to.

585
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,241
You're free!

586
00:33:57,275 --> 00:34:00,482
Now you can both experience
what life would be like if...

587
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:02,344
you'd never met.

588
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,482
Okay.

589
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,172
You are really insane.

590
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:11,379
Could you... okay, first of all,
please stop stalking me, okay?

591
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,137
This is what you get for
being nice to weirdos.

592
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:18,206
Second...

593
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:24,172
must've left my wallet
at the office, but... listen.

594
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:27,172
I will come to the bar tomorrow
and give you cash, okay?

595
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:28,655
To pay you back.

596
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:31,275
- Are we good?
- Oh, very good.

597
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,586
Good.

598
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:41,793
Hey.

599
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,620
Are you sure we're
in the right place?

600
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,034
Let me check.
Just stay put.

601
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:18,758
What?

602
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:29,172
We're sorry,
you have reached a number

603
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,310
We're sorry, you
have reached a number

604
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:57,758
What can I get ya?

605
00:36:57,793 --> 00:37:00,379
Um, I was in here
a few hours ago.

606
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,689
Um, but it looks like
you've changed everything up.

607
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:08,586
I might've had a little
too much to drink, but

608
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,517
I was wondering if anyone
handed in a wallet and a ring?

609
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,379
Don't ask.

610
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,310
No.

611
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:18,206
Okay.

612
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:21,310
Gary, I was just
sitting right here.

613
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,034
Lady, I don't remember you.

614
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:25,482
It was only a few of us in here.

615
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,689
What do you want?

616
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:30,482
A beer.

617
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,344
Shoot.

618
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:42,965
Can I at least have a glass?

619
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:46,965
God!

620
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:50,931

Thanks.

634
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,827
I guess they're trying
to mix it up a bit.

635
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:03,724
Never knew they had dancers.
And I come here often.

636
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,517
That's a drag.
I've never seen you before.

637
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:09,034
And I'm very good with faces.

638
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,827
I do remember you as that
stuck-up executive bitch

639
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:19,620
that was in the can earlier.

640
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:21,448
I'm sorry?

641
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,586
Sorry.

642
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,862
People talk, but I've
never seen you here before.

643
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:31,448
You know, I'm not a big fan
of what they did around here.

644
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:34,862
You could tell it
was a rush job.

645
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:37,137
What brings you here tonight?

646
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:40,172
This is obviously not
your type of hangout.

647
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:42,724
I'm looking for my
ring and my wallet.

648
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:47,137
I thought I might've left it
here when I was... here, earlier.

649
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:49,620
Hey, what's going on with Gary?

650
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,965
He's never this rude.

651
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That prick is never nice.

652
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:56,448
The less talking
he does, the better.

653
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,827
It's obvious he hates his job.

654
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:03,000
If you ask me, he's in
the wrong line of business.

655
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,827
Well, good luck.

656
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll let the gang know to keep a
lookout if they find something.

657
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,655
Yeah, bet you will.

658
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:12,965
Well, screw you!

659
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,758
I'm only offering to help.

660
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,074
Believe it or not, the people
in here are more trustworthy

661
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:19,724
than you upscale pricks.

662
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry!

663
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:23,172
Look, I...

664
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,000
It's been a long day, all right?

665
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:26,965
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:33,034
What are you having?

667
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:34,896
I'm tapped out with this.

668
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,896
I spent my last on it.

669
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:37,931
It's Christmas, babe.

670
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:39,551
It's on the house.

671
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:42,137
Gary, another
round for the lady.

672
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:48,172
Thanks.

673
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:50,862
Look, I need you to
pay your tab tonight!

674
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:53,172
Oh, shut up, Gary.
Have a heart!

675
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:57,034
She lost her wallet.
I always pay my freakin' tab.

676
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:00,206
Such a jerk, I tell you.

677
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:02,206
Well, I need some
air and a cigarette.

678
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:04,793
- You comin'?
- When did he get like this?

679
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:07,034
Oh, just forget him.

680
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,241
He's always like this.

681
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,793
Candy.

682
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,148
I need you to close
out your tab tonight.

683
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,758
It ain't free, you know.

684
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:17,586
Relax, Gary!

685
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,034
Jeez!

686
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:22,068
Ugh! Jerk!

687
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:26,206
Anyway...

688
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:27,103
Right.

689
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:28,965
What part of town you live?

690
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,931
Well, I thought I knew,
and then I ended up in jail.

691
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:35,034
Girl, your issue

692
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:39,241
is more serious than I thought!

693
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:42,172
You must be drinking that
new stuff they got here.

694
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:46,620
Got people blackin' out
for days at a time, ugh.

695
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:51,758
Well... I want you to be safe.

696
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:56,103
You're welcome to crash at
my place and stay the night.

697
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:59,586
I'm sure you'll be fine
tomorrow.

698
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,241
Thanks.

699
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:07,137
Looks like your
world isn't ending after all.

700
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:09,689
Hello?

701
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:12,000
Mercedes, where are you?

702
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,034
I've been waiting here
for the past hour for you.

703
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,793
Uh, yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

704
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,275
Long day.

705
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,517
I miss you.

706
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:31,206
Very funny. It's Kenny.

707
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,551
East Hills, at your place?

708
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,965
Right.

709
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,034
Where are you?

710
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,689
Where?

711
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:48,896
Why are you at
that low-class place?

712
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,423
I'm sending a car
to come get you.

713
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,034
East Hills?

714
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,000
That's the richest part of town.

715
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:02,724
Why are you way over here?

716
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:08,379
Anyway... call me.

717
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:10,344
So I can know you got home safe.

718
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:14,068
Thank you.

719
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:39,206
Good morning, beautiful.

720
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,034
You should just stay.

721
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:48,724
I wish I could, but...

722
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:50,344
busy day today.

723
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:53,241
I am done with alcohol.

724
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:03,137
I had the worst
nightmare last night.

725
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:05,241
You weren't even you.

726
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:09,862
Even Marlon's wasn't
even the same.

727
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:14,241
Anyway, some woman claimed
to live here with you.

728
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,103
She better be lucky
it was a dream.

729
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:17,896
Uh-huh.

730
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,068
Just come back to bed.

731
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:34,068
Early bird gets the worm.

732
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,148
It's okay, you can
leave early for work.

733
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,034
I'm gonna stay
home with the kids.

734
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,275
Kids?

735
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,137
That'll be the day!

736
00:44:51,172 --> 00:44:52,275
You must be dreaming.

737
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,103
Oh my god!

738
00:44:55,137 --> 00:44:57,344
It was real.

739
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:02,000
Who are you and how
did you get in here?

740
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,137
You let me in!

741
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:05,000
No, I didn't.
Where is Matthew?

742
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:05,965
- Who?
- My husband!

743
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,758
Where is Matthew?

744
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,320
Hey, if this is some type
of-of roleplaying game...

745
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,379
Where's Matt?
Where is he?

746
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:13,493
Look, I don't know
who Matthew is,

747
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:16,137
and I don't know what this is,
but I'm not turn...

748
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,482
I'm gonna call the cops.

749
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,965
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

750
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,827
Call them and tell the
truth... we're screwing!

751
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:24,079
Yeah, and somehow, someway,
you caught a conscience

752
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:25,896
and now you feel guilty.

753
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,838
What are you doing?
You asked me to spend the night

754
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,000
like you did every
other night this week.

755
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,344
Hello? 911...

756
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:35,517
We're both workaholics.

757
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:37,172
It's perfect.
What are you doing?

758
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,862
Why are you trying
to mess this up?

759
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:40,724
Is there an emergency?

760
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,931
The wrong number.

761
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,965
I don't remember any of this.

762
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,896
Mercedes,
I'ma tell you like this.

763
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:00,620
God...

764
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:02,482
You need to lay off the alcohol.

765
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:05,034
When you got your
stuff together, call me.

766
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:28,620
Deshaun, I did not sleep well.

767
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,551
I could really use a coffee.

768
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:46,413
It's your girl, Faith.

769
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,206
Deshaun, you're passing it up.

770
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:54,689
Excuse me?

771
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:00,034
Miss Johnson, you
must have me confused.

772
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:01,562
You made it very clear that
once you're inside the car,

773
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:04,241
you want complete silence.

774
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:14,000
Where are we?

775
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:16,482
Your office, ma'am.

776
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,241
My office.

777
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:40,310
Anything else I can do
for you, Miss Johnson?

778
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,586
Um... one moment.

779
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,172
- Hello?
- Where are you?

780
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,275
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

781
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,551
Um, I think I'm here.

782
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:07,206
Okay, I'm on the
way up right now.

783
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:09,000
Great.

784
00:50:13,517 --> 00:50:15,275
Good morning, Miss Johnson.

785
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,206
Merry Christmas.

786
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:18,655
Good morning.

787
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:48,655
Can I help you with
anything, Miss Johnson?

788
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,379
Sorry, I, um...

789
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,379
My mind drew a blank.

790
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:56,310
Long night. Um...

791
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,482
I understand.

792
00:50:57,517 --> 00:51:00,655
Would you like for me to
escort you to the ninth floor?

793
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:03,137
No, no, no, I got it.

794
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:06,275
Um...

795
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,034
Let me get that for you.

796
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,206
You have a great
rest of the day.

797
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:16,793
Thank you.

798
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,862
Nine o'clock, you
have Ms. Dogmeyers.

799
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:35,862
Ten o'clock, you
have the Wayans.

800
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:38,413
Eleven o'clock, you
have Eleanor Murphy.

801
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:39,689
Something's different.

802
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,344
Good morning, Miss Johnson.

803
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:43,206
She just lost her pet
rabbit last month,

804
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:45,389
and this month, her poodle's
at the vet with a broken leg,

805
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:46,620
so she's devastated...

806
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:48,068
Good morning,
Miss. Johnson.

807
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:49,217
And she feels like her
world's falling apart.

808
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:50,620
A bunny?

809
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,769
Whatever you do,
do not call it a bunny.

810
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:53,551
It's Puffy Murphy.

811
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:56,793
She looks at it as like
a family member or something.

812
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,206
Then, at 12:00, you have
a noon luncheon to go over

813
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,517
the Black Money social
payment app possible merger

814
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,896
with both CEOs.

815
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:04,862
Woo-hoo!
If this goes through,

816
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,344
we're looking at going
public in a year!

817
00:52:07,379 --> 00:52:08,517
Is that all?

818
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:10,827
As usual, go over the rest
of your schedule at lunch.

819
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:12,517
Have a great day!

820
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:13,827
Uh-huh.

821
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:06,655
Stanford?

822
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:09,172
I didn't go to Stanford.

823
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,896
Wow.

824
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:01,896
I just don't feel
valued anymore.

825
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,517
This year, he thought
it was a good idea

826
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:06,413
to fly the G5 instead of
the Global to visit my parents.

827
00:54:06,448 --> 00:54:10,310
Imagine that, the horror
of flying on a G5.

828
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:12,689
Better yet, he thought
we should fly commercial

829
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:14,310
during the holidays!

830
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:17,034
Ugh, god only knows what
he'll get me for Christmas.

831
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:19,344
Last year, I told him
exactly what I wanted,

832
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,655
and somehow I ended up with
the ugliest emerald necklace

833
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:23,448
you've ever seen.

834
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:25,551
Wish I would've known that
before I spent 400 grand.

835
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:27,344
Oh, it's always
money, money, money.

836
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:29,724
Let me tell you something.

837
00:54:29,758 --> 00:54:31,517
I logged in to his computer.

838
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:33,862
He's secretly been trying
to buy a new Ferrari.

839
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,655
I sense a midlife crisis.

840
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:38,241
I need to reschedule.

841
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,379
Uh, I assume no
charge for today.

842
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:47,586
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey...

843
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,827
Everything okay?

844
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:50,907
Yes, I just need
to get some air.

845
00:54:50,931 --> 00:54:53,344
You can't.
You're booked solid.

846
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:55,413
And you have that luncheon
in an hour and a half.

847
00:54:55,448 --> 00:54:57,551
I'm sorry, Mercedes, but
today is not a good idea.

848
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,689
It wasn't a question.

849
00:54:58,724 --> 00:54:59,896
Reschedule.

850
00:54:59,931 --> 00:55:01,827
We can't just
cancel on everybody.

851
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:03,551
It makes us look unprofessional.

852
00:55:03,586 --> 00:55:04,631
Look, I didn't
sign up for this...

853
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:06,965
Stop!

854
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,965
I said reschedule.

855
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:57,034
Drive.

856
00:55:57,068 --> 00:55:59,344
- I gotta go up and see it.
- Must see!

857
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:01,379
Just like I said,
listen to the woman, okay?

858
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,180
Miss Johnson,
you must have me confused.

859
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:26,137
Mercedes, it's me.

860
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:42,034
Faith!

861
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:42,689
Hey, girl, you should've told...

862
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:43,965
Bitch!

863
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Uh, okay...

864
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,872
You got some nerve speaking
to me after what you did...

865
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:49,655
You slut!

866
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,182
First of all, why are
you talking to me like that?

867
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:53,482
I am not afraid of you
like everybody else.

868
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:54,872
Of course you're not!
You're my best friend!

869
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:57,655
No, save that! Save it!

870
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,482
You slept with my fiancé.

871
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:01,758
So stay the hell out of my life.

872
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,551
Faith!

873
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:06,206
But...

874
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:10,517
Slept with... okay,
this is getting crazy.

875
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:46,551
I told you, Miss Lady,
I cannot get used to that.

876
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,137
At least you know the truth.

877
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,241
I... guess I need to find
you something to eat.

878
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:47,965
Okay, look this way.

879
00:59:49,241 --> 00:59:50,793
Grace, can we get some light on?

880
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,965
Perfect, perfect.
Give us a smile... smile.

881
00:59:57,103 --> 00:59:59,241
Okay, yeah.
Okay, she's a...

882
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:02,827
Okay, there you go, all right.

883
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:07,586
All right, smile, honey.
It's your big night.

884
01:00:09,103 --> 01:00:10,103
Of course you do!

885
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:14,034
You look so beautiful!

886
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:19,344
No, you're not.
Lots of people go alone.

887
01:00:21,758 --> 01:00:23,275
Waiting for him to ask her out.

888
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:29,103
Boys are so immature
at this age.

889
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:32,344
I didn't go around
hurting people's feelings.

890
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:37,793
And honey, you stay
who you are, okay?

891
01:00:41,103 --> 01:00:42,620
Now, smile!

892
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:03,424
Hey, as the owner of this place,

893
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:04,965
is there anything
you want to say?

894
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,862
Uh, yeah, sure.

895
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:11,034
Um, wishing everyone love,
happiness, and success

896
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:12,448
during this holiday season.

897
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:15,379
- Cheers!
- Nice. Well said.

898
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:23,896
So, um, you enjoying yourself?

899
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,827
You know how I feel
about the holiday season.

900
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:28,286
It's what I like
about you, Mercedes.

901
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,103
You have no life.

902
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:32,068
So, how old are you now?

903
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:33,965
Twenty-seven? Twenty-eight?

904
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,206
Twenty-eight.

905
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:38,931
Wow, I'm 56.

906
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:44,827
It's taken me 35 years
to get all that I have.

907
01:01:44,862 --> 01:01:49,068
There's so much about you
that reminds me of myself.

908
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:52,172
You fierce, no-nonsense shark.

909
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:54,137
Knows what to do.

910
01:01:54,172 --> 01:01:56,275
All work and no play.

911
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,862
That's why you're
gonna rule the world.

912
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:02,034
But look around.

913
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:04,344
See all these losers.

914
01:02:04,379 --> 01:02:08,034
They'll always
just be employees.

915
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:10,241
But not you and me.

916
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:13,275
We show up.
We do good.

917
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:16,965
We pretend to care.

918
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,827
But these losers?

919
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:24,172
They choose families
and husbands and wives.

920
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,068
But you and I?

921
01:02:26,103 --> 01:02:28,448
We choose success.

922
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:32,517
And that's why we
will never lose.

923
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:36,344
But Rachel, on the
other hand, hm...

924
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:38,310
she's got a choice to make.

925
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:40,931
Gorgeous!

926
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,137
So pretty.

927
01:02:43,172 --> 01:02:45,206
Or we make it for her.

928
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:49,000
Amazing Christmas party.

929
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:51,482
Oh! Thank you so much
for the wedding gift.

930
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,206
Brian and I are so appreciative.

931
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,241
Uh, excuse me, ladies.

932
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:58,034
I'll, uh... I'll let you mingle.

933
01:03:02,103 --> 01:03:04,137
Thank you so much
for bringing me over.

934
01:03:04,172 --> 01:03:07,034
I won't let you down.

935
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:08,931
I know you won't.

936
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,448
We're all packed.

937
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:14,034
I'm so excited for our
honeymoon to Paris!

938
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:16,241
About that. I, um...

939
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,275
I need you to push that back.

940
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,931
It's not a good time.

941
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:22,000
I need you here.

942
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:24,413
Okay.

943
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:26,000
I'll let Brian know.

944
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:27,517
Good.

945
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:36,862
Oh no.

946
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:05,551
Well...

947
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:08,137
I guess it's only
me and you now.

948
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:14,482
Thank you for letting
me barge in on you like this.

949
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,517
I know it was last minute.

950
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,206
Girl, it's no problem.

951
01:05:18,241 --> 01:05:20,482
That's what friends are for.

952
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,586
Oh, one moment.
That's my son.

953
01:05:26,206 --> 01:05:28,034
Hey, little man!

954
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:29,724
Mm!

955
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:31,000
Hi, Mom.

956
01:05:31,034 --> 01:05:32,551
I have a surprise for you.

957
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:35,034
Oh, you've got him
spoiled, you know that?

958
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:37,034
Please, nothing else
before Christmas.

959
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:39,551
Aw, Mom, it's still
Christmas season.

960
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:42,379
RJ, it's in three days.

961
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:45,000
I packed him some extra clothes.

962
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:46,344
Thank you.

963
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:49,034
And I was thinking, um...

964
01:05:49,068 --> 01:05:51,551
Maybe I could start
bringing him to school.

965
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:53,034
You know, he was
so upset last week.

966
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:55,551
And maybe it would
be a little bit...

967
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:59,448
Gina, I'm his mom.

968
01:05:59,482 --> 01:06:02,413
I know. I know.

969
01:06:02,448 --> 01:06:06,275
It was just a suggestion.

970
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,620
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

971
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:13,103
Okay, babe.
See you later, okay?

972
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:15,379
Thank you.

973
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:18,517
Just... think about it.

974
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,517
I will.

975
01:06:20,551 --> 01:06:22,241
Okay.
Bye bye, sweetheart.

976
01:06:22,275 --> 01:06:23,172
See you soon.

977
01:06:23,206 --> 01:06:24,562
All right, you ready
for the surprise?

978
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,137
Let's go!

979
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:33,586
This is Mercedes.

980
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,068
Hi, nice to meet you.

981
01:06:36,103 --> 01:06:37,448
How are you?

982
01:06:37,482 --> 01:06:39,620
You're a handsome young man.

983
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:40,793
Are you hungry?

984
01:06:40,827 --> 01:06:42,517
No, ma'am.
I already ate.

985
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:45,034
- Okay.
- Can I go play some Xbox?

986
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,344
Not for long.
You heard what Gina said.

987
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,206
And not until you're finished
with your reading assignment.

988
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:51,551
I hate reading.

989
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:54,344
Okay, okay, how about this?

990
01:06:54,379 --> 01:06:57,448
Once I'm done here, I'll come
and we'll read it together.

991
01:06:57,482 --> 01:06:59,206
Thanks.

992
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:00,379
Deal.

993
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:02,344
Okay, I'll see you later.

994
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,310
Bye.

995
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:06,379
He is something else.

996
01:07:06,413 --> 01:07:08,137
He's adorable.

997
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:09,827
I put him through so
much, but thankfully,

998
01:07:09,862 --> 01:07:11,620
he hardly remembers it.

999
01:07:11,655 --> 01:07:14,241
He just knows he
has two mommies.

1000
01:07:14,275 --> 01:07:16,137
What happened?

1001
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:21,206
I lost custody of him
when he was three.

1002
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:25,482
I was in the streets...
Drugs, living the fast life.

1003
01:07:25,517 --> 01:07:30,275
And one day, I woke up and
left him alone for two days.

1004
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:34,517
I tried to get clean after that,
but I couldn't forgive myself.

1005
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,655
I missed him so much.

1006
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:42,620
Then I got the job at Morgan's,
and I finally got clean.

1007
01:07:42,655 --> 01:07:44,655
He's my world.

1008
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:48,586
I just wanna be there for him.

1009
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,379
I'm so sorry.

1010
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:52,275
Girl, I'm strong.

1011
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,689
It's one thing to
throw insults my way.

1012
01:07:54,724 --> 01:07:56,344
But I hate it when
they do it to him.

1013
01:07:56,379 --> 01:07:58,620
He's too sensitive.

1014
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:00,379
He'll be tough, though.

1015
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:01,413
He's just like his momma.

1016
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:05,448
But enough about me.

1017
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:08,724
I know you didn't come
all this way for that.

1018
01:08:08,758 --> 01:08:10,517
Talk to me.

1019
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:12,758
I'm worried about you.

1020
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:19,862
Well, I know this might
sound... crazy, but...

1021
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:24,793
I'm living in an
alternate reality.

1022
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:30,793
Like... what do you mean?

1023
01:08:30,827 --> 01:08:35,517
Just two days ago, I was
married with two kids.

1024
01:08:35,551 --> 01:08:37,793
My parents were alive.

1025
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:43,689
And... yesterday, I woke up next
to a man I had never met before.

1026
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:47,551
I have no kids,
no family, no life.

1027
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:52,275
And I run the largest
company in the country.

1028
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,206
I have everything
anyone could ever want.

1029
01:08:55,241 --> 01:08:58,517
But at the same
time, I have nothing.

1030
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,172
I know I sound crazy.

1031
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:04,965
Kind of, but girl,
in my line of business,

1032
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,827
I've heard stranger things.

1033
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:10,689
Were you at any
parties recently?

1034
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:12,172
Maybe you were drugged.

1035
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:19,344
This is gonna sound
ridiculous, but...

1036
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:21,310
I made a wish.

1037
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:22,448
A wish?

1038
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:24,965
Yeah.

1039
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,758
I didn't think it would
come true, but it did.

1040
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:31,379
And now I'm living
in her reality.

1041
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:32,724
Whose reality?

1042
01:09:32,758 --> 01:09:35,517
Mercedes.

1043
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:37,655
Aren't you Mercedes?

1044
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:40,827
Yeah, kind of, but it's just...

1045
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:43,724
You know what, girl?
I'm here for you.

1046
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:45,896
Whatever you need.

1047
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:49,620
Thank you.
Oh my god...

1048
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:19,827
The grieving process
is never easy.

1049
01:10:19,862 --> 01:10:22,448
It's one day at a time.

1050
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:26,586
And don't let anyone put
a timetable on your grief.

1051
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,413
Okay?

1052
01:10:28,448 --> 01:10:29,862
Now, continue.

1053
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:33,275
I wanna hear more
about this dream.

1054
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:38,655
Well, I was back home,
in Fort Worth.

1055
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:42,896
And, uh, Wolf and Francis
and I would pick berries

1056
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:44,931
in our back pasture.

1057
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:48,689
And while back
there, I saw Puffy,

1058
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:51,275
just sitting there,
staring at me.

1059
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,310
And I run up to him,
and I was saying,

1060
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:58,689
"Puffy, it's me! It's Mommy!
Don't you recognize me?"

1061
01:10:58,724 --> 01:11:00,827
He was just keep backing up,

1062
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:03,034
like he didn't even
know who I was!

1063
01:11:03,068 --> 01:11:05,034
And I was running after him,

1064
01:11:05,068 --> 01:11:09,000
and I was crying and
calling after him, and...

1065
01:11:09,034 --> 01:11:11,655
"Puffy, it's me! It's Mommy!"

1066
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:14,655
Just... you know what?

1067
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,758
Uh, can we take five?
Uh, let me...

1068
01:11:24,793 --> 01:11:26,033
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1069
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,862
Girl, what's wrong with you?

1070
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,379
What has gotten into you?
You can't be seen with her.

1071
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:45,034
It's bad for the
Mercedes Johnson brand.

1072
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:47,724
We have a huge network
TV interview in two days

1073
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:50,724
all about this merger, okay?

1074
01:11:50,758 --> 01:11:52,044
- You chose Christmas Eve.
- I know.

1075
01:11:52,068 --> 01:11:53,931
You hired me for a reason.

1076
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:57,482
Now, I'm telling you
this needs to stop now.

1077
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:59,734
Sitting in your office is one
of our highest-paying clients.

1078
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:02,758
I do not need to tell you that
she owns half of this town.

1079
01:12:02,793 --> 01:12:04,448
Your friend is embarrassing us.

1080
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:06,551
Rachel, I know.

1081
01:12:06,586 --> 01:12:09,551
Just give me a
couple minutes, okay?

1082
01:12:09,586 --> 01:12:11,000
Five.

1083
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,379
Girl, I was...

1084
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1085
01:12:15,862 --> 01:12:18,034
Listen, this is
my business, okay?

1086
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:21,586
And everybody might
not understand.

1087
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,931
Well, I'm sorry.

1088
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:24,862
This is me.

1089
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:26,827
You know what?
Never mind.

1090
01:12:26,862 --> 01:12:28,379
Okay, look, look, look.

1091
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:29,803
I'm under a lot of
stress right now, okay?

1092
01:12:29,827 --> 01:12:31,344
I went to sleep somewhere

1093
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:32,665
and I don't even remember
how I got there.

1094
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:35,344
So just be patient with me.

1095
01:12:35,379 --> 01:12:37,413
That's why I stopped
by to check on you.

1096
01:12:37,448 --> 01:12:40,931
Because of my son, and me
being so overprotective,

1097
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,896
I always keep my cameras going.

1098
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:46,758
I saw this last night.

1099
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:56,965
Oh my...

1100
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,758
You didn't even say goodbye.

1101
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:01,000
I was worried sick.

1102
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:04,689
I don't even
remember doing that.

1103
01:13:04,724 --> 01:13:07,068
Are you sure in a position
to be counseling...

1104
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:09,965
Mercedes, time's up.

1105
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,068
I can't even deal
with this right now.

1106
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:17,655
It's about time.

1107
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:19,182
Miss Johnson, do you want
her banned from the building?

1108
01:13:19,206 --> 01:13:21,034
- Yes, please.
- Come on...

1109
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,665
You better get your
damn hands off of me.

1110
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,113
- I'm going!
- Let's go. Get up out of here.

1111
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:25,551
Listen, you ain't nothin'

1112
01:13:25,586 --> 01:13:27,655
but a two-bit cop, okay?
I'm going...

Don't worry, this is gonna
be a smooth interview.

1140
01:17:57,448 --> 01:18:00,379
We're on in three, two...

1141
01:18:00,413 --> 01:18:02,310
Hello, everyone, and
Merry Christmas Eve.

1142
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,310
It's your girl, Valerie Jenkins,

1143
01:18:04,344 --> 01:18:07,379
and I'm coming live from the
office of Mercedes Johnson

1144
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:09,103
Marriage and Family Enterprise.

1145
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:10,965
Now, we're gonna be
discussing everything

1146
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,137
from the empire that she
built to the new merger.

1147
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:17,793
But first up, it's an
honor to finally meet you.

1148
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:19,000
Likewise!

1149
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:20,034
How are you?

1150
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:21,103
Blessed, we're blessed.

1151
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:22,862
That you are.

1152
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:25,172
You are truly a woman
that wears so many hats,

1153
01:18:25,206 --> 01:18:27,896
and always working!

1154
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:29,872
Now, I understand you're even
working tomorrow on Christmas,

1155
01:18:29,896 --> 01:18:31,310
correct?

1156
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:33,103
Look, people always need help,

1157
01:18:33,137 --> 01:18:36,344
especially around the
holidays, for many reasons.

1158
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:38,827
What are some of those reasons?

1159
01:18:38,862 --> 01:18:41,827
I would say our first
priority reason is loneliness,

1160
01:18:41,862 --> 01:18:44,310
which is why we make
ourselves available 24/7.

1161
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,965
An angel too?

1162
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,931
Amazing.

1163
01:18:47,965 --> 01:18:50,896
Now, in addition to being a
Fortune 500, you know, mogul

1164
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:52,896
that you are, you're
doing a merger

1165
01:18:52,931 --> 01:18:55,000
with a social payment
application called

1166
01:18:55,034 --> 01:18:56,758
the Black Money App.

1167
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:58,251
But this type of partnership
with a company like yours

1168
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,862
is... new.

1169
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:02,034
Yes, it is.

1170
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:06,000
Um, our desires aligned in
wanting to give back and...

1171
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:10,103
And provide healthier and
safer, uh, communities.

1172
01:19:10,137 --> 01:19:14,137
There's so much mental illness
in under-served communities.

1173
01:19:14,172 --> 01:19:17,965
And a simple conversation can
make a world of difference,

1174
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,586
which is why I am super
excited about this merge.

1175
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,517
Um, we're gonna create
an app that will allow us

1176
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,103
to be available 24/7.

1177
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:27,827
Sounds amazing.

1178
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,896
And with every transaction,

1179
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:33,586
um, a percentage will go back
to under-served communities

1180
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:36,517
in building educational
outreach programs,

1181
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:39,068
uh, hospitals,
community centers,

1182
01:19:39,103 --> 01:19:40,241
whatever it takes.

1183
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,482
So there you have it.

1184
01:19:41,517 --> 01:19:43,310
And you heard it here first.

1185
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:45,517
Black Money App,
Mercedes Johnson,

1186
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:48,068
a powerhouse merger
changing the future

1187
01:19:48,103 --> 01:19:49,206
and setting the standard?

1188
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:51,068
Okay.

1189
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:53,517
Now, when you're not
saving the world,

1190
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:56,551
what do you do to
take care of you?

1191
01:19:56,586 --> 01:19:58,493
I mean, I'm sure everybody's
dying to have you over

1192
01:19:58,517 --> 01:20:01,379
for the holidays.

1193
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:03,068
Actually, it's the opposite.

1194
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:05,344
I don't buy that.

1195
01:20:05,379 --> 01:20:11,068
I have a brave and
courageous friend...

1196
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:15,241
who has taught me...

1197
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:18,379
what being a true friend
really is.

1198
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:25,896
My selfishness...

1199
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:28,413
kept revealing
how undeserving I am.

1200
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:34,275
But her kindness made me see.

1201
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:40,379
Candy, if you are watching...

1202
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:46,896
I am so sorry.

1203
01:20:48,586 --> 01:20:50,482
Well, I hope she is watching.

1204
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:52,931
She sounds like
an amazing friend.

1205
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:54,310
She is.

1206
01:20:54,344 --> 01:20:56,068
Thank you again.

1207
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:57,931
Mercedes Johnson.

1208
01:20:57,965 --> 01:20:59,241
And cut!

1209
01:20:59,275 --> 01:21:01,620
What was that?

1210
01:21:01,655 --> 01:21:04,413
Are you kidding me?
Can she stay on script?

1211
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:06,241
- My job.
- Are you kidding me?

1212
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:07,379
Can you stay on script?

1213
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:09,413
Oh my god!

1214
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:12,620
Where are you going?

1215
01:21:12,655 --> 01:21:15,310
Are you trying to
throw this all away?

1216
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:16,620
I get it.

1217
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:18,517
I get it that you suddenly care.

1218
01:21:18,551 --> 01:21:22,103
But let's not lose sight
of why we are here.

1219
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:23,631
The person I know
doesn't care for anybody,

1220
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:25,344
just the goal that's
in front of her.

1221
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:27,655
That's what you taught me!

1222
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:30,241
Now, I need you to
get back in there!

1223
01:21:30,275 --> 01:21:32,310
I taught you wrong.

1224
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,379
You're supposed to care.

1225
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:36,965
You're supposed to have a heart.

1226
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,241
Look, I made some
terrible decisions.

1227
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:43,000
And now look at me.

1228
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:44,206
I'm alone.

1229
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:48,310
We just closed one of the
biggest mergers in history!

1230
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:52,068
Either you get it together,
get your head in the game,

1231
01:21:52,103 --> 01:21:57,034
or... or I go to James and
the rest of the board.

1232
01:21:57,068 --> 01:21:59,172
Let them know there's
no more room for you here.

1233
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:03,103
Enough is enough, Rachel.

1234
01:22:03,137 --> 01:22:05,965
You're fired.

1235
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,655
Are you kidding me?
You can't fire me!

1236
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:12,103
I helped build this company!

1237
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:14,068
I just did.

1238
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:31,344
Hey.

1239
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:34,034
I was on my way to you.

1240
01:22:34,068 --> 01:22:36,413
Girl, after hearing you
blast me all over TV,

1241
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:39,034
I said, forget the anger.

1242
01:22:39,068 --> 01:22:41,034
I forgive you.

1243
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:45,482
No one has ever done
anything like that for me.

1244
01:22:45,517 --> 01:22:48,379
And I meant every word.

1245
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:51,137
Thank you for opening my eyes.

1246
01:22:51,172 --> 01:22:54,172
And for being such
an amazing person.

1247
01:22:54,206 --> 01:22:55,551
And an amazing mom.

1248
01:22:58,413 --> 01:23:00,413
Stop it.

1249
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:01,448
You're gonna make me cry.

1250
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:05,275
You already crying.

1251
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,310
Let's go get some drinks.

1252
01:23:06,344 --> 01:23:09,275
Oh yes, girl, please.

1253
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:10,448
I need a nice cold one.

1254
01:23:10,482 --> 01:23:11,758
I need a keg.

Listen, Matthew.

I don't know what's

- Woman, hold on a second,

01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,448
'cause I don't know what
you're talking about.

1277
01:25:04,482 --> 01:25:06,689
I don't know what's
going on in your mind.

1278
01:25:06,724 --> 01:25:08,931
I'm trying to be polite,
but I think you need to leave.

1279
01:25:08,965 --> 01:25:11,310
This is harassment, okay?

1280
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:13,275
And disrespectful to my
wife, so can you leave?

1281
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,241
I am your wife!

1282
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,241
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, okay?

1283
01:25:16,275 --> 01:25:18,551
Look, if you would just

I promise you.

1286
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:22,896
I'm gonna ask you
one more time to leave.

1287
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:23,896
Please, I'm trying
to be polite, here.

1288
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:26,275
- I'm trying to be polite.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1289
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:29,137
- It's okay, I'm handling things.
- What is she doing here?

1290
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:33,206
- What are you doing here?
- Lady, who are you?

1291
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:35,827
Stay away from my husband.
Stay away from my family.

1292
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:37,448
Your husband?
What is she talking about?

1293
01:25:37,482 --> 01:25:39,206
- You need to leave.
- This woman's crazy!

1294
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:41,344
- She is insane.
- You need to leave.

1295
01:25:41,379 --> 01:25:42,941
- Call the police, please.
- We are calling the police.

1296
01:25:42,965 --> 01:25:44,586
I already called the police!

1297
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,206
We'll just go, okay?

1298
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:48,896
We need to press charges.
Get her now!

1299
01:25:48,931 --> 01:25:50,827
It's okay, it's okay.

1300
01:25:52,448 --> 01:25:53,862

01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,931
I was wrong.

1305
01:26:35,965 --> 01:26:37,724
But I need you to help me.

1306
01:26:37,758 --> 01:26:39,758
Please.

1307

1308
01:26:42,793 --> 01:26:45,344
I can't lose my husband.
Please.

1309
01:26:45,379 --> 01:26:47,655
Just tell me what I need to
do and I'll do it, please!

1310
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:48,965
I've learned my lesson.

1311
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,379
I will never be the same again.

1312
01:26:51,413 --> 01:26:53,758
Please, David!

1313
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,965
I just wanna go home.

1314
01:26:58,862 --> 01:27:01,310
I just wanna go home.

1315
01:27:01,344 --> 01:27:03,620
I'll never be the same again.

1316
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:07,000
Oh, what have I done?

1317
01:27:10,379 --> 01:27:13,586
I've learned my lesson, please.

1318
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,724
What have I done?

1319
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:17,517
What have I done?

1320
01:27:21,517 --> 01:27:22,862
What have I...

1321
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:25,448
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

1322
01:27:25,482 --> 01:27:26,724
I'm sorry.

1323
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:28,517
Gotta cut you off.

1324
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:43,862
David?

1325
01:27:43,896 --> 01:27:47,517
- Um... where's David?
- Who?

1326
01:27:47,551 --> 01:27:48,951
The man that was
sitting right here?

1327
01:27:51,689 --> 01:27:53,896
You've been the only one
here most of the night.

1328
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:56,827
You've been pretty quiet.

1329
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,896
And 'cause tomorrow
is Christmas Eve,

1330
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:01,724
I'm gonna shut it off.

1331
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:04,310
Um, I lost my wallet.

1332
01:28:07,758 --> 01:28:09,724
The stock market
has been the highest it's been

1333
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:16,448
Hey hey, this must be
the magic of Christmas.

1334
01:28:20,034 --> 01:28:22,068
Today marks the
10-year anniversary

1335
01:28:24,655 --> 01:28:27,310
a renowned and beloved
hometown surgeon

1336
01:28:30,379 --> 01:28:33,000
until a fatal car
crash claimed his life,

1337
01:28:34,655 --> 01:28:36,068
I remember this guy.

1338
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:37,862
I served him a couple of times.

1339
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:39,965
Really nice man.

1340
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,655
He did a hell of
a lot for the community.

1341
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:45,448
Sir, you are
gone, but never forgotten.

1342
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,793
Want me to call you a ride?

1343
01:28:50,827 --> 01:28:54,000
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

1344
01:28:55,827 --> 01:28:57,862
You got it.

1345
01:29:10,034 --> 01:29:12,965
My name is back.
Everything's back.

1346
01:29:33,517 --> 01:29:34,551
Germaine?

1347
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:37,000
Germaine?

1348
01:29:38,482 --> 01:29:39,551
Germaine?

1349
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:42,551
Where is he?
Germaine?

1350
01:29:48,068 --> 01:29:50,172
Germaine? Germai...

1351
01:29:50,206 --> 01:29:52,620
Woo, child!
Oh my god, fix it.

1352
01:29:52,655 --> 01:29:54,517
Jesus, girl,
we have to do something

1353
01:29:54,551 --> 01:29:56,413
about this storage area.
I can't do spiders.

1354
01:29:56,448 --> 01:29:57,872
I saw one so big,
I thought it was a tarantula.

1355
01:29:57,896 --> 01:29:59,103
Oh, get over here.

1356
01:29:59,137 --> 01:30:01,103
I'm so excited to see you!

1357
01:30:01,137 --> 01:30:03,482
Oh, I can kiss you!

1358
01:30:03,517 --> 01:30:05,896
What's gotten into you?
We just saw each other.

1359
01:30:05,931 --> 01:30:07,172
It feels like an eternity.

1360
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:10,137
- How are you?
- I'm okay, I guess.

1361
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:12,862
- How's Calvin?
- Waiting for me.

1362
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:15,034
We're gonna try to grab
a drink somewhere tonight,

1363
01:30:15,068 --> 01:30:18,172
whatever time that may be, since
Scrooge got me working tomorrow.

1364
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:22,068
Okay, what if I change that?

1365
01:30:22,103 --> 01:30:24,034
For tonight and tomorrow?

1366
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:25,482
What about your statements?

1367
01:30:25,517 --> 01:30:27,137
Well, who works on Christmas?

1368
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,000
And besides, my
statements can wait.

1369
01:30:30,034 --> 01:30:32,448
Thank you. Thank you.

1370
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:37,458
And since I can't give you
your Christmas gift tomorrow,

1371
01:30:37,482 --> 01:30:39,034
I wanna give it to you now.

1372
01:30:39,068 --> 01:30:40,689
I still have all six
of those blenders.

1373
01:30:40,724 --> 01:30:41,793
Please, not another one.

1374
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,034
It's not a blender.

1375
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:45,103
Look, I really appreciate you.

1376
01:30:45,137 --> 01:30:47,172
And on top of you being an
above-average employee...

1377
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:48,172
Mm-hmm.

1378
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:50,482
You are a really great friend.

1379
01:30:50,517 --> 01:30:53,517
And, uh, in addition to
me giving you a raise,

1380
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:55,482
I wanna give you a
two weeks' vacation,

1381
01:30:55,517 --> 01:30:57,689
with two airline tickets
for you and Calvin

1382
01:30:57,724 --> 01:31:00,655
on an all expenses-paid vacation
wherever you two wanna go.

1383
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:03,689
Woo-hoo! No way!

1384
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,034
- Way!
- No way!

1385
01:31:06,068 --> 01:31:08,068
I have to call Calvin right now.

1386
01:31:11,275 --> 01:31:12,862
- Hey, boo!
- Babe? Babe.

1387
01:31:14,793 --> 01:31:16,769
We are actually going to be
able to go away this year.

1388
01:31:16,793 --> 01:31:18,448
A getaway?

1389
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:21,000
Are you talking
about to your sister's?

1390
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,517
Merry Christmas, Germaine.

1391
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:52,206
Mommy!

1392
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:54,034
Hi!

1393
01:31:54,068 --> 01:31:56,586
Mommy, Mommy, look
what Daddy got us!

1394
01:31:59,551 --> 01:32:01,275
- Oh!
- Her name is Luna.

1395
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:04,000
Can we keep her, please, please?

1396
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:07,655
You can absolutely keep her.

1397
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:08,976
I probably
should've called you first,

1398
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,827
but everything happened so fast.

1399
01:32:10,862 --> 01:32:12,941
A random guy came to work.
He said he was leaving town.

1400
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:15,655
He asked if somebody
wanted to adopt a dog.

1401
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:18,827
I couldn't say no.
He was so cute. I thought...

1402
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:33,103
I'm sorry.

1403
01:32:34,034 --> 01:32:38,655
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1404
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:40,862
I thought I lost you and
I never want to lose you.

1405
01:32:40,896 --> 01:32:42,068
I love you so much.

1406
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:43,000
- Babe.
- I'm sorry.

1407
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:44,827
Relax.

1408
01:32:44,862 --> 01:32:48,758
Listen, slow down, okay?

1409
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:50,586
You never lost me.

1410
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,310
Never.

1411
01:32:52,344 --> 01:32:55,586
What did I tell you
on our wedding day?

1412
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,793
We're on this ride
together, right?

1413
01:32:57,827 --> 01:32:59,103
Yeah.

1414
01:32:59,137 --> 01:33:01,275
Til the end, no matter what.

1415
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,103
You're my wife.

1416
01:33:03,137 --> 01:33:05,206
- I love you.
- I love you.

1417
01:33:07,758 --> 01:33:09,137
To the end.

1418
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:12,344
I love you so much.

1419
01:33:13,965 --> 01:33:17,206
These last few days
have taught me so much.

1420
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:21,241
And I will never put anything
before our family again.

1421
01:33:24,413 --> 01:33:27,620
Mom, it's about
time you got here.

1422
01:33:27,655 --> 01:33:29,827
I was about to come
searching for you.

1423
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:31,724
Hi. Look at you.

1424
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:39,379
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1425
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:42,000
Mommy, we missed you so much!

1426
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:43,034
We were praying for you!

1427
01:33:43,068 --> 01:33:44,724
- You were?
- Yes.

1428
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:46,068
Okay, look.

1429
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:47,862
I love you guys so much.

1430
01:33:47,896 --> 01:33:49,172
You're my everything.

1431
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:52,172
And I will never allow anything
to come between us again, okay?

1432
01:33:52,206 --> 01:33:54,206
- Okay.
- All right?

1433
01:33:54,241 --> 01:33:56,896
- Thank you, Mommy.
- I love you.

1434
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:59,137
Mom.

1435
01:33:59,172 --> 01:34:00,724
Mom, are you okay?

1436
01:34:00,758 --> 01:34:02,137
Something's different about you.

1437
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:04,344
Yes, I'm perfect, baby.

1438
01:34:04,379 --> 01:34:08,034
I think our prayer worked.

1439
01:34:08,068 --> 01:34:09,827
Merry Christmas, baby.

1440
01:34:09,862 --> 01:34:11,448
Merry Christmas!

1441
01:34:11,482 --> 01:34:14,172
- Merry Christmas, Mommy.
- Merry Christmas, baby.

1446
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:27,068
Yes, the kids are
so excited, okay?

All right? Be careful!

1448

All right, talk to you later.
Love you. Bye.

1449
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:35,758
- How was she?
- Good, good.

1450
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:37,724

done a long time ago.

1451
01:34:40,068 --> 01:34:41,344
