1
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:05,647
Long ago, as the Americas lie untouched

2
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,970
and unblemished, travelers
from afar boarded grand vessels

3
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,335
and crossed choppy waters.

4
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:15,574
A merciless army of warriors
plundered the new world

5
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:18,241
and great ancient civilizations.

6
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:21,649
They were known as the conquistadors.

7
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,355
Proudly shipping their stolen
treasure back to their queen,

8
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:28,443
they were heralded as heroes
of Spain.

9
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:30,896
But greed knows no bounds.

10
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,315
A small group of
conquistadors decided

11
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,959
to steal the gold for themselves.

12
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,628
They sailed up the coast
to what is now California.

13
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:42,628
But mother nature had her own plans.

14
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,716
Only one soul survived
that torturous night,

15
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:49,318
a shrewd and cunning
conquistador named

16
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,485
Don Antonio Miguel Torres.

17
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,635
Aided by the natives, he hid
the fortune deep within a cave

18
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:59,214
in an uncharted mountain forest.

19
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:01,404
Even today,
few are willing to brave

20
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,083
this treacherous terrain,

21
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:07,577
fraught with natural
and unnatural pitfalls.

22
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:10,015
To help him find his way upon
his return,

23
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,914
Don Miguel made two maps,

24
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:15,309
one of parchment and one a medallion.

25
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,238
It told of the way through
the forest

26
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,245
and warned of booby-traps and curses.

27
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:23,274
Years later, he returned
to claim the riches.

28
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:27,521
Don Miguel was never heard or
seen again.

29
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,737
Time and again,
brave souls have searched

30
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:31,949
the cursed forest for the treasure,

31
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,140
none known to come out alive,

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,428
even as the town of Santa
Rosarita grew up from nothing,

33
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:41,454
prospered, and then fell
victim to economic hard times,

34
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:43,860
and all the while, the
fortune of gold lay hidden

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,527
in the woods beyond.

36
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:21,655
Woo.

37
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,323
Whoa.

38
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,505
Whoa.
Oh, oh, hey.

39
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,144
Whoa!

40
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:31,977
Oh, sorry!

41
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:42,085
Hey! Hey!

42
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,152
You darn kid!

43
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,746
You nearly scraped the paint!

44
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:48,819
What are you doing?

45
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,996
He nearly scraped the paint!
We gotta try to act natural.

46
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,954
We gotta try to fit in here, okay?

47
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,391
Okay, okay.
Be one of the locals.

48
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,264
Okay, okay.
You get me?

49
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,742
Okay.
Okay.

50
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,575
Come on.

51
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:01,715
Whoa!

52
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,028
Are you okay?

53
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:09,268
I think I'll live.

54
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,066
You should watch where
you're going with that thing.

55
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,594
You new in town?

56
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:16,879
I just moved in this week.

57
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,551
Look who we've got here.

58
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,053
What you got there, Peters?

59
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,230
More junk that mutt dug up?

60
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,848
None of your business what it is.

61
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:30,225
This kid's forever digging
up junk, him and that dog.

62
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,838
You'd think it'd be worth something,

63
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,015
the way he hordes around
old rocks and sticks.

64
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,379
But you know what, Peters?

65
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,379
It's not, just like you.

66
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,576
Just our local nobody!

67
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:44,176
Yeah, a local nobody.

68
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:48,295
Lost cause,
just like that mangy mutt!

69
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:49,460
Really?

70
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,249
You're in town less than a week

71
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,325
and you already hang out with Rachel?

72
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,158
Skip it, Peters!

73
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,603
You're a loser.

74
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,847
Always gonna be a loser.

75
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,155
And you're the last thing a girl

76
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,539
like that's gonna take a look at.

77
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,456
Right, Ana?

78
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,683
I said, right?

79
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,850
I don't know him well enough
to make a judgment like that.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,407
I'll take that!

81
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:16,240
Thank you.

82
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,584
What a loser.

83
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,251
So is that new girl.

84
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,369
Mr. Peters,
I think you got it all wrong.

85
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,835
No, Sir, you do.

86
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,304
Okay, a big mega center like
Ultra-Mart comes to town,

87
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:33,382
the first thing that happens
is all

88
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:34,782
the local businesses die.

89
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,116
The town dies, Mr. James.

90
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,999
The town is already dying.

91
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,144
I'm trying to save it.

92
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:40,713
I'm not trying to destroy
anything here,

93
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:43,408
that's why I think I'm
making a very generous offer.

94
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,420
Right, to buy me out.

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,605
Changes my slow death to murder,
wouldn't you say?

96
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:52,349
How many other towns have
you killed, Mr. James?

97
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,924
I'm gonna need your answer
by the end of the week,

98
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:58,274
so I just, do me a favor and
be smart about it, all right?

99
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,002
My answer's no.

100
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,734
Think about it. Hey!

101
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:02,817
Who loves ya!

102
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:10,196
All right.

103
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,815
Hey bud.

104
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,599
Ultra-Mart guy again?

105
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,432
Yep.

106
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,864
The store this guy wants to
build is gonna kill this town.

107
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,406
He thinks buying me out
is gonna fix everything.

108
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,226
Well, wouldn't it?

109
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:34,369
Wouldn't even cover what
I owe on a small business loan.

110
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:37,275
Listen, Josh, if we're
gonna stand our ground,

111
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:40,445
gonna need to cut back
on a few things, okay?

112
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:41,639
Your mum's over at your grandmother's.

113
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,551
She talked about us moving
in with her for a while,

114
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,789
just until we get back on our feet.

115
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,372
But Grandma lives in a condo.

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,233
They don't allow pets.

117
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,553
We are gonna make
some sacrifices, right?

118
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,386
Hm?

119
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,872
Come on, Bosco.

120
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:04,297
I won't let anything happen
to you.

121
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:05,547
You'll be okay.

122
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:08,411
I promise.

123
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,356
Say, you fellas wouldn't
happen to have

124
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:33,270
a hammer I could borrow,
would ya?

125
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,732
Stay calm, act natural.

126
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,881
No, no, sorry, Officer,
we got no hammer!

127
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,204
Oh, no, wait a minute.

128
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,454
We got a hammer right here!

129
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,587
Thank you.

130
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,144
Yeah.

131
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:46,977
What?

132
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,193
Hey, hold up, boys.

133
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,777
I'll get this hammer
back to you right quick.

134
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:09,490
Oh, no, no, no, we don't need it!

135
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,604
We don't need it, okay?

136
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,137
We got so many hammers!

137
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:14,387
(Mumbling)

138
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,806
Come on, Bosco, let's go.

139
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,669
Let's get outta here.

140
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,394
Bosco, just quit it.

141
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,311
What's the use anyways?

142
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,321
What's this?

143
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:09,747
Couldn't be.

144
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,822
Did you see that?

145
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,012
Oh my.

146
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:20,429
Boy, I think you finally
found something!

147
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,679
Let's go show Dad, come on!

148
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,316
Look, things are just a
little bit tough right now.

149
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:32,863
I'm doing the best that I can.

150
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,203
I'm not asking you for anything.

151
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,082
I'm asking for a couple more days.

152
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,447
I understand.
Dad, look what Bosco found!

153
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:38,290
Dad!

154
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,026
Listen, listen, my son
just walked in, I need to go.

155
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:42,194
I'll take care of the money,
don't worry.

156
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,434
Dad, look, look!

157
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:45,630
You guys are all riled up, huh?

158
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,463
What's going on?

159
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,835
Well, I was out with Bosco

160
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,535
and he started digging up
some stuff.

161
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:50,456
Digging up?

162
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,901
Digging up where?

163
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,842
Mrs. Vandiver's?

164
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,179
No, no, no, no.
No?

165
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,035
The Ultra-Mart construction site.

166
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:56,868
Okay.

167
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,535
And so he dug up this thing.

168
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,773
It's really cool.

169
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,023
Let's see it.

170
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,155
It's pretty cool.
Cool?

171
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,482
Dad, I think this might be
the conquistador's medallion.

172
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,561
You remember, I did a
report on it last year.

173
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,916
The legend is that a
conquistador named Don Michael,

174
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:19,379
or something like that, he
made a medallion out of gold.

175
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,547
Maybe this is our chance
to save our house,

176
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:23,963
the town, and then I can keep Bosco.

177
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:27,713
Come here, let me take
a closer look at it.

178
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,769
What do you think?
What do you think?

179
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,245
I don't think this is it,
Josh, I'm sorry.

180
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,731
Look, it's made of tin.

181
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,375
Okay, this isn't gold.

182
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,765
It's probably some kid's
old toy he threw away.

183
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:49,782
It's pretty cool-looking though.

184
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,615
Dad, you don't think that maybe,

185
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,181
anyway possible it's..

186
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,014
Josh.

187
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,616
Come on.

188
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,160
It isn't fair.

189
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,587
I know.

190
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:06,420
I know.

191
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:10,272
Now look, when you grow up,

192
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:11,880
you'll learn that there's
a heck of a lot of things

193
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,021
in this world that aren't fair,

194
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:17,142
and you can't dwell on those
things that you can't control.

195
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:17,975
Right?

196
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,847
Stay focused on the future.

197
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,456
Sometimes, that means
you take a step backwards

198
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,749
before you can take two steps forwards.

199
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:26,999
You understand?

200
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,493
And Bosco, he needs you to
stay strong right now, right?

201
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,399
Nobody needs to see their
best friend all sad.

202
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,369
Now you cheer up.

203
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:41,182
I just thought that if we
were to find the treasure,

204
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:43,175
then everything would go back
to normal,

205
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:45,232
the way it was before all
this happened.

206
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,526
Hey.

207
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:49,740
You don't think I'd love
a treasure right now?

208
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,551
Look, I gotta focus on you,
your mom, and our future.

209
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,482
All right, this is the time

210
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:55,813
when you focus on what's most important,

211
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,639
that's family and, Josh,
that's my treasure.

212
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,967
Well, then what about Bosco?

213
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,143
He's part of the family too.

214
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,267
I'm sorry, buddy.

215
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:12,844
Look, they're gonna take good
care of him, I promise you.

216
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:13,677
All right?

217
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:20,759
Hey Josh,
I don't want you out there

218
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,861
in the woods doing any
treasure hunting.

219
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,168
Okay, they're not safe.

220
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,751
They're off limits.

221
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,704
Josh, okay?

222
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,084
Okay.

223
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,690
Let's go, Bosco.

224
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,489
Make sure you're back for lunch.

225
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,656
Hey, I'll see you back here
for lunch?

226
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,834
It's got potential.

227
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,703
Ha, potential!

228
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:49,407
It's a ground with potential.

229
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,374
I like the way you think, Professor.

230
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,455
That's what's good about you.

231
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,042
I know!
You're always thinking..

232
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,441
Hey.
Hey, you okay, Sir?

233
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,688
Here you are, young fella.

234
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:06,241
What are you do, oh,
what you got there, kid?

235
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,612
Just something I found.

236
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,088
Oh, really?

237
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,329
Well, that's what we do too.

238
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:12,137
We find things.

239
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:13,825
We're artifact collectors.

240
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,757
Collect, that's what we do!

241
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:17,722
Big ones!
Oh, yeah, they're giant.

242
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,943
We'd be happy to give
you something for that.

243
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,864
We got a little something,
little cash.

244
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:24,562
Come on, we have, well,

245
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,817
how about if we pay ya
next time we see ya?

246
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:27,650
I mean, you could just..

247
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,400
I don't want a layaway program.

248
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,036
Well, how about some of that
old time,

249
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,369
small town charm, sonny boy?

250
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,638
Come on, Bosco, Bosco!

251
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:40,708
Whoa!

252
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,111
Professor!
What?

253
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,169
Let him go!

254
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,794
Yeah, but that was the..

255
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:48,317
That was ours if you hadn't
given back to him, you moron!

256
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:49,465
But you said I was supposed

257
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,743
to be natural!
Well, of course be natural!

258
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:51,808
He dropped it, I picked it up!

259
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:53,687
What's more natural?
But you don't jump a kid

260
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,187
in broad daylight!

261
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,076
You gotta be smart.

262
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,065
Smart.

263
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:00,893
Smart!

264
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:03,879
Smart, yeah, smart, use it,
use your noggin!

265
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,712
Use it!
I'll use it!

266
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:05,545
Use your noggin!

267
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,495
Watch me!

268
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,770
Oh, don't worry!
I'll get smart!

269
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,986
I'm your number one fan.

270
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:11,547
I'll show you smart.
I'm your number one.

271
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,700
Let's not let him get it out
of our sight!

272
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,922
Oh, not me, Boss.

273
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,171
He's not gonna get by me!

274
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,509
Hey, wait.

275
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:40,814
Look.

276
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,594
Watch out, Bosco, I'm on your tail!

277
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,155
Do you suppose he's..
No, no, no, no, no.

278
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,716
Don't be a moron!

279
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:49,549
He's a kid.

280
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,838
He doesn't know what that is!

281
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,177
Oh, okay.
Not like you!

282
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:54,318
You look like a kid!

283
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,756
Thanks!
You do look like a kid.

284
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:58,584
It's clean living.
Ah, oh, it is, isn't it?

285
00:14:58,584 --> 00:14:59,469
May I clean liver?

286
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,077
Oh, thank you, whoa!

287
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,922
It's all right!

288
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:10,356
No need for apologies.

289
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,023
I'll walk from here.

290
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:29,174
Bosco?

291
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:32,341
So what were you doing in the woods?

292
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:37,015
Running away.

293
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:39,266
Why, I mean, you've got everything.

294
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,266
You're rich.

295
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,504
You wouldn't understand.

296
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:46,337
Look, you know these woods, right?

297
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:48,378
Yeah.

298
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,888
Well, can you help me
get to the other side,

299
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,742
I mean, to get to the bus station?

300
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:56,659
Bus station, where are you going?

301
00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:00,489
Back to Texas to stay with
my mom.

302
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,322
But could you help me?

303
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,001
Please?

304
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,513
Sure.

305
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:14,895
What's all this?

306
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,708
Just junk Bosco digs up.

307
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,802
You wanna know how many
holes I've had to refill

308
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,103
to keep him from going to the pound?

309
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,274
How many?

310
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,441
I don't know, but a lot.

311
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,431
You know what though?

312
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,140
Probably doesn't matter.

313
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,648
Looks like I'm moving and
I can't take him with me.

314
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,499
I know all about that.

315
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:39,462
About what?

316
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,437
About moving.

317
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,393
We do it every couple of years.

318
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:47,019
Every time Ultra-Mart moves
to a new city and they build,

319
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,793
well, they send my dad to
over see the transition.

320
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:52,644
And all the people living
there hate us for it

321
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,681
because they think we're
taking over.

322
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,490
It's just not true.

323
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,298
Well, aren't you?

324
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:00,472
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:04,818
Just try to live a normal life,
just be a normal kid.

326
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,151
So that's why.

327
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,235
That's why.

328
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,017
Do you surf?

329
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:13,844
Whoa, is that you in the picture?

330
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:15,811
Hey!

331
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,025
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,942
Don't worry about it.

333
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,482
What is that?

334
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Looks like a tree.

335
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,016
It's in Spanish.

336
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,911
How would you know that?

337
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,451
Private school.

338
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:43,284
Figures.

339
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:48,894
He who carries this
gold medallion should have

340
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:50,394
the riches of man.

341
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,924
From the hidden vantage point of..

342
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,341
Wait, hidden vantage point?

343
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:03,284
A look to the west and you'll
find the arms of the earth

344
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:06,284
in the riches of the
skeleton's eye.

345
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:12,635
Snakes, huh?

346
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,457
You know about this?

347
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:18,602
The legend of the
conquistador's gold.

348
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,519
Okay, well,

349
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:24,304
supposedly, the
conquistadors hid a fortune

350
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,443
in these parts about a
zillion years ago.

351
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:30,265
They used markings on gold medallions

352
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,083
to tell where they hid the treasure,

353
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,705
and then, booby-trapped
the secret trail to it.

354
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:40,538
But the story is,
one conquistador got greedy,

355
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:45,886
ran off with the medallion and
kept the location to himself.

356
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,546
Poor guy got disoriented by
his own curse,

357
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:14,713
fell victim to his own trap,
never claimed the gold.

358
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:19,145
But it's out there, somewhere.

359
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,238
Sounds like a crock to me.

360
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:28,145
Well, believe what you want.

361
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,813
You wouldn't be the first skeptic.

362
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:32,997
I mean, no one's actually
ever found the trail,

363
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,580
much less the gold.

364
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,008
Except Colt Black.

365
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,892
All right, well, Colt Black
was the meanest outlaw

366
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,225
in the old west.

367
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,633
Started robbing banks in Kansas.

368
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,439
Eventually, ended up here in California.

369
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,874
He came across the
conquistador's remains

370
00:19:57,874 --> 00:20:00,609
and the gold medallion.

371
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:03,681
Now, being the adventurer
that Colt Black is,

372
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:07,050
he couldn't pass up a challenge,

373
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,460
so he goes off looking
for the secret gold.

374
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,543
But Sheriff Joe Denton,

375
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:17,083
wait, you know who Sheriff
Joe Denton is, right?

376
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,223
Sorry.

377
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:21,092
Well, okay,
Sheriff Joe Denton is like

378
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,425
a legendary old west lawman.

379
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:29,158
Anyway, Denton tracks Colt
Black somewhere nearby

380
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:30,896
before he could find the gold.

381
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,848
The outlaw knew someone
would try to, you know,

382
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,671
take the gold out from under him,

383
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,774
so he shot the medallion into
three pieces

384
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:39,780
and buried them all around.

385
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,446
So Denton put him behind bars,

386
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:44,897
but eventually,
Colt Black busted out,

387
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,922
went searching for the medallion.

388
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:49,081
Did he find it?

389
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,945
Legend is that he found one piece,

390
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,236
but couldn't find the others.

391
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:58,403
Went searching for the gold
anyway, never heard from again.

392
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,952
And this is one of the pieces?

393
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:07,285
Sure looks like it.

394
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,925
You're going to go after
that gold, aren't you?

395
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,124
You told me you'd take
me to the bus station.

396
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,541
Well, that'll have to wait.

397
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,109
If I can find that treasure,

398
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,130
I could save my house and my dog.

399
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,191
Look, what if this piece

400
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:32,358
of medallion leads you to
other clues?

401
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,004
What if you find Colt Black

402
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:37,503
and you find the other
piece of the medallion?

403
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,251
Well then, I'll be that much closer

404
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,251
to finding the treasure.

405
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,640
This is in Spanish.

406
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:47,755
How are you gonna decipher
these clues without me?

407
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:50,066
Are you my Spanish teacher now?

408
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:50,899
Huh?

409
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:51,732
No.

410
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:55,608
I'm you compadre.

411
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,117
Compadre?

412
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,661
What is that, my sidekick?

413
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,913
Not exactly.

414
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:06,570
Look, I don't need a sidekick.

415
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,822
What do you call him?

416
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:08,833
Bosco?

417
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,677
Yeah.
He's my partner.

418
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:14,344
Well then, now you've got two.

419
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:17,692
Look, no offense..

420
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:19,972
Ugh, has anyone ever said
"No offense"

421
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,176
without it really being
offensive, Josh?

422
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,343
Look, all I know is that

423
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:28,787
this journey is gonna
test a man's resolve.

424
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:29,881
What?

425
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,317
Is this about me being a girl?

426
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,504
No, I didn't mean it like that.

427
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:36,094
Good, because I don't
know if you know it or not,

428
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:39,177
but this is not the old west anymore.

429
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:42,111
Come on, Bosco.

430
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:58,130
Now, rumor has it that Colt
Black's ghost returns daily

431
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,655
in search for the gold.

432
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:02,781
Stop trying to spook me out.

433
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,781
Hey, I'm just telling you
what I heard.

434
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:13,440
Somewhere, back in these woods,
there's a snake pit.

435
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
Or at least there used to be.

436
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,791
Older kids used to come here
at night,

437
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:22,563
scare their girlfriends into
their arms, that kinda thing.

438
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:24,896
Don't get any ideas.

439
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:29,030
There's a trail around
here that leads to it.

440
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,113
Where was it?

441
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,275
Where was it?

442
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:36,157
Oh yeah, this way.

443
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:38,832
Wait up!

444
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:42,120
So what if we find the snake pit?

445
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,953
Then what?

446
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,393
I guess we'll find the hidden
vantage point, look west,

447
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,134
find the arms of the earth
in the skeleton's eye.

448
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:52,967
Let's do it.

449
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,311
Is that okay with you?

450
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:55,394
Yeah.

451
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:30,981
Ah, what you please
cut that bland stuff out!

452
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,293
Ah, thank you!

453
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,933
Professor.

454
00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:57,658
I said no napping on the job!

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,917
No napping!

456
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:10,618
Thanks, I needed that.

457
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:12,640
So, that dog..

458
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,890
Bosco.

459
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:16,916
He's kinda mangy.

460
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,067
That's called character.

461
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,408
Well, I guess you both got it then.

462
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,505
Thanks.

463
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:23,588
Sure.
Hey.

464
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,030
Look, I don't think you
should be calling someone

465
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,702
like me a character,

466
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:30,379
putting stink on a word like that

467
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,301
when your only friend in town
is Rachel.

468
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:35,218
She is not my friend.

469
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:38,453
And sorry about your skateboard.

470
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,968
No big deal.

471
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:42,237
She does it every couple of days.

472
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:45,498
Her way of making sure
everyone knows who's boss.

473
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:49,360
It'll be sitting in my front
yard in the morning probably.

474
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,974
Yeah, this is one strange town.

475
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:53,818
You could say that again.

476
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,235
Bosco, come here.

477
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,697
Why'd I bring you along for again?

478
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:04,100
The scintillating conversation?

479
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,419
Where'd you get those big words?

480
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,332
TV.

481
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,211
Ha, figures.

482
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,185
Professor?

483
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,461
Professor?

484
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:20,018
Where'd you wander off to now?

485
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:26,592
What are you fooling around for?

486
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:27,906
This ain't the time!

487
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:29,622
We got work to do!

488
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,267
Come on!

489
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,100
Jeez!

490
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,458
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

491
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,174
Look, rocks!

492
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:47,586
Well, it's just called
Snake Rock, right,

493
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:50,209
I mean, there's no actual snake?

494
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,669
Why? Are you scared?

495
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:53,502
No.

496
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:55,734
Terrified.

497
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:56,887
I know they're around here somewhere.

498
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:57,720
Whoa, what was that?
We need that piece

499
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,899
of medallion to find..
Come on!

500
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:00,856
What are you doing?

501
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,323
This is private property.

502
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,111
When my dad finds out I'm here,
I'm grounded for life.

503
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:06,209
Come on!

504
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,515
Yes, yes, Professor,
I think that's them.

505
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:09,348
Let's go! Come on!

506
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,348
Get them, go on, go on!
Right here, right here.

507
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:18,241
What are we doing?

508
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,142
Where are those blasted kids?

509
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,815
I could've sworn I heard them yapping.

510
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,368
They're not here.

511
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:27,177
Not there, not over there either.

512
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:29,010
Shut up, come on, let's go.

513
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,701
How could you let them
get outta your sight?

514
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:32,735
I thought you were watching them.

515
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,795
I thought..
Stop thinking.

516
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:34,769
Start looking.

517
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:38,376
Okay, from now on, I'm not thinking.

518
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:40,000
Starting right this instant,

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,937
I am looking and definitely
not thinking.

520
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:45,598
Just watch while I don't think.

521
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:46,812
Watch me, do you hear?

522
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,229
I'm not thinking.

523
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,955
I think they're gone.

524
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:58,483
Yeah, they're gone.

525
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:00,733
I recognize those voices.

526
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:06,354
Josh, maybe this
wasn't such a good idea.

527
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:08,206
I mean, who knows what kind

528
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,728
of creatures are lurking
around here,

529
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:11,776
and we don't even know what
we're looking for here.

530
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:16,066
And what about those guys,
just chasing after...

531
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,556
What are you looking at?

532
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:18,739
Sh, sh.

533
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,572
Look.

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,110
Oh my, it's a rock.

535
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:32,702
Look, look closer.

536
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,768
Okay, just got goosebumps.

537
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:45,151
Exactly.

538
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:45,984
Come on!

539
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:00,352
Oh my gosh.

540
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:03,238
A real treasure chest!

541
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:04,543
We're gonna be heroes, Ana!

542
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,913
We're gonna save the whole
town with this chest!

543
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,977
How do we get to it though?

544
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,897
Yeah, they're pretty sharp.

545
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:22,615
I have an idea.

546
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:25,672
Almost there.

547
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,202
Just a little farther.

548
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,498
Don't let go.

549
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:32,748
Great idea, Peters!

550
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:34,827
Pull!

551
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,266
It's no use, it's stuck on something.

552
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,532
Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.

553
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:49,508
It's empty!

554
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:54,496
Wait, there's something in there!

555
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,276
All right.

556
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:58,193
Pull me up!

557
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:01,864
I can't!

558
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:04,451
Ana, it's either you
pull me up right now

559
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:07,390
or I get turned into shish kabob.

560
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:27,170
Cool.

561
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,272
Awesome.

562
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:39,926
What's this?

563
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:43,747
Wow.

564
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:57,634
Ana, you might wanna take a
look at this.

565
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:02,137
Ana, look at it.

566
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:07,747
Oh my...

567
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:11,692
I can't believe it.

568
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:13,476
People have been searching
for this

569
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:16,356
for centuries, Ana, for centuries!

570
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:18,273
And we just found it!

571
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:21,737
So what does all this say?

572
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:25,068
Well, we're here,
so that says snake rock.

573
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:27,062
And over here?

574
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:31,297
Uh, um, he who enters this
forest is cursed.

575
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:34,630
Over here, skeleton's eye,
the entrance.

576
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,266
And?

577
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:38,453
Death valley.

578
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:39,368
All right.

579
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:42,533
And, uh, what's this?

580
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,700
Rich as a man.

581
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,790
All right, and we have to go here,

582
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:52,477
so that means we have to go
that way.

583
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,735
And lucky for us,

584
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,485
that's the same direction
as the bus station.

585
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:03,542
Wow.

586
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:07,955
Josh, wait.

587
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,374
What? What is it?

588
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:13,854
Don't you think you should
tell somebody about this first?

589
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:15,655
What do you mean we?

590
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:18,322
I thought you were running away.

591
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,425
I mean, like, after you take me

592
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,422
to the other side of the woods.

593
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,678
Don't you think you should
tell your dad or somebody?

594
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,140
Ana, remember?

595
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,609
I showed my dad the medallion,
he didn't believe me.

596
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,261
I'll show him the map and
he'd still won't believe me.

597
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:32,344
Just come on.

598
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,211
What is it now?

599
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:45,279
What about those bad guys
who are chasing after us?

600
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,664
I'll take my chances.

601
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,718
Saving my house and
Bosco is more important

602
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,666
than anything else right now.

603
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,008
And finding that treasure is
the only way

604
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,841
of making that happen.

605
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:00,290
Come on.

606
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,722
Yup, west is that way.

607
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:07,574
Let's see.

608
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:13,230
He who enters this forest
will be cursed.

609
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:18,858
Joy.

610
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:32,188
What?

611
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:35,855
Well, you see,
the bus station's that way.

612
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:41,192
If you're bent on running away,
that's where you gotta go.

613
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,626
Can we make it quick?

614
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,959
I wanna be home before dark.

615
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:52,894
Maybe I don't wanna run away anymore.

616
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,930
Maybe I wanna help you find
that gold.

617
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,597
Why, I mean, you've got money.

618
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,854
Forget it, look,
I'm along for the ride.

619
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:03,187
Nothing you can do about it.

620
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:06,098
Yeah.

621
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:06,931
All right.

622
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:08,620
Yeah.

623
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:26,570
Good idea.

624
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:33,233
Do you know how many animals,
how many fish,

625
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,727
have probably peed in this water?

626
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:38,903
If we're out here any longer,
I might end up peeing in it.

627
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,320
Oh, jeez.

628
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:44,798
Disgusting.

629
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,939
Ain't it though?

630
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:07,693
Don't say anything.

631
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,326
What would I say?

632
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:11,536
I just figured I better take
a drink

633
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,046
before you foul it up, that's all.

634
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:17,213
I said I might pee in it,
not that I would pee in it.

635
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:21,184
What was that?

636
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:23,988
I don't know.

637
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:25,803
There are a lot of
twigs around here, Boss.

638
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:27,552
I'm not stepping on them on purpose.

639
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,961
Well, could you try a little harder.

640
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:32,230
You don't see me stepping on
a twig!

641
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,327
Follow me, fast.

642
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,172
Ana, look out!

643
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,265
Ana, you okay?

644
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,231
What is that?

645
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,944
I don't know, but that's been waiting

646
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:27,168
for someone for over 500 years.

647
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,001
Whoa.

648
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:32,624
You know what this means,
don't you?

649
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:35,852
That we're in a world full
of danger?

650
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:38,230
Means it's true, see?

651
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,336
Traps in the woods protect
the gold?

652
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:44,965
This proves it,
that trap right there.

653
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:47,215
Josh, who's following us?

654
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:51,290
Those creeps who tried to buy,

655
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,873
steal, the medallion off of me.

656
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:59,378
You really think they're
following us?

657
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,461
Yeah, I do.

658
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:02,369
Come on.

659
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,939
You know what?

660
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,039
I said no, Mr. James.

661
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,981
Whatever, it's fine.

662
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:33,974
Keep it.

663
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:34,974
Looks great.

664
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,188
My daughter, Ana, she ran away.

665
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:47,826
You know what, she's
probably just out exploring,

666
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,063
you know, she's a little kid.

667
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,678
Well, sure, but she left a note,

668
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:54,963
a very teary, smeary "Dad,
I'm running away" note.

669
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:59,908
13 year old girl's leaving me,
just like her mother did.

670
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,127
Sorry.

671
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:03,832
No, listen,
kids get emotional, okay?

672
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,019
They do silly things like this.

673
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:08,665
She'll be back, she'll be..
Can you help me find her?

674
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,242
Why would you ask me?

675
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,297
You're the only one who'd
talk to me.

676
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,408
All right.

677
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:15,241
All right.

678
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,801
Mike Denton, the Sheriff.

679
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,598
Mike Denton?
He probably...

680
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:22,058
Hey.

681
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,591
What?

682
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,491
I haven't seen my son Josh.

683
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,793
He always makes it home by lunch,
you know?

684
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:28,928
And you don't think the two
of them are

685
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:31,178
off there out in the woods?

686
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,583
Hey Josh, maybe we should go back,

687
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,621
you know,
and just talked to my dad..

688
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:17,454
Hold up.

689
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,629
An hour ago, you were running away.

690
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:22,051
Now you wanna run back to daddy?

691
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

692
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:24,708
Well, maybe you should.

693
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:25,960
Why do you think I'm traipsing

694
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,527
through the woods with you, huh?

695
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:29,005
I don't need the money.

696
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:31,180
But if I can be a part of something
that takes the sting off

697
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,682
and helps you save your house
and helps the town rebuild

698
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,665
without having to take its
anger out on me and my father..

699
00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:42,013
Maybe you won't feel
like such an outsider?

700
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:43,846
Something like that.

701
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:46,638
Hey.

702
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,890
Where's Bosco?

703
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,723
Bosco!

704
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:54,000
Bosco!

705
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,879
Bosco, where are you, boy?

706
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,111
Come here, Bosco!

707
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:00,373
Bosco!
Where do you think he went?

708
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:01,943
Who knows?

709
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,443
But it's not good.

710
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:11,455
I can't believe we lost them,
you numbskull!

711
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,864
I don't believe I'm tired
of calling you a numbskull.

712
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,574
Never thought that day would come!

713
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,194
Oh, Professor, be careful
of the booby-traps here.

714
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:19,577
They're terrible!

715
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,188
Meanwhile, Professor,
we'll find them,

716
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,928
being the leader all the time.

717
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,702
I wouldn't mind a couple
of the kids catching

718
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,864
those booby-traps.

719
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,861
Professor, perhaps you
could take the lead.

720
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:34,854
Professor, I..

721
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:39,592
Professor, I'm sick of all
that, Professor?

722
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:47,302
I asked you to take the
lead, but not so quickly!

723
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:48,911
It's okay, Boss!

724
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:51,992
No problem,
I have everything in control!

725
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,353
Professor.

726
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:00,445
My life is flashing in front
of my eyes!

727
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:02,594
Oh, Professor!
I'm gonna drown!

728
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:04,141
Boss, save me!

729
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,322
Lead, but didn't mean this!

730
00:42:06,322 --> 00:42:08,285
Professor, come, Professor,
I can pull you.

731
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,381
One, two, three!

732
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,847
Bosco!

733
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:26,825
The children.

734
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:30,146
Oh, let's go!

735
00:42:31,337 --> 00:42:32,853
Oh, come on, Professor!

736
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:33,981
I'll help ya!
Give me a hand!

737
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:35,438
Oh!

738
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:42,232
Oh, come on, Professor.

739
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:44,758
Bosco!

740
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:47,540
Bosco!

741
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:49,999
Bosco!

742
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,400
The Conquistador's Curse.

743
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,204
What?

744
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,911
It says that the
forest itself is cursed.

745
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,804
It'll take your voice and
spin it around

746
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:07,357
till you don't know where
you are or where you've been.

747
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:08,190
Bosco!

748
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,416
Bosco, I'm coming to you, boy!

749
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,500
Give me another bark!

750
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:20,656
Bosco!

751
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:23,404
Bosco, where are you?

752
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,635
Come back to me, boy!

753
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:30,009
Just settle down.

754
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:31,702
Get yourself calm.

755
00:43:31,702 --> 00:43:33,811
Get your bearings.

756
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,894
Listen to me!

757
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:47,686
Wanna know what I'm gonna do

758
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:48,806
if we do get the..

759
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,393
Josh, we gotta run!

760
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:54,527
I'll buy me a nice pair
of gold-plated boots.

761
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:55,923
Come on, let's go climb up
this tree.

762
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:01,135
Man.

763
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:04,272
Quick, hold that.

764
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:07,375
Is this really the time?

765
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,375
Just go along with it.

766
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:11,860
Can you climb a tree?

767
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,693
Yeah.

768
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:16,423
Gold-plated boots?

769
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:18,798
Yeah.

770
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:22,919
How are you gonna walk
around in metal boots?

771
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:25,450
I didn't say metal boots.

772
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,450
I said gold.

773
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:29,371
You know what you oughta buy?

774
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:30,204
What?

775
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,707
Some new parts for your brain!

776
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,213
What are you doing?

777
00:44:41,213 --> 00:44:44,380
The higher I am,
the more I can see.

778
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:49,688
Whoa!

779
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,271
You hear something?

780
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:57,880
Yeah.

781
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,880
Dog barking.

782
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:01,133
Besides that.

783
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,300
Beside what?

784
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,329
Besides the dog barking.

785
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,465
There's something beside the dog?

786
00:45:12,465 --> 00:45:13,382
Oh, gosh!

787
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,673
Do you hear anything besides
the dog?

788
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:23,642
No!

789
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:28,243
Must be your imagination.

790
00:45:28,243 --> 00:45:29,530
Must be.

791
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:37,775
Wade, we have got to find the dog.

792
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:41,907
If we find the dog,
then we find the kids.

793
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:45,490
If we find the kids,
we find the medallion.

794
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:51,432
And if we find the medallion,
we find the treasure.

795
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:56,984
Thanks.

796
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:01,204
Does your daughter have a tendency

797
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:02,813
to run off like this, Mr. James?

798
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:06,606
She gets all bent outta shape
whenever we change towns,

799
00:46:06,606 --> 00:46:08,119
but nothing like this.

800
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,266
Well, how about Josh?

801
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,482
He's never run off like this?

802
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:11,927
No, no, I mean,
he runs around all morning

803
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:12,760
during the summer time,

804
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,594
but he always makes it home
by lunch.

805
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:15,786
You know where he goes?

806
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:17,565
Not really.
I know where he goes.

807
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:19,625
Rachel, what are you doing here?

808
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,453
You're looking for Josh and Ana,
right, Dad?

809
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:24,852
Well, I know where Josh hides out.

810
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:25,944
Where?

811
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:30,159
In the woods,
halfway to Colt Black's Ridge.

812
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,644
Colt, what is that?
No, no, don't worry.

813
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:32,992
They wouldn't venture too far
in there.

814
00:46:32,992 --> 00:46:34,609
All the parents make sure the
kids think

815
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:37,010
that place is cursed,
so they don't go in.

816
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,355
There are a lot of rattlers
in there.

817
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:40,910
Really, rattlers, okay.

818
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,615
She's afraid of snakes.

819
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:45,028
Well, there's a lot of snakes
out there.

820
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:47,794
No one's been out to
Colt Black Ridge since,

821
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:49,211
well, Colt Black.

822
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:52,398
Those woods are awful big, Rachel.

823
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:54,776
You're gonna need to be more specific.

824
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:56,742
Where would they be?

825
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,489
Double my allowance and I'll
tell you.

826
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:00,822
Done. Come on.

827
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:03,241
Uh, well...

828
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:29,497
Bosco!

829
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:32,621
Bosco, here, boy!

830
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:36,554
We have to call the hunt
off until we find him.

831
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:39,672
He has to be around here somewhere.

832
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:42,328
Bosco?

833
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:43,642
Bosco!

834
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:47,782
Come here, boy!

835
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,908
Oh, Bosco, thank god!

836
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,954
Whoa!

837
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:58,779
Josh!

838
00:48:00,186 --> 00:48:03,603
Oh, Bosco,
always digging up junk, man.

839
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:07,561
What, what?
Josh, get outta there!

840
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:08,781
What is it?
Look.

841
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:09,614
What the?

842
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:12,279
Jeez!

843
00:48:20,629 --> 00:48:22,951
Is that who I think it is?

844
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:25,199
If you think that's Colt Black,

845
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,699
I'd say you're probably right.

846
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:31,652
And is that what I think it is?

847
00:48:31,652 --> 00:48:33,118
I don't know what you think
it is,

848
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,618
but I know what I think it is.

849
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:40,851
It's almost like he led us here.

850
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:43,587
What are you waiting for?

851
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,837
Ladies first.

852
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:48,530
Are you scared?

853
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,363
No.

854
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,718
Don't be such a baby.

855
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,020
You wanna do this?

856
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,073
No.

857
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,656
You're doing great.

858
00:49:11,733 --> 00:49:12,865
Come on.

859
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:16,235
It's not moving!

860
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,068
It's not gonna work.

861
00:49:17,068 --> 00:49:19,401
It will, just keep trying.

862
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,317
Ah, gross!

863
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,386
Oh, get it off of me!

864
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,304
Oh, oh my gosh!

865
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,455
Oh, it's stuck!

866
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,683
Help!
Get off of me!

867
00:49:38,683 --> 00:49:39,933
Stupid!

868
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:45,687
Gah!

869
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:51,412
Ana, look.

870
00:49:56,963 --> 00:49:57,796
Yes.

871
00:50:07,577 --> 00:50:09,077
Oh, what's this?

872
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,097
My days are numbered and they
should be.

873
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:32,264
I have searched these woods for
gold and have come up empty,

874
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,154
the Conquistador's Curse
having caught me in its grip.

875
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:40,857
All I can do now is wait
for the Devil to take me,

876
00:50:40,857 --> 00:50:43,753
knowing that I've wronged
many men in my time.

877
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:46,920
Any pity that consumes me,
just guilt.

878
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:51,972
As I rest here,
a spike torn through me,

879
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:56,139
my thoughts are dreaming
basically to those I've hurt.

880
00:50:57,433 --> 00:51:00,016
And all I can say is I'm sorry.

881
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,851
He felt bad for what he did.

882
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:11,995
Should we find out what the new
piece of the medallion says?

883
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:12,828
Yeah.

884
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:26,563
The arms of the earth.

885
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:28,197
Wow, it's beautiful.

886
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:29,420
Ana, you were right.

887
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,420
It's a tree!

888
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,130
So we find this tree

889
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:37,462
and that should lead us
to the skeleton's eye.

890
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:38,795
Yeah, exactly.

891
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:43,143
So the treasure must be
somewhere near.

892
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,421
The next piece probably tells
us where.

893
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:48,242
We probably won't ever find that.

894
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,243
You hear something?

895
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,368
What was it?

896
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,321
Would you please shut
that mutt up already?

897
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:03,088
What are you following us for?

898
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,505
What do you want?

899
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:08,656
I think you know darn well
what I want.

900
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:10,141
Now hand it over!

901
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:12,485
Yeah, hand it over!

902
00:52:12,485 --> 00:52:14,598
Can it, Professor!

903
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,536
I'm just saying!

904
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:20,536
Yeah, now don't it just
fit together beautifully?

905
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:25,583
We got the old legend, yeah,
he's coming to life.

906
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:28,736
And we got the two little
lovebirds, aw, yeah.

907
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:29,569
We're not..

908
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:30,465
Yeah, well, can it!

909
00:52:30,465 --> 00:52:32,377
I don't wanna hear it!

910
00:52:32,377 --> 00:52:34,294
Uh, uh, Boss, uh, um.

911
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,044
Boss, I, uh, uh, Boss!

912
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:40,482
Oh!

913
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:45,042
Now hand over that medallion.

914
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,306
Yeah.

915
00:52:46,306 --> 00:52:47,211
Yeah!

916
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:48,781
Hand it over!

917
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:50,048
We don't even have the whole thing.

918
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:50,949
It's useless.

919
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:54,366
Oh, let us be the judge of
that, Missy.

920
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:56,725
Oh, I get it!

921
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,855
So sorry!

922
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,592
You want it the hard way!

923
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:05,214
That's fine by me.

924
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:07,225
Yeah, that's fine by him.

925
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,078
Quiet, moron.

926
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:09,245
Yeah, quiet!

927
00:53:11,072 --> 00:53:12,822
I'm talking to you!

928
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:18,580
Oh.

929
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,781
You think I got some aversion
to slapping a kid around?

930
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:24,958
He's got no aversion of any kind!

931
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,423
I don't!

932
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:28,609
Zero!
I can testify that, huh?

933
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,006
Good.
Okay.

934
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:32,566
You can do it two ways!

935
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:34,399
The smart way like me.

936
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:37,819
Or the dumb way like him.

937
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,146
I'm not like you.

938
00:53:41,146 --> 00:53:41,979
Hey Josh..

939
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:43,652
I'm not like either of you.

940
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:45,344
Josh, let's just go.

941
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:46,502
These are two grown men.

942
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:47,765
We can't win this fight.

943
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:50,512
Ah, listen to your girl, kid.

944
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:51,929
They won, Josh.

945
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:56,935
Let's just be thankful we're
okay and leave them alone.

946
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:01,232
Eh?

947
00:54:01,232 --> 00:54:02,065
Eh?

948
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:04,486
It's all yours.
Ah!

949
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:07,672
That's what we like, kid.

950
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:11,007
That's a wise choice.

951
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:26,175
Well, ... Oh, what's that?

952
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:31,227
Oh, I tell ya, you have no idea

953
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:34,023
how long the Professor and
I have been searching around,

954
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:35,688
and you two kids found it for us.

955
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:37,378
Well, we much appreciate that.

956
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:38,866
So you know what we're gonna do?

957
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:41,116
We're gonna let you leave
with your hides.

958
00:54:41,116 --> 00:54:41,949
Now scram!

959
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,409
My family needs that money!

960
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:44,992
Aw, what a shame.

961
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:49,420
So I think that you will
be living in the projects

962
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,417
when me and the Professor
here are living the high life!

963
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:53,494
Yeah!

964
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,764
Living the high life!

965
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:56,385
You know what's gonna
be happening to your girl

966
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:58,633
when you're in the projects?

967
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,481
Yeah, kid, that's what.

968
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:03,016
She's gonna find a rich
guy, a really rich guy,

969
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:04,423
and not need you anymore!

970
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:05,256
Now scram!

971
00:55:05,256 --> 00:55:06,703
You bother me!

972
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,538
Give me that medallion!

973
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,610
Boy, come here, boy!
It's mine, it's mine!

974
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,741
Josh!

975
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:11,175
Professor, take care of her!

976
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,163
Let go of me!

977
00:55:12,163 --> 00:55:13,498
Get him off of me!

978
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:16,248
Give it to me!

979
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:19,593
Go get him, Bosco!

980
00:55:19,593 --> 00:55:20,552
Get off! Come on!

981
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:22,236
Bite him, boy, bite him!

982
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,406
You're trying my patience, kids!

983
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:25,491
Get away from me!

984
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:27,812
Let go!
Bosco, go save Ana!

985
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:28,738
Go get her, boy!

986
00:55:28,738 --> 00:55:29,723
Come here!

987
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:31,091
Let go of me!

988
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,132
I'll take that!

989
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:35,215
Wait, wait!

990
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,386
Begone!

991
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:43,245
Bad dog!
Come here, kid.

992
00:55:43,245 --> 00:55:44,281
Give me that!

993
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,202
Give me that, you!

994
00:55:45,202 --> 00:55:46,326
(Mumbling)

995
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,659
Come on, little girl,
now give it to me!

996
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:52,938
Now give me that medallion!

997
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:54,688
Ana, I've got them!

998
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:57,589
Ah, you wanna play?

999
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,417
Give me that medallion right
now, kid.

1000
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:00,489
Don't do it, Josh!

1001
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:01,639
It's not yours!

1002
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:05,316
It's the girl... Or the medallion.

1003
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:06,882
You choose!

1004
00:56:06,882 --> 00:56:07,715
Huh?

1005
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:20,779
See ya.

1006
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:23,661
Boss!

1007
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:28,973
Now get up!

1008
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:30,342
No sleeping on the job!

1009
00:56:30,342 --> 00:56:31,312
Get up!
All right!

1010
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:32,145
Come on!

1011
00:56:32,145 --> 00:56:34,066
Jeez Louise!

1012
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:35,597
Am I the only one with brains here?

1013
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:37,008
Yes, Sir.

1014
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:42,569
I knew you didn't mean to
cut me down like that, Boss.

1015
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:46,305
Professor, you're about as
smart as a bag of doorknobs.

1016
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:47,826
Oh!

1017
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:51,710
Oh, Boss, flattery will
get you everywhere!

1018
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:52,919
Of course it will!

1019
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:53,752
I like you!

1020
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:55,341
Oh, thanks, Boss!

1021
00:56:55,341 --> 00:56:56,174
Get a hold of it.

1022
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:57,624
Take a piece of it!

1023
00:56:57,624 --> 00:57:00,124
Ain't it beautiful, Professor?

1024
00:57:02,394 --> 00:57:03,561
So what now?

1025
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,399
I take you to the bus station,
I guess.

1026
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:08,642
That's it?

1027
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:09,648
That's it.

1028
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:10,481
It's over.

1029
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:12,978
No gold.

1030
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,598
No saving my house.

1031
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,015
No saving my dog.

1032
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:20,541
We lost.

1033
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,705
So that's it, huh?

1034
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,676
Simple as that?

1035
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,744
You're just going to give up?

1036
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:32,244
Give up on the gold,
on your house, on me?

1037
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:35,686
I'm not giving up on you.

1038
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,275
You were going to let me run
away, Josh.

1039
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,705
I didn't want you to.

1040
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,122
Josh, that gold is out there.

1041
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:42,985
You know it and I know it.

1042
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:47,013
And you're too strong and I'm
too smart

1043
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:50,243
to let those two knuckleheads
take it away from us.

1044
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:51,993
But what can we do?

1045
00:57:55,507 --> 00:57:57,090
Backpack, please.

1046
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,408
All right.

1047
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:16,983
What exactly are you doing?

1048
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:21,277
I'm making a wax
impression of the medallion.

1049
00:58:21,277 --> 00:58:22,324
We have the map.

1050
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,887
We don't need the medallion.

1051
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:25,976
There's writing on the
medallion that isn't on the map,

1052
00:58:25,976 --> 00:58:27,809
so we might need this.

1053
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:51,491
Wax impression,
that was smart, Ana.

1054
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,658
Well, I have my moments.

1055
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,923
Plus, I owed you.

1056
00:58:57,923 --> 00:58:59,345
For what?

1057
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:03,905
Well, when I was near
the medallion back there,

1058
00:59:03,905 --> 00:59:04,988
you chose me.

1059
00:59:14,275 --> 00:59:18,275
Um, the tree's on the
other side of the creek.

1060
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,446
We have to take the shortcut

1061
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:22,594
if we wanna get in front of
those guys,

1062
00:59:22,594 --> 00:59:24,276
you know what I mean?

1063
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:25,693
Yeah, let's go.

1064
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:36,474
Bosco, come here!

1065
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:39,303
Ever hear of the
Conquistador's Curse?

1066
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:40,603
You mean the one where after

1067
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:42,587
the conquistadors conquered
the Americas,

1068
00:59:42,587 --> 00:59:44,540
wiping out everything in
their path,

1069
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,223
accumulating more wealth
than you could ever imagine,

1070
00:59:47,223 --> 00:59:48,446
employed unconventional means

1071
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:49,836
with which to protect their treasure,

1072
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,816
even going so far as to
apply local Indian customs

1073
00:59:52,816 --> 00:59:55,886
and curses in direct defiance
of their church and state?

1074
00:59:55,886 --> 00:59:57,627
Yeah, I heard of it.

1075
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,699
How would you know that?

1076
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,498
Because Ultra-Mart researches
every town

1077
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:02,573
before they conquer it.

1078
01:00:02,573 --> 01:00:04,240
I mean, colonize it.

1079
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,677
I mean, cash out.

1080
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:11,458
Those aren't pants or trousers.

1081
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,526
What'd I tell you about those pants.

1082
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,359
Wait up.

1083
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:27,250
We're here, and we have
to go there, and then here.

1084
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:43,131
Bosco!

1085
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:53,665
What are you doing?

1086
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:54,998
What? Nothing.

1087
01:00:56,942 --> 01:01:00,417
Are you trying to show me
up at this stage of the game?

1088
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,769
I'm not trying to show you up.

1089
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:04,221
I just wanna get there in a hurry.

1090
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:05,491
Is this about me being a girl,

1091
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:07,204
'cause if it is,
it shouldn't be..

1092
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:08,484
This again?

1093
01:01:08,484 --> 01:01:09,484
Oh, ah, joy.

1094
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,653
Well, because I ran
track at my old school.

1095
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:17,203
You didn't exactly
run with boys, did you?

1096
01:01:17,203 --> 01:01:19,150
You wanna race?

1097
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,420
Okay, that's a little bit
off-topic, don't you think?

1098
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,137
Come on, Josh, I'll race you.

1099
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,118
Forget it.

1100
01:01:25,118 --> 01:01:26,368
Come on, Bosco.

1101
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,003
What are you doing?

1102
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:33,237
Ready?

1103
01:01:33,237 --> 01:01:34,733
Ana?

1104
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,566
Set.

1105
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:41,302
And go!

1106
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:42,135
Girls.

1107
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,642
Eat my dust, Josh Peters!

1108
01:02:03,183 --> 01:02:04,372
Ana!

1109
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:05,653
Ana, where are you?

1110
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:07,486
I'm down here!

1111
01:02:09,337 --> 01:02:10,621
Don't look down.

1112
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:11,954
Don't look down.

1113
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:16,071
Holy, told you!

1114
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,067
Ana, where are you?

1115
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,464
Oh, I'm down here!

1116
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:21,772
What are you doing down there?

1117
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,487
Just help me, please!

1118
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:36,155
Josh!

1119
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:37,927
Ana, you have to grab onto
the stick.

1120
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:39,844
I can't go any farther.

1121
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,841
Come on.

1122
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:50,921
Come on.

1123
01:02:50,921 --> 01:02:52,710
You can do it.

1124
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,877
You can do it.

1125
01:02:57,019 --> 01:02:58,150
Come on.

1126
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:03,461
Thanks.

1127
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:05,044
Don't mention it.

1128
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:11,918
Hey, have you ever heard the story

1129
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:14,951
of the tortoise and the hare?

1130
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:15,905
Have you ever heard of the story

1131
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:19,682
with the big brown bear in
the woods?

1132
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:23,094
I think I heard a joke one
time that's sorta like that.

1133
01:03:23,094 --> 01:03:24,661
Yeah, well, I gotta story for you.

1134
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:27,767
Okay, once upon a time, there
was these idiots with a dog

1135
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:31,267
in search of gold and got
eaten by a bear.

1136
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:34,799
You saw a big brown bear?

1137
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:37,712
Yeah.

1138
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:40,927
Yeah, let's go.

Bosco!

1153
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,166
Kids!

1154
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:31,536
Boss?

1155
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:32,369
Oh, the dog.

1156
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,536
Got it. Ana!

1157
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,162
Josh!
Ana, kids!

1158
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:45,010
You guys need to take a break?

1159
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,672
I mean, come on, we're
on a wild goose chase here.

1160
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:48,479
We oughta call in the
National Guard.

1161
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,610
What, you don't think I can
handle this?

1162
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,349
Look, no offense, Sheriff, okay,

1163
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:54,330
with truly the best intentions,

1164
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,356
but if you don't have the resources

1165
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:58,213
to mount a proper manhunt, then
I think we better call in..

1166
01:04:58,213 --> 01:04:59,186
Listen, stop bickering here

1167
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,687
and just find the kids, all right?

1168
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:01,848
We need to work together.
All right, all right.

1169
01:05:01,848 --> 01:05:03,398
Bicker, I mean, come on.

1170
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:05,442
I've never seen a badge
that small in my life,

1171
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:07,847
like a thumbtack's bigger
than that at the store.

1172
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:09,152
Well, maybe I'll go to Ultra-Mart

1173
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:10,832
and buy a big one, yeah.
Oh yeah, we can do that,

1174
01:05:10,832 --> 01:05:12,080
all right, Hoss?

1175
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,913
Whatever.

1176
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,464
Ana!

1177
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:17,083
Ana!

1178
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,899
Hey everybody!

1179
01:05:18,899 --> 01:05:19,732
It's gonna be dark soon.

1180
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:20,649
Let's move!

1181
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:29,273
What you got there, boy?

1182
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:34,036
What's in there?

1183
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,917
Medallion, please.

1184
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:50,009
Let's see here.

1185
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:54,752
Looks like this is the tree.

1186
01:05:55,714 --> 01:05:57,591
I knew you had me along for
a reason.

1187
01:05:57,591 --> 01:05:58,424
Come on.

1188
01:06:03,614 --> 01:06:05,200
You know what, Ana?

1189
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,029
You're a genius.

1190
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,373
Whoa.

1191
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:10,505
Josh, be careful!

1192
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:12,422
Just don't look down.

1193
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:27,709
All right.

1194
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:31,876
You see how the sun sets
right behind the mountain?

1195
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:33,978
Yeah.

1196
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:38,986
All right, also, you see
how it sets on the map?

1197
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:41,435
Yeah.

1198
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:45,602
Okay, now can you make
out that skull-shaped rock?

1199
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:52,047
The skeleton's eye.

1200
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:52,916
Exactly.

1201
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,406
Now, according to the map,

1202
01:06:54,406 --> 01:06:58,573
the entrance of the cave
should be directly below.

1203
01:07:03,678 --> 01:07:05,178
Oh my gosh, yes!

1204
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:09,911
Okay, so we ready?

1205
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,233
Josh.

1206
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,521
We're gonna go find the gold.

1207
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:17,380
All right,
I was just taking a moment.

1208
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,959
It's been a pretty crazy day.

1209
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:21,625
All right.

1210
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:47,720
Oh my gosh.

1211
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:51,358
What now?

1212
01:07:54,144 --> 01:07:55,394
I don't know.

1213
01:07:57,902 --> 01:07:59,837
Wait, can I see the medallion?

1214
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,004
Yeah.

1215
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:10,232
Let's see, he who carries
this medallion should have

1216
01:08:10,232 --> 01:08:12,649
the key to the riches of man.

1217
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:16,814
It's the key!
It's the key!

1218
01:08:16,814 --> 01:08:19,731
Put it in, let's see if it works.

1219
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:15,519
Check it out, it's huge!

1220
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,585
Hello?

1221
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,957
I haven't done that since
I was like six.

1222
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:25,706
This must be it.

1223
01:09:25,706 --> 01:09:27,180
This is the water symbol.

1224
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,220
There's gotta be a clue here somewhere.

1225
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,387
Let's find it.

1226
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:53,271
Ana, stop!

1227
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:54,104
What?

1228
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:54,937
It's a trap.

1229
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:55,770
What?

1230
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:59,270
Uh, um, uh, help me find a stick!

1231
01:10:10,918 --> 01:10:12,367
Whoa!

1232
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:13,200
Oh, wow!

1233
01:10:16,743 --> 01:10:19,124
Are you okay?

1234
01:10:19,124 --> 01:10:20,541
That was close.

1235
01:10:25,197 --> 01:10:27,614
Next time, be more careful.

1236
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:32,800
What's it say?

1237
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:35,946
(Foreign language)

1238
01:10:35,946 --> 01:10:37,410
What?

1239
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,328
The gold is cold.

1240
01:10:39,328 --> 01:10:40,161
Oh.

1241
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,733
Let's go that way.

1242
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:43,816
Definitely.

1243
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:54,668
Oh, gosh!

1244
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,485
Bosco, come back!

1245
01:10:58,485 --> 01:10:59,541
Watch the traps!

1246
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:03,563
Whoa!

1247
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:05,480
Bosco, what did you do?

1248
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:13,616
Whoa!

1249
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:15,396
Okay, um.

1250
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,451
On three.

1251
01:11:16,451 --> 01:11:17,462
Okay.

1252
01:11:17,462 --> 01:11:18,483
One.

1253
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,316
Two.

1254
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,209
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1255
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,695
When you say "On three," do
you mean like,

1256
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,473
on three as in one, two,
and then three?

1257
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:27,827
Or one, two, three,
and then we run?

1258
01:11:27,827 --> 01:11:29,733
On three.
On three, okay.

1259
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:31,195
Yeah, okay.

1260
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:32,276
One.

1261
01:11:32,276 --> 01:11:33,109
Two.

1262
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:34,991
Two.

1263
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,115
Three!

1264
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:42,762
Good job, Bosco!

1265
01:11:44,507 --> 01:11:45,340
Guys!

1266
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,091
All right.

1267
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:48,403
Looks like they've definitely
been here.

1268
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:49,365
Yeah?
Yeah.

1269
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:50,951
All right.
All right, here.

1270
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:52,883
Give me a hand.

1271
01:11:52,883 --> 01:11:54,556
Thanks.
Rachel,

1272
01:11:54,556 --> 01:11:56,163
you knew about this place?

1273
01:11:56,163 --> 01:11:57,622
Josh comes here all the time.

1274
01:11:57,622 --> 01:11:58,981
It's his little place to think.

1275
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,556
Yeah, you know any other
places he might hide,

1276
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:01,882
any other secret spots?

1277
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,207
Not really.

1278
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:05,414
He just likes to dig up stuff.

1279
01:12:05,414 --> 01:12:07,803
Can we move on and not
get all sobby about this

1280
01:12:07,803 --> 01:12:09,035
and that mangy mutt?

1281
01:12:09,035 --> 01:12:10,277
Careful.

1282
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:11,456
Don't drop me.

1283
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:12,640
Whoa, whoa.

1284
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:33,677
Ah, man, that's hot!

1285
01:12:33,677 --> 01:12:35,058
Ah, gosh!

1286
01:12:36,498 --> 01:12:37,998
What do we do now?

1287
01:12:42,618 --> 01:12:46,785
Um, okay, I saw this show
about this, like, monk, okay?

1288
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:50,037
And he had to cross coals
like this

1289
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:53,507
and he just concentrated,
like, really, really hard,

1290
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:55,058
you know,
mind over matter type of thing,

1291
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:57,217
just walked across.

1292
01:12:57,217 --> 01:12:58,634
Should we try it?

1293
01:12:59,828 --> 01:13:00,661
Okay.

1294
01:13:06,618 --> 01:13:07,618
I'm waiting.

1295
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,309
This type of thing takes time.

1296
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:11,724
Just let me focus.

1297
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:13,474
We don't have time.

1298
01:13:22,096 --> 01:13:23,096
Sh.

1299
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:32,706
Yep, yep, still hot.

1300
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:37,058
Wait, I've got an idea.

1301
01:13:37,058 --> 01:13:37,891
What?

1302
01:13:40,347 --> 01:13:42,014
(Foreign language)

1303
01:13:42,014 --> 01:13:43,821
The gold is cold.

1304
01:13:43,821 --> 01:13:45,548
The gold stones!

1305
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:46,381
Follow me.

1306
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:52,030
Be careful.

1307
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,863
Thanks.

1308
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,775
Be careful, Ana.

1309
01:13:57,775 --> 01:13:59,647
Watch it, watch it.

1310
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:00,957
Okay.

1311
01:14:00,957 --> 01:14:04,810
Okay, good job, okay,
keep it, be careful, Ana.

1312
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,731
Oh man.
Just jump, just jump.

1313
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:07,564
Just jump!

1314
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,987
Okay.

1315
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:13,798
Okay.
Okay, you can do it.

1316
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:15,715
Just follow my pattern.

1317
01:14:17,652 --> 01:14:18,485
Okay, okay.

1318
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:19,437
You can do it, you can do it.

1319
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:20,270
It's okay.

1320
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:35,928
Ah.
Oh, you're leaning

1321
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:37,053
on the wrong foot.

1322
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:37,973
Okay.

1323
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,929
I'm sorry.
Hurry up.

1324
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:41,596
Don't pressure me.

1325
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,403
It's the entrance.

1326
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,486
Whoa.

1327
01:14:53,373 --> 01:14:56,100
Come on, just over.

1328
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,850
Leave your backpacks.

1329
01:14:58,948 --> 01:14:59,781
Okay.

1330
01:15:04,582 --> 01:15:06,415
Come on, Ana, come on.

1331
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,007
Holy shining pile of gold!
Shining pile of gold!

1332
01:15:30,007 --> 01:15:31,712
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!

1333
01:15:31,712 --> 01:15:33,191
We found it, Ana!

1334
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:34,024
Look at all this!

1335
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:35,756
You can save your whole town!

1336
01:15:35,756 --> 01:15:37,533
We are rich!

1337
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,121
Woo!

1338
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:39,954
Aw yeah!

1339
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,872
Oh my gosh!

1340
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,511
Woo!
I cannot believe this!

1341
01:15:45,511 --> 01:15:48,100
Yes, finally,
look at all this gold, Ana!

1342
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:48,971
Jewelry!

1343
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,361
You're a rich dog now, Bosco!

1344
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,283
Woo-hoo!

1345
01:15:57,283 --> 01:15:58,866
Oh my gosh.

1346
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:03,780
Your lady.

1347
01:16:06,987 --> 01:16:08,631
Oh my gosh.

1348
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:10,214
This is incredible!

1349
01:16:12,175 --> 01:16:13,008
Woo!

1350
01:16:16,092 --> 01:16:17,952
Woo, look at all this gold mess!

1351
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,456
Put it down, boy!

1352
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:23,256
Ah, I said put it down!

1353
01:16:24,686 --> 01:16:25,592
This?

1354
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:27,005
Yeah, that's right, boy.
All right.

1355
01:16:27,005 --> 01:16:29,970
You just put it down.
All right, all right.

1356
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:32,168
You guys keep showing up!

1357
01:16:32,168 --> 01:16:33,873
Yeah, they miss us!

1358
01:16:33,873 --> 01:16:36,918
They do miss us!

1359
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:37,810
We've got a fortune here.

1360
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,850
We can share.

1361
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,035
I mean, seriously, look
at how much there is here.

1362
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:43,237
Yeah, well, they got a point, Boss.

1363
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:44,330
Ah, ha,

1364
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,043
what are you talking about?
Ow!

1365
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:48,900
I don't like to share
and neither does he!

1366
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,564
No, no, we don't like to share!

1367
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,814
Sharing's for mugs!

1368
01:16:52,814 --> 01:16:53,881
Fine.

1369
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:54,906
We'll leave.
Yeah, we will.

1370
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:56,202
You're not going anywhere!
Oh, no, no, no,

1371
01:16:56,202 --> 01:16:57,385
no, you don't.

1372
01:16:57,385 --> 01:17:01,400
Oh, we heard that one before,
oh yeah!

1373
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,260
You see, you'll just circle around

1374
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,759
and come right back here to get

1375
01:17:04,759 --> 01:17:07,955
my great, great,
great granddaddy's gold!

1376
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:09,832
Great granddaddy?
Great granddaddy?

1377
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:10,665
You didn't know it?

1378
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:14,531
You see, Colt Black was my kin,

1379
01:17:14,531 --> 01:17:16,170
so I think that makes me

1380
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,416
the rightful owner of all
this gold!

1381
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,744
That's the way he sees it!

1382
01:17:20,744 --> 01:17:22,662
Yeah, that's the way I see it!

1383
01:17:22,662 --> 01:17:25,005
Actually, Colt Black stole
the medallion

1384
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:26,865
that led to that gold.

1385
01:17:26,865 --> 01:17:28,806
It didn't belong to him anyway.

1386
01:17:28,806 --> 01:17:30,603
Belonged to the conquistadors.

1387
01:17:30,603 --> 01:17:31,797
So, if anything..

1388
01:17:31,797 --> 01:17:35,964
If anything, it's hers,
because she speaks Spanish.

1389
01:17:36,872 --> 01:17:38,204
What?

1390
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:40,063
Yeah, well, they got a point, Boss.

1391
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:42,195
Ah, let it go!
Ow!

1392
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:44,583
We can keep yakking and
yakking all day,

1393
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,313
but that's not gonna get us anywhere,

1394
01:17:46,313 --> 01:17:48,330
so why don't you be good
little kids

1395
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,489
and come here and let the
Professor and I dispose of ya.

1396
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:56,986
Got get them, boy!

1397
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:00,465
Huh?

1398
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:01,298
Whoa!

1399
01:18:09,983 --> 01:18:13,112
Ah, ya darn, dirty, mangy mutt!

1400
01:18:13,112 --> 01:18:15,071
What you gotta say now, old man?

1401
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:17,404
Oh, I like your style kid.

1402
01:18:19,305 --> 01:18:20,483
Oh, sorry.

1403
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:22,369
Sorry about that Boss.
Can't you see I'm trying

1404
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,392
to make an impression here!

1405
01:18:23,392 --> 01:18:24,225
Sorry about that.

1406
01:18:24,225 --> 01:18:25,058
Ow!

1407
01:18:28,146 --> 01:18:31,100
Kid, I got a style of my own.

1408
01:18:32,769 --> 01:18:33,659
En garde!

1409
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:47,647
Show him how it's done!

1410
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,475
Whoa!

1411
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:55,794
Whoa!

1412
01:19:01,332 --> 01:19:03,690
Oh, be careful, Josh!

1413
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,592
Come on, Boss!

1414
01:19:04,592 --> 01:19:06,197
Boss, what's the matter with you?

1415
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:09,114
Be quiet, you horrible man!

1416
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:12,741
Yes!

1417
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:16,587
Oh, you can do it, Josh!

1418
01:19:16,587 --> 01:19:18,299
You can do it!

1419
01:19:19,746 --> 01:19:20,719
Josh!

1420
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,071
Now, kid, you're shish kabob.

1421
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,468
Ay-yi, Boss!

1422
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:30,030
Come on, Ana, run!

1423
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,155
Where are we going?

1424
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:32,034
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1425
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,231
Right now, let's go!

1426
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:34,314
Come on, Ana!

1427
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:40,043
Aw, a dead end!

1428
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,257
Hey, Boss, I got them!

1429
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,283
You mutt!

1430
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:52,058
Come on, Ana,
grab a sword and shield!

1431
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:53,504
Look, Boss!

1432
01:19:53,504 --> 01:19:54,645
Bring it on!

1433
01:19:55,894 --> 01:19:56,761
Oh, look at them!

1434
01:19:56,761 --> 01:19:58,760
Throw some stuff at them!

1435
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,605
That's it!

1436
01:19:59,605 --> 01:20:01,112
Hey, Boss, isn't this kinda

1437
01:20:01,112 --> 01:20:03,025
like throwing money at a problem?

1438
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:07,416
Oh no, this is too good.

1439
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,916
Hey Josh?
Yeah?

1440
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:11,800
I'm glad I met you.

1441
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,182
Well, I'm glad I met you too,

1442
01:20:13,182 --> 01:20:15,808
but to be honest with you,
this isn't the time for this.

1443
01:20:15,808 --> 01:20:17,263
Oh, that's what I want!

1444
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,838
There you go!

1445
01:20:20,838 --> 01:20:21,982
They're going back!

1446
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:23,039
We did it!

1447
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:24,273
We did it!

1448
01:20:24,273 --> 01:20:25,460
Victory!

1449
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:28,477
I got an idea.

1450
01:20:28,477 --> 01:20:29,876
Whoa!

1451
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:34,370
Hey, take this for a nice shot.

1452
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,088
What now?

1453
01:20:37,088 --> 01:20:38,171
Um, we run!

1454
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:50,297
Whoa, whoa!

1455
01:21:01,468 --> 01:21:02,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1456
01:21:04,661 --> 01:21:06,396
What are you doing napping on
the job?

1457
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:13,681
Where'd they go?

1458
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:14,846
Not again!

1459
01:21:14,846 --> 01:21:16,694
Come on.

1460
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:17,818
Here we go!

1461
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:23,118
Come on, come on!
Come on, Boss!

1462
01:21:23,118 --> 01:21:23,951
Come on, Professor!

1463
01:21:25,616 --> 01:21:27,062
Lost the kid!

1464
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:29,895
Come on, come on, I see a light!

1465
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:41,301
Spiderwebs.

1466
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:52,594
Bosco, where you going, boy?

1467
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:55,434
Ana!

1468
01:21:58,321 --> 01:21:59,154
Kids!

1469
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,007
Bosco!

1470
01:22:09,044 --> 01:22:10,004
Bosco!

1471
01:22:10,004 --> 01:22:10,837
Come on!

1472
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,224
Come here, come on!

1473
01:22:14,224 --> 01:22:15,153
Come here, come here.

1474
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:16,538
Come on, where's Josh?

1475
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:26,956
Come on, Professor.

1476
01:22:28,947 --> 01:22:30,721
Hey Bosco, where's Josh, huh?

1477
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:31,899
Dad!

1478
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:32,846
Josh!

1479
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:33,710
Dad!
Josh!

1480
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:34,543
Dad!
Ana!

1481
01:22:34,543 --> 01:22:35,595
Dad!
Hey.

1482
01:22:35,595 --> 01:22:37,142
Dad!
Ana.

1483
01:22:37,142 --> 01:22:38,559
Ana!
Dad!

1484
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:40,976
These guys, they're after us!

1485
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,786
Dad, you won't believe.

1486
01:22:45,786 --> 01:22:46,909
These treasures.
What do you mean treasure?

1487
01:22:46,909 --> 01:22:48,615
Right below us in the cave!

1488
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:52,076
Wait, what, what, who are you?

1489
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:54,084
We can take about anything!

1490
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:56,084
All right there, boys.

1491
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,108
Wade Black?

1492
01:23:16,942 --> 01:23:18,359
Sheriff Denton?

1493
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:27,809
Do you have a clean shower
in your jail by any chance?

1494
01:23:27,809 --> 01:23:30,360
Got a nice shower for ya.

1495
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,069
Yep, get you all cleaned
up in jail and then some.

1496
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:35,292
Ah, lovely, lovely.

1497
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:37,551
You have the right to remain silent.

1498
01:23:37,551 --> 01:23:38,538
Hold on, Darling.

1499
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:40,804
I'll take care of this.

1500
01:23:40,804 --> 01:23:43,788
You have the right to remain silent.

1501
01:23:43,788 --> 01:23:45,583
Anything you say can and will
be used

1502
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:47,817
against you against you
in the court of law.

1503
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:49,382
You have the right to an attorney.

1504
01:23:49,382 --> 01:23:50,588
Do you have a breakfast?

1505
01:23:51,478 --> 01:23:53,837
Maybe some pancakes and some
Froot Loops.

1506
01:23:53,837 --> 01:23:55,434
Let's go, silent, I said silent.

1507
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:02,222
What part of silent don't you understand?

1508
01:24:04,184 --> 01:24:06,200
I can't believe it!

1509
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,902
It was beneath our feet all along.

1510
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:09,464
What was?

1511
01:24:09,464 --> 01:24:10,297
This.

1512
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:21,246
The gold, it's true, it's all true,

1513
01:24:21,246 --> 01:24:24,562
in the cave beneath the woods.

1514
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:28,721
Dad, there's so much,
anything you could ever imagine.

1515
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:31,434
There's enough to save
the town and then some.

1516
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:34,291
Yeah, and enough that no one
has to sell their business.

1517
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:36,102
Ultra-Mart and the other
local businesses

1518
01:24:36,102 --> 01:24:37,960
can all stay here together.

1519
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,710
They can all prosper.

1520
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:43,230
Yeah, well,
we have some good news too

1521
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,646
'cause we came up with an
agreement, Hector and I.

1522
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:48,459
Ultra-Mart's gonna change
some policy

1523
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,024
whereby we're not gonna carry products

1524
01:24:50,024 --> 01:24:51,749
that you can find locally.

1525
01:24:51,749 --> 01:24:53,773
They're gonna buy a percentage
of some of the local shops

1526
01:24:53,773 --> 01:24:55,921
and then we can all spend that
extra money at Ultra-Mart,

1527
01:24:55,921 --> 01:24:57,253
so everybody wins.

1528
01:24:57,253 --> 01:25:00,592
So we didn't have to go out,
find you all that?

1529
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:01,933
Ooh, I don't know.

1530
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:04,966
I think the world could find

1531
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,887
a way to put this to good use,
don't you?

1532
01:25:07,887 --> 01:25:11,387
So, Josh, what are we gonna
do tomorrow?

1533
01:25:14,037 --> 01:25:15,918
I say we go see what Bosco
digs up.

1534
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:26,637
You're the treasure, princess.

1535
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:27,720
Thanks Dad.

1536
01:25:28,904 --> 01:25:30,962
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.

1537
01:25:30,962 --> 01:25:32,450
I'm proud of you.

1538
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:33,405
