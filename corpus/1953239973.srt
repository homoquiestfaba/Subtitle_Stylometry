1
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:29,988
We will have to repent
in this generation

2
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:34,045
not merely for the vitriolic words
and actions of the bad people,

3
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:37,939
but for the appalling silence
of the good people.

4
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,910
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

5
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:52,177
The vast and complicated issues
facing today's generation

6
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,281
can leave many with the uncertainty
and fear that nothing can be done.

7
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,561
Yet by exploring how the influence
of our media,

8
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,572
education and parenting have shaped us,

9
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,806
we can begin to understand
what we must change.

10
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:11,831
Both as a generation and as a culture.

11
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:19,656
There's a lot of talk about
the great generation

12
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:22,197
of the World War II Generation,

13
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,906
and all generations that came after

14
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,727
are supposed to be in some way
lesser than that.

15
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:33,736
They do not have the world historic role
that the great generation had.

16
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:39,030
Then there's the sixties generation,
which in some way had had a purpose,

17
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,851
had a world historical role of a kind.

18
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:46,448
And then Generation X and
Generation Y and so on

19
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:48,984
are seen mainly in marketing terms:

20
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,105
as generations with no purpose,
no world or historical role.

21
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,989
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program

22
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,177
to bring you the following
special report.

23
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,635
Good evening. I accepted...

24
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,107
There was a moment in the 1970s

25
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:05,563
when a not very successful president,

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,874
nonetheless, tried very hard to say:

27
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:13,678
"Hold up. We may be heading down
the wrong path."

28
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:17,101
In a nation that was proud of hard work,

29
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:21,856
strong families, close-knit communities

30
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,519
and our faith in God,

31
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:31,652
too many of us now tend to worship
self-indulgence and consumption.

32
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:38,435
Human identity is no longer defined
by what one does

33
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,937
but by what one owns.

34
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:48,136
We may be embracing a
false definition of freedom

35
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:53,588
and Carter's effort to bring us back
to a truer definition of freedom

36
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:58,121
was one which required us,
in the near term, to sacrifice.

37
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,886
The vast majority of the American people
didn't want to hear anything like that

38
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,761
and, in short order,

39
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:10,769
came to see Ronald Reagan as offering
a much preferable message.

40
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:15,429
And Reagan's message was
that it's morning in America,

41
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,929
you can always have more

42
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,325
and that the American way of life
is not up for negotiation.

43
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:26,112
They tell us that the future will be one
of sacrifice and few opportunities.

44
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:30,487
My fellow citizens,
I utterly reject that view.

45
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,611
Of course the problem is,

46
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,714
if we want to preserve
the American way of life,

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,179
or at least if we want to preserve those
aspects of the American way of life

48
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,371
that are worth preserving,

49
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:48,651
then we are going to have to change.

50
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:08,843
Human nature

51
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:13,313
usually leads us to not change things
until we are forced to change things.

52
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:16,293
Then that's the paradigm
that has to be broken.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,601
With a series of other
problems in the world

54
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,993
and an economy that leaves people
feeling enormously uneasy.

55
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:27,832
You just become numb.

56
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,713
I wish we had more of a solution though.

57
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:40,480
Protesters vowed to keep up
their demonstrations

58
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,921
despite this state of emergency.

59
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,869
Why is the level of depression so high?

60
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,056
Why are levels of anxiety so high?

61
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,402
Is this really where you want to be?

62
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,223
A woman in Long Island, New York,

63
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:55,949
was trampled to death
by a stampede of shoppers.

64
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,802
I don't buy into this idea
that we are ok.

65
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,224
I don't think we are ok,

66
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,860
but I think that many of us
are just putting on a show.

67
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,949
So I'm afraid to say we need this change,

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,753
and I know we need something
but I'm not sure what.

69
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,652
So, if we lose our principles,
we get lost,

70
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:19,598
we need to reform and revitalize
and incorporate that back into society.

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,926
I think it's a spirit too that
we are not damned.

72
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,710
In order for a revolution to happen,
it has to change on every level.

73
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,816
We need to change the way we live
in some respects

74
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,525
in order to preserve
that which we value most.

75
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:40,805
It's a time to regenerate,

76
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:44,260
it's a time to look at lessons, look at
important things that have happened

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,828
that need to be defined as a culture.

78
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:03,212
Eagan High School.
Eagan, Minnesota.

79
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:06,513
Suburb of Minneapolis / St. Paul.
Student Population: 2300.

80
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:22,649
You know, I'm so young still
and I think about

81
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,738
all the opportunities I have, that I could
do something and make a difference.

82
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:29,306
And every time I think "that's wrong",
"that shouldn't be like that",

83
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,842
I wish I could change it or whatever.
But then I'm just like,

84
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:35,994
you know, who am I?
I am just one junior in high school,

85
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,720
seventeen years old.
What is that going to do?

86
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,697
Dustin and Nicole Artwohl.
Ages 26 and 27

87
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,392
Married 4 years.
Expecting 2nd child in 4 days.

88
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:01,956
There's not one thing out there that
everyone is trying to fight right now.

89
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:05,602
There's hundreds of things that you hear
about every day and

90
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:09,564
it does probably kind of numb you,
because you hear so many of them.

91
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:13,432
Absolutely. AIDS in Africa
can concerns me, war concerns me.

92
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,031
ou don't really know where to begin.

93
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,391
Are there things that we could be doing
differently? Most definitely.

94
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:23,956
Is there more help that we could
be providing fellow man? Absolutely, but

95
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,950
time, money...

96
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,120
There's things that are standing
in the way of making that happen.

97
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,236
STS9: Sound Tribe Sector 9.

98
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,867
Musicians and Artists.
Touring for 10 years.

99
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,339
Own and operate independent
record label/1320 Records.

100
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,146
I think it is important to realize that

101
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,253
there are so many people who morally
disagree with what's going on.

102
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,930
You know, poverty, war,  everything.

103
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:55,815
All of us care, but we just don't know
what to do about it.

104
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:59,523
We don't want to sound stupid or we don't
want to sound like we are un-American,

105
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,299
or that "we're not supporting our troops"

106
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,296
people who are our friends.

107
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,529
You know, understanding that
we look to the institutions

108
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,414
and the government to answer
a lot of these things when really,

109
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:11,284
where things get done is people.

110
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,056
You have to care

111
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:20,540
and if you don't care, then,
I don't know man...

112
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:22,506
I don't know.

113
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,630
7 days before graduation.

114
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:45,361
On the bigger issues, the war in Iraq,
global warming,

115
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,990
you know, the big worldwide issues.
I see less activism.

116
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:54,459
Some of that, I think,
is they've just been overexposed.

117
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,788
They know it's important
but it seems so big

118
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:01,116
and so, "What can I do?
I'm just one person".

119
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,586
Leo Durocher was a baseball
manager decades ago.

120
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:09,041
Famous guy, very cantankerous
and clever and witty.

121
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,260
And he used to say
nice guys finish last.

122
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,652
And everybody thought it was
so cute and so accurate.

123
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,125
If you think about it a little,

124
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,960
it's a gigantic condemnation
of a social structure

125
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,303
that being nice should
consign you to failure.

126
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:27,839
But that's exactly
the world that we live in.

127
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,878
We live in a world whose institutions
are structured in such a way

128
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,753
that you have to be nasty to get ahead.

129
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,289
The culture communicates,

130
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,378
"Nice guys finish last, garbage rises.
Learn that lesson and you'll be okay."

131
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,756
In bailout news,
top managers continue to offer

132
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,989
multi-million dollar pay outs
to senior employees.

133
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,986
The culture communicates,

134
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:51,039
"injustice is forever",
"poverty is forever",

135
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,692
"violence is forever".

136
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:58,652
Eek out a niche,
do the best you can.

137
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,680
But it's all forever.

138
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:07,211
If some of these negative things
were happening on my street,

139
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,937
you'd better be out there
trying to fix it.

140
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,441
But today it's not,
it's not happening in front of me.

141
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:17,513
The word that you've used throughout
this whole deal is 'apathy,'

142
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:19,732
and I'd say that we're very apathetic.

143
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,790
It's not that people think
that poverty is fine

144
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,311
or war is fine,

145
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:29,274
or degradation and cynicism
and violence is all over...

146
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:32,539
that all that and all
that we know is fine.

147
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:33,870
Nobody thinks it's fine.

148
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,772
It's just that everybody thinks
there's no alternative.

149
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:39,576
Everybody thinks that's the way it is.
Like gravity, or like aging.

150
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,112
In other words,
"What are you talking about?

151
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,585
There's no point in a social
movement against aging.

152
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,438
There's no point in a social
movement against gravity."

153
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:50,291
In our reality, nothing will change.

154
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:52,002
Unless,

155
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,677
I don't know, unless some more college
students stand on street corners and picket.

156
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:58,913
Maybe that'll help.

157
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:00,720
And so, when you say,

158
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,129
"Come be an activist,
oppose that stuff,"

159
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,313
it's an actual belief
that it's a fool's errand.

160
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,184
That's the problem.

161
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,449
This is the violence of institutions,
indifference,

162
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,143
inaction and decay,

163
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,328
and only a cleansing
of our whole society

164
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,766
can remove this sickness
from our souls.

165
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,953
We live in a 'Me' Generation.

166
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,077
Therein lies the conflict.

167
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:31,754
And the conflict is how do we live
in a 'Me' Generation?

168
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,276
What is the 'Me' Generation?

169
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,178
What is the 'Me' Generation?

170
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,846
On a Volleyball game, you're a team.
And then in this it's just me.

171
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,696
Teenagers who gossip
are actually more popular.

172
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,898
People have come to expect
global climate change.

173
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:55,941
Breaking entertainment stories
you need to hear.

174
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,192
The first thing I'm unpacking
is a box of condoms.

175
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,872
Poor and unemployed...

176
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:11,886
I think the notion of individualism
has a long history in the United States.

177
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,595
And things that are good
for the community such as

178
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,555
preserving the environment

179
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,952
or having decent wages for everyone,

180
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:22,601
or have looked at the world and said,

181
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,295
"I want to change this
and I am going to make the time"

182
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:29,480
those sort of societal values
get thrown by the wayside.

183
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:34,995
It's a generation that
has no sense of the future,

184
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:37,880
no sense of civic responsibility.

185
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,004
I don't mean this as a criticism.

186
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:44,157
I believe the media
and the society are generating this.

187
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,690
It also has to do with
how we're just selfish.

188
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,909
It's always about,
"Me, me, me,"

189
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:54,459
and we kind of take all the things
that we have for granted.

190
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,151
Most definitely it has become
a 'Me' Generation,

191
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:04,254
and I think that we all are taught
self confidence and...

192
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,410
People have a sense of entitlement.

193
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,661
We're the most important
person in the world

194
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:12,179
and that transfers over into adulthood.

195
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,488
There'd been a movement for a while

196
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,562
about individualism that
really began in the '70s,

197
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:25,176
but that wasn't applied
to kids until the early '80s,

198
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,585
when the self-esteem
programs hit the schools.

199
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:32,562
And if you look in the media as well,
and in popular culture,

200
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:35,574
they we're taught things like,
"believe in yourself",

201
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:40,487
"you can be anything you want to be"
and putting yourself first.

202
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:42,801
It's a total lie,

203
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,257
it's a total lie.  There are two lies
in the self-esteem movement:

204
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,729
The first is "you can be
whatever you want to be",

205
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,346
which is just demonstrably untrue.

206
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:56,464
And the second is that
your value is innate.

207
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,187
In other words, you're a wonderful
person no matter what you do,

208
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:02,519
you're a great person.

209
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,674
I tell my children every day
that they're special.

210
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:08,732
I tell them that I love them,
I tell them that they can do anything.

211
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,236
But I also am realistic with them.

212
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:15,421
I tell them that they can do anything
if they prepare themselves,

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,193
if they become a certain type of person
and have an understanding of history.

214
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:27,149
We live in a society that prizes
politeness over righteousness.

215
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,478
If you don't take the time
to tell them in the house

216
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,634
what their outside behavior should be,

217
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,899
then it's your fault when
they're outside acting a fool.

218
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,086
And then they grow up to be assholes.

219
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,334
There are a lot of enabling parents.

220
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:47,184
The thing about parent and kids
today is that they're much closer

221
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:53,017
and the communication is much
more open than it has been in the past.

222
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,472
So they're almost kind of like friends.

223
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:01,195
We have had many situations
where parents come in

224
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:06,013
and they do not want their kids to have
the consequences of what has happened,

225
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,786
and they enable them and they come in
and they fight with the principal.

226
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:14,034
And, you know, I just think what
a disservice that is to the kid.

227
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:18,567
What a disservice to think that
whatever you do is fine,

228
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,342
and I will fight for you

229
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:24,526
and you do not have to pay
the consequences of your failure.

230
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:55,877
They're told that
they are 'Me' Generation,

231
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:00,315
but they're encouraged to relate
to the world in that way:

232
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,307
To basically be narcissistic
in their relation to the world.

233
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,871
I don't like liberals.
I'm going to be honest.

234
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:15,848
I just think it's hard to label
the entire generation something...

235
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:20,445
...that all of us are the same,
which is definitely not true.

236
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,125
In the late eighteenth century,
when working people around Boston

237
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:38,102
were running around newspapers,
they complained bitterly about

238
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,525
the industrial system that
was being imposed on them.

239
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:46,122
I'm quoting now, what they called
"the new spirit of the age,

240
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:50,243
gain wealth, forgetting all but self".

241
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:54,966
That's supposed to be the 'Me' Generation,
but this was a hundred and fifty years ago.

242
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:01,528
Coming from a business point of view,
from the point of view of any rulers,

243
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:05,236
independence is the last thing that
the managers want

244
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:11,724
and attempt to crush this independence
and to shape people into malleable,

245
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,736
obedient, apathetic,

246
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,947
separated, atomized individuals.

247
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:24,103
The ideal social unit is a pair:
you and a television set.

248
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,751
Just about the only thing that
can make a ten year old

249
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:29,499
sit still long enough for you
to catch your breath.

250
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:34,232
If you can impose a society
constructed of such units,

251
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:38,668
then you've got the country pretty
much under control, even without force.

252
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,600
Kids do not evaluate things.

253
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,624
They do not really dig into stuff the way
that they need to in order to analyze it,

254
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:52,835
and that's part of the
multi-task generation.

255
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:02,203
They're watching the television,
they've got their computer on,

256
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:04,453
they're on their cellphone
all at the same time.

257
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,109
And I'm guilty of it.

258
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,757
A ton of kids are walking around,
all tuned into their iPods and,

259
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,743
you know, texting and stuff like that.

260
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:16,270
They're literally sheltering themselves
away from everything else out there.

261
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:20,607
We may not demonstrate
and aren't as active

262
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,089
as generations of the '60s and '70s,

263
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,021
but a big part of that is because we
haven't gone outside for our entire lives.

264
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,941
We've been inside, on the Internet.

265
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,225
It's true.

266
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:36,197
It has everything to do with our
alienation from nature. Absolutely.

267
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,666
The means of how we sustain ourselves,
how we survive.

268
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,539
The man who doesn't know how to fish,
who doesn't know how to hunt,

269
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:47,021
who doesn't know how to farm,
who's completely dependent

270
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:51,324
upon a government or some sort of
system that's in place for him to eat,

271
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,946
breathe, survive.

272
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:58,309
For thirty thousand generations
of human history

273
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,931
we grew up within nature,

274
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:03,108
and we got our cues and our
learning experiences by

275
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:07,709
checking out the wind and learning
how to negotiate rivers.

276
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,622
And then all of a sudden,
three generations ago,

277
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,528
the lessons that we're learning
from nature diminished down

278
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,878
to damn close to zero for many people,

279
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:20,817
and the electronic environment
is a much colder environment

280
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,373
compared to the natural one.

281
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,359
You are more than welcome,

282
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:28,298
when you're done, to quietly listen
to your mp3 player.

283
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,152
If I, or the people around you,

284
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,171
have to hear what your
favorite song is, I take it.

285
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,356
Ok?  If I see your cell phone,
same thing.

286
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,408
That means that all weekend
you'd have to go without it,

287
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,983
which I understand is just like probably
removing your right leg

288
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,068
or both legs for some of you guys.

289
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,816
I've seen tears, people crying,

290
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,563
"You can't do this to me!"
Yes, I can.

291
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,904
The research shows that
you can't really multi-task.

292
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:58,950
What it is,
is it's time-splicing so their attention

293
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,028
is switching from one thing to the next.

294
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:07,026
And the research is showing that
the brain is actually changing

295
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,502
in young children
to allow them to do that.

296
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:14,077
So what we've got is
this big ADD generation.

297
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:17,519
And you come into a classroom
where you want to take a poem

298
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,028
or a piece of literature and
you want to dig into it for a half hour,

299
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:24,173
forty-five minutes, and really get into
the depth of it

300
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,258
they don't have the patience for that.

301
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,131
They just don't have the patience
for that deep thought and analysis,

302
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:34,070
and that bothers me because
you need those skills.

303
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:37,645
But if you grow up in an
electronic environment,

304
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:42,080
then you may have a kind
of an empathy deficit of some kind.

305
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,840
You won't be able to make rich,
intense human contacts.

306
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,110
You won't be able to love
somebody totally,

307
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,042
you won't be able to feel deep,
deep sorrow when somebody dies.

308
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:02,139
And we need empathy
to prevent wars in Iraq.

309
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:14,354
I am outraged that
this generation of kids

310
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:18,789
was not more concerned and
outraged at that war.

311
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,225
I don't understand why
they didn't react like we did.

312
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:25,741
I mean, when we were in Vietnam,

313
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,852
I was expelled from school
for walking out in protest

314
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,838
when Nixon invaded Cambodia.

315
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:35,273
The kids today, it's just like,
"Oh yeah, the war in Iraq."

316
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:40,636
I sat here in my classroom on that
television and we watched 9/11 happen.

317
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:43,119
Teacher ran down and said,

318
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,469
"Turn on your TV,
something horrible is happening."

319
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:49,540
I turned on the television:
we watched that airplane.

320
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:06,157
We watched that airplane
crash into the tower

321
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,540
and kid in the back is going, "Cool!"

322
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:12,347
I said, "This isn't a movie, you guys.

323
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:16,054
This is real.
This just really happened.

324
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,735
You know, that's not a special effect."

325
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:31,115
The current generation of kids
are literally saturated with media,

326
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,697
with some kind
of mass media communication.

327
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,345
You know, sometimes ten,
twelve hours a day.

328
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,854
And when you're surrounded
by an environment in that way,

329
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:42,402
you have to be shaped by it.
That's how culture works.

330
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:46,209
Culture shapes identity, culture
shapes how we understand the world.

331
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,226
Nielsen Media Research shows
that the average man,

332
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:57,132
woman and child watch as much
as four hours of television a day.

333
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,343
This does not include
time spent on the Internet

334
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,561
or playing video games.

335
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:07,195
So with this much time spent
sitting in front of a screen,

336
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:10,141
what exactly are we staring at?

337
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:13,484
What is shaping us?

338
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,930
A soldier calling home to check in
with the world at large,

339
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,504
to be connected as to what's happening,
would most likely get a response

340
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:32,583
of something to do with Lindsay Lohan
is back in rehab,

341
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:34,801
or Paris Hilton went back to jail.

342
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,853
That's the news of the day.

343
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,700
Do you know anything else
that's going on right now?

344
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,878
That's important?

345
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:43,978
-  Yeah.
- No.

346
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:46,718
First in news at 8:03,
Paris Hilton out of jail this morning.

347
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,505
Was she given special treatment?

348
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:52,278
Who cares? Reporters wanted
to know how did she look so good.

349
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:57,045
The media are aggressively dumb.

350
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,381
They pander.
Of course, we pander.

351
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:02,838
We're dumb, I'll admit it.

352
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,287
Welcome back,
we know you're jonesing for it

353
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:08,332
today's Britney Spears' disaster update.

354
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,170
Media and Propaganda Conference;
University of Windsor, Canada.

355
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,017
Mass media are mostly for diversion.

356
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:22,797
Take a look at the tabloids.

357
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:26,339
They may have a quarter of a page
on their national affairs.

358
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:30,775
But that's what the mass media are,
they are to divert the public,

359
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,026
get them out of their hair.

360
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,832
That's pretty explicit.

361
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:41,831
It's explicit among public intellectuals,
media leaders and others.

362
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,909
Now, the public just... they're called,

363
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,855
'Ignorant, meddlesome outsiders.
We've got to get rid of them so we,

364
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:51,695
the responsible men,
can do things properly.'

365
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,296
Political apathy is a rational
choice in many ways

366
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:00,731
for most people because that's the fare
that's fell up to most of us.

367
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,710
Think more about Anna Nicole Smith

368
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:10,529
than about 655,000 Iraqis who
have been killed in the war.

369
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,832
When the city of New Orleans drowned,

370
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:20,294
the corporate media in that case did the
right thing.  They raced to New Orleans.

371
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,663
Now, the Bush administration
did respond quickly on one issue

372
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:28,172
they said,
"You are not to film the bodies."

373
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:30,456
See, a side effect
of the Bush administration

374
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:33,534
not responding to the catastrophe
in New Orleans

375
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:36,381
is that when the network
reporters went down,

376
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:40,717
they shocked our country,
they galvanized the nation.

377
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,198
Could you imagine if, for just one week,

378
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:10,839
we had seen those images
on the ground in Iraq?

379
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,963
We saw the babies dead, we saw
the women with their legs blown off,

380
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:22,358
the cluster bombs from Iraq to Lebanon.

381
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,893
We saw the soldiers dead and dying.

382
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:33,315
There was a poll done in the United States
just recently that asked Americans,

383
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,532
"How many Iraqis
do you think have died?"

384
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,982
They said somewhere under ten thousand.

385
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,822
Well, the British Medical Journal
The Lancet published

386
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:48,673
a Johns Hopkins University study that
says more than 655,000 Iraqis have died.

387
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:54,399
And a more recent study says
more than a million Iraqis have died.

388
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,810
But in the United States,
most people don't think that.

389
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,915
And it's not because people are stupid.

390
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:03,386
people are good media consumers.

391
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,962
They take in, they absorb what
they watch and read.

392
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,120
Could you imagine if, for one week,
we saw those real images on the ground?

393
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,157
The dead and dying on all sides?

394
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,686
Americans are a compassionate people.
They would say, "No.

395
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,972
War is not the answer
to conflict in the 21st century."

396
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,999
How do you see,
just being a media personality

397
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:45,449
do you see the media affecting
the youth culture at all?

398
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,613
Particularly news media?

399
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,565
I mean, we do our best
to affect youth culture

400
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,396
because that's where the ad dollars are.

401
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,601
TV shows, news programs,
variety programs,

402
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:58,097
soap operas were created to sell soap.

403
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:00,053
That's what they were created for.

404
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:02,591
But it doesn't surprise me
when people criticize,

405
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:05,670
you know, CNN, Fox News,
the celebrity shows...

406
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,958
It's like people really don't understand

407
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,621
what TV and media is for.

408
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:14,324
It's to sell you things.  You'd be lucky
if you get some entertainment out of it.

409
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:22,645
Bit by bit, I found out how
the Vietnam war started

410
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:28,428
and that probably was the beginning
of my politicization of my life.

411
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:31,341
And then after that, of course,
travelling around the world

412
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,004
and then finding out about
how most of the world lives.

413
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,995
Then I immigrated to Canada
and I actually wanted to be a filmmaker,

414
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,992
I wanted to make documentary films
and show people

415
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:44,738
some of the stuff that
I'd seen all over the place.

416
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:48,274
So, I started a film-making commune,
right here in this house actually.

417
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,936
And we've been making all kinds
of experimental films,

418
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:55,223
so, why don't we package
some of our really powerful messages

419
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,553
into thirty and sixty second packets

420
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,297
and try to raise a little bit of money,
and actually air them on television?

421
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:04,792
In your living room is the factory.

422
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,495
The product being manufactured...

423
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,116
is you.

424
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:22,475
Over the last ten years here
at Adbusters we have produced

425
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:25,720
dozens of thirty-second social messages

426
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,632
that tackle all the big issues of our time,

427
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:32,585
from obesity to media concentration
to climate change.

428
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:42,695
And when we approached ABC and NBC
and CBS and MTV and Fox,

429
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,187
and tried to buy 30 seconds of airtime
to air some of these messages of ours,

430
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:49,768
they all said no.

431
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,849
So,

432
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:56,800
what does that tell you?
It tells you that our public airwaves

433
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,130
aren't public anymore.

434
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:03,290
That we, the people,
own those public airwaves.

435
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:05,495
They legally belong to you and me,

436
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,281
and the FCC leases those airwaves
out to the broadcasters

437
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:12,444
who are then supposed to act in,
of course in their own business interest,

438
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,730
but also in the public interest
and they do not.

439
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:19,101
These guys have six million
dollars to spend.

440
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:22,803
We are not going to sell you a lousy
twenty-five thousand dollars of airtime

441
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:26,714
for your spot and then piss of these
multimillion dollar sponsors that we have.

442
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:32,955
That was a big shock for me at that time.

443
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:37,657
I was a guy who was born in Estonia,
and in my country

444
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:41,318
for fifty years you weren't allowed
to speak back against the government.

445
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,650
You weren't...

446
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,647
and if you did speak back
against the government,

447
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:47,517
they'd put you in a mental asylum
or you'd suffer in some other way.

448
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:49,473
You'd never get a decent job or whatever.

449
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,677
And here I was, many years later in this

450
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:56,213
cradle of democracy,
the land of the free here,

451
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,084
and all of a sudden I discover that,

452
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,745
here, you are not allowed
to speak back against the sponsor.

453
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,942
They spend more time watching television

454
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:18,098
everybody believes that when you're
spending more time with the media

455
00:31:18,198 --> 00:31:19,388
than you are in the classroom,

456
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,801
the media have a profound impact
upon your life as well.

457
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,961
Dr. Kunkel, thank you very much
for joining us today

458
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:27,667
and I look forward to your testimony.

459
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,872
Thank you.  Good afternoon Mr. Chairman.

460
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:32,560
With the help of a number
of fine colleagues,

461
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,765
including several who are
here with us today,

462
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:38,776
I've conducted extensive research on
media content and effects over the years.

463
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:43,644
Advertisers claim that kids today are more
savvy than they've ever been in the past,

464
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,221
but when you really get down to it in
terms of children's cognitive abilities,

465
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:50,135
an eight year old today

466
00:31:50,235 --> 00:31:54,170
doesn't understand the persuasive intent
of advertisements any better

467
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,540
than an eight year old in the past did,
say, when I was a child.

468
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,114
And a magic box turns the TV into a safe
and happy haven. Simply what matters.

469
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,384
And, in fact, what the evidence
shows is that

470
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:10,022
the more the kids are immersed
in the consumer culture,

471
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,520
the more they're exposed
to these messages,

472
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,892
the more unhealthy they are,
the more they're depressed,

473
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:17,470
the more they're anxious, the more
they have problems with their parents.

474
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:22,088
It is a form of systematic child abuse
and I think it is absolutely crazy.

475
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,658
There is a lot of truth to the notion
that kids are bombarded with advertising

476
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:34,362
for things that are not particularly
healthy for them.

477
00:32:34,462 --> 00:32:36,900
No question that large
numbers of young children

478
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,647
have televisions in their own rooms.

479
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,685
Who's to blame here?
The parents!

480
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:44,223
Let me tell you my schedule, ok?

481
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:47,718
I get up in the morning at six o'clock.
I am out of the door by seven o'clock.

482
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:51,254
It takes me an hour to get to work.
So I get there at eight o'clock,

483
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,000
and I'm there until five.
I drive an hour back home,

484
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,288
I get home at six.
We cook dinner,

485
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:59,534
we give him a bath,
we clean up the house a bit.

486
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:02,654
It's now about seven thirty
by the time everything's done.

487
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:04,360
He goes to bed at eight o'clock.

488
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:07,730
We don't have the time to sit there and

489
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:11,558
calculate what they're watching,
and when and where and how.

490
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:13,971
You can't be there every minute
of the day, you can't.

491
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,592
The media industries,
of course, always tell us,

492
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,088
"Isn't it just the
parents' responsibility?"

493
00:33:19,188 --> 00:33:21,626
And then they spend
hundreds of billions of dollars

494
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:24,955
to influence the child
to influence the parent.

495
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:29,032
Mom, I need one minute.
One teensy-weensy minute

496
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,986
to make your day, 'cause I've got
with me the toy

497
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:35,232
that could change
the way you look at toys.

498
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:36,332
I'm sold.

499
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,758
And if the parents would say 'no'

500
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:49,336
billions and billions of times based
on the billions of requests

501
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:52,124
that are based on billions
of influence attempts

502
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:54,246
that come from all the commercials,

503
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:56,659
all would be well.
But surprise!

504
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,112
Parents like to please their children.

505
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:12,719
When you have a culture of people

506
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:16,089
who spend four to five hours a day
watching television,

507
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,500
and every seven minutes
there's two minutes of commercials,

508
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,370
over and over,
we've become familiar.

509
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,865
And when we go into the store
and see that thing,

510
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,403
subconsciously,
when we pick that up and buy it,

511
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,774
there's a certain amount
of comfort that comes with that.

512
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,063
Certain amount of safety.

513
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:36,684
I know I learned in class that,

514
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,928
when we learned about advertising
in Health class or somewhere,

515
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:43,632
that it influences you,
even if you don't think it does.

516
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:47,460
But, I am not a materialistic
person at all,

517
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,996
I don't care about... Shush!
I'm not!  I'm not like,

518
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:53,617
"Oh my god, I have to have the shiny car
and I have to have this."

519
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,490
I'm just really happy
with whatever I have.

520
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,277
I don't ask for a lot, and I don't get
influenced by billboards saying...

521
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:00,898
- Where is your iPod right now?
- Shhh, you know what...

522
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,062
The one that you have plugged
into your ear all day?

523
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:06,931
I like it because of the music,
not because it's shiny or expensive.

524
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,511
Like it's never advertised, ever.

525
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:16,168
I don't think that it's possible
to grow up in a culture

526
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:17,999
where, from the moment
you were a little baby crawling

527
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,871
around the TV set in your living room,

528
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,076
you've been told
a certain kind of a message

529
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:25,488
and you've been told
that certain brands are really cool.

530
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:28,525
And then when you're a teenager
or in your early twenties,

531
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,688
you can suddenly sit back and say,

532
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,018
"No, no, this hasn't had
any effect on me."

533
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:36,929
Bullshit!  It's had a profound
effect on you.

534
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:42,837
When I talk about consumer culture
and I talk about how consumerism

535
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:44,668
tries to define who we are,

536
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,662
I raised this question in one
of my classes and I said,

537
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,908
"Why do you think Americans
buy diamond rings

538
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,276
when they want to get engaged
to someone and is that natural?"

539
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:59,105
And people did not
know the answer to that.

540
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,352
And, of course, we know this
is a fairly recent phenomenon:

541
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:05,596
It's the diamond industry that makes
this move through advertising

542
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,468
to associate a diamond ring.

543
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,632
And so the student
raises her hand and says,

544
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:12,711
"Yeah, okay, I get that.
It's all very well,

545
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:18,078
but I still feel if my fiancé doesn't
give me a two karat diamond ring,

546
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:21,614
if he gives me anything less than that,
I'll throw it back in his face."

547
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,940
Now, the good thing about that comment
is that everybody else in that class went,

548
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,146
"What?"

549
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:32,557
and it was a great learning moment
because then we could explore:

550
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,010
Why do you think that way?
Where do you get these ideas from?

551
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:38,881
And, why do you feel that
you need to judge

552
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:42,833
the most intimate relationship
between two human beings

553
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:47,452
on the basis of how much money
has been spent on this?

554
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:53,609
I've seen a kid with
a CD player be ostracized

555
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:56,231
because he has a CD player.

556
00:36:57,396 --> 00:37:02,055
It just creates this wall in between
you and someone who can't have that.

557
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:05,550
We have to create wants.

558
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:10,418
We have to direct people to what were
called the more superficial things of life,

559
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:12,665
like fashionable consumption.

560
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,744
And if we can do this,
then we can control them.

561
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,780
The government has tried to respond to

562
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,817
our demands for more.

563
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,980
That's why, as soon as 9/11 happened,

564
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,894
they said, "Hey, go out and buy stuff".

565
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,642
You know, because that's
what it's based on.

566
00:37:28,742 --> 00:37:31,429
That's what is really going to make
this society go round.

567
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:34,924
Too many people have the wrong idea
of Americans as shallow,

568
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:36,963
materialistic consumerists.

569
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,918
And I encourage you all
to go shopping more.

570
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:42,413
And that's what we did.
We followed orders.

571
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,032
The ads that I see everyday
are trying to make an effort,

572
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:51,858
so it's really easy to just buy
the green Samsung Razor that

573
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,686
donates fifty cents to global warming.

574
00:37:55,786 --> 00:38:00,304
Like, "Oh, I did my job.
I feel morally ok with myself now."

575
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,050
Now, the consumer culture
or consumer message

576
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,585
doesn't talk about the world.
The consumer message talks about me.

577
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:27,889
In that sense, the movement
of advertising into every nook

578
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,385
and cranny of culture
shouldn't surprise anyone.

579
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:33,339
And over the course of the 20th century,
and now into the 21st century,

580
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:37,625
advertising has colonized more and more
of the spaces within which we live.

581
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:43,949
With an age group ranging from 18 to 29
as their key demographic,

582
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:48,525
advertisers feed on the lust of our
generation's desire for material goods,

583
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:51,230
resulting in more products to be made

584
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,309
and the necessity for more products
to be advertised,

585
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,847
consumed and disposed of.

586
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:00,175
Never mind the effects
this may have on our planet.

587
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:05,459
But with this excess of consumerism,

588
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,704
how too can this affect
the identity of our generation?

589
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:10,993
I think what we are all

590
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,780
subconsciously deciding is
the 'Me' Generation,

591
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,132
is the stuff that's readily
available and out there.

592
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,021
The homogeny.

593
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:24,307
Homogeny is defined as a correspondence
in form or structure

594
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:26,387
owing to a common origin.

595
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,090
And in the case of today's generation,

596
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:34,958
this means a world where
everything looks the same.

597
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:01,294
The homogeny that happens in America
creates a cultural ignorance.

598
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,123
"I want it now, I want it fast."

599
00:40:04,223 --> 00:40:06,911
You know, the convenience store
is where I spend all my time.

600
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,865
It destroys the beauty of the country.

601
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,564
When I was in college, I knew
I wanted to do music for a living.

602
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,185
So I knew that I had to get a job
that was going to allow me

603
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:22,014
the freedom creatively and
physically to do music.

604
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:28,047
Working in a bookstore or a record store
was the only thing that made sense,

605
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:30,835
so I went to every bookstore and
every record store in my neighborhood

606
00:40:30,935 --> 00:40:32,166
until I got a job.

607
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:36,160
And then I moved on to a black-owned
bookstore Nkiru Books.

608
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:41,070
Mos Def helped me out with a lot of
different events we were doing there.

609
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,856
Me and him ended up purchasing the store,
running it for a couple of years.

610
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,893
We made it more of a community thing
and we developed a program

611
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:51,430
in the high schools that was based
on poetry readings we used to do.

612
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,209
But we weren't prepared
to handle skyrocketing rents

613
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:01,873
of Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn.

614
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,909
You know, independent bookstores
have the same problems.

615
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:09,528
You have a major company like a
Barnes & Noble that will come up.

616
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:11,900
The only thing the independent
bookstores had was

617
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,939
this home feel where you could come in

618
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,852
and you would know the person
who'd worked at the counter,

619
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:17,642
you could come and see
your favorite author.

620
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,968
At some point the majors started
to figure out how to do that.

621
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,798
Put in cafes, start bringing authors in,

622
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,627
putting couches in and making them
feel more like an independent store.

623
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:29,707
Brand new hardcover

624
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:32,329
you can get it at
Barnes & Noble for ten dollars,
fifteen dollars.

625
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,367
At an independent bookstore,
you got to pay the thirty,

626
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:37,196
or else the guy ain't gonna make
no money and they'll go bankrupt.

627
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:42,314
So the consumer is just going to keep on
to the bigger bookstore all the time.

628
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,924
We saw our community go from

629
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:55,045
two-lane dirt roads,

630
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,667
trees and forests and lakes,

631
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:03,866
to Lowe's and Kroger's and miles
and miles and miles of shops.

632
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,613
And that's something that
we just were always

633
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:07,610
so surrounded with and just
couldn't understand.

634
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,230
What is destroying the beauty
of our community?

635
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:17,596
And when we started the band that was
something that just really influenced us.

636
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,672
We drive all night
coming back from Alabama

637
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:27,165
or North Carolina or Florida,
in my dad's Mercury Villager van.

638
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:31,118
We'd literally play three or four places
in each town.

639
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:34,114
We'd go to this place and then work
and play that two or three times,

640
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:38,066
and then you finally sold it out so
now we're gonna put you in this place.

641
00:42:38,981 --> 00:42:40,438
People were catching on.

642
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,809
We had a particularly
hard decision to make

643
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:45,264
of how were we going to release
the record that we're working on.

644
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:46,762
We were working on it
for a very long time.

645
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,008
So we wanted to just
really make sure that

646
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,255
we looked at all of our options.

647
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:55,291
And on the outside, the perception
of going with the label

648
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:57,787
looks really cool because
they're giving you money

649
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,660
and what they say that
they're going to do

650
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,615
is they're going to put it
in all the music stores

651
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,654
you're going to be in Best Buy,
you're going to do it all.

652
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:06,109
That's what they claim that
they're going to do.

653
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:09,395
We flirted around with different
companies for a little bit

654
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,932
and I tried to make something happen.
But it always came down to just

655
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:15,803
our gut feeling telling us
that we could...

656
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,965
We'd be better off in the long run
if we just did it ourselves.

657
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:22,376
So we just kept at it.

658
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,291
It meant more to us to know
that we had the freedom,

659
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:26,454
to know that we still could do
what we wanted even though

660
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:28,826
we had to work a little harder to do it
and didn't make as much money,

661
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:30,906
and didn't have as
much attention out there.

662
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:32,737
Because that's not what
we were going for.

663
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:39,643
Eventually, what became important to us
was this do-it-yourself culture,

664
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,720
without having to sell our souls,
if you will.

665
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,547
Or join the corporate system or get into
these things that we were kind of...

666
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:52,375
trying to escape from.

667
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,953
Because we grew up
in this suburban structure

668
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:01,528
everything looked the same.
And when we started touring, it was,

669
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:03,775
"Wow, everywhere looks the same!"

670
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,730
It's not just the South,
it's not just Georgia,

671
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,267
it's not just Stone Mountain,
it's really everywhere.

672
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:33,856
From advertising to consumerism,

673
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:37,600
the media has played a dominant role
in shaping today's culture.

674
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,679
Add to that the education
of our generation

675
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:43,259
what we are taught and who's teaching us

676
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:48,459
and the media has all but overshadowed
another vital institution.

677
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,705
How did I know what
I wanted out of my life?

678
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,185
It may sound weird, it is not necessarily
about the experience

679
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:55,824
but talking about what you learn.

680
00:44:56,157 --> 00:44:59,568
And I knew what I wanted out of life
by watching TV, not by going to school.

681
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,271
It's sad to say, I think a lot of them
are learning more from the media.

682
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:06,683
They're more excited about it,
they're more interested in it.

683
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,928
And so we're constantly
challenged to make education

684
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:12,092
more interesting, more exciting,

685
00:45:12,716 --> 00:45:14,089
attention-grabbing.

686
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,875
Is there anything remotely real
about the real world?

687
00:45:18,915 --> 00:45:21,703
Do you think what's really real is what
they teach you in an American history class?

688
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,117
Why? Why do you say that?

689
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:25,031
Why do I say that?

690
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:28,152
Because what I believe that I was
taught in History class in high school

691
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:31,813
is false information about what
actually happened in history.

692
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:39,510
I think the real problem is that we use
history as a way to comfort ourselves.

693
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:43,172
To tell uplifting stories,

694
00:45:43,504 --> 00:45:48,414
even to the extent that the story
of America is the story of struggle,

695
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:53,323
it's basically a struggle that always
comes out about right in the end.

696
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:58,191
We embrace a mythic notion of history,

697
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:01,686
rather than one in which
we are really willing

698
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:06,804
to look at the past in the eye
and come to terms with it.

699
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:09,966
The loss of history

700
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,126
is always important,
because if you don't have history

701
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,040
then you're stuck with the present.

702
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,326
And you're also stuck with
the word of authorities.

703
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,651
This loss of history in
the United States today

704
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:30,103
has created a possibility,
in fact the inevitability,

705
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:37,759
of a whole population being
bewitched by television,

706
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,793
by the political leaders,
by the media leaders.

707
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:50,116
And without history to give
some basis for judging

708
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:51,946
what is being thrown at them,

709
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,024
the population becomes a victim

710
00:46:56,357 --> 00:47:01,599
of whatever the authorities
decide needs to be done.

711
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:05,676
The world still walks in the shadow
of another world war.

712
00:47:05,776 --> 00:47:08,589
Nations could defend themselves
against missile attack.

713
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:11,335
Our allies concur
that now is the time to strike.

714
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:14,871
Our country is still the target
of terrorists who want to kill many.

715
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:16,993
We have a goal to disrupt,

716
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:21,819
dismantle and defeat al-Qaeda
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

717
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:26,188
The result is we get into war
after war after war.

718
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,722
The loss of history
is a matter of life and death.

719
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:38,961
Now is the time...

720
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:43,787
to rise from the dark and desolate
valley of segregation

721
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:46,367
to the sunlit path of racial justice.

722
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,483
Now is the time...

723
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:58,017
to lift our nation from
the quick sands of racial injustice

724
00:47:58,117 --> 00:48:01,678
to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time...

725
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,626
to make justice a reality
for all of God's children.

726
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:12,163
We grew up in the South and we never were
taught about the civil rights movement,

727
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:15,450
other than the 'I Have a Dream' speech.

728
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,737
Let freedom ring!
If America is to be a great nation,

729
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:20,984
this must become true.

730
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:25,394
Let freedom ring from
the Stone Mountain of Georgia!

731
00:48:26,683 --> 00:48:29,762
I lived in Stone Mountain.
I'm from Stone Mountain

732
00:48:30,636 --> 00:48:33,590
and barely anybody read the whole
speech to pick it out and ask,

733
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,835
why is Stone Mountain
mentioned in this speech?

734
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,785
Young people did not grow up learning
that this is a society

735
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:46,238
which is driven by class.

736
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:49,941
They grow up with the idea
that this is like one family.

737
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:52,646
Starts with the words
of the Constitution,

738
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:55,059
"We the people of the United States,"

739
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,845
and that's the impression we get.
That we're all together,

740
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:01,841
we all got together and fought
the revolution against England.

741
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,796
We all got together and formed
the Constitution.

742
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:07,749
The Constitution was formed
by fifty-five rich, white men.

743
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,451
Excluded were 20% of the population,
black slaves.

744
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:15,238
Excluded were working people;
excluded were Indians,

745
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:17,318
excluded were women.

746
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:19,606
But you don't learn
about this in school.

747
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:22,602
We were just talking about this
in my history class,

748
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:25,723
because we're not really learning
lessons of life in school

749
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:28,219
and it's just a bunch of busy work.

750
00:49:28,344 --> 00:49:32,421
I remember being able
to pass a history exam

751
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:36,207
because I was able to recite the words
to Blackman in Effect by KRS-One,

752
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,619
and he was talking about
the Byzantine Empire and Mesopotamia

753
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:42,365
and these were things that
I wasn't learning about in school.

754
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,399
Stone Mountain was owned by the KKK:

755
00:49:47,499 --> 00:49:52,309
the carvings on the mountain are the three
most prominent confederacy leaders.

756
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:57,676
If we were told that and given the history
of our own community,

757
00:49:58,258 --> 00:50:00,963
and to see at a younger age how wrong...

758
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:06,330
If we could be inspired by our teachers
about our own histories...

759
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,826
class would have been
much more interesting.

760
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:13,778
It's not that the teacher consciously
deceives the student,

761
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,687
it's that the teacher conforms
to what has been taught before

762
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:23,846
and the textbooks conform
to whatever the textbooks were before.

763
00:50:24,512 --> 00:50:28,381
Because if you step out of line,
if you start to do something different,

764
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:33,956
if for the first time in generations that
have been taught that Columbus is a hero,

765
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,952
the school teacher says,
"You know kids,

766
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:39,989
Columbus is not a hero."

767
00:50:40,946 --> 00:50:42,902
16th Century Priest,
Bartolome de las Casas,

768
00:50:43,002 --> 00:50:45,215
sailed with Columbus and estimates
nearly 3 million Native Americans

769
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,811
were killed at the hands of
Columbus and the Europeans.

770
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:55,841
Columbus killed, mutilated, kidnapped
and enslaved Indians for gold.

771
00:50:55,941 --> 00:51:01,125
The United States continues to observe
Columbus's arrival as a national holiday.

772
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,907
I mean, if a teacher starts
talking that way,

773
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,069
that teacher will be singled out.

774
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,397
And we shouldn't just pick on history.

775
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:20,139
You can have the same belief
if your language arts teacher

776
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,884
doesn't look at your essays critically
enough and does this rubber-stamp,

777
00:51:23,984 --> 00:51:26,921
'Oh very good, here's a smiley face.
You did a really good job.'

778
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:30,957
That would also be a crime.
In another way, it's kind of a lie.

779
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:34,951
I think it really depends
on what class, what teacher.

780
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:39,944
There are plenty of teachers who teach
because they thought it would be a good idea

781
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:43,896
and I can tell they don't like teaching,
they don't care about teaching that much,

782
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:46,684
those are the ones who will give you
the busy work.

783
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:48,182
I think that's what's
really the difference:

784
00:51:48,282 --> 00:51:50,928
I really think it's the teachers
and how much they care.

785
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:59,374
The loss of history
and the cynical views

786
00:51:59,474 --> 00:52:02,993
of today's education system
by both students and educators

787
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:06,530
is met with further challenge
by increasing class sizes,

788
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,358
and a series of governmental policies
whose systemic underfunding

789
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:13,645
often times does the opposite
of what it says it will.

790
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:17,306
The goals of No Child Left Behind
were admirable

791
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,260
and President Bush
deserves credit for that.

792
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,296
But beyond high school,

793
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:27,375
a recent survey conducted
by the U.S. Education Department

794
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,330
shows over 80% of tenth graders

795
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,825
still expect to move on to a four year
college or university

796
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:38,067
But, at what cost does this
post-high school education come?

797
00:52:40,397 --> 00:52:42,395
We've had to talk about
what we're going to do with him,

798
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:44,183
what we're going to pay for
and what we're not

799
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:49,010
and right now I can say that
we're willing to help and chip in,

800
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,338
but we're not going to have
$80,000 to pay for college.

801
00:52:54,294 --> 00:52:57,106
There's so much pressure to get
the perfect grades and everything

802
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,287
so you can get the scholarships
that are out there,

803
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:02,781
like my mom who was putting
all this pressure on me

804
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:06,443
all these last three years
I've been in high school to get top,

805
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:09,563
top grades because we can't afford
to pay for me to go to college.

806
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,768
So the only way I'm going to get
anywhere in life

807
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:14,681
is to have a scholarship to pay for it,
so I'm not in debt.

808
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:20,006
Now you have huge amounts
in loans at market,

809
00:53:20,106 --> 00:53:22,045
and even above, market rates.

810
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:25,332
So for kids coming through this process,

811
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:29,908
you start at a point where you are thinking
about having a springboard to your career.

812
00:53:30,008 --> 00:53:32,530
You're going to have to dedicate yourself

813
00:53:32,904 --> 00:53:35,359
to paying off those debts.

814
00:53:36,482 --> 00:53:38,271
You can't make your own choices.

815
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:42,557
Like maybe you graduate law school and
you'd like to be a public interest lawyer,

816
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:45,469
you don't have that choice
if you have a big debt.

817
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:47,217
You have to go into
a corporate law firm.

818
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:50,403
And pretty soon,
it's values get internalized.

819
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:54,206
You may think you can hold them off
and "I'll do what I want to do",

820
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:55,663
but life doesn't work like that.

821
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,701
When I went to go pick a career,

822
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,156
I wanted to pick a career
that would pay me a lot of money.

823
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,571
It's as simple as that.

824
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,442
I wanted to be financially stable
the rest of my life.

825
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:08,061
So even if I had the goals and hopes
and dreams to be a civil servant,

826
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:10,266
I wouldn't because
it wouldn't pay me enough.

827
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:17,880
What that is, its actually
indentured servitude.

828
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,127
It's brilliant what capitalism has done.

829
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:22,956
It gets people into debt very young,

830
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,870
and then for the rest of their lives

831
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,658
they're paying off the debt that
they have gotten themselves into.

832
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:31,278
And so, in fact, the more debt you're in,
the less freedom you have.

833
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:34,897
What if you took a fraction
of the military budget

834
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,310
that we spend on these insane weapons

835
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,223
and what if you used that instead
of having student loans,

836
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:41,845
you had student grants?

837
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,340
At that point you have invested
in the future of young people.

838
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,293
You can leave university and you will have
freedom to do what you really want.

839
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:51,873
Your individual freedom actually
has been enhanced

840
00:54:51,973 --> 00:54:54,078
by the fact that
you have taken public money

841
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:56,199
and you've invested it in this way.

842
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:15,671
When the second baby is born,

843
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:21,787
we will be spending
$16,640 a year on childcare.

844
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:23,909
And that's after tax money.

845
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:28,111
Well, you know Nicole
is having a C-section

846
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,608
so well be in the hospital
for the first four days.

847
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:34,976
After that Nicole is home
for the 6 weeks maternity leave,

848
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:36,349
we get these days.

849
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:37,598
Only six weeks?

850
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,177
Doctor says eight.  We'll take six.

851
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:44,795
That's a wild deal, taking your
six-week-old baby to day care.

852
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,167
Very, very scary.

853
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:49,730
And yet, if we actually
look at the condition

854
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,285
of the bottom 80% of Americans,

855
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:54,822
studies have shown
that the bottom 80%

856
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:57,901
have either seen their wages
decline or stagnate.

857
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:02,395
So today it takes two wage
earners in a family

858
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:07,096
to make the same wage
that one wage earner did in the 1970s.

859
00:56:07,928 --> 00:56:11,715
The average family is working
six and a half weeks more today

860
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:16,000
then they were in 1989,
and making the same amount of money.

861
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,914
So people are working harder

862
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:22,407
and yet you get these ideas which says
if you work hard you will succeed,

863
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:25,029
if you buy these commodities
you will be happy,

864
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:28,690
and there is a point at which
these ideas come into contradiction

865
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,562
with the reality of people's lives.

866
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,142
Our cable TV bill, our cable modem,

867
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:37,469
you know $150 dollars a month.
Cell phone bill, $120 dollars a month.

868
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,089
If we didn't have those things...
Do we need them?

869
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,961
No, I don't think we do.

870
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:44,875
But we want them

871
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:50,533
Of course consumerism makes people buy
things that they don't necessarily need,

872
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:54,444
but beyond that what are the other
economic factors that are driving it?

873
00:56:55,026 --> 00:56:57,980
And that has to do with the fact
that if your wages go down

874
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,727
and you need things,
you need to buy food,

875
00:57:00,827 --> 00:57:03,972
you need to buy health care, you're
going to do it with your credit card.

876
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:07,425
And that explains a large part
of the debt that Americans have today.

877
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:26,065
If everyone took that one chance
of going for their dream,

878
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:29,643
they might fail but at least they tried.

879
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:34,428
And the institutionalized education,
institutionalized jobs

880
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:37,257
are still going to be there.
They're institutions.

881
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:41,001
Senior year of college,

882
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:45,079
with career path this way
in front of me,

883
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:48,615
just getting a job and working
and paying off those student loans?

884
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:51,444
Or career path with
the band in front of me?

885
00:58:03,302 --> 00:58:09,293
It took courage and as one person
and one example,

886
00:58:09,393 --> 00:58:12,871
I can say nine years later,

887
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:18,738
that there is no job that would
compare with the happiness

888
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,982
and what I've gained from being
my own person for the last ten years,

889
00:58:23,523 --> 00:58:30,512
surrounded by people that share
that same desire to not be owned,

890
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:39,957
or to not buy into some other
version of what a happy life is.

891
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:49,443
Okay, Is everyone in here ready?

892
00:58:54,061 --> 00:59:01,384
I want to see the graphic
and hear the music in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

893
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:04,421
We watch and are influenced
by more TV than ever.

894
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:08,499
We're more globally connected,
we're more aware of the world around us.

895
00:59:08,957 --> 00:59:12,867
Meanwhile our schools and the cost of
living has skyrocketed over inflation,

896
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,364
while starting salaries
have hardly changed.

897
00:59:15,697 --> 00:59:19,108
We're a credit card generation,
mass consumers.

898
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:23,227
And because of it, homogeny
has made us a little less unique.

899
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,849
et we are told in the
self-esteem movement,

900
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:28,470
that we are special and can be
whatever we want to be.

901
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:30,425
Yet with little direction,

902
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:34,294
we find ourselves lost with in our
absolution of faith with the education,

903
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:38,372
parenting and media that
has helped shape who we are.

904
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:42,200
Yet today's issues
are not so clearly defined.

905
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:46,735
Civil rights and the struggle of class
still hangs over us like a dark cloud.

906
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:50,896
There is no draft,
instead we volunteer to fight.

907
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:56,263
ut with 18 to 29 year olds maintaining
the lowest registration and voting rate,

908
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:59,383
is it any wonder that
those elected into office put

909
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:03,460
18 to 29 year olds in harms way?

910
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:07,954
Meanwhile, we want to save our earth,

911
01:00:08,245 --> 01:00:11,740
but we're so intrinsically connected
to some form of a screen,

912
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,483
we hardly have enough time to look up
and see what the earth is saying.

913
01:00:18,688 --> 01:00:20,893
And with all the problems of the world,

914
01:00:21,393 --> 01:00:24,596
what is left of the hearts and the minds
of today's generation

915
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:27,550
to deal with today's issues?

916
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:30,421
Will we even try?

917
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,666
Roll it and take it.

918
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:37,245
Claire, start your intro.

919
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:38,992
Good morning Eagan High School

920
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:41,488
and welcome to a very special
edition of Eagan AM,

921
01:00:41,588 --> 01:00:45,216
I am Claire Freidman. Today we will be
departing from our normal format

922
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:47,230
to focus on the issue
of the War in Iraq.

923
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:07,700
We see so many images of war and after
a while we kind of just brush it off,

924
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,027
and we say, "Oh there's another bombing,
what can I do about it?"

925
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:17,894
In 1965, the population
on the United States

926
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:21,680
believed that the U.S. was out
to help the world.

927
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,802
And I mean they really believed it.

928
01:01:24,093 --> 01:01:26,298
Deep down inside,
that's what people believed.

929
01:01:26,398 --> 01:01:29,211
They believed that lawyers
were out for justice,

930
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,123
that doctors cared only about
the health of patients.

931
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:34,619
That companies were trying
to make people's lives better.

932
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,199
On and on and on.  Nowadays,

933
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:40,111
the reality is nobody
believes any of it.

934
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:44,064
Deep down inside, everybody knows
the war was for oil.

935
01:01:44,164 --> 01:01:46,020
Everybody knows the war was for power.

936
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,015
Everybody knows that
corporations seek profits

937
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:52,593
and will do anything to get them, and
don't give a damn about their employees,

938
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:54,465
and don't care about
the consumers either.

939
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:57,503
They just care about the bottom line.
Everybody knows this stuff.

940
01:01:57,919 --> 01:02:02,662
So then why isn't everybody as aroused
as we were in the 60s?

941
01:02:06,032 --> 01:02:09,943
I mentioned that I don't really care
much about what's going on,

942
01:02:10,043 --> 01:02:12,065
outside of my reality,

943
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:15,268
but its not that we don't care
about the world at large,

944
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:19,013
its that we want to know where to begin.

945
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:26,086
It's got to relate to you.

946
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:30,330
if you can paint a picture for how
something, a world issue, Iraq,

947
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,826
or whatever is going on in the world
relates to this child's life

948
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:34,699
then you have something there.

949
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,528
Last month we had one of
our own Eagan graduates,

950
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,565
Daniel Olsen of the class of 2005,
pass away.

951
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:44,393
To end this show this week
we present you with 52 servicemen

952
01:02:44,493 --> 01:02:48,845
and women from Minnesota
who have given their lives over seas

953
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:51,258
so that others may experience
the freedoms we enjoy.

954
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:53,296
Thank you for joining us today.

955
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,665
It's time for us to look at ourselves
in the mirror.

956
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:03,490
I think that were going to have
to have another cultural revolution

957
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:10,521
of a magnitude of the cultural revolution
that we experienced in the 1960s,

958
01:03:11,437 --> 01:03:15,556
but one which is going to return to...

959
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:20,549
a more modest

960
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,503
or a more disciplined

961
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:30,575
No, a more sustainable definition
of what freedom is.

962
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:35,152
Sustainability is to be made
by each of us.

963
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:40,478
From recycling, to the clothes you buy,
to where you shop, to eat locally.

964
01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:44,430
To being aware of where your dollar
goes and how its used.

965
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,802
It takes everybody
putting in a little effort,

966
01:03:46,902 --> 01:03:49,090
and you might not see the effort
that you put in pay off,

967
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:51,836
but it will in fact pay off someday
down the road,

968
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:53,417
because it always has.

969
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:57,287
The big major issues of humanity
have always been overcome

970
01:03:57,387 --> 01:04:01,156
throughout time through small words
of mouth and through small

971
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:05,525
ideas that became bigger ones
because they touched

972
01:04:05,857 --> 01:04:08,146
principles and values that we all share.

973
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:11,599
A year ago in assuming the task
of the Presidency,

974
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,469
I said that few generations
in all history

975
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:20,503
had been granted the role
of being the great defender of freedom

976
01:04:21,085 --> 01:04:25,329
in its hour of maximum danger.
This is our good fortune.

977
01:04:26,037 --> 01:04:29,323
Cultural revolutions have always
been driven by some sort of a rage

978
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:31,487
the wells up in people.

979
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,274
And now, in this information age of ours,

980
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:37,728
we have to find a new kind of rage
and a new kind of movement.

981
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:51,042
The ecological crisis, the psychological
crisis, and the political crisis.

982
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:53,704
The three biggest crises that exist

983
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:57,615
within this human experiment of ours
on planet earth right now,

984
01:04:57,715 --> 01:05:01,443
these are problems that we,
the rich people, have largely created.

985
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,604
We have to face that unflinchingly

986
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:08,932
and once we've faced that unflinchingly,
that will change us.

987
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:14,424
We can't talk about addressing the
corruption in people and in the world,

988
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:17,503
if we ain't addressing
the corruption in ourselves.

989
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,334
You see what I'm saying?

990
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,995
Don't pay attention to these stupid MCs
talking about they're players.

991
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:25,325
The real players got smart bombs.

992
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:29,735
You see?  And when they wanna play,
its no more game.

993
01:05:31,524 --> 01:05:33,189
That's the real deal.

994
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:36,143
So if we're gonna do this or
were gonna be doing this,

995
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:38,597
it ain't worth it if were gonna be up
here talking about

996
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:40,969
how good we are because
none of us is important

997
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:43,257
unless we're doing
something that's vital.

998
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,670
Everybody got the same amount
of energy in this room.

999
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,002
But who you gonna give it to?

1000
01:05:47,102 --> 01:05:49,831
You gonna give it to BET or MTV or Nike,

1001
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:52,327
or whoever the hell else is vying for it?

1002
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:54,699
And I say this because
nobody else says it,

1003
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,112
because we think that we're doing
something, we're revolutionary.

1004
01:05:57,212 --> 01:05:58,568
We're suckers,

1005
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,398
we're suckers, for real.

1006
01:06:02,063 --> 01:06:04,144
We gotta get off of that man.

1007
01:06:04,244 --> 01:06:07,289
We come here to these places
and its good to feel good, but

1008
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:10,176
we gotta know that we gotta do more.
We ain't doing nothing.

1009
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:12,506
It's young people like you,

1010
01:06:12,922 --> 01:06:14,462
all over the world, dying.

1011
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:17,166
Catching a bullet,
Tiananmen Square dudes.

1012
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:20,578
How many of us could have said that

1013
01:06:20,678 --> 01:06:22,825
we would have stood in front of
that tank if it was us?

1014
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:25,404
For real,

1015
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,856
think about that. I hope I didn't blow
anybody's vibe or high,

1016
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:31,770
but I had to say it.

1017
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:53,613
It was the most overwhelming
feeling in the world.

1018
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:57,067
You're overwhelmed with joy and fear

1019
01:06:57,167 --> 01:07:00,645
all those emotions all at once
are circling through your head.

1020
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,597
Having a kid is amazing because

1021
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:10,048
everything that you didn't do
or you didn't do well in life,

1022
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:14,291
you hope that you can teach your kid
to do things just a bit differently.

1023
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,686
As a young person
who feels disempowered,

1024
01:07:29,786 --> 01:07:32,182
who feels what difference can I make?

1025
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:39,879
We're all making a difference,
regardless.

1026
01:07:39,979 --> 01:07:41,710
Celebrate the fact

1027
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,829
that we live in a country
where freedom does exist.

1028
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,697
What we need to do is to create
an environment, through education,

1029
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:56,147
in which a greater proportion of the
population uses its freedom wisely.

1030
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,889
But it's not for me to tell you
how you should define freedom.

1031
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:07,963
But I guess I am enough of a scrooge
to say that if all you think freedom is,

1032
01:08:08,671 --> 01:08:12,249
is going out on a Saturday night
and drinking Budweiser

1033
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:14,662
and watching professional
football games.

1034
01:08:14,762 --> 01:08:19,155
And then heading down to the mall to buy
yet another pair of athletic shoes,

1035
01:08:19,255 --> 01:08:22,193
that somehow you're
missing out on something.

1036
01:08:22,775 --> 01:08:24,689
We can do better than that.

1037
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,973
No matter how lead you've been,

1038
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:34,009
or you consider yourself to have been, or
how indoctrinated or how trained you are.

1039
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,504
Given your moral strength and your
own truth, and your own inspiration,

1040
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:39,584
I think you can make a lot
out of this world,

1041
01:08:39,684 --> 01:08:41,955
and help some people along the way.

1042
01:08:44,494 --> 01:08:45,908
The information is there

1043
01:08:46,008 --> 01:08:48,987
and that's coming from someone
who didn't think it was there,

1044
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:52,565
and through just a little bit
of scratching the surface

1045
01:08:52,665 --> 01:08:55,103
come to become more confortable with my

1046
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:58,099
understanding of the world
and the things in the world,

1047
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,345
and if I can do that
I feel like anybody can

1048
01:09:00,445 --> 01:09:04,048
because I was one of the more cynical,
apathetic people.

1049
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:11,121
I think it is a problem that
people are willing to accept things,

1050
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:16,405
but I don't think to chastise or
challenge the people on it is the answer.

1051
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:19,318
So the key is to get
the information out there,

1052
01:09:19,418 --> 01:09:21,980
and hold the truth up against the lie.

1053
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,767
It's the history of ordinary people
fighting back against sometimes

1054
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:29,636
insurmountable odds to win
progressive change.

1055
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:36,542
And knowing that history,
knowing that we can make a difference,

1056
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:41,535
I think will motivate that 15 year old
not to simply buy things,

1057
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:45,113
but want to think of themselves
as a socially conscious individual

1058
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:46,944
that wants to change the world

1059
01:09:47,044 --> 01:09:50,814
in a way that's not just better for them
but better for everyone.

1060
01:09:53,185 --> 01:09:56,098
A famous physicist taught at MIT,

1061
01:09:56,198 --> 01:09:58,344
and he'd be asked at the begging
of the course,

1062
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,383
"What are you going to
cover this semester?"

1063
01:10:00,483 --> 01:10:02,297
And his standard answer was,

1064
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:06,332
"It doesn't matter what we cover,
it matters what we discover."

1065
01:10:09,536 --> 01:10:10,660
Discover.

1066
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:13,197
Find out who you are,
find your own path.

1067
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:15,694
In fact, its what plenty of people do.

1068
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:21,768
We've been talking about what
the external system tries to impose,

1069
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:24,057
but it doesn't necessarily succeed.

1070
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:28,176
We are a collective
and we have to work together.

1071
01:10:29,216 --> 01:10:31,421
You want to talk about
people who are activists

1072
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:34,167
like Martin Luther King,
he was not one voice.

1073
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:38,203
You don't hear about all the people
that were around him,

1074
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:40,491
helping that movement.

1075
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:54,845
I guess it was eight months after
Katrina, we came down here and saw

1076
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:58,340
the destruction first hand and wanted,
like a lot of people in the world,

1077
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,210
wanted to know if there was anything
we could do.  How could we help?

1078
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:11,613
And to donate in a way that helps
rebuild the lower ninth ward

1079
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:14,525
was one choice for us

1080
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,645
to do something that helped.

1081
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,041
I think the whole world was touched
by what happened here.

1082
01:11:32,141 --> 01:11:36,118
People like you coming back to rebuild
a community on their own.

1083
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,073
One of the great things about it is,
I want to make a correction,

1084
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:43,441
is we're not doing it on our own. We're
doing it off of the sweat of volunteers.

1085
01:11:44,856 --> 01:11:47,643
It's people from all over the country,
all over the world.

1086
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:50,223
Coming down here to see
what's happening

1087
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:52,178
and it's going to make a change for us.

1088
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:54,841
So you just step back and see that
y'all are doing a good job.

1089
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:56,547
You all are doing a good job.

1090
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:05,076
Look for people in your neighborhood
or in your school,

1091
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:11,567
who are doing something about
the injustices of the world,

1092
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:17,808
who are involved in some movement
to save the environment or to stop war,

1093
01:12:17,908 --> 01:12:21,136
or to help people who are in need.

1094
01:12:21,386 --> 01:12:25,962
Look for people like that
and consider that,

1095
01:12:26,062 --> 01:12:28,501
when you get out of your own shell,

1096
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:31,288
if you leave your living room
and television set

1097
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:37,571
and go and join other people who are
doing something to make life better.

1098
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:42,980
Life becomes more interesting to you

1099
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:47,473
and more fulfilling.

1100
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:50,801
Tell them about the people who,

1101
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:53,464
in the south during
the civil rights movement,

1102
01:12:53,564 --> 01:12:55,836
who were working to end
racial segregation

1103
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:58,374
and who went through all sorts of hell,

1104
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:01,453
and many of them were beaten
and put in jail an so on.

1105
01:13:01,553 --> 01:13:03,990
But when they got together years later,

1106
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,319
they would look back on those years
and they would say,

1107
01:13:08,401 --> 01:13:10,606
"Those were terrible times
we went through,

1108
01:13:11,064 --> 01:13:14,351
and those were
the best years of my life."

1109
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:20,550
Don't let anybody call you immature
or naive because you're hopeful.

1110
01:13:21,091 --> 01:13:23,837
Don't let anybody call you
immature or naive

1111
01:13:23,937 --> 01:13:26,666
because you talk about
attaining justice.

1112
01:13:26,766 --> 01:13:29,578
And don't pay any attention
to somebody who says that,

1113
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:34,113
because their agenda is
to stifle real change.

1114
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:37,317
Frederick Douglas said it,

1115
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:40,021
"Power concedes nothing without a demand

1116
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:43,641
and there is no more
important time than now."

1117
01:13:44,515 --> 01:13:45,597
And the question is,

1118
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:48,426
Do you want to be a part of it?
Do you want to determine it?

1119
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,045
And there are so many issues that
we have to deal with now.

1120
01:13:52,145 --> 01:13:55,541
Global warring, global warming,

1121
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,704
the global economic meltdown,

1122
01:13:57,804 --> 01:13:59,992
the lack of health care in this country,

1123
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:02,821
the way that our country
deals with, vilifies,

1124
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:05,484
discriminates against immigrants.

1125
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:11,268
There are so many issues that are
life and death issues right now.

1126
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:15,636
How are you weighing in?
Or are you weighing in?

1127
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:18,465
This is Democracy Now!
The War and Peace Report.

1128
01:14:18,565 --> 01:14:21,128
I'm Amy Goodman
and we're at Liberty Plaza,

1129
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:22,917
what was Zuccotti Park.

1130
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:27,328
Talk about how this whole
encampment began.

1131
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:30,448
So the original idea
was put out by Adbusters,

1132
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:35,066
a culture-jamming magazine, to amass
in lower Manhattan 20,000 people.

1133
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,396
The rallying cry was occupy Wall Street.

1134
01:14:37,496 --> 01:14:39,102
To come down here

1135
01:14:39,202 --> 01:14:42,555
to make your voices heard
about the injustices about Wall Street,

1136
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:46,425
the financial system and the idea
just spread like wild fire.

1137
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:48,089
Show me what democracy looks like!

1138
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:50,419
This is what democracy looks like!

1139
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,247
It all comes down to effort.

1140
01:14:54,347 --> 01:15:01,070
If we see an issue, I think if we want
to leave anything to future generations,

1141
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:05,189
if that's what we mean by 'a footprint'
than it needs to be the fact that...

1142
01:15:06,146 --> 01:15:07,727
we tried.

1143
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:14,717
71 million people
did not register to vote.

1144
01:15:15,174 --> 01:15:18,253
If you're not registered to vote,
we will help register you.

1145
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,121
Don't let the media or advertising
hold you back.

1146
01:15:23,995 --> 01:15:26,159
Your voice is the voice of change.

1147
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:37,642
If you want to save a life, if you want
to do what you believe is right,

1148
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:42,219
than act on it and don't just sit
on your ass and watch T.V.

1149
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:45,838
and find out what celebrities are doing,
because that's not going to help anyone.

1150
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:49,708
This year as their student
graduate speaker,

1151
01:15:50,248 --> 01:15:52,204
Ms. Claire Friedman.

1152
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,783
Claire the podium is yours.

1153
01:15:57,613 --> 01:16:01,316
Everyone just sits around hoping
that things are going to happen,

1154
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:04,727
nothing's going to happen
if you just sit on the couch and go

1155
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:08,638
"Global warming is so bad. I hope
someone does something about that."

1156
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:10,885
Nothing is going to happen,
that doesn't do anything.

1157
01:16:10,985 --> 01:16:14,172
Recently, I was asked if there is
any hope for the future?

1158
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:17,625
The future of the country,
the future of the world,

1159
01:16:17,725 --> 01:16:19,331
the future of the next generation,

1160
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,120
I responded...

1161
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,116
The only way you get hope
is through action.

1162
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:27,278
that there is only hope with action.

1163
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:31,230
No one changed the world
by sitting on their couch

1164
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,476
and wishing that someone
would do something.

1165
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:36,681
Be that someone.

1166
01:16:37,554 --> 01:16:41,049
Stop hoping for action and be action.

1167
01:16:41,674 --> 01:16:48,331
I honor this class with respect,
admiration, pride and hope.

1168
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:03,558
We have come to remind America
of the fierce urgency of now.

1169
01:17:04,307 --> 01:17:08,926
This is no time to engage
in the luxury of cooling off

1170
01:17:09,026 --> 01:17:12,712
or to take the tranquilizing
drug of gradualism.

1171
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:18,620
Now is the time to make real
the promises of democracy.

1172
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:21,740
Now is the time.

1173
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,862
COMMUNITY

1174
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:26,150
SUSTANABILITY

1175
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,439
ACTIVISM

1176
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:30,685
