00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:41,765
He says no.

4
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,802
She says goodbye.

5
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:46,839
Oh, no, baby, please don't go.

6
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,566
Can we stay?

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,954
She says OK, if we say what
we mean, and mean what we say.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,201
Oh, baby, just tell
me what you want.

9
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:15,661
Ooh, baby, tell me
what you need from me.

10
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,147
'Cause we got to
keep on loving life.

11
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:26,155
Keep it falling,
falling down below.

'Cause where there is
truth, love survives.

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,579
And in the end, maybe
that's all we need to know.

14
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,581
Come to me.

15
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:47,141

way to the Windy City,

24
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:27,699
my baby cousin, Terry Deveroux.

25
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:28,562
Not bad, peanut.

26
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,735
You're too kind.

27
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:38,744
Eric.

28
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,056
Hey, Terry, you were great.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,953
Oh, thanks.

30
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:41,885
I'm glad you could make it.

31
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,749
Can I buy you a
drink or dinner?

32
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:47,063
Uh, thanks, but it's
late and I'm beat,

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,547
and we both got to be up early.

34
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,859
No.

35
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,826
Don't duck me like this.

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,035
Now, you owe me
better than that.

37
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,417
Eric, please,
that dog don't hunt.

38
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,591
I don't owe you.

39
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,564
Look, we were friends at work.

40
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:06,910
We dated some.

41
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,775
It didn't go anywhere, so
we're friends again, I hope.

42
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,777
I don't see it like that.

43
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:13,952
Well, I wish you
tried to, because that's

44
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:16,126
the way it's got to be.

45
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,300
Look, you're a nice guy, Eric.

46
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:18,301
I really like you.

47
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,268
I'll see you tomorrow.

Hey, Eric, these seats free?

50
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:34,144
Sorry, man.

51
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,905
I'm kind of waiting
for somebody.

52
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:36,802
Oh?

53
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,460
OK.

54
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:40,875
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,256
Needs his space, I guess.

56
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:50,851
Oh, hang on, you guys.

57
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,577
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,509
Hey, honey.

59
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:55,959
Hi, Bill.

60
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:56,857
You leaving?

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,168
Yeah, I got to hurry.

62
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,654
I'm assisting Carter on a
tricky little laparotomy.

63
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:01,896
Do well.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,828
I'll see you tonight.

65
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:03,829
Yeah.

66
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,525
Take it easy, OK?

67
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:10,526
Bye.

68
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,913

69
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,882
You've been robbed?

70

Yes.

71
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:27,784
Like I have time
for those lines.

72
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:28,682
Oh, come on.

73
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:29,683
They go fast.

74
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,239
It's Renee, right?

75
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,345
Uh huh.

76
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:38,036
I heard you were
out for a while.

77
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm glad to see you back.

78
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,522
Thanks.

79
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,420
Were you sick?

80
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,732
Uh, no.

81
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,389
Actually, I had a miscarriage.

82
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,530
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

83
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:53,396
I guess I'm just taking
it harder than I thought.

84
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,397
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,916
I shouldn't be
bothering you with this.

86
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,712
No, no, it's no bother.

87
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,714
You know, you're right
about these lines.

88
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,094
They're ridiculous.

89
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,199
You want to just
sit for a while?

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,096
Mhm.

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,132
OK.

92
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,685
Excuse me.

93
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,687
Isn't your husband
a resident here?

94
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,552
Yeah, Bill's in his last year.

95
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,935
So we thought the
time was right.

96
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:16,316
I got pregnant on
the first try, and

97
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,835
everything was going so well.

98
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,941
I wasn't very pregnant,
but still, you

99
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,184
wonder, where did that life go?

100
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:24,703
Don't torture yourself.

101
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,464
That's a mystery
you may never know

102
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,225
the answer to in this life.

103
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,435
Personally, I know it's
corny, but I really

104
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,404
believe that everything
happens for a reason.

105
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:39,097
And one day, we'll
have all the answers.

106
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,513
That was the one and
only real conversation

107
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:45,034
I ever had with Terry Deveroux.

108
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,587
We didn't know each
other very well.

109
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,039
We worked in different
areas of the hospital.

110
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,111
So when everything
started to happen, I--

111
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,182
I couldn't help but
ask myself, why me?

Oh, hey.

118
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,056
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,955

that toxic joint again.

Ta-da.

We haven't had a proper
meal together in ages.

When I was done
with the procedure,

141
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,166
gave me one of these.

142
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:07,167
Really?

143
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,617
Really, yeah.

I swear he did.

You may just get that
job on the surface.

149
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,867
Maybe I will.

bucks to rewire the house.

00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,250
and why he was there.

186
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,943
Get a shot in here.

187
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,117
I want the same from the
first firemen on the scene.

188
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:21,326
I want to see it exactly
the way they saw it.

189
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,535
Joe.

190
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,952
Looks like she was a nurse.

191
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:29,058
Charlie, get over to
Lakeshore Medical Center.

192
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,922
Secure the possessions
of Terry Deveroux.

193
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:32,441
Take care of it yourself.
It's critical.

194
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,442
No mistakes.

195
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,271
You got it.

196
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,686
Joe, look at her neck.

197
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,763
Strangled.

198
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,454
I guess.

199
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:50,873
Then stabbed, then burned, on
top of what looks like rape.

200
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:51,978
Unbelievable.

201
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:52,944
JOE: What a waste.

202
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,224
Corner's in the hall, Joe.

203
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:58,881
You want him to come
in and take the body?

204
00:12:58,985 --> 00:12:59,848
Send him in.

205
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,685
"Get tickets for A.S."

206
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,687
See if you come up with a little
black booklet for any names

207
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,275
with the initials A.S.

208
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,276
Maybe there's a Rolodex.

209
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,802
Gentlemen, it's time to put
this unfortunate lady to rest.

210
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,781
Honey, you are
so spacey tonight.

211
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,516
[gasps]

212
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,242
Renee?

213
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,519
Are you OK?

214
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,761
Oh!

215
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,764
I had the most awful
images in my mind.

216
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,973
Of what?

217
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,459
Of, uh, men's faces, darkness.

218
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,636
Were they people we know?

219
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,362
No.

220
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,536
What were they doing?

221
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,675
I don't know.

222
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:13,473
They were just, um,
making everything dark.

223
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,371
It was really scary.

224
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,305
Honey, honey, it's your body
telling your mind time out.

225
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,755
Stress.

226
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,139
You got a demanding job,
a miscarriage, money.

227
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,416
You think?

228
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,971
Yeah, I think so.

229
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:30,731
Oh.

230
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,287
[music playing]

231
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:39,706
Good morning.

232
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,852
Are you OK?

233
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:52,063
Um, why don't-- why don't
we go outside for a minute?

234
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,030
OK.

235
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,173
Didn't you hear?

236
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,622
No, what happened?

237
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,314
Terry Deveroux was murdered.

238
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:10,357
Oh, my god.

239
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,703
Hey, Renee.

240
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,119
Mrs. What's-her-name would
like to know if she's going

241
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,706
to have her therapy now.

242
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,294
Can't you see that
I need some time?

243
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,643
What's her problem?

244
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,991
I just told her about Terry.

245
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:24,440
Oh.

246
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:25,925
They were friends, or--

247
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:28,928
No, not really, but I
think everybody's upset.

248
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,343
Yeah.

249
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,310
WOMAN: Did you hear
what happened to Terry?

250
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:35,382
I heard about it on
the radio coming in.

251
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,591
The apartment was on fire.

252
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,559
She was stabbed.

253
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:43,045
WOMAN: Somebody told me the
police are coming here today.

254
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,012
Help me, Renee.

255
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,363
You're gonna sit, Renee?

256
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:54,954
Renee?

257
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,526
Why don't you come
outside with us?

258
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,363
Can I get you some water?

259
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,364
I'm all right.

260
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,303
God, who could have done this?

261
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,583
You've got to find out
who did this to her,

262
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:40,137
and you make sure he pays.

263
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,586
That's my intention.

264
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,484
I won't forget Terry.

265
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:45,349
I promise you that.

266
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:50,354
She had the sweetest,
most wonderful voice.

267
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:51,700
I got a tape of her
outside in the car.

268
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,942
I'd like you to hear it.

269
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,083
A note was found in
Terry's apartment--

270
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:57,464
"Get tickets for A.S."

271
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:00,502
Do those initials
mean anything to you?

272
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,538
Yes.

273
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:05,990
Aerosmith, the band, they're
giving a concert next week.

274
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:06,956
Check the ticket office.

275
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,890
Maybe she paid with
her credit card.

276
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:12,686
Was Terry having a
problem with someone?

277
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,241
Any enemies that you knew of?

278
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,173
Enemies?

279
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,139
No.

280
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,662
Everybody who knew
her loved her.

281
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,698
She was so special.

282
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:27,839
The evidence indicates
that she let the attacker in.

283
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:29,703
She knew him.

284
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:30,911
There must have been somebody.

285
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:34,570
OK, she did have
boyfriend problems.

286
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:37,056
It's because they all want to
marry her after the first date.

287
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,022
Can you give us some names?

288
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,748
Sure.

289
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,991
Eric Sylvester.

290
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,684
He works at the hospital.

291
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:46,513
You've got to stop making
those heartfelt promises

292
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:47,790
to victims' families.

293
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,033
No, I don't.

294
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,483
That guy was grieving hard.

295
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,967
He needed to hear we
were going to help him.

296
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,520
You just about guaranteed
him we'd break the case.

297
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:54,418
What are we, roofers?

298
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,833
You can't warranty police work.

299
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,662
Maybe I should think
about a career change.

300
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,043
Hello?

301
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:00,596
Hello?
Hold on.

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,528
You're breaking up.

303
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:02,460
Can you hear me?

304
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,429
There-- there you go.

305
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,845
All right, thanks.

306
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:09,053
Well?

307
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,538
Forensics couldn't
get any fingerprints.

308
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:12,746
Off anything?

309
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,440
Water and smoke damage
wiped everything clean.

310
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,820
Told you you
shouldn't make promises.

311
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,586
I investigate 35
to 40 murders a year.

312
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,726
But I think I reacted
to Terry Deveroux

313
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,177
more as a parent than as a cop.

314
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,075
I couldn't help thinking
it just as easily could

315
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,594
have been my daughter
who was murdered

316
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,528
or who could have been next.

317
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:40,671
Not finding Terry's killer
was never an option for me.

318
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:43,363
If I can have everybody's
attention for a minute.

319
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm Joe Stachula.

320
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,090
This is Larry Ephron.

321
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,747
We're the homicide
detectives investigating

322
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,749
the murder of Terry Deveroux.

323
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,407
We know you have
important work to do here,

324
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,064
but the only way we can
hope to solve this case

325
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,722
is from some clue
you might have.

326
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,622
We'll be asking some of you
to be available for questioning

327
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:01,761
over the next several days.

328
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,866
But if anyone
thinks of something

329
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,318
that might be able to help
us out, please let us know.

330
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,492
Do you have any suspects?

331
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,287
JOE: Right now, we
do have some leads,

332
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,668
but obviously we
can't disclose them.

333
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,533
All I can say is
whoever committed

334
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:19,882
this crime is an extremely
dangerous individual.

335
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,992
So you dated on and off
for about six weeks,

336
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,235
and then the relationship ended?

337
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,753
How long ago?

338
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,030
Three weeks.

339
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,274
And was the breakup mutual?

340
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,172
Not really.

341
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,346
[SCOFFING] Not really.

342
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,555
You know, I keep
telling the wife, please

343
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:38,763
don't answer me "not really."

344
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:39,902
I don't get this expression.

345
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:42,181
Is it yes but with a hint of no?

346
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:43,561
No with a smidgen of yes?

347
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,287
She broke up with me.

348
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,600
Ah.

349
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,533
I need to know where you
were the night of the 23rd.

350
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,472
I went to dinner at
my brother's house.

351
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,784
I was there all night.

352
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,340
Look, Detective, I could
never hurt anyone like that,

353
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,618
especially not Terry.

354
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,344
I understand.

355
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,310
OK.

356
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,659
Can I get the number
of your brother?

357
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:13,660
Sure.

358
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:14,661
Hold on a second.

359
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:19,321
Look.

360
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,185
I don't believe it.

361
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,186
That's a cop.

362
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,981
Looks like he was
questioning Eric.

363
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,672
Eric?

364
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:26,604
No way.

365
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,504
That dog don't hunt.

366
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:30,953
Why did you say that?

367
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,023
[screams]

368
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,024
Renee?

369
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:36,787
Uh, what?

370
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,687
What you just said,
"that dog don't hunt."

371
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,482
Terry always used
that expression.

372
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:44,346
She did?

373
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,314
For a minute, you
sounded just like her.

374
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:52,596
Renee, pediatric
recovery's looking for you.

375
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,011
OK.

376
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:55,806
Hey, am I right, you haven't
treated anybody on this floor

377
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:56,738
yet?

378
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:58,049
Look, Nate, I'm sorry.

379
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,913
I-- I don't feel very well.

380
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,915
We're all upset about Terry.

381
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,123
Yeah, that was
terrible, but we

382
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,436
can't let it affect our work.

383
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,782
We all have jobs to do.

384
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:13,617
Look, Nate, um, I'm going to
call downstairs for coverage.

385
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,584
I-- I should go home.

386
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,000
No, Renee, that's really
not an option at this point.

387
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,450
My patients are waiting
for their therapy.

388
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:20,348
But, Nate--

389
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,073
Look, I will call respiratory.

390
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,730
I'll try to find
you some coverage.

391
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:27,527
In the meantime, could you
just please get started?

392
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:28,528
Fine.

393
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,430
That's good, Mrs. Beevy.

394
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,396
That's fine.

395
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,298
Good.

396
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,160
Hey, Renee?

397
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,403
Don't touch me!

398
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,715
Sorry.

399
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,957
No, sorry.

400
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,787
I just wanted to say sorry
about before in there.

401
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,687
What is the problem?

402
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,654
You're the problem.

403
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,669
I don't get it, Renee.

404
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:06,601
The guy's not now.

405
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,016
You've worked with
him for a while.

406
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:08,913
What's the problem?

407
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,777
I don't know, Bill.

408
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,642
He just makes my flesh crawl.

409
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:17,197
I keep seeing these
things in my mind.

410
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:18,509
Like last night?

411
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,581
Yeah, but worse.

412
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,203
I keep seeing these
hideous images

413
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,171
of Terry Deveroux's murder.

414
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:26,379
OK, that was--

415
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,829
that was horrible.

416
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,934
Everybody's shaken up about it.

417
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,247
It's normal to imagine
the details you've heard.

418
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,249
Well, what if I haven't
heard any of these details

419
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,630
I'm seeing?

420
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:38,253
Then, it's your imagination,
working on the story you heard.

421
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,915
I even thought I saw
Terry today, in the lounge.

422
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:50,334
Honey, it's a big deal.

423
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,854
Your coworker was murdered.

424
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:55,201
Trust me, you're
not going crazy.

425
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,889
TERRY: [screaming]

426
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,466
Uh.

427
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:05,167
RENEE: [gasps]

428
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,237
Honey?

429
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,238
Are you still up?

430
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:14,970
What is it?

431
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,354
Renee?

432
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,427
[gasping and screaming]

433
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,776
What-- what's wrong?

434
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,743
What's wrong?

435
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:29,675
Shh.

436
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:32,712
What's wrong, honey?

437
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,714
Shh.

438
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:37,683
[wind blowing]

439
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:41,238
[screams]

440
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:57,081
Renee?

441
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm not Renee.

442
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,464
Stop it, Renee.

443
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,158
I'm Terry Deveroux.

444
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:10,439
He killed me.

445
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,338
The police don't know who he is.

446
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:13,512
You have to tell them.

447
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:39,917
[dog barking]

448
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:50,997
REPORTER [ON RADIO]:
Good morning, Chicago.

449
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,654
The traffic and weather
report is brought--

450
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,071
Oh, god.

451
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:02,526
How are you?

452
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,528
Not good.

453
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:07,151
I feel hung over or something.

454
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,226
You fell asleep in your clothes.

455
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,092
Honey, I don't want
you to get scared,

456
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:21,545
but, uh, something
happened last night.

457
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,860
You had some kind of
cataleptic seizure.

458
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:26,861
What?

459
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:29,001
At least I think
that's what it was.

460
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:31,072
And then when I went
to touch you, you--

461
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,591
you went all rigid.

462
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,247
And you seemed like you
were going to be all right,

463
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,974
and then you started screaming.

464
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,636
Whatever it is, we'll
take care of it.

465
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,362
I want you to get a
complete physical.

466
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:46,674
What do you think's
wrong with me?

467
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:49,953
I-- I'm not sure.

468
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:55,061
You told me you
were Terry Deveroux.

469
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,376
Oh, my god.

470
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,701
I won't take long, Terry.

471
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:21,605
Just take five minutes.

472
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:25,436
[gasps] Oh, my
god, it was you!

473
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,437
Excuse me?

474
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,073
Hey, I want to talk to you.

475
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:44,801
WOMAN: Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

476
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:45,767
How you doing?

477
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:52,981
Please, wait!

478
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,465
Leave me alone!

479
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,470
Renee!

480
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:01,541
Just tell me why you said that!

481
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,896
Hey, Renee, what's--
calm down, calm down.

482
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,967
What's wrong?

483
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,864
I can't, um--

484
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:14,762
What is it?

485
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:15,659
Come here.

486
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:16,660
Come on, come on.

487
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:17,661
My goodness.

488
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,048
What happened to you?

489
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,188
You're never going
to believe this.

490
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,466
Adam Schuster just
followed me off an elevator

491
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:30,881
and chased me up the stairs.
- What?

492
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:31,779
Why?

493
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,781
He's a maniac.

494
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:34,713
Hi, Adam.

495
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:35,714
Hi.

496
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,614
Morning, Clara.

497
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,202
Good morning.

498
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:46,069
I, uh, I think he's
the one who killed Terry.

499
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,311
Why on earth?

500
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,213
Where did you get that from?

501
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,110
Nowhere.

502
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:54,525
I, uh--

503
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:59,876
JENNY: Renee, tell me.

504
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:00,946
Come here.

505
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,023
What did you hear?

506
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:16,685
OK, uh, this is
going to sound crazy.

507
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:23,140
I keep seeing the murder
in my mind, visions of it.

508
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:24,659
Adam is there, and he's--

509
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,802
it's horrible what
he's doing to her.

510
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:31,873
Look, I'm sorry, but
I'm not getting this.

511
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,669
Do you think you're
psychic or something?

512
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,877
I don't know.

513
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,603
I can't explain it.

514
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:40,813
But, Renee, you were barely
friends with Terry, right?

515
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,642
So why would this
be happening to you?

516
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,575
Jenny, I wish I knew.

517
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,508
JENNY: Of all people,
Adam Schuster?

518
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:48,683
I can't believe
he'd be a murderer.

519
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,306
He's just such an ordinary guy.

520
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,307
No, he's not.

521
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,147
Retractor, please.

522
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,217
I'll need wet laps.

523
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,392
And have your suction ready.

524
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,393
Easy does it.

525
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,463
[device beeping]

526
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,879
Doctor, her blood
pressure's dropping.

527
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:13,225
How fast?

528
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:14,640
80 over 60.

529
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:16,435
I'm having some
problems ventilating her.

530
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:19,196
[device beeping]

531
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,888
There's not much bleeding.

532
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,682
78 over 54.

533
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:25,168
I'm cutting back
on the anesthesia.

534
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,755
68 over 40.

535
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:27,998
Still ventilating poorly.

536
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:32,520
Dr. Carter, the, uh,
diaphragm is pushing down.

537
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,143
Could this be a
tension pneumothorax?

538
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:36,110
He's right.

539
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:37,870
Get him a number
16 angiocath set.

540
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:39,907
[device beeping]

541
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,807
Good work.

542
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,641
Hey, Doc.

543
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:52,402
What's up, Joe?

544
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:53,679
I was just in
the neighborhood.

545
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,267
Thought I'd stop by to see
if you had the Deveroux--

546
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,164
Deveroux results.

547
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,615
On the table behind you.

548
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,306
I'm not entirely
sure the ink is dry.

549
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,204
Huh?

550
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,377
What?

551
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:03,447
Oh.

552
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:04,345
It is.

553
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,242
How's it going?

554
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:06,381
Ah, it's going.

555
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:07,762
Could be better.

556
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,213
We had one suspect, but it
was the victim's ex-boyfriend.

557
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:12,663
His alibi stuck.

558
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,838
I was hoping maybe
you had something.

559
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,978
A little surprise, maybe.

560
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:20,257
She wasn't raped.

561
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,225
Well, we'll keep that
under our hats, won't we?

562
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,261
Anybody else know
that, he's our man.

563
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:25,366
I'd say so.

564
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,367
Thanks, Doc.

565
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,723
Oh!

566
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:40,174
Hi, honey.

567
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,485
What's up?

568
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:42,659
I don't know.

569
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,903
I love my job, and I love you.

570
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:45,834
- Oh.
- You know what else?

571
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,043
What?

572
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:48,458
We're going out to dinner
tonight, someplace nice.

573
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:49,355
Mm.

574
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,425
Mhm.

575
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:51,702
We deserve it or what?

576
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:52,600
Don't answer that.

577
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,051
Just be there.

578
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:56,362
[giggles]

579
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,164
Come in.

580
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:06,096
Hey.

581
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,063
Hi, Renee!

582
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,788
Nate Bradshaw spoke to me today.

583
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:09,893
Oh.

584
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,101
Talk about jumping the gun.

585
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:12,896
I was just a little
tardy, making my rounds.

586
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,554
No, Renee, this is
about Adam Schuster.

587
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:17,659
It seems Adam is very upset.

588
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,075
Nate actually had
to talk him out

589
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:21,146
of filing a formal grievance.

590
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:23,562
He thought best to speak
to me unofficially first

591
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,081
and maybe we could clear it up.

592
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:26,703
Adam says you refuse
to work with him.

593
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:27,600
Is that true?

594
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:28,981
No.

595
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:30,810
He says you went so far as
to tell one of the other nurses

596
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:34,435
that he killed poor
Terry Deveroux.

597
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,817
Is he now spying on me?

598
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:42,512
OK, look, uh, Donna, the
truth is I don't like him.

599
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:43,409
He's strange.

600
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:44,583
He followed me.

601
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:45,929
He literally chased me
up a flight of stairs.

602
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,172
He did?

603
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,381
Did he threaten you, or
was there physical contact?

604
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:50,899
No, he never caught up to me.

605
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,109
How long have you been
having problems with him?

606
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:54,006
[siren blaring]

607
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,973
Adam?

608
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,219
I guess ever since Terry
Deveroux was murdered.

609
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:02,842
Nate really likes
this guy, Renee.

610
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:06,156
Do yourself a favor, try to find
a way to get along with him.

611
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:10,402
BILL: Honey?

612
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,852
I'm home.

613
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:14,578
Guess where I made reservations?

614
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:16,442
I'll give you a hint.

615
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:20,032
You want to wear that cool
dress, the one with the straps?

616
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,174
What's wrong?

617
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:25,417
Hideous headache.

618
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,970
Aw.

619
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,730
What happened?

620
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,042
Schuster again?

621
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:31,423
Yep.

622
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,840
He got Nate to talk
to Donna about me.

623
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,911
I really think they're
going to fire me.

624
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,051
Ah, to hell with
them If they do.

625
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:41,433
Well, you're feeling awfully
confident about this job.

626
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,056
Yes, in fact, I am.

627
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,369
Knock wood.

628
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:47,508
Honey, I'm beat.

629
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,752
I'm just going to go
upstairs and lay down.

630
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:51,995
Sorry about tonight.

631
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,065
Don't worry about it, honey.

632
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:09,840
Renee?

633
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,223
Honey?

634
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,406
Renee, look at me.

635
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:30,344
[screams]

636
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:42,356
Leave her alone.

637
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:46,325
Please go away.

638
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,293
Did you call the police?

639
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,466
Renee.

640
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,504
You know I'm not Renee.

641
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,851
Why won't you help me?

642
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,163
What do you want from us?

643
00:34:56,266 --> 00:35:01,996
You have your life,
but mine is gone.

644
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,170
Tell me what
you want me to do.

645
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:09,141
Go to the police.

646
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:12,351
Tell them Adam
Schuster killed me.

647
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:17,322
Make them punish him.

648
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,784
It happened again, didn't it?

649
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:36,306
Oh, god, Bill.

650
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,618
Am I going crazy?

651
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:41,760
If you are, then I am.

652
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:50,009
What did-- what did she say?

653
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:55,532
She told me to tell
the police who her is.

654
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:58,604
She-- she said he's--

655
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,605
I know who he is.

656
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,057
Adam Schuster.

657
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:37,402
Um, I-- I'm just going to talk.

658
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,162
I got the feeling we would
have been good friends.

659
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:49,414
I'm really sorry you died,
what happened to you.

660
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,179
But we're not friends.

661
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:04,256
I can't make them believe me.

662
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,706
You should find somebody else.

663
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:25,346
Can I help you?

664
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,314
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
looking for the workup

665
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,213
on Renee Perkins.

666
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:35,494
Um, you didn't order these
tests, did you, Doctor?

667
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:36,426
No.

668
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,153
I'm, uh, I'm her husband.

669
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,672
Yeah, well, normally
these are only released

670
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,914
to the attending physician.

671
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:45,677
Well, I promise I
won't tell if you don't.

672
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,850
I can keep a secret.

673
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:47,851
Thank you.

674
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:56,826
[phone ringing]

675
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:58,931
Hello?
BILL [ON PHONE]: Hi.

676
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,036
It's me.

677
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,209
Great news.

678
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,626
All your tests were normal.

679
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:05,075
That's a relief.

680
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:06,318
What's wrong?

681
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:09,597
Well, if it's not a medical
issue, then what is it?

682
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:13,532
I'm gonna call you later.

683
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:22,196
Is your, um, friend a,
uh, member of the church?

684
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,338
Yes, she is, but she's
not active anymore.

685
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:28,375
I think she regrets that
now, especially with all

686
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,169
she's going through.

687
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,964
I don't know much
about possessions

688
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:33,449
beyond the church protocol.

689
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:38,419
It requires a battery of
tests; medical, psychological.

690
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:42,320
And, uh, then if the person
gets a clean bill of health,

691
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:46,910
I believe a board meets to see
if an exorcism is necessary.

692
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:48,395
An exorcism?

693
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:49,913
Oh, yeah.

694
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:51,294
Does it trouble you?

695
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:55,712
Father, has anyone ever been
possessed by a good spirit?

696
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:58,784
I mean, it isn't always a
demon or a devil, is it?

697
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:01,269
Well, I, uh, never
thought about it.

698
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,995
I suppose it's possible,
but then again,

699
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,859
why isn't it at rest in heaven?

700
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,516
Maybe it needs help.

701
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,245
Maybe if the person possessed
did with the spirit asked,

702
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,730
maybe it could rest.

703
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:20,150
I'm afraid I'm outside of my
realm of experience on this.

704
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,877
I've wasted
enough of your time.

705
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,811
Thank you, Father.

706
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:29,056
Is there something more
you'd like to talk about?

707
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,023
No, I don't think so.

708
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:34,164
I'll pray for you.

709
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:35,165
Thank you.

710
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:38,479
MAN: Here you go.

711
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,687
Thank you.

712
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,033
Pizza.

713
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:42,552
Pizza, pizza.

714
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,105
They told me you'd be
here feeding your face.

715
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:45,555
Hey, Bill.
How's it going, man?

716
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,557
How's the wild and crazy world
of the surgical resident?

717
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:49,214
- I can smell the finish line.
- I hear you.

718
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:50,215
You doing the interview thing?

719
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:51,147
Oh, yeah.

720
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,044
How about you?

721
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,494
Nothing but.

722
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:56,773
Capital District Psych Center,
Denver Psych, Boston General,

723
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,706
all in one month.

724
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,054
So, uh, I actually
wanted a consult.

725
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,262
Delighted.

726
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,643
It's a doozy.

727
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:07,888
These, uh, people
I know, um, really

728
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,650
steady, down-to-earth,
normal, having a rough time.

729
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:14,929
The, uh-- the wife, uh--

730
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:20,521
the wife believes she's been
possessed by the spirit of--

731
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,835
by, by the spirit of the
nurse who was murdered.

732
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:24,732
Oh, yeah?

733
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,527
Wow.

734
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,668
The husband has actually
witnessed these possessions.

735
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:30,566
How many have there been?

736
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:32,084
Two, and they're uncanny.

737
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,916
Uh, some cataleptic symptoms--
stiff limbs, tremors.

738
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:36,986
Her voice even changes.

739
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,056
Oh, thanks.

740
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,713
Uh, the dead woman
was from Louisiana,

741
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,404
and during these
episodes, the wife--

742
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,095
well, it just isn't her.

743
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:45,650
It's someone else's
voice coming through.

744
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:47,203
OK, this is great.

745
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,792
I actually attended
a lecture on this.

746
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:50,724
Possession?

747
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:51,759
Of course not.

748
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:54,106
Multiple personality disorder.

749
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,625
Episodes of so-called
possession are

750
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:57,316
commonplace in
third-world countries.

751
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,595
Findings suggest
that possessions

752
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:00,975
have much in common.

753
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,149
Multiple personality disorder.

754
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,323
It's not, uh--

755
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:07,292
it's not multiple
personality disorder.

756
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,605
You seem pretty sure of this.

757
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,502
Wrong age.

758
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:13,401
Wrong history.

759
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:14,610
Wrong person.

760
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:16,853
Does not fit the profile.

761
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:20,823
Well, how else
do you explain it?

762
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:24,723
Milosh, we're doctors.

763
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:27,450
Don't we witness the
inexplicable time and again?

764
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,107
Patients who should
die according

765
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,281
to every scientific
fact available to us,

766
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:32,420
and they don't.

767
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:34,284
They heal by themselves.

768
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:35,665
The patients we've
raised from the dead

769
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,702
with electricity,
for Pete's sake.

770
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:42,430
Isn't there room in
our universe for this?

771
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,501
For possession?

772
00:41:57,894 --> 00:41:58,723
You're home early.

773
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:02,830
Oh.

774
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:03,831
Ooh.

775
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:13,289
I absolutely don't want
you to see any shrinks.

776
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:15,981
They'll wrap you up in
a tiny, little package

777
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:18,121
and you'd never get out.

778
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:20,330
So what are we going to do?

779
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:21,608
Just pray it's finished.

780
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:24,403
Bill, it's not
going to stop, not

781
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:25,853
until we do what Terry asked.

782
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,476
You go to the police and tell
them Adam Schuster killed her.

783
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,030
Nuh-uh.
No.

784
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,169
Never happened.

785
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:32,998
No way.

786
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:33,930
Why not?

787
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,761
[scoffs] Are you kidding me?

788
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:39,004
Just answer my question.

789
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:41,766
If we both think it's true,
why can't we go to the police?

790
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:44,527
Because the whole world will
say you're crazy, that's why.

791
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,012
Well, I'm not
entirely sure I care.

792
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,151
But you will.

793
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,257
People will never look
at you the same way.

794
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:56,539
Or is it they won't
look at you the same way?

795
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:58,506
Poor Dr. Perkins,
married to a Loony Tune?

796
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,404
You're not funny.

797
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:01,199
I'm not trying to be.

798
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:02,994
You're worried
about appearances.

799
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:03,926
Of course I am!

800
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:06,687
How else do people judge you?

801
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,068
Bill, this is too important.

802
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,035
No, I'll tell you
what's important,

803
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:12,003
eight years of our lives.

804
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:15,800
We've worked and struggled
and sacrificed, not

805
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,215
to mention assumed heavy debts.

806
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:18,181
Also, I can have this career.

807
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:19,286
Yeah, I know all that.

808
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:20,977
And now-- and now
when we're a heartbeat

809
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,808
away from the payoff--

810
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:24,740
no.

811
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:26,155
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:28,295
I'm not going to throw it all
away by making public jackasses

813
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,091
of ourselves with a story
ripped from the headlines

814
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:33,645
of the "Enquirer" that
we will never live down.

815
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:40,065
This is not just
your decision.

816
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:49,661
Renee, we don't even know
for sure just who did it.

817
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,526
Maybe the ghost is
lying or confused.

818
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,492
You're forgetting.

819
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,598
I saw what happened too.

820
00:43:55,702 --> 00:44:00,983
OK, you saw it, but
you can't prove it.

821
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:02,674
We don't have the
kind of evidence

822
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:04,089
the police need to make a case.

823
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,022
What can we give them?

824
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,024
All we can do is ruin ourselves.

825
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:09,716
Why?

826
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:12,650
Two reasons; it's
the right thing,

827
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:15,411
and Terry Deveroux is not
going away until we do.

828
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,006
[music playing]

829
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,666
TERRY: [SINGING] Keep it from
falling, falling down below.

830
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:34,119
We've got to keep
our love alive.

831
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:37,019
Come to me.

832
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:41,368
I want you beside me, yeah.

833
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:53,829
[tense music]

834
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:33,247
Hey, Renee.

835
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:34,179
How are you?

836
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:35,180
How are you feeling?

837
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:36,181
Are you-- are you good?

838
00:45:36,285 --> 00:45:37,148
Are you feeling better?

839
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,224
You're in my way.

840
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:45,225
Hey.

841
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,058
It's OK.

842
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:51,956
What's your hurry?

843
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,026
Let's-- let's take some time.

844
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:53,923
Talk to me.

845
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:54,890
Whoa.

846
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,207
I mean, you're perfectly
willing to talk about me.

847
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:05,486
Right?

848
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:13,115
So listen, why don't you
just calmly, to my face,

849
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:17,119
tell me what your problem is?

850
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:19,811
What did I ever do to you?

851
00:46:19,915 --> 00:46:21,917
Not me.

852
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,883
Terry Deveroux.

853
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:29,269
You are nuts.

854
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:31,029
You know that?

855
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:31,927
I don't know, Renee.

856
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,549
I'd-- I'd be careful.

857
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:36,379
They're gonna lock you up, or--

858
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:37,656
They're going to lock you up.

859
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,106
You're not going to
get away with this.

860
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,038
Hey, bitch.

861
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,005
What was that just now?

862
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:42,351
Now, are you threatening me?

863
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:21,321
Hey.
How you doing?

864
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:22,218
Hey.

865
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:24,911
Hey, Nate.

866
00:47:25,014 --> 00:47:25,877
You OK?

867
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:26,774
Yeah.

868
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:27,914
You sure?

869
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:29,191
Yeah.

870
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:31,469
Nate, I think I might just
need a minute, all right?

871
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,643
I might just step outside
for a bit, if that's OK.

872
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:34,541
Sure.

873
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:35,714
You're not feeling well?

874
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,514
What the hell happened to you?

875
00:47:42,618 --> 00:47:43,550
Nothing.

876
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:44,827
Forget it.
- No, no, no.

877
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:45,897
Come on, come on, come on.

878
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:46,760
Tell me.

879
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,314
What's going on?

880
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,869
Look, I don't want to--

881
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:52,766
it's Renee.

882
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,216
Renee?

883
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,976
What the hell is her problem?

884
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,874
I don't know.

885
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:58,634
I don't know.

886
00:47:58,737 --> 00:47:59,911
She used to be fine, you know?

887
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:01,223
She used to be normal.

888
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,156
Normal?

889
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:04,536
She's a menace.

890
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,713
Listen, this-- [WHISPERING]
this is no big deal, OK?

891
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:13,097
It isn't, but the only thing
that worries me-- and I don't

892
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,651
even like to say
this, but do you

893
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:18,516
think that she should
be dealing with patients

894
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,208
when she's behaving like this?

895
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,245
That's all.

896
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:25,109
[NORMAL TONE] Listen, I gotta--

897
00:48:25,212 --> 00:48:26,213
I gotta go.

898
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,663
Don't say anything, all right?
- All right.

899
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:28,560
You take care.

900
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:29,561
All right.

901
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:35,326
Renee, can we talk a minute?

902
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:36,603
What's up, Donna?

903
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,294
The stakes are getting
pretty high in this game

904
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:39,571
between you and Adam.

905
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:40,469
I don't understand.

906
00:48:40,572 --> 00:48:43,851
He says you slapped him.

907
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:48,304
Nate said he saw the
hand prints on his cheek.

908
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:49,650
That's six weeks
suspension, pending--

909
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:51,273
- Suspension?
- --a hearing, without pay.

910
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:52,860
Donna, I need my job.

911
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:53,896
We need my paycheck.

912
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,966
Well, I want to back you up.

913
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,142
Just tell me it's not true.

914
00:48:58,245 --> 00:48:59,488
- I can't.
- Renee--

915
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:00,385
I just-- he--

916
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:01,386
--why?

917
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:18,472
MAN: Wanna take the couch next?

918
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:20,785
MAN: Yeah, the big
one, with a dolly.

919
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:22,166
MAN: All right.

920
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:23,546
MAN: Watch it.
- Tuck that in.

921
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,547
Yeah.

922
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:29,932
MAN: Watch the door.

923
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:32,866
MAN: Keep coming, now.

924
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,936
That's good, angle.

925
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:40,218
Hey.

926
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:45,361
How you doing?

927
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,469
Better, when I'm done here.

928
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,855
What do I do with this?

929
00:49:56,959 --> 00:49:57,891
How do you wrap up a life?

930
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,827
You remember how they lived.

931
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,862
You learn from it.

932
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:17,359
Hey, Bill!

933
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:22,088
Bill.

934
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:23,468
Hey.

935
00:50:23,572 --> 00:50:26,644
I wanted to pick up on our
conversation the other day.

936
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:29,647
That was Renee you were
talking about, wasn't it?

937
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,544
[sighs]

938
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:31,580
I apologize.

939
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,685
It hit me later.

940
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:35,618
My professional
enthusiasm overwhelmed

941
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,137
what's left of my sensitivity.

942
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,311
I'm sorry.

943
00:50:38,414 --> 00:50:39,933
What is going on?

944
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:40,934
I already told you.

945
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,321
It was like walking into
the Twilight Zone, man.

946
00:50:48,424 --> 00:50:49,908
Can you think of what
could be troubling her?

947
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:50,806
Stress?

948
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:51,945
Trauma?

949
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,981
Well, we've both been
worried about money.

950
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,881
In the last month, she--

951
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:58,434
she had a miscarriage.

952
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:00,195
Ah, well.

953
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:03,819
If you'd seen what I saw,
you wouldn't be saying, ah.

954
00:51:03,922 --> 00:51:07,857
Anyway, I got a brand
new problem now.

955
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,204
She wants to go to the police.

956
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:12,069
Oh, no way.

957
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:14,278
Well, you-- you're
not going to, are you?

958
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:16,245
I don't want to.

959
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:18,834
You don't sound
very convincing.

960
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:19,869
Come on, buddy.

961
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:20,905
You've got to ask
yourself, are you

962
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:23,701
ready to sacrifice your career?

963
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:25,116
We're talking about
my wife, Milosh.

964
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,013
But--

965
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,705
My-- no, no.

966
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,120
It's my wife's peace of mind.

967
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,099
Stachula, Evanston PD called.

968
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:44,515
A couple out there want to
discuss the Deveroux case.

969
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,313
JOE: I love when the
Dodgers come to Chicago.

970
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,210
That's a rivalry.

971
00:51:50,314 --> 00:51:51,625
Well, I hope you
like it strong.

972
00:51:51,729 --> 00:51:52,833
Oh, not for me.

973
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:53,869
Thank you.

974
00:51:53,972 --> 00:51:54,835
Thanks.

975
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:58,874
Please, uh, have
a seat, Detective.

976
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:00,703
Thanks for calling in.

977
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:02,498
I appreciate anything
you have to tell me.

978
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:05,605
Let me just start
by saying, uh, we

979
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,228
don't want to have to
testify, I mean, go to court.

980
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:09,988
Oh, we want our
names kept out of this.

981
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:12,646
Yeah, I understand that.

982
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,028
OK.

983
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:20,067
Uh, Detective, have you
ever had any experience

984
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:22,587
with the supernatural?

985
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:24,141
No.

986
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,454
Then this is going
to sound crazy to you.

987
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:30,423
JOE: You know, police work,
you learn to keep an open mind,

988
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,321
so go on.

989
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:38,914
Um, well, we think
what we have is genuine

990
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:42,020
information about your
case, but it's, um--

991
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,091
it's come to me through--

992
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:48,958
I guess I would call them, uh,
visions, and then two episodes

993
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:52,962
of spirit possessions.

994
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:56,173
Mr. Stachula, We aren't kooks.

995
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,209
Bill is a surgeon, and I'm
a respiratory therapist

996
00:52:58,313 --> 00:52:59,935
at Lake Shore.

997
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:02,593
We did not ask for
this to happen to us.

998
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,941
BILL: I believe Renee was
possessed by the spirit

999
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:08,046
of Terry Deveroux.

1000
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,427
She identified herself.

1001
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:15,571
She, uh-- Renee spoke with an
accent, uh, Southern, Cajun.

1002
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,159
You heard her say this?

1003
00:53:17,263 --> 00:53:19,679
You didn't-- you
didn't see anything?

1004
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:20,818
You heard this?

1005
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,958
Yeah, absolutely.

1006
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:26,410
Uh, she said that the police
weren't on the right track.

1007
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:31,242
She said that the killer
is a nursing assistant

1008
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:34,349
at Lake Shore, Adam Schuster.

1009
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,315
Adam Schuster?

1010
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,117
This just doesn't feel right.

1011
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,225
Uh, Renee, maybe we should just
apologize and back off here.

1012
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:51,435
Dr. Perkins, I find
this very interesting.

1013
00:53:51,538 --> 00:53:54,852
I don't mind telling you that
this has been a tough case,

1014
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:59,201
so please go on.

1015
00:53:59,305 --> 00:54:00,823
Well, uh, there
isn't much more.

1016
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:03,826
It's just, um, there's
something I read

1017
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,140
in the papers that isn't right.

1018
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,487
He didn't rape her.

1019
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,627
He just arranged her
body to look like rape.

1020
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:18,669
Joe, listen to me.

1021
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:25,503
Do not type this report up, Joe.

1022
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:28,265
We do not have to go on record
with every fruitcake who

1023
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:31,544
calls in to report the martians
are landing on Lakeshore Drive.

1024
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:33,166
Larry, they gave
us an AS we missed.

1025
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,410
Joe, what if this
million-to-one,

1026
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:39,103
snowball's chance in hell,
when pigs have wings looser tip

1027
00:54:39,206 --> 00:54:40,863
turns out to be the real thing?

1028
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:44,729
What if Schuster is
AS and did the crime?

1029
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,525
If you make this a part
of official record,

1030
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:50,459
you're going to
look like an idiot.

1031
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:51,460
All right.

1032
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:52,427
Thank you, Jesus.

1033
00:54:57,984 --> 00:54:58,778
Now what are you doing?

1034
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,538
[typewriter clacking]

1035
00:55:00,642 --> 00:55:01,953
Making it unofficial.

1036
00:55:02,057 --> 00:55:07,165
Memo to Captain Kirkwood,
from Joe Stachula

1037
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,857
You aren't going to
believe this one.

1038
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,213
Well, I'll be.

1039
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,772
What's up?

1040
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:29,360
Schuster lives two
blocks away from Terry

1041
00:55:29,464 --> 00:55:32,984
Deveroux's apartment,
and he's got a rap sheet.

1042
00:55:33,088 --> 00:55:34,123
Yeah, sure.

1043
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:35,470
I understand.

1044
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:39,646
April 23, I was, uh, right
here, watching the Cubs game.

1045
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,303
I never miss one.

1046
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:44,410
Yeah, that's right, huh, Yvonne?

1047
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:45,618
That's right.

1048
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:46,653
ADAM: Yes, it is.

1049
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:48,448
I remember because
it was the next day

1050
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:52,072
that we found out that Terry
was murdered, so that kind of--

1051
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:54,143
thanks, honey-- that kind of
imprints things on your mind.

1052
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:55,559
Do you recall
who won that game?

1053
00:55:55,662 --> 00:55:56,491
No.

1054
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:59,045
You see, that-- that, I forget.

1055
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,047
You remember that, Yvonne?

1056
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,566
Who won that Cubs game?

1057
00:56:02,669 --> 00:56:03,463
Beats me.

1058
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:04,775
I hate baseball.

1059
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:06,259
There you go.

1060
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,640
What is it with the women?

1061
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,158
Every time I sit down
and watch a game,

1062
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:10,919
without fail, my wife
suddenly needs the lawn

1063
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:12,230
mowed or the faucet fixed.

1064
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:13,818
It's got to be done right now.

1065
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:15,302
[chuckles]

1066
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,928
Yvonne, when's the baby due?

1067
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:20,929
Any day now.

1068
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:22,551
That's terrific.

1069
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:24,622
We'll call you if
we need you again.

1070
00:56:24,726 --> 00:56:26,279
ADAM: Anything you
need, you let us know.

1071
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,280
It's a shame about Terry.

1072
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,488
- Yeah, it is.
- Thank you.

1073
00:56:28,592 --> 00:56:29,455
Yeah.

1074
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:34,460
Thanks.

1075
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:39,292
What's going on, Adam?

1076
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,708
It's a police investigation.

1077
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,814
Got to ask questions.

1078
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,332
I worked with Terry.

1079
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:48,197
But were you here that night?

1080
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:50,683
Well, where else would I be?

1081
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:53,479
You're almost never
here at night, Adam.

1082
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:55,619
What-- what, am I lying now?

1083
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:56,792
YVONNE: No, I didn't say that.

1084
00:56:56,896 --> 00:57:00,417
Well, Yvonne, you don't
sound that confident.

1085
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,798
I just think that you're
not telling me something.

1086
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:09,426
Well, then you
think too damn much.

1087
00:57:09,529 --> 00:57:10,634
Don't be mad, Adam.

1088
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:11,876
I hate it when
you get mad at me.

1089
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,084
Please?
- Please!

1090
00:57:13,188 --> 00:57:13,947
Adam.

1091
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,362
What?

1092
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:16,260
What?

1093
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,400
You make me mad.

1094
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:19,436
Oh, and there.

1095
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:20,678
And now you don't like it.

1096
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:26,995
Come here, come here.

1097
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:27,996
Come here.

1098
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,037
Look at you.

1099
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:36,556
You're as big as a house.

1100
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,454
Thanks.

1101
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:38,351
Come here.

1102
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,559
Listen.

1103
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:42,355
You know that I'm going to
take care of you, right?

1104
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,532
You know that I'm
always there for you.

1105
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,017
Right?

1106
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,022
Well, I expect the mother
of my child to stand by me.

1107
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,369
Huh?

1108
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,853
I can't hear you, Yvonne.

1109
00:57:57,957 --> 00:58:00,200
Right, Adam.

1110
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:01,270
All right.

1111
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,587
Renee didn't tell you
she's been suspended?

1112
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:08,864
She didn't mention it.

1113
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:09,762
What was the reason?

1114
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,073
She slapped Adam Schuster.

1115
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:12,454
The woman's completely unstable.

1116
00:58:12,558 --> 00:58:13,455
Nate!

1117
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,977
Did either of you ever
notice any problem between Adam

1118
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,081
Schuster and Terry Deveroux?

1119
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:20,324
Well, absolutely not.

1120
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:21,670
Adam is no murderer.

1121
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:22,809
That's great.
Fine.

1122
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:24,259
Thanks, Deanna.

1123
00:58:24,362 --> 00:58:25,605
You know his
girlfriend's expecting?

1124
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:27,607
The guy is working
overtime just to provide

1125
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,608
for her and the baby.

1126
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:30,161
He's even moonlighting.
- Oh, yeah?

1127
00:58:30,265 --> 00:58:31,059
What's he doing?

1128
00:58:31,162 --> 00:58:32,405
NATE: Electronics.

1129
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,649
He put himself through night
school, repairs TVs, VCRs,

1130
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:37,583
stuff like that.

1131
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:39,550
So the voodoo
lady is ticked off

1132
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:42,380
at Schuster for some damn
reason and gets him arrested.

1133
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:44,279
But why is she ticked
off in the first place?

1134
00:58:44,382 --> 00:58:46,315
Because the ghost told
her he was the killer?

1135
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:47,558
Oh, come on, Joe.

1136
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:50,009
You know that Terry
Deveroux's TV was on the fritz.

1137
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:52,149
What am I missing here?

1138
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,772
The guy said Schuster's been
moonlighting as a TV repairman.

1139
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,741
Maybe that puts him
in her apartment.

1140
00:58:57,844 --> 00:58:58,880
Now that's what
I call a stretch.

1141
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:00,709
[scoffs] Maybe.

1142
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:01,779
So?

1143
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:02,815
No, no, no, no.

1144
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:06,335
This is-- take this
to 307, all right?

1145
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:07,923
Hey, we need to talk.

1146
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:08,855
Yeah, what's up?

1147
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:09,753
It's Renee.

1148
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:10,685
She's at it again.

1149
00:59:10,788 --> 00:59:12,065
She contacted the police.

1150
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:14,585
She told them that you
killed Terry Deveroux.

1151
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:15,828
What?

1152
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:18,624
They were just here, talking
to me and Donna Larson.

1153
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,142
What did you guys say to them?

1154
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:22,006
She's nuts.

1155
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,699
I can't believe that
she called the police.

1156
00:59:24,802 --> 00:59:28,254
She is out to nail you.

1157
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:32,292
[suspenseful music]

1158
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,171
[gasps and screams]

1159
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:50,483
- Hey, come here!
- No!

1160
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,726
- Let me move you.
- Let me go!

1161
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:52,761
No, not yet.

1162
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:53,659
[screams]

1163
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:54,867
Hey, hey, hey!

1164
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,593
Hey, shut up, shut up.

1165
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:58,560
Shut up, all right?

1166
00:59:58,664 --> 00:59:59,768
Shut up.

1167
00:59:59,872 --> 01:00:00,873
OK?

1168
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:01,770
All right?

1169
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:03,185
Mhm.

1170
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:04,670
- All right.
- These--

1171
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:06,188
No, Renee, Renee,
Renee, listen, listen.

1172
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,431
Focus on the business, OK?

1173
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:09,985
Now, you created this
problem for yourself.

1174
01:00:10,089 --> 01:00:11,090
You came after me, and now look.

1175
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:12,022
You see?

1176
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:13,333
Here I am, right?

1177
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:15,439
Now, what I want
you to tell me is

1178
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:16,543
just what you told the police.

1179
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,545
That's all.

1180
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,583
What did you say to them, Renee?

1181
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:24,137
What you did to Terry.

1182
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:26,243
Where did you get that from?

1183
01:00:26,346 --> 01:00:27,140
Talk to me.

1184
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:29,764
She told me.

1185
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:31,282
What?

1186
01:00:31,386 --> 01:00:32,629
Terry told me.

1187
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,189
You are crazy.

1188
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:42,259
Yeah, well, that's they think.

1189
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:43,363
So you don't have to worry.

1190
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,748
Listen to me.

1191
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:52,165
From now on, you keep
your mouth shut about me.

1192
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:53,201
All right?

1193
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:54,202
Mhm.

1194
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:01,071
I'll see ya.

1195
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:24,611
Renee?

1196
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:25,612
You there?

1197
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:34,207
[radio static]

1198
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:49,671
Renee.

1199
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:03,305
Why won't the police
arrest Adam Schuster?

1200
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:06,550
Please, go away.

1201
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:08,000
Can't you see what
you're doing to her?

1202
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,380
She can't take any more of this.

1203
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:12,383
Renee wants to help me.

1204
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:14,213
Why won't you?

1205
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:15,455
We tried.

1206
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,216
No one believes us.

1207
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,080
Don't you understand?

1208
01:02:19,183 --> 01:02:23,049
It's not our fault.
No one believes us.

1209
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:26,397
I have evidence.

1210
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:28,675
Go to the police.

1211
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,644
Tell them he stole my jewelry
and gave it to the girl.

1212
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:41,516
The voodoo lady to see you.

1213
01:02:41,619 --> 01:02:43,207
[laughs]

1214
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:44,208
Excuse me.

1215
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,559
Mrs. Perkins, how can I help?

1216
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,113
Adam Schuster
broke into my house.

1217
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:53,562
I was alone, and
he threatened me.

1218
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:54,771
Sorry, Mrs. Perkins.

1219
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:56,220
If you file a complaint,
we'll be more than happy--

1220
01:02:56,324 --> 01:02:58,395
I want you to arrest him
for killing Terry Deveroux.

1221
01:02:58,498 --> 01:03:00,466
We can't build a
case on what we've got.

1222
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,296
I can give you proof.

1223
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,815
Adam stole some
jewelry from Terry,

1224
01:03:04,919 --> 01:03:06,437
and he gave it to
his girlfriend;

1225
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,302
a sapphire ring,
some gold earrings,

1226
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:12,305
and an art deco style black
onyx pin with diamond gems.

1227
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:13,755
This information
about the jewelry,

1228
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,861
did this come to
you in a vision too?

1229
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:16,827
Does it matter?

1230
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:25,940
Look, I believed you when
you told me how badly you

1231
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,700
want to catch Terry's killer.

1232
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,426
I still do.

1233
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:31,428
That's why I'm sure you're going
to follow through with this,

1234
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:34,638
no matter how crazy it seems.

1235
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:37,434
Do you really want to wonder
for the rest of your life

1236
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:39,954
if you had it in your
hands, by some miracle,

1237
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:43,785
to do the right thing
and you just let it go?

1238
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:53,243
[knocks on door]

1239
01:03:58,593 --> 01:03:59,525
Good afternoon.

1240
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,698
I was wondering if
you had some time

1241
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:02,355
to come to the station
with us and answer

1242
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:03,978
a few more questions?

1243
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:04,910
Am I under arrest?

1244
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:06,049
Absolutely not.

1245
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:06,981
OK.

1246
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:08,051
Step in.

1247
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:09,500
Yvonne?
YVONNE: What?

1248
01:04:09,604 --> 01:04:10,743
I'm going to go
down to the station.

1249
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,609
I'm going to help out
the detectives here.

1250
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:15,852
I'll be back soon, OK?

1251
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:16,853
Uh, OK.

1252
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,512
Where's your other guy?

1253
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:23,480
Oh, he's going to ask
Yvonne a couple of questions.

1254
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:27,001
Why don't we go ahead?

1255
01:04:31,177 --> 01:04:33,559
Did you need something?

1256
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:37,114
As a matter of fact, yes.

1257
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:39,910
I wanted to ask you if Adam had
given you any jewelry recently.

1258
01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:48,091
Um, am-- am I going
to be in trouble?

1259
01:04:51,646 --> 01:04:52,785
Listen.

1260
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,719
I hardly knew Terry
Deveroux, all right?

1261
01:04:55,822 --> 01:04:57,755
The problem is I have
different information.

1262
01:04:57,859 --> 01:04:58,722
Huh.

1263
01:04:58,825 --> 01:04:59,965
We have a neighbor
that says he saw

1264
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,449
you around Terry's apartment.

1265
01:05:01,552 --> 01:05:03,106
Oh, yeah, six
months ago, maybe.

1266
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:05,418
Six months ago, I might have
bumped into her on the street,

1267
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:07,420
helped her bring some groceries
upstairs or something,

1268
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:08,697
you know?

1269
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:09,906
Well, if it was
six months ago,

1270
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:11,597
there'd be no reason to
find your prints there.

1271
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:16,602
Tell you what we're going to do.

1272
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:17,879
I'm going to take
some fingerprints,

1273
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:19,329
see if they match up
with the set of prints

1274
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:20,571
we found in her apartment.

1275
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:21,469
Yeah, fine.

1276
01:05:21,572 --> 01:05:22,435
That's good.

1277
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:23,505
You should do what
you have to do.

1278
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:24,506
We will.

1279
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,029
Tell me about your
TV repair business.

1280
01:05:34,068 --> 01:05:36,277
Terry Deveroux's TV
was out of order.

1281
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,209
Come on, Adam.

1282
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,452
We know about your moonlighting.

1283
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,351
Oh, OK.

1284
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:43,111
Um, let me think.

1285
01:05:43,215 --> 01:05:45,424
Um, oh, right.

1286
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:46,735
I see.

1287
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:48,841
Yes, I think I might have
been there more recently.

1288
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,223
I was going to fix
her television set,

1289
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:53,052
and she was going to
give me some comedy

1290
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,433
club tickets instead of paying.

1291
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:56,469
That's right.

1292
01:05:56,573 --> 01:05:58,333
Was that around April 23?

1293
01:05:58,437 --> 01:05:59,507
Uh, yeah.

1294
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,164
[clears throat] Yep.

1295
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,304
What happened when
you went to fix her TV?

1296
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,789
Well, I didn't have the
right part, and so I left.

1297
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:08,619
And then, I forgot all about
it, and I never came back.

1298
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:10,173
And that is the god's truth.

1299
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:15,764
Who told you
about her jewelry?

1300
01:06:18,284 --> 01:06:19,182
I don't--

1301
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:20,252
I don't know anything
about jewelry.

1302
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:21,149
Sure, you do.

1303
01:06:21,253 --> 01:06:23,186
[chuckles] I don't.

1304
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:25,912
Try to remember.

1305
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,018
You got a minute, Joe?

1306
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:30,745
You got Yvonne waiting.

1307
01:06:30,848 --> 01:06:33,230
Got to leave you for
a few minutes, Adam.

1308
01:06:33,334 --> 01:06:34,300
You got Yvonne--

1309
01:06:34,404 --> 01:06:37,027
what's-- what do you
got Yvonne here for?

1310
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:39,133
We think she's material
to the investigation,

1311
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:40,962
but don't you worry about that.

1312
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:45,346
We'll take good care of her.

1313
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:49,177
We're highly respectful of
expectant mothers around here.

1314
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:50,523
You need anything?

1315
01:06:50,627 --> 01:06:51,524
Huh?

1316
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:52,974
JOE: Cup of coffee?

1317
01:06:53,078 --> 01:06:53,837
No, nothing.

1318
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:54,734
No, I'm fine.

1319
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:56,219
Can I talk to Yvonne?

1320
01:06:56,322 --> 01:06:57,185
Maybe later.

1321
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:02,259
He admitted to being in
Terry Deveroux's apartment

1322
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:04,123
the night of the murder.

1323
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:05,400
Oh, he's waiting for us.

1324
01:07:07,644 --> 01:07:08,472
Hi, Jeff.

1325
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:09,508
I'm glad you could make it.

1326
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:10,405
Thanks for coming down.

1327
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:11,579
Sure thing.

1328
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:12,580
You ready?

1329
01:07:12,683 --> 01:07:13,581
Yeah.

1330
01:07:16,273 --> 01:07:19,794
Yvonne, this is Jeff
Deveroux, a relative

1331
01:07:19,897 --> 01:07:22,003
of the victim, Terry Deveroux.

1332
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:23,142
Hello.

1333
01:07:23,246 --> 01:07:24,385
I'm very sorry about your loss.

1334
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:25,386
Thank you.

1335
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:30,115
Ma'am, forgive me for
asking, but why are you

1336
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:31,357
wearing my cousin's earrings?

1337
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,640
The ring, that's Terry's too.

1338
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:49,030
Terry's.

1339
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:00,662
I'm so sorry.

1340
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:01,663
I didn't know.

1341
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:20,234
It's all over, Adam.

1342
01:08:20,337 --> 01:08:21,821
One of Terry Deveroux's
family members

1343
01:08:21,925 --> 01:08:25,239
identified the jewelry
box that you gave Yvonne.

1344
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:27,379
Two pair of earrings.

1345
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:28,656
Sapphire ring.

1346
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:31,176
Well, I bought that jewelry
from a guy on the street.

1347
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,694
You have a receipt, Adam?

1348
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:33,626
Well, no.

1349
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,593
They don't give receipts.

1350
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:35,525
Hey, come on now.

1351
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:36,595
You're pushing it, Adam.

1352
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:38,321
You lied about being
in her apartment.

1353
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:39,977
You lied about the
night of the 23rd.

1354
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:41,565
Which Yvonne corroborated.
Am I right, Joe?

1355
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:42,808
That's right.

1356
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:44,672
Which could make her an
accessory after the fact.

1357
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:48,400
I think it would be pretty sad
to have a baby born in lockup.

1358
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:49,401
Hey, you--

1359
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:54,613
Hey, Yvonne is--

1360
01:08:58,064 --> 01:08:59,549
[sighs]

1361
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:06,487
She didn't know
anything about it.

1362
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,798
About what, Adam?

1363
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:09,524
Terry Deveroux's murder?

1364
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:10,525
Yeah.

1365
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:12,562
Are you ready to
talk about it, Adam?

1366
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:13,563
Yeah.

1367
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:28,440
I killed her.

1368
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:30,373
Why did you kill her?

1369
01:09:30,476 --> 01:09:31,857
I got a kid on the way.

1370
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,411
I needed the money.

1371
01:09:34,515 --> 01:09:37,345
I was going to rob her.

1372
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:39,899
Hey, everybody knew that
she came from money.

1373
01:09:40,003 --> 01:09:40,900
She was loaded.

1374
01:09:48,391 --> 01:09:50,220
So I go to her place.

1375
01:09:50,324 --> 01:09:51,946
She wasn't going to let me in.

1376
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:54,328
I guess I wasn't
convenient, like,

1377
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:56,330
what, I'm some kind
of servant, I guess.

1378
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:59,436
She's better than me.

1379
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,852
Anyway, I talked her into it.

1380
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:02,853
She let me in.

1381
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,687
You know, she's standing there
in her expensive dress, and--

1382
01:10:11,517 --> 01:10:12,311
whatever.

1383
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:13,830
I got a kid on the way.

1384
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:21,424
I didn't rape her.

1385
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:22,425
Yeah.

1386
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,914
That's, uh--
that's great news.

1387
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,605
Congratulations.

1388
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:31,537
Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:32,573
And thanks a lot.

1390
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:33,470
You too.

1391
01:10:33,574 --> 01:10:34,920
Bye.

1392
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:35,817
It's over.

1393
01:10:35,921 --> 01:10:37,336
Schuster confessed.

1394
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,337
Thank god!

1395
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:43,584
We were told there
wouldn't be a trial.

1396
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:44,964
Adam Schuster
would be sentenced,

1397
01:10:45,068 --> 01:10:46,863
and that would be it.

1398
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:48,589
Renee was asked back
to work, but decided

1399
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:49,728
to take a little more time off.

1400
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:52,800
And I focused on
finishing my residency.

1401
01:10:52,903 --> 01:10:54,871
We had done what
Terry wanted, and we

1402
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:57,356
thought it was all behind us.

1403
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,185
I need to talk to
you two for a minute.

1404
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:00,186
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.

1405
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,187
How's it going?

1406
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,499
Schuster just
withdrew his confession.

1407
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:03,638
Damn!

1408
01:11:03,742 --> 01:11:06,745
You want to tell me
about this, detective?

1409
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:07,849
Not a welcome surprise.

1410
01:11:07,953 --> 01:11:09,265
I don't think you
have to worry about it.

1411
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:10,404
It's just a memo.

1412
01:11:10,507 --> 01:11:12,060
You think the defense
won't see through that?

1413
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,407
They'll accuse you
of trying to hide it,

1414
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,891
and I can't help but
think they'll be right.

1415
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:16,651
Hey, O'Gane, we
handed you a confession.

1416
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:18,239
This case is a slam dunk.

1417
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:20,345
We have some serious
probable cause issues.

1418
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:22,554
You can't make an arrest based
on this kind of information.

1419
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:23,520
JOE: We know that.

1420
01:11:23,624 --> 01:11:25,108
All we did was bring
him in to talk.

1421
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:26,696
He was arrested
after he confessed.

1422
01:11:26,799 --> 01:11:28,387
This, along with all
the other paperwork,

1423
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,251
was just subpoenaed
by the defense.

1424
01:11:30,355 --> 01:11:31,908
It's part of the
official record now.

1425
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:33,219
That's how it came
across my desk.

1426
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:34,773
Otherwise, I probably
would never have seen it.

1427
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:36,015
Am I right, detective?

1428
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:36,982
You were trying to hide it.

1429
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:38,294
Not really.

1430
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:39,743
[SCOFFING] Not really.

1431
01:11:39,847 --> 01:11:42,574
Well, now I have to prove to a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt

1432
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:45,680
that, uh, Renee
Perkins was possessed

1433
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:47,199
by the spirit of the victim.

1434
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,788
They made it perfectly clear
they want to be kept out of it.

1435
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:51,237
Oh, yeah?

1436
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,238
Tell that to the defense.

1437
01:11:58,693 --> 01:11:59,694
Evening, detective.

1438
01:11:59,798 --> 01:12:01,317
Nice to see you.
- Nice seeing you.

1439
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,145
Thanks.
How are you?

1440
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:03,146
[phone ringing]
BILL: Hey.

1441
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:04,216
Yeah, we were--
- Hello?

1442
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,977
BILL: --kind of surprised
when you called.

1443
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:07,944
Who is this?

1444
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:09,428
BILL: What brings you out here?

1445
01:12:09,532 --> 01:12:10,326
You could say--

1446
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:11,430
RENEE: How did
you get my number?

1447
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:14,226
No, I don't-- I
don't have a comment.

1448
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,781
Detective, that was a reporter.

1449
01:12:17,885 --> 01:12:22,303
Could I comment on my role in
the case against Adam Schuster?

1450
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,892
He said Schuster's
recanting his confession.

1451
01:12:24,995 --> 01:12:26,549
He's claiming he was coerced.

1452
01:12:26,652 --> 01:12:27,481
His lawyers got to him.

1453
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:28,654
I know this has
been tough on you,

1454
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:30,587
and they're probably
going to ask you--

1455
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:32,140
well, you can expect a subpoena.

1456
01:12:32,244 --> 01:12:33,556
You're going to have to testify.

1457
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:35,627
Oh, boy.

1458
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,870
Oh, Bill.

1459
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:38,871
I'm so sorry.

1460
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,396
[knocking on door]

1461
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,363
Come in.

1462
01:12:49,986 --> 01:12:51,021
Hi, Dr. Carter.

1463
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:51,919
Hello, Bill.

1464
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:52,920
Have a seat.

1465
01:12:57,925 --> 01:13:00,306
I called you here today
because of my respect for you

1466
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:03,206
as a doctor.

1467
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:05,691
I wanted to let
you know personally

1468
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:07,900
we've decided to go
with another candidate

1469
01:13:08,004 --> 01:13:08,936
for the staff position.

1470
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:13,216
I see.

1471
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:32,822
REPORTER: I think that's
him, I think that's him.

1472
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:34,548
Oh, oh, get a shot of him
coming up the driveway!

1473
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:35,411
Come on.
Let's go.

1474
01:13:35,514 --> 01:13:36,273
Stay with me.
Come on.

1475
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:37,171
Uh, Dr. Perkins?

1476
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:38,793
- Dr. Perkins?
- Dr. Perkins?

1477
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:40,105
Dr. Perkins?

1478
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,244
Dr. Perkins, has your wife
had any visions concerning

1479
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:42,487
the outcome of the trial?

1480
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,489
Do you belong to any
religious cults, Dr. Perkins?

1481
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:45,593
REPORTER: What about your wife?
I mean, is she feeling OK?

1482
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:46,732
Has she ever tried any
hallucinogenic drugs?

1483
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:49,804
[reporters clamoring]

1484
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:52,980
Have you got any
comment at all for us?

1485
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:54,637
BILL: Get a life.

1486
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,638
[phone ringing]

1487
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:57,674
Can you believe these people?

1488
01:13:57,778 --> 01:13:59,055
I'll get it.
- No.

1489
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:00,366
Honey, no.

1490
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:04,060
It's probably just a crackpot
or reporter, or both.

1491
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:06,959
Didn't get the job.

1492
01:14:07,063 --> 01:14:09,168
Oh, Bill.

1493
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:11,170
Carter was a
gentleman about it.

1494
01:14:11,274 --> 01:14:13,241
At least I didn't get a
form letter in the mail.

1495
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:15,071
It's because of me.

1496
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:17,591
Ah, it's the trial.

1497
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:18,557
I'm so sorry.

1498
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:28,671
Renee, the defense is
going to use your testimony

1499
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:31,328
to try and get the jury's
mind off the real issue

1500
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:34,504
of the record, which is the
fact that Schuster confessed.

1501
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:38,819
One thing I absolutely have
to know without ambiguity,

1502
01:14:38,922 --> 01:14:41,511
do you plan on
sticking by your story?

1503
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:44,928
Only if they still require
the truth, Mr. O'Gane.

1504
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:45,929
That's all I need to know.

1505
01:14:53,799 --> 01:14:56,664
Mr. Schuster, could
you tell the jury

1506
01:14:56,768 --> 01:14:58,424
how you knew Terry
Deveroux had not

1507
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:01,048
been raped when the police did
not release that information?

1508
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:02,325
Uh, I didn't know that.

1509
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:04,327
But you said in
your confession,

1510
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:09,159
and I quote, "I just wanted
to make it look like a rape.

1511
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:11,265
That's why I moved
her legs apart."

1512
01:15:11,368 --> 01:15:13,543
Oh, well, the
detectives there, they--

1513
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:16,650
they wrote that confession,
and I just signed that.

1514
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:18,617
So your testimony is
now that you've lied

1515
01:15:18,721 --> 01:15:19,860
when you made this statement?

1516
01:15:19,963 --> 01:15:21,896
Uh, well, the--

1517
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,277
the detectives
threatened me, sir.

1518
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,934
They told me that if I
didn't sign the confession--

1519
01:15:25,037 --> 01:15:27,764
Mr. Schuster.

1520
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:29,628
You answered my question.

1521
01:15:29,732 --> 01:15:30,595
OK, sorry.

1522
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:36,566
Mr. Smith?

1523
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:40,881
Adam, will you
tell the jury, why

1524
01:15:40,984 --> 01:15:43,608
did you confess to the
murder of Terry Deveroux

1525
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,264
if you're an innocent man?

1526
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:49,855
Well, Yvonne, she was
about to have our first baby.

1527
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:54,135
And the detective said
that she would be arrested,

1528
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,242
and that our baby would
be born in jail if I

1529
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,969
didn't sign that confession.

1530
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:03,213
So you were forced to
sign a false confession?

1531
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:05,664
That's the way
I felt. Yes, sir.

1532
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:08,149
You know, I would have confessed
to killing Kennedy or whatever

1533
01:16:08,253 --> 01:16:10,186
if they would have promised
to leave Yvonne and the baby

1534
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:11,843
alone.

1535
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:13,879
Thank you,

1536
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:15,191
You may step down.

1537
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:16,192
Thanks.

1538
01:16:18,228 --> 01:16:19,989
Detective, would
you tell the jury

1539
01:16:20,092 --> 01:16:23,199
what happens to evidence seized
or arrests made in the absence

1540
01:16:23,302 --> 01:16:24,821
of probable cause?

1541
01:16:24,925 --> 01:16:26,029
It becomes invalidated.

1542
01:16:26,133 --> 01:16:26,961
I'm sorry?

1543
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:29,412
I didn't hear you.

1544
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:30,689
It becomes invalidated.

1545
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:32,070
ATTORNEY SMITH:
Detective Stachula,

1546
01:16:32,173 --> 01:16:34,728
was Adam Schuster a suspect in
the murder of Terry Deveroux

1547
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:37,800
before Renee Perkins told
you her story of having

1548
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:39,387
visions and being possessed?

1549
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:41,527
No, he was not
a suspect until I

1550
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,426
got a tip that he
was in possession

1551
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:44,841
of the victim's jewelry.

1552
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:47,050
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well,
that's very good, Detective,

1553
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:48,604
but would you be
good enough to tell

1554
01:16:48,707 --> 01:16:51,399
us where that tip came from?

1555
01:16:51,503 --> 01:16:52,366
Renee Perkins.

1556
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:53,678
ATTORNEY SMITH: And
did Mrs. Perkins

1557
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:55,887
say that that information
came from Terry Deveroux?

1558
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,991
Yes, she did.

1559
01:16:57,095 --> 01:16:58,165
ATTORNEY SMITH: And
Terry Deveroux's been

1560
01:16:58,268 --> 01:17:00,305
dead for, what, four weeks now?

1561
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:01,720
JOE: Yes, that's true.

1562
01:17:01,824 --> 01:17:03,757
ATTORNEY SMITH: I'd like to
direct your attention to a copy

1563
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,968
of Exhibit C, a memo from you
to your supervisor, Captain

1564
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:08,969
Kirkwood.

1565
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,699
You did write that memo?

1566
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,045
JOE: Yes, I did.

1567
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,288
And it describes your first
meeting with Renee Perkins.

1568
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:19,738
Is that right?

1569
01:17:19,842 --> 01:17:21,015
Yes, it does.

1570
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:23,880
ATTORNEY SMITH: Allow me
to read the first sentence.

1571
01:17:23,984 --> 01:17:27,366
And I quote, "you aren't
going to believe this."

1572
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:34,477
Detective Stachula, do
you believe in ghosts?

1573
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,065
[scoffs]

1574
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,244
Now, Mr. Bradshaw, you've
worked with both the defendant

1575
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:45,143
and Renee Perkins
for over two years.

1576
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,283
You know them pretty well.

1577
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:50,044
Do you believe Adam Schuster
provoked this incident?

1578
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:51,080
Oh, no.

1579
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,599
I was shocked when
she slapped Adam.

1580
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:55,809
They've always
worked well together,

1581
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:59,122
that is until her miscarriage.

1582
01:17:59,226 --> 01:18:00,745
Maybe she was just jealous--

1583
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,678
O'Gane was right.

1584
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:03,713
I'm the one on trial.

1585
01:18:08,235 --> 01:18:11,825
Mr. O'Gane, how do
you think it's going?

1586
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:13,619
Stachula's testimony
hurt, didn't it?

1587
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:14,724
Mhm.

1588
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:17,658
And our real Achilles'
heel is yet to come.

1589
01:18:17,762 --> 01:18:19,039
Meaning me, of course.

1590
01:18:19,142 --> 01:18:20,316
I'm afraid so.

1591
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:22,801
All the defense has to
do is hang the jury.

1592
01:18:22,905 --> 01:18:26,356
And all they need to do that
is one juror who doesn't

1593
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,428
buy into the spirit world.

1594
01:18:29,532 --> 01:18:31,534
Odds are they'll find one.

1595
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:32,535
See you tomorrow.

1596
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:39,887
[somber music]

1597
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:01,978
Well, that's very
interesting, Dr. Perkins.

1598
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:03,773
It's very interesting.

1599
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,362
Can you tell us, has
your wife ever been

1600
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:08,605
possessed by any other spirits?

1601
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:09,606
Of course not.

1602
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,505
She hasn't, for
example, been possessed

1603
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:15,336
by the spirit of,
oh, uh, say, Elvis,

1604
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,097
or Jackie O, or Jimmy Hoffa?

1605
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,132
Objection.

1606
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:19,651
Your Honor, he's
harassing the witness.

1607
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,378
Your Honor, we
need clarification.

1608
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:24,587
The rest of us are
unschooled in the mysteries

1609
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,900
of the supernatural realm.

1610
01:19:27,003 --> 01:19:29,350
Can you tell us why you
consulted a psychiatrist

1611
01:19:29,454 --> 01:19:31,076
and why your wife
underwent these

1612
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,423
extensive neurological tests?

1613
01:19:33,527 --> 01:19:36,702
We wanted to find out why
Renee was having these--

1614
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:40,189
well, what was the cause of
what was happening to her.

1615
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:43,192
PROSECUTOR O'GANE: And did you
find any psychiatric or medical

1616
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:44,089
explanation?

1617
01:19:44,193 --> 01:19:46,505
No.

1618
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:55,066
Renee is as normal and healthy
as anyone in this courtroom.

1619
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:58,172
I call Renee Perkins.

1620
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:01,727
So it's your testimony that
during these possessions,

1621
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,522
you were completely unconscious?

1622
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:04,903
Yes.

1623
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:08,320
Mrs. Perkins, do you think
it's fair to take away a man's

1624
01:20:08,424 --> 01:20:10,806
freedom based on
supernatural testimony

1625
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:12,704
that we now find out
you didn't even hear?

1626
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,154
Objection, your Honor.

1627
01:20:14,257 --> 01:20:16,121
It calls for speculation,
and he knows it.

1628
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:17,191
Sustained.

1629
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:18,917
Relax, Mr. Smith.

1630
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:21,678
Mrs. Perkins, did you
tell the police that Adam

1631
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:23,094
Schuster killed Terry Deveroux?

1632
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:23,991
Yes, I did.

1633
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:25,890
And did you base
this conclusion

1634
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:29,825
on your alleged possession by
the spirit of Terry Deveroux?

1635
01:20:29,928 --> 01:20:33,552
N-- not exactly.

1636
01:20:33,656 --> 01:20:35,382
I also had visions
of the murder.

1637
01:20:35,485 --> 01:20:36,935
Visions.

1638
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:38,592
And did these
visions come to you

1639
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:42,976
after you saw reports of the
murder in the news media?

1640
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:44,598
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1641
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:45,771
No more questions, your Honor.

1642
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,016
[chatter]

1643
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,983
Mr. O'Gane?

1644
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:56,575
Mrs. Perkins, could you put
the fragments of your visions

1645
01:20:56,679 --> 01:20:59,716
together and tell
us what you saw?

1646
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:05,861
Yes Uh, I remember
seeing Terry

1647
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:08,346
look through the people
of her door to see

1648
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:10,106
who had rung her doorbell.

1649
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:14,835
Um, she was dressing for
a nightclub performance.

1650
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:18,943
I remember seeing her
in a blue satin dress.

1651
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,083
Adam was standing there.

1652
01:21:21,186 --> 01:21:26,019
She told him through a closed
door that she was in a hurry.

1653
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:30,023
But he said he only needed
five minutes of her time,

1654
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:31,887
so she let him in.

1655
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:36,995
He attacked her right away.

1656
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:41,482
He threw his arm around
her and strangled her.

1657
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:45,866
They struggled,
but it was no use.

1658
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,182
He dragged her into
the living room

1659
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:54,357
and choked her until
she was unconscious.

1660
01:21:54,461 --> 01:21:59,190
He left, and he came
back with a knife.

1661
01:22:02,987 --> 01:22:05,368
Do you need some
time, Mrs. Perkins?

1662
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:06,369
I'm all right.

1663
01:22:09,372 --> 01:22:14,481
He stabbed her, dragged
her body into the bedroom,

1664
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:19,658
ripped her dress, took some
time positioning the body

1665
01:22:19,762 --> 01:22:22,385
to make it look like
she had been raped,

1666
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:24,801
put the mattress on top of her.

1667
01:22:24,905 --> 01:22:27,045
He doused her with
lighter fluid that he

1668
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:29,979
had brought in his toolbox.

1669
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:33,293
He took a lighter
from his pocket

1670
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:38,056
and held it to the mattress,
and then he set me on fire.

1671
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,437
No!

1672
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,334
[gavel banging]

1673
01:22:40,438 --> 01:22:42,819
Mr. Schuster, take your seat.

1674
01:22:42,923 --> 01:22:43,820
Take your seat.

1675
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,412
[WHISPERING] Do you see
the girl on the stand?

1676
01:22:49,516 --> 01:22:50,448
[WHISPERING] Relax.

1677
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:51,414
Continue, Mr. O'Gane.

1678
01:22:54,383 --> 01:22:58,594
Mrs. Perkins, what exactly
did Adam Schuster's lighter look

1679
01:22:58,697 --> 01:22:59,802
like?

1680
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:05,566
It was copper, an
alligator with emerald eyes.

1681
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,706
To light it, he
flicked open the mouth.

1682
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:11,503
I'd like to introduce
Exhibit 42b, a lighter found

1683
01:23:11,607 --> 01:23:13,816
in Adam Schuster's apartment.

1684
01:23:13,919 --> 01:23:15,714
It is a copper alligator.

1685
01:23:15,818 --> 01:23:17,233
It has emerald eyes.

1686
01:23:17,337 --> 01:23:19,166
And you light it by
opening its mouth.

1687
01:23:27,692 --> 01:23:30,039
Hey, Adam?

1688
01:23:30,143 --> 01:23:31,351
Adam?

1689
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:32,283
Huh?

1690
01:23:32,386 --> 01:23:34,423
Adam, hang in there.

1691
01:23:34,526 --> 01:23:36,149
We're almost home.

1692
01:23:36,252 --> 01:23:37,943
You don't know what I'm
going through in here.

1693
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:39,393
The jury's on our side.

1694
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:40,463
I feel them pulling for us.

1695
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:42,603
Hey, listen.

1696
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:47,643
I saw Terry Deveroux in
that courtroom today.

1697
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:48,644
No, Adam.

1698
01:23:48,747 --> 01:23:50,128
She was staring
right at me, Dennis!

1699
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:51,440
Adam, Adam, calm down.

1700
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:52,820
Hey, take it easy.

1701
01:23:52,924 --> 01:23:53,718
Calm down.

1702
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:54,926
Remember, I was there.

1703
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,514
I didn't see her.
No one else saw her.

1704
01:23:56,617 --> 01:23:57,446
It's all in your head.

1705
01:23:57,549 --> 01:23:58,895
Now, listen to me.

1706
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:01,415
They are very good people
working hard for you.

1707
01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:06,489
I need you to fight a
little longer with me, OK?

1708
01:24:06,593 --> 01:24:07,387
Yeah.

1709
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:09,492
All right.

1710
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:10,424
Hang in there.

1711
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,909
Get a good night's sleep.

1712
01:24:13,013 --> 01:24:13,910
Then, we'll celebrate.

1713
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:21,815
All right, let's go.

1714
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:49,187
[gasps]

1715
01:24:56,712 --> 01:24:58,783
Hey!

1716
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:00,025
Hey, you get away from me!

1717
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:24,843
[phone ringing]

1718
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:25,741
Hello?

1719
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:26,638
JOE [ON PHONE]: Hi.

1720
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:28,019
It's Joe Stachula.

1721
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,366
The jury is going to reconvene
tomorrow morning, 9:00 AM.

1722
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,367
Really?

1723
01:25:31,471 --> 01:25:33,404
Yeah.

1724
01:25:33,507 --> 01:25:34,370
See you there.

1725
01:25:34,474 --> 01:25:35,302
OK.

1726
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:36,269
Thanks.

1727
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:42,551
[chatter]

1728
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:52,526
[gavel banging]

1729
01:25:54,597 --> 01:25:57,152
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

1730
01:25:57,255 --> 01:25:58,567
No, Your Honor.

1731
01:25:58,670 --> 01:25:59,430
We're deadlocked.

1732
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:02,226
[chatter]

1733
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,400
JUDGE BACON: Are you close
to reaching a verdict?

1734
01:26:04,504 --> 01:26:07,679
I don't think so, your Honor.

1735
01:26:07,783 --> 01:26:12,339
Ms. Foreman, I want you
and your fellow jury members

1736
01:26:12,443 --> 01:26:15,204
to go back into that
jury room and work

1737
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:17,758
until you reach a verdict.

1738
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:19,381
Now, we know this
isn't going to be easy,

1739
01:26:19,484 --> 01:26:21,314
but this is a very high--

1740
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:24,524
You'll pay for this.

1741
01:26:24,627 --> 01:26:25,801
JUDGE BACON: Under
the circumstances,

1742
01:26:25,904 --> 01:26:28,873
I don't want to put this
court through that case again.

1743
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:30,461
I want you to plead me out.

1744
01:26:30,564 --> 01:26:32,463
What?

1745
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:33,809
I-- I want you to reinstate--

1746
01:26:33,912 --> 01:26:35,224
Is your client feeling ill?

1747
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:36,432
Mr. Smith?
- I won't do that.

1748
01:26:36,536 --> 01:26:37,744
No, he's fine, Your Honor.

1749
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:39,504
Listen, I did this thing.
ATTORNEY SMITH: No, no.

1750
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:40,747
I did this thing.
I'm guilty, OK?

1751
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:41,989
So just--
- Just hang in with me.

1752
01:26:42,093 --> 01:26:43,059
Stop.
ADAM: You're my lawyer.

1753
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:44,060
You do like I--
[gavel banging]

1754
01:26:44,164 --> 01:26:44,716
ATTORNEY SMITH:
Don't throw it away.

1755
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,821
I want you to do it!

1756
01:26:45,924 --> 01:26:47,202
JUDGE BACON: I want
order in this court.

1757
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:49,963
Mr. Schuster, you will deeply
regret any further outbursts

1758
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:51,033
in this courtroom.

1759
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,552
Mr. Schuster, do
you understand me?

1760
01:26:52,655 --> 01:26:53,518
You day it, or I'll--

1761
01:26:53,622 --> 01:26:54,347
JUDGE BACON: Mr.
Schuster, I will not

1762
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,970
be ignored in this courtroom.

1763
01:26:57,073 --> 01:27:00,284
You say it, Dennis,
or I'll say it.

1764
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:02,631
I'm guilty.

1765
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:03,563
What did you say?

1766
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:07,705
I-- I killed Terry Deveroux.

1767
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:10,052
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your
Honor, my client

1768
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:12,848
wishes to apologize to
the court and to reinstate

1769
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,298
his confession.

1770
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:17,162
My client pleads guilty to
the murder of Terry Deveroux.

1771
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:19,579
[chatter]

1772
01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:20,890
I'll be damned.

1773
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:27,725
The media went crazy.

1774
01:27:27,828 --> 01:27:30,210
It was all over the Chicago
news and even hit "Newsweek."

1775
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:33,317
They called it "The Voice
from the Grave" case.

1776
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,801
Some of the guys
in the department

1777
01:27:34,904 --> 01:27:36,078
still razz me about it.

1778
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:38,874
And I always have
the same comeback--

1779
01:27:38,977 --> 01:27:40,116
so how do you explain it?

1780
01:27:43,672 --> 01:27:46,709
Voice of an angel.

1781
01:27:46,813 --> 01:27:49,402
May she rest in peace.

1782
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:51,162
Amen.

1783
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,683
[wistful music]

1784
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:19,052
Join me this Friday
for our regular edition

1785
01:28:19,155 --> 01:28:21,019
of "Unsolved Mysteries."

1786
01:28:21,123 --> 01:28:24,885
Here are some of the great
stories coming up in May.

1787
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:27,819
When her home was overrun by
a pack of unknown intruders,

1788
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:29,959
a teenage girl was
plunged into a nightmare

1789
01:28:30,063 --> 01:28:33,515
of psychological terror and
afflicted with a peculiar case

1790
01:28:33,618 --> 01:28:35,689
of amnesia.

1791
01:28:35,793 --> 01:28:38,313
Welcome to the Valley
of the Kings in Egypt.

1792
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:41,212
Many believe that when the
tomb of the legendary King Tut

1793
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:45,423
was opened in 1922, a deadly
curse was unleashed on all

1794
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,495
who entered his sacred crypt.

1795
01:28:48,599 --> 01:28:51,464
Last January, a cab driver
was hijacked and turned

1796
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:56,538
into a human time bomb as part
of an insidious robbery scheme.

1797
01:28:56,641 --> 01:28:59,713
For tobacco heiress Doris
Duke, an extravagant life

1798
01:28:59,817 --> 01:29:02,233
ended in a bitter dispute
over control of her billion

1799
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,443
dollar fortune, a
dispute now inflamed

1800
01:29:05,547 --> 01:29:08,929
by accusations of foul play.

1801
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:10,724
And on the island
of Puerto Rico,

1802
01:29:10,828 --> 01:29:13,071
reports abound that a
frightening and mysterious

1803
01:29:13,175 --> 01:29:15,591
beast is on the loose.

1804
01:29:15,695 --> 01:29:19,664
Tune in, Friday's at 8:00
for "Unsolved Mysteries."
