00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,375
Oh, son of a bitch!

3
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,211
Yeah, that's
me, Johnny Jones Junior.

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,247
As you can see, I love blow.
That big fat rail that just went

5
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:53,683
up my nose... it's just the
first of many for the day.

6
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:57,488
Make no mistake, coke is both a
requirement and a sin to boot.

7
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,226
But, I know right from wrong. No
one is perfect... especially me.

8
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,838
That's Rebecca, my hot Latina
girlfriend. Don't let the blonde

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,907
hair fool ya.. she's one
hot little chili pepper.

10
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,609
She's mi hermosa, mi amor.
(my girlfriend, my love)

11
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,678
Most importantly, she's mi vida.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,415
Now in English that basically
means she's the love of my life,

13
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,151
the most beautiful
woman in the world.

14
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,153
We've known each other
since grade school.

15
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,320
We've been
inseparable ever since.

16
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:33,924
I guess you could say we
are co-dependent. All I know for

17
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,592
sure is, I'd die without her.

18
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:39,428
She's a little materialistic...
but most of the beautiful ones

19
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,797
are, right?

20
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,434
AAAAAA... MOTHER FUCKER!

21
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,803
That's my old man,
Johnny Jones Senior.

22
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,805
A real life
walkin' "talkin" satan.

23
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,874
Evilest man who ever
walked the Earth.

24
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,276
I often thought I saw horns
coming out of his head.

25
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,445
I have no idea why mom
stayed with him all

26
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,347
those years... I suspect
she was trapped by fear.

27
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,784
MOTHER FUCKER!

28
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,320
My sweet mother,
the salt of the Earth.

29
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,323
Not a mean bone in her body...
the most spiritual God

30
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,758
fearin' woman you'd ever meet.
I guess that's where I got my

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,762
calling... every Wednesday and
Sunday you could count on it,

32
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,463
we'd be sittin' in church.

33
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,931
Let me rewind this
back to the beginning...

34
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,536
Now that you know a
little about me... let's go back

35
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,738
to where Rebecca and I
decided to take a little trip

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,743
Westward...

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,532
Hallelujah!

38
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:26,602
Hallelujah.

39
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:27,770
Can I get an Amen?

40
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:28,971
Amen!

41
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:32,375
The Lord says let the sick be
healed, let the poor be rich

42
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,011
and let the broken
hearted be renewed.

43
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,711
Now I say to you
today, God's people,

44
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,848
if you are among the sick, if
you are among the poor, if you

45
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,651
are among the broken spirited I
want you to rise up and come on

46
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,387
down to the front with me.
Rise up I say in the name of the

47
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:52,029
Lord. Come on,
Jesus wants to heal you.

48
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,931
Be gone devil of illness he says
to one. May your cup runneth

49
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:00,036
over he says to another.
Be healed all of God's children.

50
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,038
Be healed and
renewed in Jesus name I say.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,906
God is entering you now
brothers and sisters,

52
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:04,740
can you feel it?

53
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,042
Yes!

54
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,278
The devil
wants you to resist it, don't

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,413
you let him. Let the fire of the
Lord God almighty cover you in

56
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,048
the blood of
Jesus Christ the Messiah...

57
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,017
Hallelujah!

58
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,084
Hallelujah!
Can you feel the healing that's

59
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:17,053
taking place in this
church today? I can feel it.

60
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:23,726
Sister, do you believe?
I want you to feel fire of the

61
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,529
Lord Jesus Christ blazing
through my hands...

62
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,932
Lord Almighty release
this woman from the bondage of

63
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:33,769
her chair. Put the fire of Jesus
in her legs. Lord hear me.

64
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:38,675
Heal this woman.
Thank you Lord, for all...

65
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:46,817
Now sister, trust in the Lord.
Everything will be okay, c'mon.

66
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:51,087
Lord has you.
Don't be afraid. That's right.

67
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,656
- Oh Lord,
- Witness brothers and sisters.

68
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,925
I'm walking... I'm walking.

69
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,560
Reverend,
you've healed me.

70
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,962
Oh, no ma'am, no ma'am,
God has saved you.

71
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,897
I'm merely an
instrument for the holy spirit.

72
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:09,839
A servant of the
Lord almighty. Praise God.

73
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,707
Did you see that God's people?

74
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:12,976
Amen!

75
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,176
Did you see the miracle of God's
glory that just took place right

76
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:18,682
in front of your very eyes?
Thank you Jesus. Praise God.

77
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:19,750
Praise be to God.

78
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,550
The healing hands of
the Lord radiate through me.

79
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,486
He strengthens the weak and
makes his people the meek.

80
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,555
He delivers us from all evil. He
is the rock, the rock of ages.

81
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:28,959
Praise be to Jesus.
Praise be to God.

82
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,560
Praise be to God.

83
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,461
Now I never like to close
without givin' thanks to the

84
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,998
Lord first, so as the offering
baskets are making their way

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
around today I want to encourage
each and every one of you to

86
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,935
give, and give again, and then
give just a little more until

87
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:43,507
your heart is satisfied because
remember what the Lord says,

88
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,543
the seed you sew today will be
returned to you 100 fold.

89
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,577
Blessed are the meek
who put their faith in the Lord.

90
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,678
Can I get an Hallelujah?

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,147
Hallelujah!

92
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:57,620
Let us pray...

93
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:00,089
May the love of God always
be above you, to overshadow

94
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:04,827
you, beneath you to uplift you,
before you to guide you, and

95
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,031
behind you to protect you... In
Jesus name, our savior, to whom

96
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,801
glory be now and
forever more, I say Amen.

97
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,572
Go in peace
brothers and sisters.

98
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:27,716
Oh... Son of a bitch!

99
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:32,788
Hey babe, how much do
you think we made off with?

100
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,692
Why you gotta say it like that?
You know that's how the Lord

101
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,728
provides, baby.

102
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,498
Looks like a couple of grand.
Should be enough to last us a

103
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,699
few weeks.

104
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:46,969
Why don't you count it yourself
if you care so damn much.

105
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,640
Puta Madre Johnny! Half of this
is gonna go up your nose.

106
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:55,745
You never buy me shit.
I want a new purse and some of

107
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,747
those new boots that all the
girls have been wearing...

108
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,015
you are so lucky that you have a
woman that puts up with

109
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,820
your shit.... Pinche Guero.
(whitey)

110
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,255
I tell ya what baby we're
headed to Albuquerque next,

111
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:10,594
stop at the mall or somewhere,
get ya whatever ya want.

112
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,228
But, I gotta make a
few more stops first.

113
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,764
A lot of good little churches
in this part of the country.

114
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,601
We should be able to
make out like banditos.

115
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,212
Hey babe, do you
remember my fifteenth?

116
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,015
Yeah, I remember the party.
Didn't your uncle get all

117
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,384
drunk and smash up the
piñata with a baseball bat?

118
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,353
All the little kids got candy,
he got a boot in the ass from

119
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,789
your daddy.

120
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,925
Ay, Teo Chewy.
He was my favorite.

121
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:00,964
He loved us kids. After my
father was killed, he looked

122
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,901
after me and my mom.
I will always love him for that.

123
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,169
Yeah, he was a good guy.

124
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:10,873
He lost his wife pretty early in
life and, and just... that drove

125
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,877
him to being a borracho.
(drunk)

126
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,412
Yeah, I get it.
I mean if I ever lost you I'd...

127
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:20,416
go crazy... just kill me.

128
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,084
I love you, mi amor.

129
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:25,088
I love you too.

130
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:51,113
How ya'll doin'? Come
on in. Don't be shy. Ma'am, there's a...

131
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:54,416
She's fine buddy!
Where you keep the agave at?

132
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,386
If you mean tequila,

133
00:10:56,388 --> 00:11:00,190
it's right there in
the corner. You can't miss it.

134
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,160
I keep the pints back here.
I got some sales on half

135
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:08,498
gallons... douche bag.

136
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,229
Fuck me!

137
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:58,381
I got all you can handle.

138
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,517
Hey! What the hell you think
you are lookin' at? Huh?

139
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,685
You think I can't see
you eye fuckin' her?

140
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,953
You ought to take it as a
compliment... don't be such a

141
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,153
fuckin' hot head.

142
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,321
Aw, did you really just fuckin'
say that? You dumb fuckin'

143
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:08,458
You dumb fuckin' country rube,
I ought to come back there

144
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,459
and rip your fuckin' head off.

145
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,459
Come on...

146
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,528
Keep the change,
motherfucker!

147
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,464
Ya'll come back
now, ya hear.

148
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:51,099
Ah, shit. No fuckin' way.

149
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:58,810
All right, I'll be right back.

150
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:09,151
Good evening, my son. Your
vacancy sign is lit up brighter

151
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,453
than a Las Vegas Casino.

152
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,522
Good evening Father,
I can call you Father? Right?

153
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,358
I ain't a father in
the biological or the

154
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,259
Catholic sense,
but you call me pastor,

155
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:21,430
reverend... just don't call me a
son-of-a-bitch is all...

156
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,065
the wife and I need
a room for the night.

157
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:23,767
Oh, sure.

158
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,901
How much is that gonna cost me?

159
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:28,938
Just so happens that we
have our best room available.

160
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,305
And you know
what, just for you...

161
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:33,142
I can do a special discount
of thirty nine a night.

162
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,612
There's fifty and keep the
change. Why don't you keep the

163
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,446
T&A off your mind
while you are at work son.

164
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,681
I could see what you were doin'.

165
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,617
Don't you know that Internet
porno shit will rot your brain?

166
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,318
Keep it clean.

167
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,353
Might need a wake up call in
the morning, I'll let ya know.

168
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:49,124
Sure Father, uh,
Reverend. Room One.

169
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:52,161
Uh, Father... I was
wondering if you could help me

170
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,129
with something?

171
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,364
Sure my son,
what can I do for ya?

172
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,533
Look I... I know this is gonna
be strange coming from a guy you

173
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:03,039
just met at a motel. But you
know me and my, my old lady

174
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,342
we've been... we've been
fighting a lot lately.

175
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:09,045
I... If shit doesn't change,
I... I'm gonna lose her...

176
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,381
she's... she's gonna leave me.

177
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,449
Could you... pray for us?

178
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:19,656
You know do like whatever you
spiritual people do? Only if you

179
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,291
want to, Father. You know
what, I'm sorry, I'm way out of

180
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,459
line... I shouldn't have
said anything...

181
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:27,195
Give me your hand and bow
your head kid. C'mon... uhhhh,

182
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:31,968
other hand.

183
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,536
Father Almighty, come to
this young man in his hour of

184
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:39,608
despair, heal him and his lady.
Teach them the wisdom to act

185
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,047
together. Bestow upon them the
power of compromise and...

186
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,483
In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

187
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:53,022
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

188
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:58,994
If you need anything at all...
anything, just... just dial zero.

189
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:13,408
Go in faith son.... Go in faith.

190
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,511
What was
that about? I saw you in there

191
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:20,248
praying with that guy. Let
me guess, money problems?

192
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,088
Pobrecito. I wish we were rich
and we could help everybody.

193
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,223
Yeah,
it's just some a... poor soul

194
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,458
having trouble with his
girlfriend, asked for a little

195
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,295
help from above. And we are
rich. Alright, just keep saying

196
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,265
that. Speak words into existence
and one day it'll be true.

197
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,568
Just watch and see,
just watch and see.

198
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:45,210
- We are rich.
- We are rich.

199
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,392
God damn
baby can ya please just bring it

200
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,661
down a notch? I'm trying work
on my sermon. I need to

201
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:06,561
focus on this shit, please.

202
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,198
Shut the
hell up Johnny. You never let me

203
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,709
have any fun.
What's up your ass any way?

204
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:24,613
You ever get the feeling that
God's giving me a purpose?

205
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:31,353
Maybe God gave me a gift. That
woman... in the chair, she got

206
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,689
up and walked after I touched
her. I always think they're

207
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:39,395
bullshittin' but, maybe they
were all healed. I mean maybe

208
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:43,598
God gave me... a gift. When I
was a little kid I used to think

209
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,238
I could heal animals. Maybe even
raise the dead. Becca I really

210
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,811
think God's given me the power.

211
00:16:55,813 --> 00:17:01,483
You know what I think? I think
you put too much of that shit up

212
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:04,187
your nose.

213
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,255
Yeah but sometimes it
seems like I will live forever

214
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,824
and sometimes it feels like
death is right around the corner

215
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,594
just waitin' to jump on me.

216
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:20,369
I'll never see it comin'. But I
do believe in life after death.

217
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:23,405
...Maybe you're right, maybe I'm
just going nuts but, am I crazy

218
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:27,343
for believing these things? Only
God knows the truth. It's not

219
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:31,847
like I'm first guy to ever
get the power, ya know...

220
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:38,554
Look at me
Johnny... I don't just want a

221
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:49,164
boyfriend. I want a husband. I
want a family. Whether you are

222
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:54,504
touched by an angel
or just an evangelist.

223
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,509
It doesn't matter to me.

224
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:03,312
I want to settle down. I'm
tired of this life on the road,

225
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:06,282
Johnny.

226
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:12,889
I know, baby.
In time. Princess, I promise.

227
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:19,394
It's all in good time.

228
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:37,215
You expect me to
eat this shit? You want mine?

229
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,144
Shut up! Shut up!

230
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,248
Hey, Hey!

231
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,487
It's me... Hey, it's okay.
It's me... you were having a

232
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:25,460
nightmare. It's okay. It's me.
Relax, it's okay. Nobody's gonna

233
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:32,701
hurt you. You're okay. It was
just a nightmare. Let me get you

234
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,705
some water.

235
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:41,513
Drink it baby...

236
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,526
It's okay....

237
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,930
You're fine.

238
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:19,681
Baby I've
been having these weird dreams.

239
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:21,750
I don't know how to explain
'em. It doesn't make any sense

240
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:26,389
and... and there's these other
dreams where its me as a little

241
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,793
kid with my dad.
I don't understand it.

242
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:33,996
Maybe you need to check into a
mental hospital or go see a

243
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:34,896
shrink.

244
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:38,734
Go see a
shrink. You fuckin' kiddin' me?

245
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:40,835
Are you even listening to me?
You understand what I'm talking

246
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:43,538
about? These dreams are drivin'
me fuckin' crazy. And look all

247
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,841
This shit is all you fuckin"
care about, God damnit.

248
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,109
MOTHERFUCKER that's...!

249
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:49,745
Stare in the fuckin' mirror all
God damn day... you don't give a

00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,713

- Shit about me. You fuckin"...-

251
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,682

- You gonna hit me now, huh?

254
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,061
You gonna hit me now
like your dad used to beat you?

255
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:14,769
God damn it... Fuck!

256
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:26,684
Hey... Hey, I'm sorry... I

Where'd you get
that ugly ass shirt?

288
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:35,331
Your 'ole lady left it at
my place, asshole.

289
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:41,036
Oh 'kay, so it's like that.

290
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,006
Look, I was wondering if you
guys may be able to help me out?

291
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:47,241
Help you out...

292
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:50,011
You know where I can
score a little a...

00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,347
little action?

294
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:56,884
So the little boy is lookin'

295
00:25:56,886 --> 00:26:01,789
Nope, not, not exactly...
I need about ten of these.

296
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,758

Look man, are you
the fuckin' five-o

298

think we got the hookup?

299
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:13,901
Just because we
look the part means we are?

300
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:16,904
I mean you think you can
just walk into a place, put in

301
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:19,775
an order and BAM you're
gonna have it right there?

302
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,043
You gotta be fuckin' high man.

303
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,710
I ain't,
I ain't a fuckin' cop.

304
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:24,680
Alright you either
got the shit or you don't.

305
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,685
What's it gonna be?
I ain't got time to fuck around.

306
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:29,584
This motherfucker is a pig.

307
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,888
I can smell him. I'm still on
probation, I don't need this

308
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,093

309
00:26:36,926 --> 00:26:41,162
Look man, I think
you might be alright.

00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,931
Time will tell.

00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,937
Here is a little bump for you.

312
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,405
I might be able to help you out.

313
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:51,940
You got the money?

314
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,940

I heard that, shit head.

335
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,301
He heard it, he's
gonna forget it though in a few

336
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:30,205
minutes. Hey we have all kinds
of guns here. We got nines, we

00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,074

& Wesson, we got Glock, we got

338
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:36,944

00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:39,515

341
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:43,518
That belonged to my 'ole
man. Uh, that a 1911?

342
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,519
Can I see that one?

343
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,755
What year is that? Yea, I used

344
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:51,459
to have one of those back in the
day. Ya know, I laid more pipe

345
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:55,530
in that car, than a plumber.
Get it? A plumber.

346
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,533
Shut up.

347
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,767
How many extra clips
come with this one?

348
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:03,071
Um, you get one with the gun and
then one extra comes with it.

349
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:07,409
You know my wife made me sell
my old '67 when we got married.

350
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,309
How much?

351
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,545
She hated that car.

352
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,279
I mean out the door...
how much? Cash money.

353
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,882
The Colt is a good
choice for you sir.

354
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,084

hundred dollars... even.

Hey man, you

Better have them Benjamins, yo.

362
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:13,040
They ain't Benjamin's, but I got

00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:16,612
Okay, good good.

one of those ho's stomach,

00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,034
You sure you ain't
the five-o cuz?

369
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,503
You don't look like no junky.

We all got our vices brother.
Mine just happens to be powder.

371
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,309
It takes me up to heaven, even
if it's just for a little bit.

372
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,446
I'm in a hurry so if we
could get on with it.

373
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,414

00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,968
Please God hear me.

Oh Lord please. Lord, Chapter

00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:56,510
they shall be healed. Please.
Amen Jesus. Please Lord.

393
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,713
In Jesus name,

00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,282
Lord Almighty, hear
my prayer. Please Lord.

395

Please believe.
Oh God, please.

396

00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,674

399
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:29,076
Oh, Johnny are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

400
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,746
No, I'm really
serious Becca, come on.

401
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,613
Get dressed. Come on. We gotta
get the fuck outta here, right

402
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,349
now. Come on!
I don't got time for your shit.

403
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,017
I'll explain on the road.
Come on! You understand?

404
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,152
We gotta go right fuckin' now.

405
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:40,021
What the? I need some...
a few minutes to get ready.

406
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,757
Stop! I don't need your
shit. Come on. Just hurry up.

407
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,966
Are you listening? Come on!
Get dressed... Jesus Christ.

408
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:57,104
Are you going to tell me
what the hell is going on?

409
00:32:57,106 --> 00:33:00,307
You just barge in,
treat me like fucking shit...

410
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,576
and then you just want to run
off like you robbed a bank.

411
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:04,211
- Just shut the fuck....
- What the hell is going on?

412
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,148
- No.
- Shut the fuck up for minute, okay?

413
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,049
I just had some really
weird shit happen and I

414
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,316
just need a minute
to think. Okay?

415
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:11,219
You know what?
Keep this shit up!

416
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:14,523
Because, I'm gonna be on a bus
back to Texas... really soon.

417
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,225
I just tried to buy some coke
and I ended up shooting a guy.

418
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:20,062
Alright? I shot
a guy but he's okay.

419
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,296
- Are you insane?
- I, I pu, I put,

420
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,398
my hands on him and he healed,
okay? Healed 'em, and he walked

421
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,335
away. I don't know how... but,
it's true. Just don't worry.

422
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:35,779
We'll go get us some food...
everything is gonna be okay.

423
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,453
Alright!... God damn,
piece of shit...

424
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:49,356
Awwwwww!

425
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,359
Piece of shit.

426
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:54,362
Shut the fuck up, alright?

427
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:58,767
You shut up... I hate your face.

428
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,385
Hi, can I get you
something to drink?

429
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:21,655
I'll take iced tea,
non-sweet, extra lemon please.

430
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:24,258
I'll have a water, no ice.

431
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,262
I'll be right
back with your drinks.

432
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:31,166
You never told me
how you got the gun.

433
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,401
Was that a divine miracle
too, or did you lie to me?

434
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:37,271
I got it from a pawn shop, okay.

435
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:38,106
Alright?

436
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,575
I need a little
extra protection.

437
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,811
Speaking of which,
runnin' low on funds,

438
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:47,282
I got enough for about another
week, might have to sell my

439
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:53,324
watch. We need to
hit another church soon.

440
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:04,635
Order up!

441
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Anything good in that paper?

442
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:18,313
Not unless you mean a
painter or a handyman needed...

443
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:21,650
Pinche Guerros are too
damn lazy in this country.

444
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,920
Let me see it.
You don't know where to look.

445
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,820
Ahhhh.

446
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,923
Pendejo!
Whatever, Johnny the Baptist...

447
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:32,193

448
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:36,630
Look... right there.
Big as fuckin' Dallas...

453
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:58,954
I hope you know that. It may

454
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,956
He always provides.

455
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,626
Afraid I lost ya out on
the road back there...

456
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:08,295
Johnny what you said, it really
messed with my head.

457
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:11,233
I don't know how much
longer I can take this shit.

458
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:15,604
I'm starting to freak out, okay?
This fantasma cucu crap is esta

00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,673

I love you.

461
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:27,849
Tell ya what, I'll make ya a
bet. I pick out a song on that

462
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,786
jukebox and you get
up here and dance with me.

463
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,521
I never get to dance
with the girl I love.

464
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,523
And what is the bet?

465
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,525
Two pairs of boots...
instead of one, if ya dance.

466
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,362
You think I'm scared?
I'm not scared.

467
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,865
This Latina isn't scared of
shit. I will dance naked for

468
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:44,865
those boots.

469
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:45,800
- Oh yeah?
- Um hum.

470
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:48,806
Ya might have to.

471
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,934
This could be a big one
for us baby. We really need it.

472
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:57,942
Runnin' low. Wish me luck.

473
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:11,686
Okay, Okay Mrs. Taylor...
I'll get that out to you right away.

474
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:18,092
Oh, and God Bless.
Yes, uh huh. Bye Bye now.

475
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:21,528
Howdy Ma'am, I'm Pastor Jones.
My wife and I were having dinner

476
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,764
out on the highway last night
and we came across your ad and

477
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,633
thought we'd pay ya a visit.
Ya see we're headed out to

478
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,103
California to do the Lord's
work, a little church just North

479
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,572
of Fresno. We had a few days
free so we thought we'd stop by

480
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:33,775
and see if we could be of some
assistance to you and the good

481
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:34,742
people of the church?

482
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:38,746
Bless you, Pastor.
You said, Pastor Jones?

483
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,115
Well, Bless you too. Yes, that's
right, Pastor Johnny Jones.

484
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:42,916
Originally from the
Great State of Texas.

485
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:46,121
Texan, aye?
My daughter married a Texan.

486
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,822
Oh, that's a lucky lady.

487
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:55,662
Um, yes Pastor Jones our pastor
of 10 years took ill and died

488
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:59,501
last month. And we have been
without guidance for three weeks

489
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:05,139
now. The associate pastor has
been just overwhelmed. He's very

490
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:08,142
young. Hasn't even
finished seminary yet.

491
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,612
Well I just, I'm so sorry
to hear that, sister.

492
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,648
We would be delighted to have
you this weekend to lead us in

493
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,153
guidance and in prayer if you
could? The assistant has just

494
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:23,590
been booked with paying house
calls and doing the job of two.

495
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:26,860
I know that he would be
very happy to get a break.

496
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:30,565
Well he does the best he can
with his experience, ya know?

497
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:31,699
Sister O'Neal is it?

498
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,168
Oh please, call me Mary, Pastor.

499
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,037
Mary, I would be absolutely
delighted to lead the church

500
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,574
this Sunday. I... It would be
the least we could do.

501
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:43,545
After all a church in need, is
the Lord's church indeed.

502
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,581
We hit the jackpot honey...
house full of Baptist just dying

503
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,749
to give to the Lord.
We're on for this Sunday.

504
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,985
Maybe now I can get
my new purse and shoes?

505
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:54,555
Yeah, I'll get
your damn boots.

506
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:59,130
Ahhh... thank you God.

507
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,483
Hey honey, hurry up in there...
I gotta take a shit.

508
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,219
That burger
yesterday isn't sittin' right.

509
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,425
In a minute.

510
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:39,166
Jumpin' Jesus. Thank God.
I was about to explode.

511
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:46,039
Gross. Esta Cochino Marano.

512
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,610
Hey honey... why don't ya pick

513
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,043

514
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,579
What do you mean?
All of my dresses are cute.

515
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:56,117
Yea, I know but I... I really
want to impress these people.

516
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,985
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

517
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:03,493
Yea,
it could be a big haul for us.

518
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:16,304
Mmm, you smell good... why
don't you go pick out a dress?

519
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,139
Ahhh, yes.

520
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:23,043
Which one do you
think I should wear on Sunday?

521
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:25,813
Ahhhhh um...

522
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:29,284
Do you think we will ever get
married, Johnny? We've been

523
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,686
together forever now.
I'm ready.

524
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:35,692
Do you want to have kids?

525
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:41,829
You sure know how to end the
night, dont'cha? Look I promise

526
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:47,568
as soon as I'm ready for all
that, I'll let you know first.

527
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,170
I still got
my new purse and boots, right?

528
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,307
Yes, you get your new purse and
boots... because you're my

529
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,077
princess. But, right now
I needa little R.F.P.

530
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,845
What is R.F.P.?

531
00:41:57,847 --> 00:42:00,315
Uh, Rebecca's
fantastic pussy.

532
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:05,320
Get over here.

533
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,820
Honey...

534
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:14,921
Hmm?

535
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:17,090
I'm gonna take the car
out for a few hours to get some

536
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:20,394
girl stuff.
Do you need anything?

537
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:22,996
No but, hurry up and get
your ass back here quick.

538
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:24,699
I gotta get my suit dry
cleaned for Sunday.

539
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:29,202
Okay, grumpy.
I'll be back pronto.

540
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:32,842
Bye.

541
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:52,059
Ay, ay, ay, ay,
canta y no llores.

542
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:58,231
(yes, yes, yes,
Sing and don't cry)

543
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:27,831
AHH! MOTHER FUCKER!

544
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:34,168
I told Little Johnny I don't
want that fuckin' dog in

545
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,036
the house.

546
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,737
- That's enough.
- Literally, tie it up.

547
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,005
Fuck... Shut the fuck up.

548
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:40,340
I don't give a shit.

549
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:41,342
Get away from me.

550
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:42,342
No, you come here bitch.

551
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:43,344
I hate you.

552
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:44,211
Where the fuck you going?

553
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,213
I'm just trying to
get away from you!

554
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,280
Okay.

555
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,132
Bueno? (hello)

556
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:39,934
Hey Mom, it's me, Becca.

557
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,537
Ay, Mija...
I've been so worried about you.

558
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,173
It's been like two weeks
since you've called me.

559
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,941
Donde estas, Mija?

560
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,142
I'm here in
Nuevo Mexico with Johnny.

561
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:52,079
Mija, El es el diablo.
(he is the devil)

562
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:54,081
Everything is going to be okay.

563
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,083
We just need some time.

564
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:59,220
We talk about marriage
and ninas one day...

565
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:04,258
Okay, mi amor... just take of
yourself. Promise me that,

566
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,994
if you need anything, that
you're going to call me.

567
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:11,833
Si Mama, I promise. Mom, I have
to let you go. I'm gonna do some

568
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,001
shopping. But, I love you, okay?

569
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,237
Okay, mi amor. Te amo. Te quiero mucho.
(I love you very much)

570
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,572
Bye mama, te quiero.

571
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,307
Adios, mija.

572
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,969
Hey Baby...
you get your beauty sleep?

573
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,137
Yea, I gotta get
my suit cleaned.

574
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,472
You get all your
ladies stuff?

575
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:54,474
I did. I also got my boots.

576
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:55,575
Whhhhaaat?

577
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:56,610
I saved you a trip to the mall.

578
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,612
Yea, I don't have to hear
about that any more.

579
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,146
I talked to my mom too.

580
00:47:00,148 --> 00:47:01,115
How's she doin'?

581
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:04,150
She's fine.
Um, she's just worried about me.

582
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:06,153
Just being a typical mom.

583
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:09,490
God damn baby, I love your mama.
Sweetest woman on the planet.

584
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:11,492
Nobody's got a
bigger heart than her.

585
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:15,162
I guess I got her to thank for
your lovely personality.

586
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:18,065
And that's a turn on. You know
most guys got fat bitchy old

587
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,133
ladies.

588
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,969
Well mister, what if I turn
bitchy, fat, and ugly?

589
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:23,070
Ah, I don't see
that happening.

590
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:25,238
Ah, this piece of shit.

591
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,213
Ah mother... just needs a
little love. There it goes.

592
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,204
I'm tired.
I'm tired of this...

593
00:47:58,206 --> 00:47:59,539
Yea, you know what?
I'm fuckin' tired too.

594
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:03,346
- Well I just...
- Stop talkin', fuck!

595
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:08,115
You know what?
It's none of your fuckin'

596
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:09,215
business how much
money there is left.

597
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:10,117
Why not?

598
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:11,117
Or what the fuck I
did with it, alright?

599
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,688
- It is my business...
- you're not doing shit.

600
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,295
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

601
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,197
What are you doing in the middle
of the God damn fuckin' road?

602
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,499
Shit. Fuck.
Fuckin' insurance?

603
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:29,570
Well, Mister miracle man... are
you going to prove it to me now?

604
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:32,405
What are you trying to be funny?

605
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,441
What?

606
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,242
What about the bullshit...

607
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,709
...Shut the fuck up.
Just shut up.

608
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:36,610
Uh, fuck you!

609
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:40,581
Ah, God.
Heavenly Father, heal this man.

610
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:43,717
Descend upon this man's leg.
Heal his broken limb.

611
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,753
Put the fire of
Jesus in my hands.

612
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:49,492
Heal this man, Lord.
Heal this man.

613
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:01,469
I'm healed.

614
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,470
Just... just get out of here.

615
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:07,141
- I... you healed me.
- Here... just go, just leave.

616
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,476
Who are you?

617
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,110
Just get outta here!

618
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:14,250
You healed me.

619
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:24,291
I can't believe it.
You weren't lying to me.

620
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm in love with a miracle man.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

621
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:00,193
How do I look?

622
00:50:00,195 --> 00:50:03,130
You look a lot like the man that
fucked me twice this morning.

623
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:06,168
Yea, I bare a strong
resemblance, don't I?

624
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:11,805
Alright.

625
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:13,340
You ready?

626
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,543
Yea, I think so.

627
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,547
Let's do this.

628
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,184
Good morning,
how are you?

629
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,519
Good morning,
thank you for coming.

630
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:27,287
Good morning, Pastor.

631
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:28,421
Good morning,
how are you, ma'am?

632
00:50:28,423 --> 00:50:30,624
I am just fine.
We are so happy to

633
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:33,693
have you with us this Sunday.
The ladies of the church have

634
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:36,362
made lunch for you all.
You will stay, won't you?

635
00:50:36,364 --> 00:50:38,231
Well of course we will.
I would never turned down fine

636
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,566
home cooked meal.
So thoughtful of you

637
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:40,834
and the sisters.
I can't wait.

638
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:43,369
I have prepared my
special apple cobbler for you.

639
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:45,606
Aw, you are kidding me? I was
just telling Rebecca how much I

640
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:46,840
miss my mama's apple cobbler.

641
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:49,275
Oh! Excellent.

642
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:51,512
Good morning.
How are you?

643
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:54,180
Good morning.
God bless ya.

644
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:58,121
Good morning.
Thank ya for coming.

645
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,854
Good morning,
people of the Lord.

646
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:02,090
Good morning.

647
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,559
I was driving here this blessed
morning and I told my lovely

648
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:08,528
wife, Rebecca, how blessed we
were to be welcomed into such a

649
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,566
fine church and community. But
moreover, how blessed the people

650
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:15,469
here were to have had such a
fine minster for so many years.

651
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,369
Hallelujah! Amen!

652
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:19,405
Now I know Pastor
Mike is lookin' down

653
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:22,409
on all of us right now with a
great big smile on his face.

654
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:24,878
I'm Reverend Jones and I come
here today with one purpose and

655
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,215
one purpose only. And that
purpose is to share in the power

656
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:30,184
and the glory of the holy
spirit. Can I hear an Amen?

657
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:31,418
Amen!

658
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,554
Now I'm so often reminded of the
hardships that so many of us

659
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:39,159
face throughout our lives be it
pain and suffering, financial

660
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:41,595
troubles, or maybe the loss of a
loved one. But here's what the

661
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:43,630
Lord says:

662
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:46,166
"Seek first
the kingdom of God and his

663
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:50,371
righteousness and all these
things will be made unto you."

664
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,940
Let us not look at the sudden
departure of Pastor Mike as a

665
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:56,443
tragedy but rather as God's
will. He had bigger things in

666
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:58,278
mind for him.
Amen!

667
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,780
Amen.

668
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:05,452
Now I'd like for you all to turn
your Bible's to Malachi 3 10.

669
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:08,354
"Bring ye all the tithes into
the storehouse, and prove me now

670
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:11,925
herewith, so sayeth the Lord of
hosts. If I will not open for

671
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:14,795
you the windows of heaven and
pour you out a blessing."

672
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:17,231
Now I want you to pay attention
to that verse and see how the

673
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,934
Lord operates. See the Lord
says, if you bring a seed to be

674
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:24,572
sewn with your tithe. He in
return releases the blessings he

675
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,574
has in store for you.
Can I hear an Amen?

676
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,708
Amen.

677
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,709
See we believe in a Lord of
plenty not in a Lord of

678
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:30,811
emptiness. Amen.

679
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:32,012
Amen.

680
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:34,615
In order to receive God's
blessing we must all be faithful

681
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:37,650
to his promises. We all must sew
that seed when we open our

682
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:40,387
hearts to bring forth
a blessing unto Him.

683
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:41,387
Amen.

684
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,655
Amen.

685
00:52:42,657 --> 00:52:45,959
Now as I look out into the crowd
on this beautiful Sunday, I see

686
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:50,965
a lot of tears. I see some
wheelchairs. I know some of you

687
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,499
are in pain and need relief.

688
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,501
So I'm gonna ask those of you
that need some healing to come

689
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:58,505
on down to the front and let me
pray for ya. Take a leap of

690
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:01,374
faith. Come on. Come on,
don't be afraid. Help the people

691
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:02,842
that can't get down themselves.

692
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:07,951
Don't be shy, God's waitin'
for ya. Amen. Come on.

693
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:14,854
Fire!

694
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:20,360
Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!
Thank you Lord.

695
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:24,565
Fire!

696
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:30,838
Hallelujah!

697
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:36,376
Fire!

698
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:39,382
Hallelujah!

699
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,892
My son do you believe
that you will see today?

700
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:54,394
Yes. Yes.

701
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:55,496
Do you believe in the Lord?

702
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,463
Uh huh.

703
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:57,563
- Yes!
- I can't hear you.

704
00:53:57,565 --> 00:53:58,465
Do you believe in the Lord?

705
00:53:58,467 --> 00:53:59,800
Yes. Yes.
Let me hear you scream it.

706
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:03,670
Yes! Yes, I believe! I believe.

707
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:05,905
The Lord almighty said
said let there be light.

708
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:09,476
The Lord said
let there be healing.

709
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:12,845
Fire!

710
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,581
Now son,
when I remove my hands,

711
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,516
you will be healed.

712
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:17,517
Do you believe in the Lord?

713
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,257
Yes! Yes! Yes!

714
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,561
What is it my son?

715
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:32,833
I can see. I can see!

716
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,613
Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound.

717
00:54:47,615 --> 00:54:50,083
That saved
a wretch like me.

718
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:55,088
I once was lost,
now I am found.

719
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,958
I was blind,
but now I see.

720
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,094
Now I want to ask
each and everyone of you to sew

721
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,329
a seed with the
Lord in your hearts.

722
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,530
Help break down those walls
keepin' you from bein' healed or

723
00:55:04,532 --> 00:55:07,700
gettin' those bills paid this
month. Put your trust in the

724
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:11,905
Lord that all your needs will be
met. He will not let you down.

725
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,907
We're going to go ahead and
pass around the collection plate

726
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:18,045
while the organ plays. God bless
you. God bless you all...

727
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:19,045
Hallelujah!

728
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:21,715
Hallelujah!

729
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:29,326
(sniffing sound)

730
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:47,740
Thank ya,
Sister. Thank you. Thank you.

731
00:55:47,742 --> 00:55:49,943
Reverend Jones, I
just want to thank you for what you

732
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:51,512
did for my brother.

733
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,648
It was truly a miracle.
You have the gift.

734
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,150
I mean he's been
blind since the war.

735
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:59,753
It may be a gift. But, it's a
gift from God to your brother.

736
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,757
I'm merely an
instrument of the Lord.

737
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:06,693
So how
long are you in town Pastor?

738
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,162
I'm sad to say ma'am we
gotta get movin' in the mornin'.

739
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,532
Ya know, out to California to do
some more good work for the

740
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,566
Lord.

741
00:56:12,568 --> 00:56:13,766
Church will be open up soon.

742
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:17,470
Oh, so what is the
name of your new church?

743
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:20,441
It's the Calvary Community
Church just outside of Fresno.

744
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,943
Um hum, um ma'am, this
cobbler reminds me

745
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,711
of my mama's. It's delicious.

746
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:31,050
Oh, you are too kind Pastor,
let me get you another piece.

747
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,052
After all, I did make
it special for you.

748
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:35,057
Bless you!

749
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:46,934
That was a close one, Mr. Jones.
You better be glad I was here to

750
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,101
save your culo.
(butt)

751
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:51,572
Yeah, you're not shittin'
me. Ole' bag does make a mean

752
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,577
cobbler though. Here...

753
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:01,215
You think you will
ever get caught?

754
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,016
Caught?

755
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:07,019
What do you mean, caught?
The Lord's on our side baby.

756
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:10,224
Whatever, Johnny.
We're just a modern day

757
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:14,994
Bonnie and Clyde. Heck our next
home is just the next pinche

758
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:18,764
motel in the next
pinche little town.

759
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:23,936
I'm tired Johnny.
I want a home, I want a family.

760
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:27,943
I know honey. All that'll come.

761
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:30,943
All that'll come.

762
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,778
I promise but you
gotta stick with me a little

763
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,054
bit longer... we're almost
home free. Alright?

764
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,970
Are we almost there?

765
00:57:57,972 --> 00:57:59,805
Yea baby, just a
few more hours.

766
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,240
Look, you see
them mountains?

767
00:58:01,242 --> 00:58:03,976
When they start gettin' bigger
you know we're gettin' close.

768
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:05,979
Alright? Just hang in there.

769
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:11,050
Ah shit! What does this
motherfucker want?

770
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:13,753
Fuck. God damnit.

771
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:15,155
Becky, where's
the coke?

772
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:16,289
In the glovebox.

773
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:21,161
And the gun too?
Ah, shit.

774
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,030
Alright, everything is
going to be okay... just be

775
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,032
cool, I'll talk us out of this.
We'll be back on the road in

776
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:27,700
five minutes.

777
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:37,478
How you doin'?

778
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,213
License,
registration, and proof of insurance.

779
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:43,617
I, uh... I've got my
driver's license but I'm pretty

780
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:46,186
sure I left my insurance card at
home... I, we definitely have

781
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:48,322
insurance no doubt about that.

782
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,057
I... what's the
reason for pulling us over?

783
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,193
Your tags are expired.
You know it is against the law

784
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:55,662
to operate a motor vehicle
without proper registration,

785
00:58:55,664 --> 00:58:56,762
proof of insurance.

786
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:58,898
I'm a pastor and me
and my wife are on our way to a

787
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,668
revival... anyway you can
just give us a warning?

788
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,670
You sure you don't have an
insurance card in your glovebox?

789
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:05,671
Anywhere? An old one?

790
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:06,873
Ah, I'm, I'm
pretty sure I don't.

791
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:10,077
Why, Why don't ya check?

792
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,278
Officer I...

793
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,947
Sir, I can not let you leave
without proof of registration

794
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:17,351
and proof of insurance.

795
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,885
Go ahead and
check your glove box.

796
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,057
- Wait...
- Shit! shit, shit...

797
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,959
Oh my God! Why did you do that?

798
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:27,961
God damn...

799
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:28,729
Turn-a-round!

800
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,996
What do you
mean, turn around?

801
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:31,097
You can heal him.

802
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:32,298
I'm not going back there...

803
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,668
You're gonna let him die?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

804
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,702
Turn-a-round, Johnny!

805
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:37,570
Shut up!

806
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:40,742
Alright, I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try.

807
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:46,079
Oh, please Lord, please Lord
hear me... I've just shot a man

808
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:48,382
and I need ya to s......
I need ya to save him Lord.

809
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,383
Please hear me.

810
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,717
Please hear me Lord.

811
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,920
Fuck! It's not workin'.
Fuck, I can feel it.

812
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:54,987
I need to lay hands on him.

813
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:57,124
We have to go back.

814
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,726
- Hurry up!
- Alright. Alright, we gotta go back.

815
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:04,398
Shut up! Alright just... I got
this. We're gonna be alright.

816
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,066
Why do you keep
fucking up, Johnny?

817
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,900
I need ya to shut up
for me, alright?

818
01:00:07,902 --> 01:00:13,974
I'll get us out of this. Oh God
damn piece of shit car...

819
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,414
We'll be fine.

820
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:51,445
Police are investigating
the murder of a Quay County Deputy

821
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,847
Sheriff. While on a routine
traffic stop, Deputy Danny

822
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:57,983
Hernandez was shot at point
blank range by a gunman.

823
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:00,353
It is unknown who the
assailant is at this time.

824
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:02,988
But, police hope to learn more
after reviewing Deputy

825
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,293
Hernandez's onboard
police camera footage.

826
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:09,297
Fuck!

827
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,867
Alright, we
just gotta get to the border.

828
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,068
Alright, we'll get into Mexico.
Everything will be alright.

829
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,338
We'll be safe there.

830
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,474
We just gotta drive a little bit
further until it gets dark and

831
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:27,012
we'll ditch the car
somewhere. Ahhhh, fuck!

832
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:32,284
I should've listened to my mom.
I knew this was going to happ....

833
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:35,921
Look at me. I love you.
Alright, we're in this together.

834
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:38,492
I'm sorry this happened, but at
this point we'd both be guilty

835
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,026
in the court. Alright? So I
just need you to stick with me

836
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:42,295
for a little bit longer.

837
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:44,498
I'll get us out
of this. I promise.

838
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,863
We're gonna have to
ditch the car.

839
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:22,137
Okay, genius... then what?

840
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:26,405
There's a little town about five
miles ahead... we're gonna walk

841
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:30,209
there, and get us a room... and
I'll go get us something at a

842
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:33,213
used car lot. We have enough
money for a cheap car.

843
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,818
You really expect me to walk
five miles in heels? Please.

844
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,088
Johnny, this is too much
for me. This is not okay.

845
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,559
Else you do this,
or life in prison.

846
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:49,996
Alright? I'm tryin' to get us
out of this shit. I need you.

847
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:54,003
Alright? Just hold on. Let's go.

848
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,373
Alright, grab our shit.
Take only what we need.

849
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,842
Start walkin'. I'll catch up.

850
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,043
Now what Johnny?

851
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,048
Just fuckin' do it. Alright?

852
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,530
Alright, give me your
fucking shoes. Take em off.

853
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:31,530
- What?
- Give me your fuckin' shoes.

854
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:32,666
Just give em to me.

855
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:33,467
These are my favorite shoes.

856
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,873
I don't care.
Just give em to me.

857
01:04:40,675 --> 01:04:44,411
Haaa!
Johnny, what are you doing?

858
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,679
Fuck 'em.

859
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:51,016
Pendejo!
You're gonna spend a whole day

860
01:04:51,018 --> 01:04:52,052
with me at the mall. You know?

861
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,686
I could give a shit about
your fuckin' shoes.

862
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:54,688
Those were priceless.

863
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,894
Oh, little princess.
I don't care. Keep up...

864
01:05:01,228 --> 01:05:05,233
Give me the fuckin' bag.

865
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:13,241
Fuckin' damn it.

866
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,914
Coming...

867
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,920
Wait for me.

868
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:31,324
Can I get a room for
the night please?

869
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:36,729
Sure, fifty bucks...

870
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:39,566
Say a, where's your car?
Better yet, where's your

871
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:40,666
luggage?

872
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:42,735
Yea, well our car broke
down a couple miles back.

873
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:46,539
I had a wrecker come pick
it up, drop us off here...

874
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,673
and gonna get it
fixed in the morning.

875
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,608
I'm with my wife, she's
outside talkin' to her mama

876
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:50,844

877

01:05:55,282 --> 01:05:56,749

Yea, I got it. Uh, can I please

880
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,521

881
01:06:01,523 --> 01:06:05,492
Thank ya very much.

882
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,128
Quay County Authorities
are investigating the murder of one

883
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,764

Hernandez had pulled over a car

884
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:15,568

Reporting Live, from the Quay

893
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:42,595
County Sheriff's Office,
I'm Steve Olson.

894
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:44,697
Please help me God,
please Lord forgive me, please.

895
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:47,434
I didn't mean to Lord. It was
an accident. I acted without

896
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,470
thinking, God. Please spare me.
Please spare me and Becca please

897
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:54,477
God, please.

898
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,206
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

899
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:30,376
We're in business baby. Got us
a fresh ride. Cold air and new

900
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,211
tires. Everything.
We are all good.

901
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:36,615
Let me guess... you got
us a brand new Mercedes.

902
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:39,621
Uh, not quite.
Here, take a look.

903
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:46,126
See, she's a beauty, right?

904
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,561
It looks just like
the other one.

905
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:51,597
Are you kiddin' that's a
classic. I told you it's got new

906
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,235
tires. It's a beauty. Hey,
you know I love ya, right?

907
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,235
Um hum.

908
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,871
Yea.

909
01:07:58,873 --> 01:08:03,409
You know back
there that wasn't me.

910
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,878
As soon as we get to
Mexico we'll have a fresh start.

911
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,085
I don't think the cops
know what we look like.

912
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:13,887
Trust me. A little bit longer,
I'll get us out of this.

913
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,592
Lord's on our side, I promise.

914
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:27,433
I'm confused. This... tell me
everything is going to be okay.

915
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:32,638
I mean, Mexico... what
about my mom and my friends?

916
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,576
Look at me. I promise
everything is gonna be okay.

917
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:39,912
Alright, once we get down to
Mexico, and get all settle in

918
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:42,781
there, we can
invite your mom.

919
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:44,918
Ya know, it's not
gonna be forever.

920
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,924
Just till the heat dies down.
Three, may be five years max.

921
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:55,131
Okay, you trust me?

922
01:08:57,465 --> 01:09:00,666
Startin' to run low on cash
again... I'm gonna have to head

923
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:06,606
out of here pretty soon, figure
somethin' out. Okie dokie?

924
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:09,145
Okie, dokie, pokie.

925
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:17,152
(water is heard running)

926
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:29,554
You know they're looking for us.
It's all over the T.V.

927
01:10:29,556 --> 01:10:30,889
We're outta here
in the mornin'.

928
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:35,027
Three hundred miles to
the border and we're home free.

929
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:39,031
I need to call my Mom,
Johnny. What do I tell her?

930
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:43,238
Just be cool baby. Just tell
her everything is alright.

931
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,041
Tell her we're gettin' married.

932
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:52,247
That should change
her mind about me.

933
01:10:54,048 --> 01:10:58,451
Do you mean that?
Do you really mean that, Johnny?

934
01:10:58,453 --> 01:11:01,787
Or, is that the
yayo talking for you?

935
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:04,589
Baby, of course I mean it.
Soon as we get to Mexico, you

936
01:11:04,591 --> 01:11:09,597
and I are gettin' married.
And live happily ever after.

937
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:23,543
You know, you never officially
asked me. But, I guess this will

938
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,547
have to do.

939
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,753
In a couple of days,
you'll be Mrs. Johnny Jones.

940
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:37,089
Don't have to fake it anymore
and can finally put a ring on

941
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:43,298
your finger.
Make an honest woman out of you.

942
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,803
Do you think if I died, you'd be
able to revive me...

943
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:53,071
like those other people?

944
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:55,875
Gah, why ya gotta say shit like
that? If anything ever happen to

945
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:57,643
you, it'd kill me. You're my
whole world, Becca.

946
01:11:57,645 --> 01:11:58,945
You know that.

947
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:03,116
- I'm serious Johnny.
- Don't talk like that. Come on... just...

948
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,550
Do you think your gift only
works on certain people?

949
01:12:05,552 --> 01:12:08,553
I don't know how it works,
it just happens.

950
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:09,888
It makes me feel weird
just talkin' about it.

951
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,991
Change the
subject, alright?

952
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:15,861
Okay.

953
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,866
- What?
- Here's one for you...

954
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,802
Never mind. It's a surprise.

955
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,341
What?

956
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:28,775
It's your birthday next week...
I guess I can tell you.

957
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,009
What does your
mom finally like me?

958
01:12:31,011 --> 01:12:35,350
Unnh, unnh... Even better.

959
01:12:36,684 --> 01:12:38,151
What is it?
Come on... spit it out.

960
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,951
You're killin' me.

961
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:42,487
Okay.

962
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:45,924
You're gonna be a
father, Reverend Jones.

963
01:12:45,926 --> 01:12:47,026
Are you joking with me?

964
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:48,494
- Are you serious?
- Unnn, unnh...

965
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:50,696
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

966
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:53,699
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be a daddy.

967
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:55,701
You know how I went to la
farmacia the other day?

968
01:12:55,703 --> 01:12:56,936
Yea.

969
01:12:56,938 --> 01:13:01,574
Well, I got three pregnancy
test and they were all positive.

970
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:06,512
Oh shit... shit! Ahh, hoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo. I'm gonna be a daddy.

971
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:11,983
I'm gonna be a daddy.
Holy shit. I can't believe it.

972
01:13:11,985 --> 01:13:14,187
- Thank you.
- You're gonna be a great father.

973
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:17,893
Oh, my God.

974
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,731
Just think honey, in a
few days we'll be in paradise.

975
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:28,733
We'll finally settle down.
No more runnin' round, from town

976
01:13:28,735 --> 01:13:33,738
to town. I think I'm gonna start
a mission. May just be a

977
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,210
missionary, I don't know. You
can finally teach me Spanish.

978
01:13:38,212 --> 01:13:43,418
Just you and me, and the
baby makes three.

979
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,519
I'm down to my
last eight ball.

980
01:13:47,521 --> 01:13:51,891
Once that's gone,
I'm done. I promise.

981
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:56,094
Straighten up, and fly right.

982
01:13:56,096 --> 01:13:58,763
What is Mexico like?
You know my people,

983
01:13:58,765 --> 01:14:00,232
are all from there.

984
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:06,505
Ummm... it's a lot like this.
Mountains and sunshine.

985
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:10,108
A bit of a slower pace.
People are really nice.

986
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:14,246
Spiritual. It'd be a good place
to call home for a little bit.

987
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:18,250
Do they have a mall?

988
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:21,720
I swear that's all you
ever think about. Jesus.

989
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:26,726
I have to look good for my man.
Besides, it's my way of dealing

990
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:31,531
with stress. And I'm gonna need
a maternity wardrobe soon.

991
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,799
Wow, I wish you'd find a cheaper
way of dealin' with your stress.

992
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:37,806
You're costing me a fortune....

993
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,272
I'm gonna go be alone
for a little bit, alright?

994
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:41,941
- Get some God time.
- Yeah

995
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,543
You be okay here for your self?

996
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:47,280
Um hum.

997
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:49,208
Hey.
Good morning, sunshine.

998
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,675
Ummm.

999
01:15:50,677 --> 01:15:55,080
Come on. I'm starving.
Get up. I need coffee.

1000
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:59,218
It's only 6:30. It's...
ten more minutes.

1001
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,053
Come on. We have a long day
ahead of us. Okay, I need to

1002
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:03,054
call my mom too.

1003
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:04,723
Ummm.

1004
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:08,729
Get up. Cranky.

1005
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:14,068
Alright.

1006
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:24,076
Gotta piss.

1007
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:26,379
Hurry up.

1008
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:01,949
Get ya anything else? Alright.

1009
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:08,153
So where you
guys headed?

1010
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:09,388
Mexico.

1011
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:13,759
Mexico? Are you crazy? Those
border towns are more dangerous

1012
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,762
than the middle east.
It's a battle zone down yonder.

1013
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,964
I wouldn't wish that on
my worst enemy for even a day.

1014
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:22,835
We got the Lord on our side,
mister. I'm a preacher.

1015
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:25,236
Headin' down there to do a
little healin'. The sick, poor,

1016
01:17:25,238 --> 01:17:28,773
the elderly. I'm on a mission
of mercy you might say.

1017
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:34,780
Shit. I mean, shoot,
Reverend. Well, you better hope

1018
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:37,717
and pray God is on your side.
You know a couple went down

1019
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,885
there a few weeks ago... they
haven't been heard of since.

1020
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:42,987
Rumor has it that
they've been kidnapped.

1021
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:45,324
Being held for ransom.

1022
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:46,558
We'll be careful. Can you uh...

1023
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,327
wrap this up? Tryin' to get
out of here before it gets dark.

1024
01:17:49,329 --> 01:17:51,464
Yea, it's a two thirty five.

1025
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,467
Hey, uh Billy, might
want to check your toilette.

1026
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,469
Every time I flushed her down,
the water came right back up to

1027
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,437
the top.

1028
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:00,839
Uh baby, I'm gonna
wait for you in the car.

1029
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:01,840
I'm not feeling well.

1030
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:02,942
Alright.

1031
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,843
Why is it every time
you come in here and take a dump

1032
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:07,012
you have to stop
up the toilette?

1033
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,880
Now I'm gonna have to go back
there and snake it again.

1034
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:10,049
Yea, yea, yea, yea...

1035
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,349
Can you wrap this up?

1036
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:14,355
Let me get your
change, Reverend.

1037
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:21,293
Uh, Mike this gentleman
here is a preacher.

1038
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:22,894
No kiddin'.

1039
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:25,030
Yeah, he's going to be going
South of the border.

1040
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:27,933
I was just explaining to him
about the drug cartels and all

1041
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:29,902
the kidnapping that's been
going on down in Mexico.

1042
01:18:29,904 --> 01:18:34,205
Oh, Mexico. Yea. So, uh,
where ya be comin' from, uh

1043
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:36,107
Preacher man?

1044
01:18:36,109 --> 01:18:38,843
Texas. Uh, sorry... Arizona.

1045
01:18:38,845 --> 01:18:41,847
Huh, why you comin' through New
Mexico if you're going down to

1046
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,116
Mexico?

1047
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:52,223
Becca! Rebecca, what the fuck is
wrong with you? Come on!

1048
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:55,527
Sweet Jesus. What the fuck did
you do? Come on. We gotta go.

1049
01:18:55,529 --> 01:19:00,067
Oh God. Come on.

1050
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:11,410
Shit, shit, shit. I just don't
get it Becca. I don't understand

1051
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:12,812
what the fuck just
came over you.

1052
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,847
You just blew
those people away.

1053
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:15,848
I'm sorry.

1054
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,550
We're so screwed.

1055
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:21,920
I, I didn't want to be a single
mom. I got scared, Johnny.

1056
01:19:21,922 --> 01:19:23,955
Well just... next time
let me fuckin' handle it...

1057
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:29,029
alright? Just... don't start
shootin' people. Fuck!

1058
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,433
Ba..., Babe...
do you think you can stop at

1059
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:39,938
the next town? I need to use the
restroom and I wanna call mi

1060
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,107
mama. I won't tell her anything,
I promise. I just need to talk

1061
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:45,910
to her. It makes me feel better.

1062
01:19:45,912 --> 01:19:47,847
Yeah, I guess.
I just.. gotta keep

1063
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,449
this car outta sight, honey.
We're, We're fuckin' wanted now.

1064
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:53,986
They got us on camera now. This
is it. There's no turning back.

1065
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:58,324
We only got about
fifty miles to go. Shit.

1066
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,858
I miss my mom.

1067
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,393
Fuck. I know baby.

1068
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:08,000
I'm a killer now. I'm no better
than pinche Charlie Madson.

1069
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:11,469
It's Manson baby. Manson's a
psychopath. You're...-

1070
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:14,138
you're nothing like him. You're
trying to protect us. I get it.

1071
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,610
I understand. God'll forgive
you. I forgive you.

1072
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,815
You just can't do
shit like that.

1073
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:27,486
Promise me that we're gonna
raise our baby to be good.

1074
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:33,157
And not like us. I'm ashamed of
the things that we've done.

1075
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:36,327
I promise baby.
Everything is gonna be okay.

1076
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:39,430
We're gonna make it.

1077
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,692
Hola!?

1078
01:21:40,694 --> 01:21:42,695
Hey mom, it's me Becca.

1079
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:48,299
Ay, mija, why haven't you called
me? I've been worried sick.

1080
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:52,705
Mira, mama. Solo dispongo de un minuto.
(just needed a minute)

1081
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,074
I just wanted to call and let
you know that I'm alright.

1082
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,343
Mija,
I'm just worried about you.

1083
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,210
Please, please come home.

1084
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:02,513
Look, Mommy, Johnny and I
are going to Mexico.

1085
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:05,250
We're going to start a family.

1086
01:22:05,252 --> 01:22:07,085
I can't tell you
a lot more than that but I

1087
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:11,723
promise as soon as I get there,
I'll let you know more... okay?

1088
01:22:11,725 --> 01:22:15,727
Hijole mija Mexico.
Okay, please.

1089
01:22:15,729 --> 01:22:18,496
Please just be
careful and call me

1090
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:19,498
when you get there.

1091
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:25,536
I will. I promise.
Okay, mama.. I have to go.

1092
01:22:25,538 --> 01:22:26,772
But, I love you.

1093
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:32,277
Bye, mi amor. I love you too.
Please be careful, don't forget

1094
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:34,746
to call... I love you.

1095
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:36,115
Te amo, mama.
(good bye)

1096
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,750
Te amo.

1097
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:00,772
Almost there. Another fifty
miles and we're home free.

1098
01:23:00,774 --> 01:23:05,143
Hmm, I'm happy for us.
My mom is a nervous wreck.

1099
01:23:05,145 --> 01:23:08,112
I have to call her as soon as we
get there. I hate putting her

1100
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:12,651
through this. I love you.

1101
01:23:12,653 --> 01:23:14,419
I love you too, sexy.

1102
01:23:23,797 --> 01:23:27,331
So we know that if it's a boy
it'll be Johnny the third.

1103
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:30,169
But, what are we going to
name it if it's a girl?

1104
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,803
I don't know.
I'm not good with names.

1105
01:23:31,805 --> 01:23:34,673
Just pick something from the
Bible. It's always a safe bet.

1106
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:38,811
Okay.
How about Abigail?

1107
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:42,113
Oh God, anything but that,
Becca. Jesus! Abigail?

1108
01:23:42,115 --> 01:23:44,516
Sounds like an old lady.

1109
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:56,361
How about Ana?
I have a tia named Ana.

1110
01:23:56,363 --> 01:23:59,363
Ana, alright. I
can live with that.

1111
01:23:59,365 --> 01:24:03,701
Ana it shall be. I'm
still hopin' for Trey though.

1112
01:24:03,703 --> 01:24:07,839
Trey? What is Trey? I thought it
was gonna be Johnny the third?

1113
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:12,844
Yea... John... Trey means three.
It's a white thing I guess.

1114
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:15,113
Well, whatever. It's gonna
be a boy. I can feel it.

1115
01:24:23,524 --> 01:24:27,860
US Citizen? Habla English?

1116
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:29,861
No habla engles.
(I don't speak english)

1117
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:33,866
Salir de coche, por favor.
(open the door please)

1118
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:39,504
He's gotta a gun!

1119
01:24:53,887 --> 01:24:57,421
Ahhh shit. What's this?
That doesn't look good.

1120
01:24:57,423 --> 01:24:58,523
Is that the border?

1121
01:24:58,525 --> 01:25:01,528
Naaa, it's one of them
check points.

1122
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:15,907
What the fuck was that?
No! No, no, no, no, no.

1123
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:20,478
No! What the fuck?
Jesus Christ. Becca. No, no, no.

1124
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,315
You're gonna be okay.
You'll be fine. Oh shit.

1125
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:25,717
HELP!

1126
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:39,697
You're gonna be okay.
Oh God. Oh God.

1127
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:45,803
REBEC... Oh sweet... No, no, no,
no, no, no, no... God, no, no.

1128
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:48,307
HELP!

1129
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:56,647
Oh Father, what do I do? No, no,
no, no, no. Oh Becca, Ohhh shit,

1130
01:25:56,649 --> 01:26:02,955
Lord. Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I
need you more now than I've ever

1131
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:07,392
have. Please Heavenly Father.
Save this woman that I love and

1132
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:12,630
my unborn child. Please God,
please. Take me instead of them.

1133
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:17,639
Please God, please
take me. Please.

1134
01:26:46,533 --> 01:26:50,001
Oh babe, babe. Babe,
you're bleeding.

1135
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:51,637
You're safe. You're safe.

1136
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:59,010
- No! Baby?
- Thank God, you're safe.

1137
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:04,016
You and the baby are all that
matter... take care of the baby.

1138
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:07,885
What happened? No!

1139
01:27:07,887 --> 01:27:11,893
God's calling me home.

1140
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:29,409
Johnny? Hey baby. No, no! No!

1141
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:33,638
Well folks, that's how I went
out. I made some mistakes.

1142
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:39,477
Some big ones. God gave me the
power to help, to heal.

1143
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:42,981
Sometimes I used it for the good
of the people and several times

1144
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:46,785
I let my selfishness and
lack of faith get in the way.

1145
01:28:46,787 --> 01:28:49,553
The good father
had bigger plans for me.

1146
01:28:49,555 --> 01:28:52,391
So he's decided to
take me home.

1147
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,860
Rebecca and the baby,
they'll be fine.

1148
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:57,495
God granted me
one last miracle.

1149
01:28:57,497 --> 01:29:02,500
Life for my love and a
future for my unborn baby.

1150
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:05,137
If you were wondering, an angel
just whispered in my ear...

1151
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:08,607
it'll be a Trey after all.
Becca's gonna have a handful if

1152
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:13,512
he turns out anything like me.
Hell, I'm not complaining,

1153
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,714
all things considered...
the good and the bad,

1154
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:20,018
I was truly a lucky man...

1155
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,024
Adios!

1156
