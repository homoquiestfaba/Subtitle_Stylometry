00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,920
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

741
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,510
Time's runnin' out.

742
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,551
[Sighs]

743
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,798
His body's
startin' to reject it.

744
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,153
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

745
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,318
Why do you hunt them?

746
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,431
I had a family once--

747
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,030
wife and two daughters.

748
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,590
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

749
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,995
a vampire.

750
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,359
He toyed with 'em first,

751
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,109
tried to make me decide

752
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,198
which order
they'd die in.

753
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,633
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

754
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,195
but it's gettin' worse.

755
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,755
Because of Frost.

756
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,791
There's somethin'
happenin'

757
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,117
in the vampire ranks.

758
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,515
It's somethin' big...

759
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,279
and I'd stake my life

760
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,110
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

761
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,675
KAREN: Blade.

762
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,637
Whistler told me
what happened.

763
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,836
He told me
what you are.

764
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,232
You don't know me.

765
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,511
You don't know
anything about me.

766
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,676
I'm not human.

767
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,474
You look human
to me--

768
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,309
Humans don't
drink blood.

769
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,796
That was
a long time ago.

770
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,038
Maybe you should
let that go.

771
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,273
I have spent
my whole life

772
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,871
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

773
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,197
It made me what I am.

774
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,396
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

775
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,229
I get a little piece
of that life back,

776
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,956
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

777
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,831
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

778
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,998
Two of them against your
entire security force?

779
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,351
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

780
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,074
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate--

781
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,794
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

782
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,036
Aah! You little skeez!

783
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,708
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

784
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,878
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

785
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,469
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

786
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,672
You got
what you deserved.

787
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,830
QUINN: Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

788
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,599
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

789
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,916
He took my hand again!

790
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,078
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

791
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,999
What the fuck
are you talk--

792
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,555
you want him alive?

793
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,991
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

794
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,431

you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

813
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,911
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

814
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,396
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

That's OK.

For your
miracle cure?

867
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,076
This is E.D.T.A.

868
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,157
It's an anticoagulant.

869
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,556
We use it
to treat blood clots.

870
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,833
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

871
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,589

I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

you could use it

01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,190
All our strengths...

921
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,516
none of our weaknesses.

922
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,520
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

923
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,428
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

924
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,077
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

925
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,159
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

926
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,669
Heh. You think the humans

927
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,917
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

928
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,112
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

929
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,834
And they should be.

930
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:38,837
You're an animal.

931
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,236
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

932
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,155
Look at 'em.

933
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,397
They're cattle,

934
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,319
pieces of meat.

935
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,228
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

936
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,237
Plague...

937
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,669
war...

938
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,235
famine.

939
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,557
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

940
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,514
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

941
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,871
the new race.

942
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,868
Looks like
your mascara's running.

943
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,557
I'm offering you a truce.

944
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,149
I want you with us.

945
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,477
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

946
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,273
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

947
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,915
Frost...

948
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,476
you're nothing
to me...

949
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,354
but another
dead vampire.

950
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,279
You're an idiot.
You know that?

951
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,314
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

952
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,558
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

953
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,194
Careful.

954
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,749
What do I care?

955
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,031
They're nothing
but cattle...

956
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,833
just like you said.

957
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,748
If you want to take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

958
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,589
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

959
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,918
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's--

960
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,274
aah!

961
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,509
Go home.

962
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,471
It was simple.

963
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,797
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

964
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,071
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

965
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,839
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

966
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:53,996
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

967
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,476
That means that
we have to treat it

968
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,716
with gene therapy,

969
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,037
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

970
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,675
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

971
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,189
Are you sure
that's safe?

972
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,595
I have no idea,

973
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,395
but I don't have
a choice, do l?

974
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,757
You actually think
this could work?

975
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,599
On me...

976
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,268
yes.

977
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,790
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

978
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,389
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

979
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,239
from a bite
like I did.

980
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,795
He was born with it.

981
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,832
It's--it's part
of his DNA.

982
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,669
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

983
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,269
but it's gonna
take time.

984
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,597
Ah, we're out of time.

985
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,270
You saw what was
on that disc.

986
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,676
[Laughter]

987
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,357
[Laughs]

988
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,199
Damn.

989
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,275
Get out of here.

990
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,197
[Laughter]

991
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,791
[Chuckle]

992
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,198
[Laughter]

993
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,190
I said get out of here!

994
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,675
Nice place.

995
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,236
Took us a while
to find it!

996
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,679
Bite me
and get it over with.

997
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,872
I ain't gonna bite you.

998
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,755
Do your thing.

999
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,795
Whistler.

1000
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,755
Ohh.

1001
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,989
Frost took her.

1002
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,799
Listen to me.

1003
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,835
The disc.

1004
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,269
He decoded it.

1005
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,393
Frost is trying to...

1006
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,150
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

1007
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,111
There's some kind of...

1008
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,552
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

1009
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,599
La Magra.

1010
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,512
You're the key.

1011
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,598
He needs
your blood.

1012
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,276
The blood
of the daywalker.

1013
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,314
You're the chosen one.

1014
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,954
Listen to me, Blade.

1015
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,919
You can't
go after him.

1016
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,588
Bullshit.

1017
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,792
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

1018
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,549
it's all over.

1019
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,960
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

1020
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,152
[Groan]

1021
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,555
Shit.

1022
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,631
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

1023
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,231
Don't want me
coming back.

1024
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,917
We can treat
the wounds.

1025
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,879
It's too far gone.

1026
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,356
You know that.

1027
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,120
Give me your gun.

1028
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,993
No.

1029
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,680
Give me
the god-damn gun.

1030
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,670
Now walk away,

1031
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,315
you stupid
son of a bitch.

1032
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,150
Walk the fuck away.

1033
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,153
[Gun blast]

1034
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,196
By the time you watch this,

1035
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,834
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

1036
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,679
If it makes any
difference to you,

1037
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,314
he put up
quite a fight.

1038
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,320
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

1039
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,510
You seem a bit...

1040
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,597
tense.

1041
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,553
A bit pent-up maybe,

1042
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,433
like you need to
release something.

1043
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,117
You know?

1044
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,595
Blade not...

1045
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,990
givin' it to you
maybe.

1046
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,029
I don't know.
I just...

1047
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,351
I see such
a beautiful woman.

1048
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,194
Great skin.

1049
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,518
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

1050
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,997
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

1051
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,516
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

1052
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,109
Go ahead.

1053
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,675
Bite me.

1054
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,588
I'll just cure myself.

1055
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:05,950
I did it before,

1056
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,628
and I can do it again.

1057
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,399
There is no cure,
baby.

1058
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,909
There is if you've
been bit,

1059
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,511
if you were once human.

1060
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,669
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

1061
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,189
A born vampire

1062
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,870
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

1063
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,993
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

1064
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,350
Isn't that right?

1065
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,678
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

1066
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,714
You're just...infected,
a virus...

1067
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,718
a sexually transmitted
disease.

1068
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,149
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

1069
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,670
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

1070
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,712
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

1071
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,639
you people
are fuckin' history.

1072
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,229
He's a hurricane,

1073
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,238
an act of God.

1074
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,954
Anyone caught
in his path

1075
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,515
will instantly
be turned.

1076
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,588
Everyone you've
ever known,

1077
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,679
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

1078
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,633
It won't matter
who's pureblood

1079
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,229
and who's not.

1080
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,194
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

1081
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,359
Hmm?

1082
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,557
And Blade's blood
is the key.

1083
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,672
We got an intruder.

1084
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,239
[Elevator bell]

1085
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,433
[Motorcycle engine
revving]

1086
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,388
[Revving loudly,
all around]

1087
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,114
[Tyres peeling]

1088
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,390
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

1089
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,670
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

1090
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,712
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him--

1091
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,513
and he's got shit
he throws at you--

1092
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,075
Yeah, the swords.

1093
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,396
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

1094
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,034
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

1095
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,390
[Over radio] There's no
intruder where we are.

1096
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,193
Look, make it happen,
all right?

1097
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,789
It's one guy on foot.

1098
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,918
That's him!
Get him!

1099
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,079
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

1100
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,750
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

1101
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,155
I need him alive.

1102
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,635
No!

1103
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,037
Please!

1104
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,629
I just work for them!

1105
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,279
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

1106
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,675
Yes, sir!

1107
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,990
Aah!

1108
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,510
Aieee!
Aah!

1109
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,232
Eric?

1110
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,432
But you died.

1111
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,676
I came back, Eric.

1112
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,348
That very same night...

1113
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,548
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

1114
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,717
[Shock blast]

1115
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,991
Uhh!

1116
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,235
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1117
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,635
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1118
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,354
and you act like this?

1119
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,831
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1120
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,918
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1121
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,315
Uh! Uhh!

1122
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,269
Don't look so surprised.

1123
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,119
You spent your whole life

1124
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,835
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1125
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,111
Well, here I am.

1126
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,196
Who would ever guess

1127
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,631
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1128
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:33,956
But you did.

1129
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,549
And here we are--

1130
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,230
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1131
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,832
I need my serum.

1132
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,350
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1133
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,518
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1134
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,439
There's one catch.

1135
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,753
If it works,

1136
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,076
you'll lose
your strength

1137
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,308
and your ability
to regenerate.

1138
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,671
You'll be
completely human.

1139
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,989
Uhh!

1140
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,315
FROST: Blade, Karen,

1141
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,193
glad you could make it.

1142
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,835
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1143
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,116
Our ancestors
called this place

1144
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,676
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1145
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,113
Nice, isn't it?

1146
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,949
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1147
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,630
Fortunately for us...

1148
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,035
I'm what you
might call a...

1149
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,948
student of history.

1150
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,711
Why are we here?

1151
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:58,113
This temple was built
for one glorious moment--

1152
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,711
this night,
for the Blood God.

1153
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,869
Thanks.

1154
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,399
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1155
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,869
Well.

1156
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:22,991
Titanium, right?

1157
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,351
Acid-etched?

1158
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,719
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1159
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:35,751
What?

1160
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,555
You look surprised.

1161
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,149
I told you, Blade,

1162
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,636
I know everything
about you.

1163
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,669
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1164
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:45,836
Why, man?

1165
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:46,917
These are--they're,
like, all better.

1166
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,236
Hold out your arm.

1167
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,635
Now.

1168
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,429
Deac, l--

1169
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,395
Just kidding.

1170
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,158
Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.

1171
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,828
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1172
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:06,837
Blade.

1173
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,157
Blade.

1174
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,237
He can't hear you,
honey.

1175
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,159
The thirst has
got him now.

1176
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,430
What do we have here?

1177
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,155
The precious serum.

1178
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,831
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1179
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,555
12, 13 hours maybe?

1180
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,831
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1181
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,349
aren't you?

1182
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,909
What's it feel like?

1183
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,279
Is your blood on fire?

1184
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,676
Try some.

1185
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,270
You might like it.

1186
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,676
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1187
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,951
In any event,

1188
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,391
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1189
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,799
It's a shame, you know?

1190
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,314
When I think of what
you've become,

1191
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,910
what you should
have become.

1192
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,873
I guess
I don't blame you.

1193
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,594
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1194
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,029
it's the human
side of you

1195
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,708
that's made you weak.

1196
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,275
You should've listened
to your blood.

1197
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,551
Say what you want,

1198
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,673
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1199
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,235
Ooh.

1200
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,677
Get him outta here.

1201
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,791
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1202
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,593
Come on. Let's go.

1203
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,712
Let's go.

1204
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,396
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1205
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,556
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1206
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,876
QUINN: Oh, no, baby.

1207
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,153
We got something real
special planned for you.

1208
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,588
QUINN: That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1209
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:48,916
I sucked him dry.

1210
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,679
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1211
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:51,996
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1212
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,350
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1213
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,233
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1214
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,635
[Imitating zombie]

1215
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:57,717
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1216
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,070
FROST: Pathetic.

1217
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,112
QUINN: Yeah. These guys
are complete scums, man.

1218
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,436
They'll eat anything--

1219
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,395
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1220
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,670
They'll even
eat vampires.

1221
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,235
That's a plus.

1222
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,669
And bearing that
all in mind,

1223
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,872
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1224
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,749
Uh!

1225
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,315
Uh!

1226
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,397
It's too bad.

1227
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,115
I kinda liked her.

1228
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,675
What a waste.

1229
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,074
[Moans]

1230
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,272
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1231
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,919
No pulse.

1232
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,156
And, of course,

1233
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,318
there's the question
of lividity.

1234
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,189
Curtis?

1235
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,474
Ahh.

1236
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,831
Karen?

1237
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,949
Karen.

1238
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,270
I never thought
I would see you again.

1239
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,153
Tell me, Karen,

1240
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,556
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1241
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,793
[Roar]

1242
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,314
Karen!

1243
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,637
Karen!

1244
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,274
Karen!

1245
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,471
Karen!

1246
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,114
Karen.

1247
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,551
Karen!

1248
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,313
Poor child.

1249
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,519
You're so sick.

1250
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,552
So thirsty.

1251
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,070
Don't touch me.

1252
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,949
Eric, look at me.

1253
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,630
Vampires are
my people now.

1254
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,275
I'm one of them.

1255
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,994
Can't be.

1256
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,118
Yes, it can.

1257
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,795
Try to understand,
Eric.

1258
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,992
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1259
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,673
I've hunted...

1260
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,679
I've killed...

1261
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,678
and I've enjoyed it.

1262
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,435
Haven't you?

1263
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,473
I know you have.

1264
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,795
Sooner or later,

1265
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,196
the thirst
always wins.

1266
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,035
Come on.

1267
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,675
Spread them out.

1268
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,229
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1269
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,352
Make it perfect.

1270
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,108
Yeah.

1271
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,872
FROST:
Bring the elevator up.

1272
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,638
[Thunder]

1273
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,631
VAMPIRE:
You stupid girl.

1274
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,751
What do you think
is going to happen?

1275
01:34:59,200 --> 01:34:59,757
La Magra?

1276
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,189
The Blood God?

1277
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,789
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1278
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,832
for pretty
little vampires.

1279
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,076
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?
