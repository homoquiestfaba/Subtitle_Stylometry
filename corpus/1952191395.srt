<i>Episode 5: The Eye</i>

2
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,592
Anna!

3
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,306
Anna!

4
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,941
Somebody help me!

5
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,777
Let me-
Help me!

6
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,446
Anna!

7
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,908
Please help me!

8
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,985
Ruber, what the hell
did you do to me?

9
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,677
How you feeling, kiddo?

10
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:41,015
We're getting close, son.

11
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:46,982
Car's ready, sir.

12
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,455
Hey.

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,150
Did you sleep?

14
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,411
No.

15
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,123
I just can't
come up with anything.

16
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:20,072
Are you sure these pictures
don't mean anything to you?

17
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:21,916
No.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,088
I mean, except that the Collectors keep
showing up agaln and agaln.

19
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,067
The pictures, the film,

20
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,636
but I can't make a connection.

21
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:32,607
I can't either.

22
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:35,679
I just hope they can help us find out
who the man in this room was.

23
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,519
We're in uncharted
territory here, Joe.

24
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,564
I mean, no one's ever
seen this guy before.

25
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,274
We don't know that he
actually existed.

26
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,444
Jennifer, he was standing right there.
We both saw him.

27
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,550
And if the prime object
is a person,

28
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:55,198
it makes sense that he'd be
able to bring my daughter back.

29
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:59,338
I've gotta find him.
That's all I care about right now.

30
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,084
Right.

31
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:12,566
What are you gonna do?

32
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,196
I'm gonna take another
look at the film.

33
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:20,369
The Collectors
disturbed reallty somehow.

34
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,166
I'm gonna try
and figure it out.

35
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:33,638
What?

36
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,350
Kreutzfeld sent you after those Polaroids,
didn't he?

37
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,563
He didn't send me.

38
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,233
We're working together.

39
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:48,702
What makes you think you
can trust him so much?

40
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,351
Good morning, sir.

41
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,002
Right this way.

42
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,111
Please.

43
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:37,774
Welcome to the Sood.

44
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:50,334
Mr. Kreutzfeld,
my good friend.

45
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,788
At last, we meet in person.

46
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,074
You're early.

47
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,845
Never early for
business, is it, Sood?

48
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,964
No, no.
Never, never.

49
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:02,151
You go everywhere together?

50
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:03,985
Oh, yeah.
Afrald so.

51
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,450
Not by choice.
I prefer my own life.

52
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,044
I was once normal.

53
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,355
It's overrated.

54
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,066
Sit, please.

55
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,510
First edition,
rough around the edges.

56
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,614
I'd call it "falr" condition.

57
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:34,857
A little less falr now.

58
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,619
Just checking
it's not an object.

59
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,785
No, no, no.
Never objects in my shop, only signs.

60
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,201
Pictures of objects.

61
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,037
Videos, artifacts,

62
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,948
no objects for sale.

63
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,869
That's dangerous business.

64
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,198
Tell me more.

65
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,186
It belonged to John Clark,
one of the Collectors,

66
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,164
born 1938, died-

67
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,073
1971.

68
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,610
In the First Cabal war.

69
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,244
How do you know it's Clarks?

70
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,782
I just bought it
off his nephew.

71
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:11,410
Had a bunch of stuff
in a trunk,

72
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:12,830
no idea what it was.

73
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,164
I called you first, of course.

74
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,003
I know you have a taste for
Collector's artifacts.

75
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:21,565
Thank you for coming
to me with this.

76
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,354
I'll, of course, pay
whatever it is you're asking,

77
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,981
whatever price
you think is falr,

78
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:29,520
and I shall accept your word
that it's genuine.

79
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:33,017
But if at some point I should
find out that it's fake,

80
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,528
that you tried
to con me in any way,

81
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:38,826
or that I hear you've made copies
and someone else has one,

82
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:42,622
then I'll have to come back here
and hurt you.

83
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,878
Mr. Kreutzfeld, my friend,

84
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,337
I am the Sood.

85
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,758
I deal in signs, no fakes.

86
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:52,554
No forgeries, no duplicates.

87
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,183
I stake my life on it.

88
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,662
No, no, no, I don't have anything
to do with that.

89
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,374
Mick, what's going on
out there?

90
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,465
- Is that a way out?
- Yes.

91
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:19,301
This way.

92
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:33,197
You need to tread
very carefully now.

93
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,660
You need to tell me
what's going on.

94
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:37,870
I've told you
everything I know.

95
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,539
I've been stralght
with you from the beginning.

96
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,086
Then what's this?

97
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:47,584
That's the combination
to the Collector's vault,

98
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,053
wherever it is.

99
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,139
It's what we've both
been looking for.

100
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,910
In the vault, I believe,
is the glass eye

101
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:57,857
which has the power to
destroy or repalr all flesh.

102
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,755
Could be used as a weapon,
most definitely,

103
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,075
but it could also cure
my son's leukemia.

104
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,829
Can I be any more clear,
detective?

105
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,412
What about the man?

106
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,067
What man?

107
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,564
The man in the motel room.
Who was he?

108
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:27,275
You're speaking of
the Occupant theory.

109
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,164
People far more obsessed than you
have gone down that road.

110
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:32,483
Who did the objects
belong to?

111
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,828
There has to be
an Occupant, right?

112
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:38,918
I say no.
There's no Occupant.

113
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,379
I've seen him.

114
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:46,470
I took the Polaroid
to the original motel.

115
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:50,643
I went inside the motel room and I saw it
just like it was back in 1961,

116
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:53,104
and there was
a man in the room.

117
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,674
My God.

118
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,569
You really
didn't know, did you?

119
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:11,507
That certalnly explalns something
I've never really understood.

120
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,554
Most of the time
in the evidence I found...

121
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,686
the Collectors refer to
their hiding place as a vault,

122
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,189
but in two instances,
they call it a tomb.

123
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:26,654
You think he's dead?

124
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:29,674
Nobody has seen him.
Nobody knows who he is.

125
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,080
Trust me,
I've done the research.

126
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:36,626
But if there is a body,
and the Collectors hid it somewhere,

127
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,713
it might be in the vault.

128
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,346
I got this from
Conroy's husband.

129
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,849
He is the last
living Collector.

130
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,836
I had it digitized.

131
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,964
Unbelievable.

132
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:55,378
The Collectors were trying
to do an experiment in Room 9.

133
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,036
Look, they nalled objects
to the door.

134
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,622
This is huge.

135
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,716
It gets weirder.

136
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,092
Wh... what's happening now?

137
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,651
I think this is
where the world almost ends.

138
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,275
The original film was stolen.

139
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,311
Someone is a step
ahead of us on this.

140
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,748
I'll kick this up the ladder,
get the Legion moving on it.

141
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:30,121
Your Lieutenant back in Pittsburgh
has been calling.

142
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:34,210
Wants to know how the hell
we let Joe Miller escape.

143
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,437
I don't know.

144
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:37,423
There is no hallucinogens
in your system.

145
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:38,509
You're clean.

146
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,054
No, Martin Ruber
did something to me.

147
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,265
I think you
should go back home,

148
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,936
as soon as the doctors
release you, detective.

149
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,166
Not until I find Martin Ruber.

150
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:47,025
I'm probably going
to die of dehydration.

151
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,028
I just thought I'd mention.

152
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,021
No!

153
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:18,071
No! No!

154
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:20,992
No, no...

155
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,620
No, no!

156
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,875
No! No!

157
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,745
I've been promoted,
by the pontifex himself,

158
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,526
so your cell will report directly to me
from now on.

159
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,424
Congratulations, Parchman.

160
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,525
Thanks.

161
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,987
Should have been you,

162
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:18,701
but you let Ruber steal two objects
right out from under you.

163
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:24,417
You know what the punishment
is for that?

164
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:28,507
I'll get the objects back.

165
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,804
And I'll take care of Ruber.

166
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,055
Good.

167
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:36,393
It would be a shame
to lose you.

168
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:55,588
Key, clock, scissors.

169
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:58,008
We want into the vault,
we need all three.

170
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:01,430
Between us, of course,
we have the key and the clock.

171
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,727
It's the scissors.

172
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,432
I think I know someone
who could help us find them.

173
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:13,131
The word is you vanished,
Mr. Kreutzfeld.

174
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:16,553
The Sood has security video
and everything.

175
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah, I had a little
lapse in security.

176
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,152
He's trying
to sell the DVD now.

177
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:28,728
So what are you guys
looking for?

178
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,197
Scissors.

179
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,961
Your pitching slow balls.

180
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:36,415
$10,000.
Cash.

181
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,738
$5,000.

182
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,721
- Okay, 10.
- 12.

183
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,074
I think you've tried my
patience enough for one day.

184
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:05,124
Zoralda Figueroa,
Washington, D.C.

185
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,553
She deals crystal meth or
pop tarts or something.

186
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,206
Is she dangerous?

187
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,650
Scissors are rarely
sought after,

188
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,094
but she's had them
for three years,

189
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:14,887
so she must be doing
something right.

190
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,432
And what do
the scissors do exactly?

191
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,045
They rotate things.

192
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,315
So what do you do,
spin plates with it?

193
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,686
Dude, if you want to theorize,
I'm gonna charge you another grand.

194
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,017
So Zoralda's apartment
is up on the fourth floor,

195
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,169
and if she still
has the scissors,

196
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:38,338
we should just be able,
to buy them off her.

197
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,167
This is a terrific neighborhood.

198
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:44,056
Is there a reason we couldn't just
come here through the motel room?

199
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,226
It's just- It's not that easy.
I never been here before.

200
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:49,705
Besides, I like to see
what I'm getting into first.

201
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,736
Maybe we should surprise her.

202
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,556
Oh, yeah. Wouldn't want her
to rotate us till we're dizzy.

203
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,777
This her apartment?

204
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,641
Stay behind me.

205
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,184
If you insist.

206
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,477
Zoralda, I'm-

207
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,989
You want something
from me, huh?

208
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:59,711
You want some, too?

209
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,726
Oh, rotates.

210
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,582
- Calm down.
- Adios.

211
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,637
You picked the wrong girI
to mess with.

212
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,574
Having a hard time breathing?

213
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,243
I'll take these.

214
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,721
Please...

215
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:02,775
Don't take my scissors.

216
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,423
I'm sorry.

217
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,943
It's all I have left.

218
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:42,491
Get up.
Get up.

219
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,577
Get-

220
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,903
Who the hell is that?

221
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:20,104
And that, I believe, is the combination
to the vault.

222
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,593
If only we knew
where the vault was.

223
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,672
What is this?

224
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,409
I don't know.
The sun?

225
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,495
No, I've seen this before.

226
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:48,263
I'll be right back.

227
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:27,070
Barbara Stritzke had these.

228
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:29,406
The location of
the Collectors vault

229
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,824
is hidden somehow
inside those pictures.

230
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm sure of it.

231
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,294
They certalnly makes
no sense to me.

232
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,088
Well, it didn't make
sense to me at first, either,

233
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,174
but together
they make up a map.

234
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,260
A map.

235
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:45,930
Well, a map or instructions.

236
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:47,557
It makes sense
if you've used the key.

237
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:48,935
When you leave the room,

238
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:50,395
you have to picture
a door in your mind,

239
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:53,775
If you don't, it'll just
pick a door for you at random.

240
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,203
If you want a specific door,
you have to have been there.

241
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:58,423
You have to be able to fix
an image of it in your mind.

242
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,785
I think that's what these
pictures are for:

243
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,124
to take you to the vault
without ever having been there before.

244
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,963
And where is there exactly?

245
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,274
Okay.

246
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,277
What do these
look like to you?

247
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,147
They look like lines.

248
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,858
Maybe out of focus.

249
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,702
These are bars.

250
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,122
That's a guard tower,
you see that?

251
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,418
I can't believe
I didn't see this before.

252
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,206
This is a prison.

253
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,553
We find the prison,
we find the vault.

254
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,108
- Hey.
- Hi.

255
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,168
What's wrong?

256
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:35,915
Why do you want this?

257
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,219
Why do you need the Legions files
on the Collectors?

258
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:40,556
I'm trying to find a way
into the vault with Kreutzfeld.

259
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,969
Oh, God.

260
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,957
I'm sorry you don't like this,
but this is the best chance I've got.

261
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:50,612
You forget, Joe,
I used to know Kreutzfeld.

262
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:52,949
I liked him, too,

263
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:54,200
but something
happened to him.

264
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,011
He changed.

265
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,756
I trust him.

266
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,962
He's gonna kill you as soon
as he is done with you.

267
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:07,711
You're putting the rest
of us in danger.

268
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:09,949
I am just trying
to find my little girI.

269
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,728
I can't worry about the whole damn world.
I'm not you.

270
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:24,661
You don't think
I wake up every morning,

271
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,064
wanting my old life back?

272
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,927
You don't get to choose, Joe.

273
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,686
No, I don't.

274
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:04,085
I'm not ready to come back
to Pittsburgh yet.

275
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,488
I need some time off.

276
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,592
I'm searching for something.

277
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:23,038
Ow.

278
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,349
What?
What's the matter?

279
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,728
Wally, you can't send
teenage girls to hell.

280
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,798
Are you kidding me?
Teenage girls deserve it the most.

281
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,759
Look.

282
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:34,263
I could have bowled a 260 if those girls
weren't teasing me.

283
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:36,893
I can't bowI with people watching.
It makes me tense.

284
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,146
Seriously, I could go pro
if no one was watching.

285
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,606
That's great, Wally.
Listen to me.

286
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,650
I think I found a way
into the Collector's vault.

287
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,336
What, you don't think
I can go pro?

288
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:45,614
- Wally-
- You should see my release.

289
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,784
Wally!

290
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,162
What do you think you're going to find
in the vault, Joe?

291
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:54,627
The Occupant and the eye.

292
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,089
Okay, there's no such
thing as the Occupant,

293
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:01,053
and even if there was,
he's long dead by now.

294
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,139
I've seen him.

295
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,443
And I'm going to find him.

296
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:07,362
Are you nuts?
Do not go in the vault, Joe.

297
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,664
Do you hear me?

298
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,650
The Collectors buried the objects there
for a reason.

299
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,494
Wally, I have to find him.

300
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,350
If the Occupant's body is in the vault,
I'm taking my chances.

301
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,729
What if he aln't dead, hmm?

302
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:23,569
What if he just sitting there
walting for you?

303
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:25,096
Hmm?

304
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:29,269
Why are you really here, Joe?

305
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:31,881
I need a favor.

306
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,029
It's ridiculous.

307
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:39,743
I mean, how do you hide 12 objects
for 40 years inside of a prison?

308
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:40,994
If we're lucky,
it's abandoned.

309
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,497
How about if it's torn down?

310
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,625
How about if it's
a golf course now?

311
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,795
This is definitely the door
they want us to use.

312
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,965
There is probably
no other way, in or out.

313
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:54,663
- Karl...
- Yeah?

314
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,650
What was the name of the Collector
who owned that book?

315
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,186
The book you got
from the Sood.

316
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,942
John Clark.
He was one the original Collectors.

317
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,462
John Clark...

318
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:06,256
Is there something there
in the Legion files?

319
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,702
Here he is.
John Clark.

320
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:13,959
John Clark was a guard at the State Prison
in Kellogg county from 1955 to 1963.

321
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,287
I think we've found our prison.

322
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:26,953
Oh, Karl,
you shouldn't have.

323
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:28,997
It's what I do.

324
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:32,252
I thought I'd make it
easier for us.

325
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,374
Your gonna have
to leave the flask.

326
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,752
Excuse me?

327
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:44,587
We're taking the clock,
the scissors, and the key,

328
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,631
and no other objects.

329
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,106
Okay.

330
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:56,396
You should leave the gun then.
Falr is falr.

331
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,608
Well, technically,
the gun is not an object.

332
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,495
Joe.

333
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,406
All right.

334
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,518
And in the interest
in complete disclosure,

335
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:08,255
I shall leave behind
the cufflink as well.

336
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:10,733
What the hell does that do?

337
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,553
Lowers blood pressure.

338
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,916
Might be a placebo,
but something is working.

339
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,553
All right.

340
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:23,686
- You ready?
- Yes.

341
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,998
Do you have it yet?

342
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:39,751
Just give me one more second.

343
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:43,089
I think I got it.

344
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,473
What are you walting for?

345
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,851
Wait!

346
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,107
Karl, hang on!

347
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,291
Hang on!

348
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,169
- You got me?
- I got you.

349
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:01,408
Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought you wanted
the inside of the prison.

350
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,876
All right, ready?
Come on up.

351
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:19,158
I guess I owe you one.

352
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:21,228
Forget it.
We're even.

353
00:31:33,622 --> 00:31:35,082
Well, at least
it's abandoned.

354
00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:37,418
Yeah, but it's still the wrong door.
I don't get it.

355
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,226
If I was a vault,
were would I be?

356
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:45,097
Well, it's doubtfuI
it's in here.

357
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:47,225
I just can't get
a lock on this door.

358
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,758
These pictures
just don't add up.

359
00:31:57,973 --> 00:31:59,100
Come on.

360
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:04,125
Wait a minute.

361
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:09,966
It's in a fallout shelter.
It's underneath the prison.

362
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:12,052
Come on.

363
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,311
So is this it?

364
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:38,491
Looks like it.

365
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,926
- It's not a real door.
- What?

366
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,289
It's just palnted on.

367
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:49,941
Karl, no!

368
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,117
What does this
look like to you?

369
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,668
It's Conroy, isn't it?

370
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:04,755
No.

371
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,465
There is someone else
in that room.

372
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:12,841
It's him.

373
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:19,609
It's the Occupant.

374
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,678
The man I saw
in the Polaroid.

375
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:30,383
Damn it!
Open!

376
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,056
Why not use the key?

377
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,352
No lock.

378
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:55,954
Concrete.

379
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,291
Collectors.

380
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,294
What does
the clock do, exactly?

381
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,839
It doesn't happen to drill
through walls, does it?

382
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:06,285
It sublimates brass.

383
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,972
Sublimates?

384
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:11,811
Turns solids into
gas without liquefying.

385
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:12,979
Or vice versa.

386
00:34:13,104 --> 00:34:17,152
Sort of like when
dry ice becomes steam.

387
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:19,514
And the scissors-

388
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,141
Rotate.

389
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,627
Yeah, I got that one.

390
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,888
There's a seam here.

391
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,851
- Hand me the scissors.
- Right.

392
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,081
Be careful with these, will ya?

393
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:17,757
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Nice work.

394
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:36,551
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

395
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,588
What the hell?

396
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:41,158
Good thing you had me
leave my gun behind.

397
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,578
Starting to have
second thoughts about that.

398
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:49,253
What do we got here?

399
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,939
Our fallout shelter.

400
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,319
Welded shut.

401
00:35:55,947 --> 00:36:00,161
Let me guess:
with brass.

402
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,419
We should step back a little.

403
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:19,005
Why is that?

404
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:21,592
I don't want to breathe
metallic gas, do you?

405
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,402
I found what you wanted.

406
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:39,634
Here is the Legion's report of all the
objects and their known whereabouts.

407
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:44,292
I don't know how accurate that is,
but that's the closest thing we've got.

408
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,170
Great, thanks.

409
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:11,540
Oh, my God.
Look at this!

410
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,552
I don't get it.

411
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:21,788
These are
the Conroy objects.

412
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:23,766
The same objects
from the film.

413
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,570
Karl Kreutzfeld
has them all.

414
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,266
He trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

415
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,076
That doesn't
make any sense.

416
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,781
It's suicide.
He'll kill us all.

417
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:35,726
Not if we kill him first.

418
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:40,516
I hope the prime object's
in there.

419
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:44,254
So we both get
what we want out of this.

420
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:48,010
After I get my daughter back,
you can have the key.

421
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:50,513
I don't want it.

422
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,433
I couldn't have done
this without you.

423
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:55,108
Oh, my God.

424
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,534
We found it.

425
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:14,762
Joe, nobody's seen these
objects in over 40 years.

426
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,160
Oh, no.

427
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:07,162
No.

428
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:14,307
I'm sorry.

429
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:16,410
I'm so sorry, Joe.

430
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,921
Joe, my search is over.

431
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,394
Well, that's great for you, Karl,
but mine's not.

432
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,980
Oh, but it is.

433
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:50,359
I can bring your
daughter back now.

434
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:52,312
How?

435
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:54,340
How can you bring
Anna back?

436
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:57,552
The same way
I bring Isaac back.

437
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,394
Do you know what
the quarter does, Joe?

438
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:15,396
It brings life to memories
for a short time.

439
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:17,683
Two days, sometimes three.

440
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:26,721
Oh, my God.

441
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:28,040
My son Isaac.

442
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,248
He died nine years ago.

443
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,928
This is all I have left.

444
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:44,639
It was enough for a while.

445
00:41:44,722 --> 00:41:47,544
Karl, what are you...

446
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:49,028
What are you saying?

447
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:52,951
You're still not seeing the objects
for what they really are.

448
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,623
They're tools...

449
00:41:56,707 --> 00:42:00,295
tools to reshape reallty.

450
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,590
The properties
that we perceive,

451
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:05,970
they're side effects,
tip of the iceberg.

452
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:08,974
The objects allow us
to change reallty

453
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:11,687
on levels that our bralns
can't even understand.

454
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:16,227
Don't you see? Conroy opened up a door
through reallty itself

455
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:19,714
where anything is possible.

456
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,502
Listen to me.

457
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:26,433
I saw what Conroy did,

458
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,753
and she almost
ripped reallty apart.

459
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,255
But I can do it right this time.

460
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,926
I can bring my boy back.
I can bring him back to life.

461
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,672
We can both bring our children back.
Both of them!

462
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:39,018
No, Karl, this isn't
just about us.

463
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,021
- What if you're wrong?
- It will work!

464
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:42,816
And what if it doesn't?

465
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,953
Well, everyone will be dead,
and it won't really matter.

466
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:53,890
Well, I can't do that.

467
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:55,125
Yes...

468
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:58,872
You sald you were willing
to do whatever it took.

469
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:01,960
I am, but not this.

470
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,457
Then I'm going
to need the key, Joe.

471
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,285
No.

472
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:19,169
The quarter brings
living memories as well.

473
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:23,458
The key.

474
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:32,952
Sorry, Joe.

475
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:37,525
Kreutzfeld,
you son of a bitch.

476
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:27,856
Hey.

477
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,064
You're getting good at that.

478
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:34,407
Are you okay?

479
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,552
No.

480
00:45:36,977 --> 00:45:38,147
Thanks for the loan, Wally.

481
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,314
My pleasure.

482
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,392
Uh, your lady friend is here.

483
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:55,347
You were right about Kreutzfeld.

484
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:58,393
I lost the key.
I lost everything.

485
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:06,488
I know what Kreutzfeld's
trying to do.

486
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,858
He's trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

487
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,220
His son is dead.

488
00:46:11,303 --> 00:46:13,356
He wants to resurrect him,

489
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,026
and now he has
the glass eye.

490
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:19,382
I'm responsible for that.

491
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:24,856
Listen, Joe, I restored the film
and I saw exactly what happened.

492
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,943
Conroy didn't stop
the experiment.

493
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:29,413
The Occupant did.

494
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,540
The Occupant?

495
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:38,685
I am sorry, I don't know
how to do this,

496
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:40,337
but we have to stop
Kreutzfeld somehow.

497
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:41,481
Now.

498
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:42,758
Let me do that
with the Legion.

499
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:47,039
But if we fall,
the Occupant's our last hope.

500
00:46:47,122 --> 00:46:48,032
You have to find him.

501
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:49,309
I don't know where to start.
I don't have the key.

502
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:50,686
I don't have anything.

503
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:55,367
Joe, you've come farther
than anyone else.

504
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:57,078
You'll find him.

505
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:34,433
We're ready, son.

506
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,502
All right, think. What do we know
about the Occupant?

507
00:47:36,628 --> 00:47:37,430
Nothing.

508
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,882
The objects all belong to him,
so they're his personal possessions,

509
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:44,698
so there's got to be at least one
thing that identifies him or

510
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:47,517
- tells us where he's from. - I didn't even
know there was an Occupant until yesterday.

511
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:50,549
How would I have any idea-
What are you- Don't touch it.

512
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:53,903
Wait a minute. Before it was an object,
this was just a bus ticket, right?

513
00:47:53,986 --> 00:47:55,781
I need you to not do that.
Come on!

514
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:58,744
Hey, do you know how hard it is for me
to get that duct tape on there

515
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:00,162
without zapping myself here?

516
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:06,004
- Whoa.
- Look at that.

517
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,841
Bus route's right on there.

518
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:09,885
- Whoa.
- Willowbrook, Arizona.

519
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,721
That's where he came from.

520
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,850
That's a start, my friend.

521
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,937
Pull over here.
Right here.

522
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,107
- What, right here?
- Yep, right here.

523
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,576
Welcome to Willowbrook, home of
the Occupant, whoever he is.

524
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:29,481
Well, if I'm right,
he disappeared from here in 1961,

525
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,966
so I'm gonna check the missing
persons reports.

526
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:32,501
Where's the police station?

527
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:35,005
Wally, I'm wanted
for murder and kidnapping.

528
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:36,841
We can't walk into
a police station.

529
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:38,569
We're at the hall of records.

530
00:48:44,018 --> 00:48:45,604
Sheriff, it's
Detective Bridgewater.

531
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:46,689
You're still in town?

532
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:48,191
Yeah, I have a question.

533
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:51,404
Detective Miller and Dr. Ruber escaped
in a prisoner transport van.

534
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,655
Did it ever turn up?

535
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:54,742
Yeah, abandoned
not too far from here.

536
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:55,827
Where?

537
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:59,583
Motel Sunshine just off old Route 66.
You know the place?

538
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:02,478
Yeah.

539
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:54,746
Novocaln.

540
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:57,699
Sir?

541
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:05,845
I need Novocaln
and a syringe.

542
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,855
I'll see to it, sir.

543
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:21,410
What, a man can't sing
to his bus ticket?

544
00:50:32,218 --> 00:50:34,596
Well, there were no
missing persons in 1961,

545
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,224
but there was an extra person.

546
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:38,060
What's an extra person?

547
00:50:38,585 --> 00:50:40,830
"Police arrested an unidentified man
yesterday-"

548
00:50:40,855 --> 00:50:42,107
blah blah blah blah blah.

549
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:45,278
"The man accosted MabeI Smith, 24,
of Willowbrook,

550
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:46,656
"clalming to be her husband.

551
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:48,742
Miss Smith is unmarried."

552
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:50,203
Who's MabeI Smith?

553
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:52,038
She's the town librarian.

554
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:58,297
Help you boys?

555
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,969
- Mabel Smith?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:02,579
I'm Joe Miller.

557
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:04,740
Can we sit down
and talk for a second?

558
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:06,518
Sure.

559
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:20,898
I found an old article
that mentions your name.

560
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,949
Why are you showing me this?

561
00:51:28,032 --> 00:51:29,577
I'm looking for him.

562
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:32,706
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

563
00:51:33,031 --> 00:51:35,861
Mabel, you filed a police
report agalnst this man.

564
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:37,029
You must remember something.

565
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:41,744
It's been so long.

566
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,208
He said he was my husband.

567
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:48,437
I never saw him before, but...

568
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:51,175
he knew all sorts of
things about me,

569
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,198
things no one knows.

570
00:51:55,223 --> 00:52:00,105
What struck me at the time
was that he seemed so sure,

571
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:03,693
so insistent that
I believe him.

572
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,016
And you... did you
believe him?

573
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,039
Oh, no. No, no.

574
00:52:12,164 --> 00:52:15,252
But he still haunts me.

575
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:20,968
You see, I never married...

576
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:26,894
and, uh...
he was as close as I came.

577
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,202
What was his name?

578
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:41,248
I don't, uh...

579
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,168
I don't remember.

580
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:44,795
Is there anything else
that you can remember?

581
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,549
Anything at all? I can't tell you
how important this is to me.

582
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:00,894
He gave this to me.

583
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:02,797
I've never shown anyone.

584
00:53:04,365 --> 00:53:08,037
Now that's him
and that's me.

585
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:11,058
But that picture
was never taken.

586
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:15,674
I never saw him before
he showed up on my doorstep.

587
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,386
And this...

588
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:21,975
This is the part
that I can't sit with.

589
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,485
Yes, that's my handwriting.

590
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:36,912
I still wonder if I should
have said yes.

591
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,545
Yes, I remember.

592
00:53:45,008 --> 00:53:46,427
Mabel, may I take this picture?

593
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,256
Yes, take it.

594
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:50,241
Thank you.

595
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:00,697
40 years old, good as new.

596
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:02,450
It's an object.

597
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:08,008
Well, Wally, I think I know why no one's
ever found the occupant.

598
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,070
Whatever the event was
that created the objects

599
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:11,555
ripped him out of
the world somehow,

600
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,093
just like the motel room.

601
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:17,680
His history's been erased.
No one remembers him.

602
00:54:17,706 --> 00:54:20,001
This picture might be the only evidence
he ever even existed.

603
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:22,354
Yeah, right. A pencil gets plucked
out of existence,

604
00:54:22,479 --> 00:54:24,107
nobody cares.

605
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,651
But a whole guy...

606
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:27,862
How do you find a man
who doesn't exist?

Oh, my God.

It's real.

Bridgewater.

Lee, it's Sheriff Starnes.

613
00:55:22,223 --> 00:55:24,560
Good news.
We just picked up your man, Dr. Ruber.

614
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:26,663
You wanted to know what he did to you.

615
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:27,606
Why don't you ask him?

616
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:29,275
He's at the hospital.

617
00:55:33,823 --> 00:55:35,951
Sood's books.

618
00:55:36,077 --> 00:55:37,287
Welcome to Loserville.

619
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:39,791
Every disgusting wannabe, coulda-been,

620
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:42,628
has-been object loser hangs out here.

621
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,466
It makes me sick
to see you here.

622
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:48,303
I need to find something
that I.D.s the Occupant.

623
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,640
Driver's license,
some personal item with his name on it.

624
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,852
The Sood's the guy to ask,
but he won't help you now.

625
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:55,814
You've pissed him off.

626
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,318
Well, I'll apologize to him,
smooth things over.

627
00:55:58,543 --> 00:55:59,653
Yeah, that will work.

628
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:00,988
Come on.

629
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:05,328
I'm not coming with you anymore.

630
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:09,334
Those people, my bus ticket,
they're like piranhas.

631
00:56:09,459 --> 00:56:13,214
This whole thing, you're getting in
so deep it's dangerous for me.

632
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,961
I'm sorry.
I just can't.

633
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,533
You know what, Wally?

634
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:33,202
You're right.

635
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:34,412
Thanks for everything.

636
00:56:35,137 --> 00:56:37,348
I owe you.

637
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,329
Hey, Joe.

638
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:44,343
Get her back.

639
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:58,530
I'm here to see The Sood.

640
00:56:58,614 --> 00:56:59,574
Appointment only.

641
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,836
Look, could you just tell The Sood
that I'd like to apologize?

642
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:11,591
Appointment only.

643
00:57:16,223 --> 00:57:17,683
Can I make an appointment?

644
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:20,687
No!

645
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,090
Well, well.

646
00:57:40,926 --> 00:57:42,136
Took me a while, Detective.

647
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:44,222
You're a difficult man to track down.

648
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,645
But every riddle has an answer.

649
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,314
I don't have it.

650
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:54,070
You'll excuse me
if I don't believe you.

651
00:57:54,354 --> 00:57:55,589
Montague, ask yourself,

652
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:57,784
would I be walking to my next destination
if I had the key?

653
00:57:58,209 --> 00:57:59,761
So what?

654
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,831
You're just another object loser?
Welcome to the club.

655
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,670
Is that really a gun in your pocket?

656
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:07,598
Yes.

657
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:14,616
Intimidating.

658
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:15,852
Do you know The Sood?

659
00:58:15,977 --> 00:58:16,895
Do I know The Sood?

660
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,122
Of course I know The Sood.

661
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:19,148
He's a friend.
He's a colleague.

662
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:20,984
- We have dinner.
- Good.

663
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:22,787
Introduce me to him.

664
00:58:25,157 --> 00:58:26,284
Sir.

665
00:58:28,186 --> 00:58:29,146
Enter.

666
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:37,850
Weasel, how many times
have I got to tell you,

667
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,838
keep your stinking carcass
out of my shop.

668
00:58:47,122 --> 00:58:48,082
You, too?

669
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,734
Pumeet.

670
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,903
Wait, wait.

671
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,573
Sood, listen, I just wanted to introduce
you to my friend-

672
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:54,909
you're already-

673
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:58,205
I know you guys got off
on the wrong foot, so...

674
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,532
Kill them.

675
00:58:59,757 --> 00:59:03,872
Please, Sood.
Hear me out.

676
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:20,062
I want to apologize for the disturbance
I caused here a few days ago.

677
00:59:20,145 --> 00:59:24,051
My argument was with Mr. Kreutzfeld,

678
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:26,538
and I had no right
bringing that argument here.

679
00:59:28,249 --> 00:59:31,379
all I want is to find this man.

680
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,720
The Occupant.

681
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,312
There's a guy object?

682
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,982
I mean, there's an object that's a guy?

683
00:59:45,107 --> 00:59:46,651
That changes everything.

684
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:49,822
You can't find any objects
with this man's name on them?

685
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:50,991
No.

686
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:53,328
No driver's license,
no business card,

687
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:56,582
no such object has ever surfaced.

688
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:04,177
Here is where all the known objects
are right now.

689
01:00:04,302 --> 01:00:05,303
Can you find me the pen?

690
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:06,680
Where's the pen?

691
01:00:06,805 --> 01:00:07,973
The pen.

692
01:00:09,476 --> 01:00:11,187
How accurate is this?

693
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:12,856
It's pretty accurate.

694
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,235
I've collected as much
history of the objects as I can.

695
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,366
The key, for instance...

696
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:24,873
Just in the last few weeks
you've been spotted in Pittsburgh,

697
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:28,295
New Mexico, Kansas, Cleveland-

698
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:29,798
I haven't been to Cleveland.

699
01:00:35,446 --> 01:00:37,525
How far back does this go?

700
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,014
Years.
Back to the beginning for some objects.

701
01:00:41,397 --> 01:00:44,318
What if you mapped
all their movements all at once?

702
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:46,538
What would that prove?

703
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,500
Well, I'm not sure,
but there might be some sort of a pattern.

704
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,835
Could you just try it, please?

705
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:05,349
What's that?

706
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,561
What's there?

707
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:09,689
No object has ever
been through there.

708
01:01:09,914 --> 01:01:12,376
Nothing.
It's the desert.

709
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:13,528
That's where he is.

710
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,215
The Occupant in the room,

711
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,702
and somehow he is keeping
all the objects away.

712
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:21,414
I need to borrow your car.

713
01:01:21,697 --> 01:01:22,850
Great. I'll drive.

714
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,169
Give me the keys.

715
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:27,506
This is all I have.

716
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:31,345
Give me the keys.

717
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:37,647
The center of the map
is a town called Green Valley.

718
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:39,750
It doesn't look like
much of a town.

719
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:42,820
From the outskirts
there is a sanitarium.

720
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:44,340
Good luck.

721
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:48,329
We have to hit Kreutzfeld hard and fast.

722
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,580
It's not going to be easy getting in.

723
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:51,266
Leave that to me.

724
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,335
I have someone
on the inside.

725
01:01:55,631 --> 01:02:00,846
Look, none of us have ever
done anything like this before.

726
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:02,557
We have no idea
what we're getting into.

727
01:02:02,941 --> 01:02:04,318
But if we don't at least try,

728
01:02:04,343 --> 01:02:06,138
we're going to end up
dead anyway, so...

729
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:09,743
let's go.

730
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,607
What are you doing?

731
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,343
Hey. How are you?

732
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:34,405
It's a little project.

733
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:35,707
It's going to take awhile, though.

734
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:39,128
But I remember Anthony said something
about making ice cream, though.

735
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:40,414
That wouldn't interest you, would it?

736
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,451
Okay.

737
01:02:45,003 --> 01:02:46,673
And close the door, will you, buddy?

738
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:02,395
We're in position.

739
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,291
Very good.
Wait for my signal.

740
01:03:12,802 --> 01:03:13,620
Yeah?

741
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:15,189
They're about to attack.

742
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:17,760
Wise man.
You made the right choice.

743
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,926
No one's here.

744
01:04:16,303 --> 01:04:17,848
Something's wrong.
I think it's a trap.

745
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:20,368
Get out.
Get out now.

746
01:04:31,259 --> 01:04:32,385
Let's go.

747
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:57,613
Don't.

748
01:04:58,824 --> 01:05:00,159
It won't heal.

749
01:05:02,537 --> 01:05:04,373
Objects don't work in the room.

750
01:05:31,622 --> 01:05:32,581
Hi.

751
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:35,377
Visiting hours are over.

752
01:05:36,587 --> 01:05:37,547
Police business.

753
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:40,218
I'm here to see a patient.

754
01:05:41,511 --> 01:05:43,806
Police?
Well, okay, sure.

755
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:45,976
Who's the patient?

756
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:47,228
John Doe.

757
01:05:50,942 --> 01:05:52,402
You do have a John Doe here?

758
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,992
Yeah.
He's always been here.

759
01:05:57,317 --> 01:06:00,447
You should empty your pockets.
He doesn't like things.

760
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,268
What do you mean?

761
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:08,175
Things-stuff, pens, wallets, keys.

762
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,302
It freaks him out.

763
01:06:35,173 --> 01:06:37,218
The firearm?

764
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:38,803
It stays with me.

765
01:07:10,491 --> 01:07:12,285
My name is Joe Miller.

766
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:16,942
I just want to ask you-

767
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,452
No!

768
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,909
Easy! Easy!

769
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:24,787
Easy! It's okay!

770
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:25,855
Look, it's okay.

771
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:30,954
I'm not going to hurt you.

772
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:31,997
Okay?

773
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,520
I'm not going to hurt you.

774
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:41,561
Okay?

775
01:07:44,316 --> 01:07:47,236
I just want to talk to you,
that's all, all right?

776
01:07:51,618 --> 01:07:54,455
I'm just going to sit down right here, okay?

777
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:55,698
No!

778
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:03,393
No! Stop!

779
01:08:16,688 --> 01:08:18,022
Damn.

780
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:28,588
Oh, my God.

781
01:08:34,514 --> 01:08:35,598
Who the hell are you?

782
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:41,023
I just want to know who you are
and what happened in that motel room

783
01:08:41,148 --> 01:08:43,068
and if you created the obj-

784
01:08:43,193 --> 01:08:44,528
Stop talking!

785
01:08:54,876 --> 01:08:57,923
I met your wife Mabel.

786
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,592
She gave me your picture.

787
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:01,011
She misses you...

788
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:06,452
even if she doesn't remember you.

789
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:15,590
I felt the photograph coming.

790
01:09:18,578 --> 01:09:23,126
I thought maybe you
might have been my wife.

791
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:25,279
I let you through.

792
01:09:27,257 --> 01:09:28,551
I'm sorry.

793
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,599
I'm really sorry.

794
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:35,895
Please, it's very important.

795
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,193
I just need to know,
did you create these objects?

796
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,279
I didn't.

797
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:45,325
Then where did they come from?

798
01:09:45,451 --> 01:09:47,286
I don't know.

799
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,288
I didn't do anything.

800
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:49,331
It just happened.

801
01:09:51,893 --> 01:09:53,353
I need your help.

802
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,587
My little girl went into that motel room
and she never came out.

803
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:03,218
Can you tell me where she is?

804
01:10:04,143 --> 01:10:05,205
She's still there.

805
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,023
- Where?
- In the room.

806
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:09,277
No, she's not.
I've been there. She's gone.

807
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:10,362
There's more than one.

808
01:10:12,048 --> 01:10:13,424
What do you mean there's more than one?

809
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,761
There's more than one.
Come on!

810
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:18,291
Can you bring her back?

811
01:10:20,502 --> 01:10:23,131
Please tell me you can bring her back.

812
01:10:24,173 --> 01:10:25,217
I can't.

813
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:32,728
But you can.

814
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:36,500
How?

815
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:39,070
How can I bring her back?

816
01:10:39,195 --> 01:10:40,656
Take me to the motel room.

817
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:03,064
You almost had me there,
Jennifer.

818
01:11:04,232 --> 01:11:05,275
Yeah, too bad.

819
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:10,967
Didn't think you had it in you.

820
01:11:13,412 --> 01:11:16,626
I want you to witness
what I'm about to do.

821
01:11:16,851 --> 01:11:17,894
I know you're scared of it,

822
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:20,163
but if I'm right-

823
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:21,274
if I'm right...

824
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:22,684
You're not.

825
01:11:26,932 --> 01:11:28,810
I won't harm you unless you interfere.

826
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:49,674
I saw him.

827
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:53,596
He...

828
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:56,100
I saw...

829
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:59,046
I've come a long way, Martin.

830
01:12:01,566 --> 01:12:02,526
Margaret?

831
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,200
Margaret, I saw him.

832
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:12,957
I saw the man in the room.

833
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:16,905
What man?

834
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:20,168
I saw him through
this Polaroid...

835
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,331
at the motel.

836
01:12:25,851 --> 01:12:29,398
I saw the Occupant...

837
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,990
the living object.

838
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:40,915
This isn't true.

839
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,751
None of it.

840
01:12:44,212 --> 01:12:48,218
He gave me a vision in the desert.

841
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:53,558
He told me that
The Order was wrong.

842
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:57,773
He said that if I could put

843
01:12:57,898 --> 01:13:01,362
all the objects
back together agaln,

844
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:06,369
that I wouldn't
just talk to God.

845
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:15,507
He said I would be God.

846
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,570
That's why you won't kill me.

847
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:20,640
I'm the Prophet.

848
01:13:35,987 --> 01:13:37,447
Lee.

849
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:39,725
I knew you'd come.

850
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:40,711
Ruber!

851
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:46,511
Don't smile at me like that.
I want some answers.

852
01:13:46,636 --> 01:13:48,138
Who killed Lou Destefano?

853
01:13:48,964 --> 01:13:50,266
I did.

854
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:51,935
What happened to Anna Miller?

855
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,605
The motel room took her.

856
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:56,484
You know the motel, Lee.
You dreamed about it.

857
01:13:57,109 --> 01:13:58,736
How did you know that?

858
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,916
The motel room is where
the objects come from.

859
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,781
And they protect me.

860
01:14:05,864 --> 01:14:09,995
I'm the Prophet of the Objects now.

861
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,822
Good-bye, Lee.

862
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:14,026
You're under arrest!

863
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,448
Stop, Ruber, or I will
put a hole in you!

864
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:36,785
When you're ready to know
the objects, Lee, come find me.

865
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:54,077
It's ready.

866
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:00,044
I'm nervous, Anthony.

867
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:04,240
Karl, please don't do this.

868
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:07,896
I want to see my son.

869
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:40,227
No!

870
01:15:42,272 --> 01:15:43,398
Daddy?

871
01:15:50,442 --> 01:15:52,821
Isaac.

872
01:15:53,404 --> 01:15:54,948
Daddy?

873
01:15:56,776 --> 01:15:57,736
Yeah.

874
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:03,319
Isaac, no.

875
01:16:04,395 --> 01:16:06,732
No, Isaac, please. No.

876
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:11,715
Please!

877
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:13,843
Come back!

878
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:16,230
Karl, don't!

879
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,952
I want to see my son.

880
01:16:21,137 --> 01:16:22,598
No!

881
01:16:45,956 --> 01:16:47,542
Don't, Joe!

882
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:51,515
Stop!

883
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:19,013
I feel like myself agaln in here.

884
01:17:26,023 --> 01:17:27,735
Outside...

885
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,438
in the real world,
there's so much...

886
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:31,882
noise in my head.

887
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:39,777
It's quiet in here.

888
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:42,389
Who are you?

889
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:48,047
I used to be a man
named Eddie McCIeister.

890
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:50,150
Used to be?

891
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,550
And now you're...
what, the prime object?

892
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,887
No, no.
There's no prime object.

893
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:01,375
I'm just an object like the rest.

894
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,811
I have a will.

895
01:18:02,894 --> 01:18:05,064
That's the only thing
that makes me different.

896
01:18:07,651 --> 01:18:09,445
Except you're allive.

897
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:13,785
Yeah, unfortunately.

898
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:16,880
Unfortunately?

899
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,716
Outside this room...

900
01:18:23,842 --> 01:18:27,013
the objects all sense each other...

901
01:18:27,138 --> 01:18:32,521
always, like paln,
electricity, noise.

902
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:35,492
For a conscious mind, it's torture.

903
01:18:44,705 --> 01:18:47,125
You said I could bring my daughter back.

904
01:18:48,377 --> 01:18:49,503
How do I do that?

905
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:52,842
You have to kill me.

906
01:18:56,556 --> 01:18:58,391
No.

907
01:18:58,517 --> 01:18:59,685
I can't.

908
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:00,954
You can.

909
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:04,609
Even if I wanted to,
you shot yourself in the mouth.

910
01:19:04,734 --> 01:19:06,612
You spat the bullet out.
I can't.

911
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:08,740
You can kill me in this room.

912
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:11,620
Take the burden.

913
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:14,056
What burden?

914
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,418
Become an object.
Take my place.

915
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:20,257
No. I don't understand.
How is that possible?

916
01:19:20,283 --> 01:19:22,034
One object is destroyed,
another is created:

917
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:23,720
conservation of objects.

918
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:29,396
Eddie, I can't.

919
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,664
I don't want that.

920
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:32,817
I want to die.

921
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:37,399
You want to see your daughter agaln,
you have to kill me now, here,

922
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:38,776
in this motel room.

923
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:41,020
No.

924
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:42,982
No, I won't be a murderer.

925
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:47,030
Take out your gun...
please.

926
01:19:47,514 --> 01:19:49,475
End this.

927
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,277
No.

928
01:19:51,302 --> 01:19:52,729
Look, there's a price
for everything, Joe.

929
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,008
This is the price to get your daughter back.

930
01:20:01,383 --> 01:20:03,729
Kill me please.

931
01:20:22,348 --> 01:20:23,767
I'll get my daughter back?

932
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,902
Will my past be erased...

933
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:32,154
like yours was?

934
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:34,490
I don't know.

935
01:20:38,622 --> 01:20:40,165
Will my daughter remember me?

936
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:44,288
I don't know, but she'll be allve.

937
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:48,344
I'm sorry.

938
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,958
God forgive me.

939
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:23,103
Are you all right?

940
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,873
What happened?

941
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:27,735
Where is he?

942
01:21:28,653 --> 01:21:30,113
Sorry.

943
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,752
- Joe?
- He's gone.

944
01:21:35,104 --> 01:21:37,441
Joe, what did you do?

945
01:21:37,624 --> 01:21:39,627
You have to reset me.

946
01:21:43,592 --> 01:21:45,277
I'm gonna go in the room.

947
01:21:45,302 --> 01:21:46,888
I want you to reset it with the key.

948
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:50,935
I can't.

949
01:21:51,019 --> 01:21:52,897
You're gonna disappear just like Anna did.

950
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,106
I won't.

951
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,485
I promise.

952
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:16,465
Better come back.

953
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:18,776
I will.

954
01:22:30,827 --> 01:22:32,955
Please bring my daughter back.

955
01:22:39,131 --> 01:22:40,591
Please bring my daughter back.

956
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,263
Please.

957
01:22:53,777 --> 01:22:55,905
- Daddy!
- Anna!

958
01:22:57,658 --> 01:22:59,201
You're okay?

959
01:22:59,285 --> 01:23:02,373
- You okay?
- Yeah.

960
01:23:02,915 --> 01:23:04,626
Yeah.

961
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:06,963
Sure you're okay?

962
01:23:07,788 --> 01:23:08,924
You all right?

963
01:23:08,949 --> 01:23:10,410
Is that bad man gone?

964
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:15,476
Yeah.
Yeah, the bad man's gone.

965
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:17,262
Okay?

966
01:23:21,677 --> 01:23:24,013
But, Anna, you're safe with me now, okay?

967
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:26,550
You're safe with me.

968
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,053
Yeah.

969
01:23:29,196 --> 01:23:30,656
All right, banana?

970
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,253
Okay, let's get out of here.

971
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:45,628
Oh, my God.

972
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,318
How is she?

973
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,654
Oh, she's all right.

974
01:23:51,779 --> 01:23:53,239
You're okay, right?

975
01:23:53,322 --> 01:23:54,407
Yeah.

976
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:57,328
Yeah.
She's okay.

977
01:23:58,956 --> 01:24:01,793
Anna, this is Jennifer.

978
01:24:02,476 --> 01:24:05,773
- Hi.
- Hi.

979
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,763
Jennifer, this is my daughter Anna.

980
01:24:15,437 --> 01:24:17,190
- What is it?
- Where are we?

981
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:23,208
I will tell you the whole story later, okay?

982
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:23,976
Okay.

983
01:24:24,001 --> 01:24:25,879
Right now I just have
one last thing to do,

984
01:24:26,405 --> 01:24:27,489
and then we got to go.

985
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,503
Okay.
Stay right here.

986
01:24:38,221 --> 01:24:39,807
What are you doing?

987
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:44,864
Trying to put an end to this.

988
01:25:17,554 --> 01:25:18,514
Let's go.

989
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,115
Where are we going?

990
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:22,410
Some place far away from here.

991
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,639
- You okay?
- Yeah.

992
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:34,224
