1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,183
Arkham Asylum.

2
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,286
Prison to the greatest supervillains
the world has ever known.

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,022
And Mr. Banjo.

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,087
Ever since the first
"Robot Chicken DC Comics Special",

5
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:26,427
#RCDC

6
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:29,252
Humanity has been safe
from these deviants.

7
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:30,888
Until...

8
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:32,605
the night.

9
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:19,486
And now,
the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special 2

10
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,360
Villains in paradise.

11
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:23,124
#RCDC2VIP

12
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,055
Would you like to buy
some girls scout cookies?

13
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,864
No!

14
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,467
Okay. Thanks, mister.

15
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,166
But Bizarro... said no.

16
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:42,931
Oh, this commute is murder.

17
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,098
Okay.

18
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:45,842
Let's do this!

19
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,142
Get aw...

20
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,164
Ow! You little vampires.

21
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:00,546
Oh, my moccasin.

22
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,463
Oh, no, not again!

23
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,477
No, no!

24
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,586
Just be gentle, Mr. Snappy.

25
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:11,460
What is wrong with this piece of shit!

26
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:13,211
Swipe it slower.

27
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,677
Ah, that's to slow.

28
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:18,482
Is it facing the right way?

29
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,348
Of course it's facing the right...

30
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:21,892
Okay, it was not.

31
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:23,918
Dad, this is total bull crap.

32
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,111
It's Spring Break.

33
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,802
My boyfriend invited me
to his family's place at the beach.

34
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,275
Well, the court says I get you
on weekends and holidays.

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,694
Like it or not,
we're spending this time together.

36
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,695
Doing what?

37
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,771
Oh, I have a plan for you.

38
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,690
Give me a double espresso latte,

39
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:41,745
half decaf, medium foam,
with a dusting of dutch chocolate.

40
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
That bald son of a bitch.

41
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,659
- Does Weather Wizard want coffee?
- I texted him.

42
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:48,855
I think he's responding because those
three dots are hovering right there.

43
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,311
Tall café latte, please.

44
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:53,309
Okay, that's $3.95.

45
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,209
You didn't ask me
if I wanted whip or no whip.

46
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,354
Do you want whip?

47
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,581
- Whip.
- Great.

48
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,557
Do I want an extra shot of espresso?

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,800
I don't know. Do you?

50
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,984
We'll see.

51
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,744
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

52
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,762
It's... It's in my keys.

53
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,319
It's in my keys.

54
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,634
It's on the house, okay.

55
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,701
Free or not free
has nothing to do with it.

56
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,244
I don't know if I want it.

57
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,615
Only the coin knows if I want it.

58
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,437
hang on.

59
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:23,787
Oh, come on.
The Wi-Fi password doesn't work.

60
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,042
Aren't you a living supercomputer?

61
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,611
Use the Wi-Fi in your brain.

62
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,070
I don't have Wi-fi.

63
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:30,427
I have 3G.

64
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,665
And I'm locked in a shitty family plan.

65
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,613
Mom blows through all my data netflixing episodes of "Castle".

66
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,379
I have no minutes ever.

67
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,552
Ever!

68
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,902
Working here on your Spring Break?
That's total bull crap, Lena.

69
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,909
Yeah.
Well, tell that to Daddy War-Bald.

70
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,646
"Daddy War-Bald"!

71
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:49,754
We... We should follow
each other on Twitter.

72
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,107
Damon Lindelof
favorited my tweet once.

73
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:58,512
So, Lena over there
has to work on Spring break.

74
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,623
Did you even know it was Spring break?

75
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,580
What does it matter?
We don't get vacations.

76
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,194
That's what I told Lena!

77
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,085
She says that's so unfair.

78
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,678
Lena makes a lot of good points.

79
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,589
Oh! And you know she's vegan?

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,732
I really admire that Lena.

81
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,207
Weather Wizard wants an Americano.

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,545
Say we already left.

83
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,884
I'd like to introduce you to Superboy.

84
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,978
My, Uh... My clone.

85
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:24,837
What up?

86
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:26,516
"Clone"?

87
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,161
I knew you wouldn't have
the guts to tell them the truth.

88
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,791
I never should have had your baby.

89
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,939
That's what I've been telling you
for 16 years.

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,373
That's right, a clone!

91
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:37,640
A clone with no strings attached.

92
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:53,513
By sending a targeted energy pulse
from our stealth drone,

93
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:57,050
we will deactivate
the Justice League's power generator,

94
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,521
housed in the south quadrant
of the Hall of Justice,

95
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:05,263
rending those hapless heroes
completely defenseless and...

96
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,171
We're in the middle of a meeting!

97
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,935
Do you fools want to tell me
what's so important?

98
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,269
Well, if you insist.

99
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:16,066
Welcome to the 1986
Smallville High School talent show!

100
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:20,946
My name is SexyLexy
and we are Sexx Luthor!

101
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:21,960
Turn it off.

102
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,485
Oh, baby, baby,
with that ass so sweet.

103
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,911
We're the brainy studs
that you're dying to meet.

104
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,246
Sexx Luthor!

105
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,593
Sexx Luthor!

106
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,627
Come on! Lana Lang,
Lana Lang with that sweet ponntang

107
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,972
I wrote you a song,
now shake hands with my wang.

108
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,401
Sexx Luthor!

109
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,221
Sexx Luthor!

110
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,587
I said turn it off.

111
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,426
Just made it my ringtone.

112
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,545
I had a great time tonight, Iris.

113
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,002
Reverse-Flash!

114
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,569
You're not the only one
who's good with ladies, Flash.

115
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,784
Feast your eyes on Revers-Iris.

116
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,555
My name is Tina.

117
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:04,968
Up, up and away!

118
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,035
Uh, don't you think
you should sit down?

119
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,945
'Cause I'm gonna flying really fast.

120
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,457
I just think it would be safer.

121
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:17,119
I just...
Isn't there another shape?

122
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,754
Couldn't you make it more... vehicular?

123
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:21,255
Why?

124
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,974
Look, it doesn't  matter.
Let's... Let's just go in the ball.

125
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,428
Oh, because it's emasculating.

126
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,813
Oh, boy. You're one of those "Just put
it right out there" guys, aren't you?

127
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,700
Yes! It is emasculating.

128
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,728
It is emasculating to show up

129
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,603
with no superpowers
in a lime-green safety bubble!

130
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,883
Oh. Well, no,
let's talk about this for a second.

131
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,694
Earlier, you said
"something more vehicular".

132
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:41,818
Like a plane?

133
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,038
- Sure
- Okay, yeah. No, jet or prop?

134
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,983
Oh, a big prop plane, for sure!

135
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,874
And while you guys
are fighting the robot,

136
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,736
I'll get in a dogfight with Snoopy.

137
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,829
Let's just go!
I am sorry I ever said anything.

138
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,802
Look, I'm not gonna fly you
in the bubble.

139
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:57,336
I know you hate it,
and that's all I'll be thinking about.

140
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,306
There does come a time

141
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,976
when you must unwind.

142
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,417
And it's just the wind

143
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,182
and your superfriends.

144
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:20,774
Be set free.

145
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:29,269
Upon the sea.

146
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:33,536
And you're with your superfriends

147
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:37,468
until the super end.

148
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:40,079
Just sailin'!

149
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,409
Sailin'!

150
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:49,309
Sailing!

151
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:53,098
Sailing!

152
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,062
I... I got to call my dad.

153
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,686
...Which will bump Eddie's plan
to the end of march,

154
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,078
but I don't think anyone loves
"Malcolm in the riddle" anyway.

155
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,498
All in favor?

156
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,390
All in favor?

157
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,195
Okay, what's the problem?

158
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,650
You're working us
to the bone, Luthor!

159
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:12,935
We've butt-polished these seats
into reflective surfaces.

160
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,095
I pulled a chair
for Grodd the other day

161
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,038
and got into a staring contest
with his brown eye!

162
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,874
Why don't we get vacations?

163
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,553
Vacation!

164
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,420
Vacation!

165
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,212
You idiots have plenty of time off.

166
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,383
It's called prison.

167
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,153
Luthor is correct!

168
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:32,005
I, Starro The Conqueror,
require no vacation.

169
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,323
Why when I'm defeated
by the Justice League,

170
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,390
I'm back to business the next day.

171
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,154
I was at the drawing board,
not the shuffle board.

172
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,936
I... Uh, hey, where we going?

173
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,368
Oh, two guys taking a leak.
All right, well, it's odd...

174
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:48,779
We're on the same page,
right, guys?

175
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,364
You shouldn't flush those things.

176
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,404
That's how New York
got giant alligators in the sewers.

177
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,049
That's just an urban legend.

178
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,488
Oh, you think so?

179
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,178
Moving on a new business...

180
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,104
I have four mochas,
two whipped, two naked.

181
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,650
What? My daughter Lena
is supposed to bring the coffee.

182
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:07,889
Who the fuck are you?

183
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,040
That's my nephew Calvin, isn't he great?
Trying to help my sister out.

184
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,595
I'm taking Lena shift while
she's on vacation with her boyfriend

185
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,723
Lena does what she wants.

186
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:17,858
No!

187
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,836
This insubordination will not stand!

188
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:22,608
Well, you heard him. Go. It's over.
I tried, but it didn't work out.

189
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,874
It is what it is, okay?
Tell sis I love her.

190
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,614
What? What are you looking at.
Get the fuck out of here.

191
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,331
Brainiac, tap into the grid!

192
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:33,047
We'll cross-reference the database
of every airline in the country until...

193
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,563
Lena's Instagram is blowing up
with vacay pics!

194
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,956
That beach house looks amazing!

195
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,872
Grodd, cross your legs,
I can see your dick.

196
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,128
Lena thinks she can defy me?

197
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,813
You all wanted a vacation?

198
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,670
Well, the Legion of Doom
is going to the beach.

199
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,880
Flight mode engaged.

200
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:49,839
What?

201
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,175
The Hall of Doom... It flies.

202
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,001
Meow! We've been commuting
to the Okefenokee swamp

203
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,305
when we could have been
anywhere else? Meow!

204
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,303
I wear fucking burlap, man,

205
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,773
and the 20 pound of swamp water
it takes on every morning!

206
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:06,064
I have a case of trench foot
that's marched halfway up my balls!

207
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,018
Buckle up!

208
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:10,949
This bastion of evil upsets
the delicate balance of the green.

209
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,390
You were right to summon me,
the Swamp Thing,

210
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,248
for I am your protector.

211
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,503
Do you smell gasoline?

212
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,535
Shit! Shit!
This thing's taking off!

213
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,614
Get the fuck out of my way!

214
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,382
No!

215
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,505
"The death of Swamp Thing"

216
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,960
The most shocking comic book
of the year, now on sale!

217
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,118
He's back and better than ever!

218
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:32,425
"Swamp Thing" #1!
Now back to our show.

219
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,210
Green Arrow to tower.

220
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,876
The turbulence knocked the pilot
out cold! I'm all alone up here!

221
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,543
Easy, India Juliet 32,
we can talk you down.

222
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:41,779
First, tell me what it says
on your altimeter.

223
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,476
I can't even see the altimeter.

224
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,037
- I assure you it's there.
- I know it's there.

225
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,792
I'm saying I can't see it!

226
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,906
If you're having trouble
identifying the altimeter,

227
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,833
you need to look it up
in the flight manual.

228
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,627
I can't read it! We're ejecting out
of this flying death box!

229
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,205
Fuel jettisoned.

230
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,243
Oh, fuck!

231
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:05,176
You know, I was just off
a very hard breakup,

232
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:07,217
but I have to say,
this actually feels...

233
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,732
Is there a doctor in the house?

234
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:12,769
Oh, right here! Dr. Fate.
He's a doctor.

235
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,430
I'm not... Uh...
I'm actually not that kind of doctor.

236
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,696
What? You lied to me.

237
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:21,719
I never meant to hurt you, Melanie!

238
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,868
Green Arrow
was the champion of justice,

239
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:41,207
but more importantly,
he was my friend.

240
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,985
And no amount of tears will...

241
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,176
Will...

242
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,515
No, you know what?
Fuck this!

243
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,251
Oh, don't act so shocked, you phonies

244
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,656
You know how this works.

245
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:53,591
In a few months, some magic amulet
will bring him back or...

246
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,624
we'll find some
alternate-dimension Green Arrow

247
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,602
that's exactly like
the one we had before!

248
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,240
How many of you here
have already died?

249
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:01,888
Come on! Put them up!

250
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,850
Exactly. So, all due respect to
Green Arrow or who ever bites it next,

251
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,985
But I'm done with your memorials,
your wakes,

252
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,164
or flying to your home planets
to scatter your fucking ashes!

253
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:12,690
I am done!

254
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,025
First day of my internship
at the Daily Planet.

255
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,127
Working at the Daily Planet is great.

256
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:25,161
Mr. Kent's really nice,
and Miss Lang gets all the scoops!

257
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,790
And if I ever get in hot water,
I can call Superman on my signal watch!

258
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,500
Good one, Jimmy!

259
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,741
Look, it's true!

260
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:32,851
No way!

261
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,263
I'll prove it, rookie!

262
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:38,711
Superman will catch me
before I even in hit the ground...

263
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,637
Is this your signal watch?

264
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,916
The bad news, Jimmy Olsen died.

265
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,345
The good news, I got promoted.

266
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,399
Come on, you stupid gorilla.

267
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,138
It's my first day.

268
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:53,064
Do something cool!

269
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:57,409
Help! Help me, Superman!

270
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:01,751
Jimmy?

271
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:02,697
Jimmy?

272
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,875
Jimmy!

273
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:09,050
What? why?

274
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:11,518
Look, Mr. Kent!

275
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,337
I got the front page
on my very first day.

276
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,388
Congrats.

277
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,071
So, what made you respond
to my profile?

278
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,115
Well, you said you liked fish.

279
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,374
So?

280
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,926
Ain't no poontang until date six,
and the edge grows wild, my man,

281
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:27,056
like Fangorn forest wild.

282
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,815
Hey, I just remembered I left
the ocean running, so...

283
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,046
maybe another time.

284
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,344
What a beautiful morning.

285
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:43,555
You're welcome.

286
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:47,386
You gonna make that joke
every fucking day, Weather Wizard?

287
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,579
Your power's not called "July"!

288
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,150
Hey, man, you're really sunburned.

289
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,521
You should go inside.

290
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:56,342
This is my natural skin tone.
You know what? Mind your own business.

291
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,049
Okay, all right.

292
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,977
Cute mermaid, girls.

293
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,376
Damn cute.

294
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,627
Hey, here's $5.

295
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,997
Why don't you girls
go get yourself some ice cream?

296
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,808
Hey, there, baby.
From around here?

297
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,958
Clayface don't get to meet a lot of...

298
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:18,773
Hey, fellas, "Private beach"
is code for "Nude beach".

299
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:23,406
Keep your visibly-mangled and misshapen
sausage cock in your pants, Penguin.

300
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:27,090
Guys, at a nude beach...
Hey, that really hurt.

301
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,914
Guys, at a nude beach,
there's nude women.

302
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,641
Oh, my god!

303
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,128
- What? Huh?
- Dude, you got fried!

304
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,264
I told you, my skin is naturally...
Holy fucking shit!

305
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,655
- Problem?
- Oh, no.

306
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,478
Is it sunburn?

307
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,142
No, no. Nope.

308
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:00,316
I'm perfectly bronzed.

309
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:04,779
Hey, I think this guy is dead.

310
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,635
I think I finally comfortable
in my own skin.

311
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,747
- So take off your mask.
- Uh, no, no, no.

312
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:14,459
- I'm a real "But-his-face".
- There's no judgment here, Scarecrow.

313
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,348
We're all beautiful in our own way.

314
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:17,875
Look at those dudes' dicks!

315
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:23,047
Wait. So "private"
doesn't mean "nude"?

316
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:25,341
"Private" means "private".

317
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,514
What are you fools doing?

318
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,799
Where are your clothes?

319
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:31,344
What the hell kind of freak show
are you running here, Luthor?

320
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,808
- I'm just here looking for my daughter.
- Daddy?

321
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:34,809
Lena!

322
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,708
"Daddy"?

323
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,847
Lena, you are never to see him again.

324
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:38,855
No!

325
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,482
Conner, you are never
to see that girl again.

326
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,483
No!

327
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,582
Hey, a quarter.

328
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,744
No!

329
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,397
Oh, golly, superboy!

330
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,696
How'd you ever land a high-class
fucking trail like Lena Luthor?

331
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:55,099
Well, talking about teenagers having sex
would be cheap exploitation.

332
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:57,833
But singing about it
is another story.

333
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:02,128
I met Lena.
Went to a movie.

334
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,666
Fell for Conner.
I let him super do me.

335
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,635
We made out.
Started to bone.

336
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,719
You'd be surprised
what they've enhanced on this clone.

337
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,517
Super teens,
who cares what they mean?

338
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,729
When all you need are super nights.

339
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,649
Give us dirt! Give us dirt!

340
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,610
Did you find out their scheme?

341
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,403
Give us dirt! Give us dirt!

342
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,322
Does his dick shoot red beams?

343
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,075
Good thing my panties are 10% lead.

344
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:36,031
And she's no stranger
to dicks with smooth heads.

345
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:36,829
Gross.

346
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,249
My super dad,
he'll get super mad.

347
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:45,954
But it's worth it for those super...

348
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:50,802
Nights!

349
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,781
I let you finish that song
as a professional courtesy.

350
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:54,847
That was a mistake.

351
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,136
Lena, you're to good
for that super-trash.

352
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,560
My clone's to good
to date a filthy Luthor!

353
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,944
Lena's got more class
in her little finger than you...

354
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:04,273
I'm cool, I'm cool.

355
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,884
Silence, fools.
It's over.

356
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:08,861
Slut, she's a slut.

357
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,029
Oh, you!

358
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,197
Oh, hell, no!

359
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:16,680
Check me out now, mother fuckers!

360
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,523
It's Starro!

361
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:22,124
Like a mighty New York City
sewer alligator!

362
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,728
I'd hate to say I told you so.

363
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,253
That is a lie.

364
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:27,832
I tol...

365
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,716
Only our combined forces
can defeat a foe that size.

366
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,916
All right, Luthor.
I'll bring my super-strength,

367
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,315
laser eyes,
invulnerability, and super-speed,

368
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,849
and you bring your slightly
above-average intelligence.

369
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,061
You know what?
Fuck you, Superman!

370
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,531
I've got this one, Mr. J!

371
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:56,978
No!

372
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,405
"Death of the Joker", now on sale!

373
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,848
Collect all 18 variant covers!

374
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:02,873
I got mine!

375
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,772
Hey, Sinestro, you remember
your lantern corps basic training?

376
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,420
The old bow-and-arrow maneuver?

377
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,084
You idiots!

378
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,822
This parasol's more
than just a fashion statement.

379
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:16,068
Sorry! Sorry!

380
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,201
Riddle me this!

381
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:21,714
Can anybody here me?

382
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,292
Riddle me this!

383
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,798
It's time Starro learn
that speed kills!

384
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,399
Sorry! Sorry!

385
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,743
I got this, guys!

386
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,194
Maybe I can turn the tide of this battle
with the aid of my ocean friends!

387
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:47,431
Aquaman calls us,
the horses of the sea, to fight!

388
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:50,629
So if any of ye wishes to leave,
go now,

389
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:54,437
and let no seahorse
hold in judgment he that does!

390
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:55,841
You are free...

391
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:56,997
all of ye...

392
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,638
to do as you choose.

393
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,001
Aye, lads.

394
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:06,270
Even Slow-witted Steve stayed.

395
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,690
And Crippled Kevin.

396
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:11,220
Kevin, whose tail
was gripped by a crab.

397
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,110
Look upon one another

398
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:16,405
and know that on this day,
ye all chose

399
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:20,826
to fight for the one in tight-green
leggins and orange shirt,

400
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,622
the one who sometimes carries a trident
but mostly no,

401
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:29,251
the one with the locks of gold
fairer than any maiden!

402
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,322
We fight for the one they call

403
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,633
Aquaman!

404
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,538
So, ride the currents as though
your tails were set alight,

405
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:41,764
for your names shall be remembered

406
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,461
from this day and forevermore!

407
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,185
For Aquaman!

408
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,423
If this is the end,

409
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,923
I want to die here,

410
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,089
In your arms

411
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,145
among all these dead seahorses

412
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,417
For Aquaman!

413
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,430
So many dead seahorses.

414
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,938
I love you.

415
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,215
I love you!

416
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
Could it be?

417
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,869
True love has touched
even this old starfish's heart?

418
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,300
We have no reason to fight,
my friends!

419
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,769
Smile, you son of a bitch!

420
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:29,906
Sailin'

421
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,524
Sailin'

422
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,164
I guess we learned
something here today, Luthor.

423
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,562
Indeed, we have.
For all our combined powers,

424
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:44,531
we were fools to think we could defeat
the greatest power of the universe...

425
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:45,367
love.

426
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,582
It's so beautiful.

427
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,792
It's a little gross.

428
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,336
The bride and groom will now read
the vows they have written.

429
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,881
When I met Lena...

430
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:01,091
I never realized one person
could teach me so much about life

431
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,098
and love and following
my own passion.

432
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,216
That's how I finally find
the courage to ask...

433
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,547
Bizarro, will you marry me?

434
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:12,313
And... and Bizarro say yes!

435
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,190
Oh! This is beautiful.

436
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,762
Bizarro say yes!

437
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:16,535
Yes!

438
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,554
Yes! Yes!

439
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,069
A thousand times yes!

440
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,735
You may now kiss the bride.

441
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,750
Yes! Me want kiss!

442
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,039
Yes! Yes!

443
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:32,051
This is how we're ending the second
"Robot Chicken DC Comics Special",

444
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,934
with a bullshit fake-out wedding?

445
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,373
Damn it! Aren't you dead?

446
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:36,937
Oh, I got the magic amulet.

447
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,960
Drop your dicks and grab your flip-flops.

448
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:42,968
We are Sexx Luthor!

449
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,346
Oh, baby, baby!
With that ass so sweet.

450
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,801
We're the brainy studs
that's your dying to meet.

451
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:51,041
Sexx Luthor!

452
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,496
Sexx Luthor!
