[♪]

6
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:16,344
You know, I was pretty shocked
when I found out.

7
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,148
I'm not sure why,
I knew it was a possibility.

8
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,416
We talked about it
a bunch, actually, but...

9
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,688
I guess I kind of
hung onto the fact

10
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,857
that maybe he will,
maybe he won't have it.

11
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:35,297
You know, I thought it was a
really good idea to take the test.

12
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,364
He wanted to know.

13
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,902
He thought it'd be better
that way and I agreed with him.

14
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,776
Guess it's just kinda different
when you actually know.

15
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:02,058
You sure you don't want me
to go with you today?

16
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,726
No, don't worry about it,

17
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,728
but will you around
when I get back?

18
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:08,263
- [Lucas] Well, no, actually,
I... I might have to work.

19
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,397
Okay.

20
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,101
Send me a message
when you find out, okay?

21
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,770
Yeah, I will.

22
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:19,008
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

23
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:38,326
[steady tone]

24
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,879
Mr. Reid?
We're ready for you.

25
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,492
[door opens]

26
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,362
Man, I'm so sorry.
This is horrible.

27
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,333
I mean, it's fine, really.

28
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,468
Also, I'm, like,
feeling pretty good.

29
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,071
I felt like I was ready to know.

30
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:27,009
But Dylan, come on, it...
This is a big deal.

31
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:29,011
You sent that message and
I couldn't even focus.

32
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,179
I told my boss I had to leave.

33
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,648
She's not pissed, is she?

34
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:33,983
No, that's fine, it's...

35
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,652
Don't worry about that,
I just...

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,589
figured I should be here
when you got back.

37
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,791
Well, thanks.
I appreciate it.

38
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,092
Obviously, the company helps.

39
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,829
This might be stupid,
I don't know,

40
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:49,397
but I got you something
on the way back.

41
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,500
No, that's great.

42
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:53,636
Thought you could use it.

43
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,104
Yeah, good,
let's go drink it.

44
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:12,487
[Lucas]
So what was it like for you

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,956
growing up with your mom
sick like that?

46
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,627
Well, it was pretty awful,
to be honest.

47
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:23,531
Just like watching her
slowly dissolve over the years.

48
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,402
One time in middle school,
I was late for class

49
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:30,505
because she shat the floor
and I stepped in it.

50
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,607
[Lucas] Jesus.

51
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,380
Yeah, well, I haven't
stepped in human shit for years.

52
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,248
You know, just dog shit
once or twice.

53
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:42,151
I guess once is
enough for that.

54
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,691
Do you think maybe you're
gonna see anybody about this?

55
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,628
Like a therapist or
a monk or something?

56
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,999
I mean, I don't
really think I need to,

57
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,100
for whatever reason.

58
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,739
Are you and Emily
still fighting?

59
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,408
[Lucas] No, man, don't
worry about my problems.

60
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,976
They're not
that important today.

61
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,178
I disagree.

62
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,649
Yeah, yeah, we're
still fighting.

63
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't know, it feels...
it's weird.

64
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,191
We get along in
a lot of ways, you know?

65
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,493
Maybe we just have different
world views or something.

66
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,398
Seems like she rejects outright
a lot of what I care about

67
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,767
and it's pretty tough...
pretty tough to deal with.

68
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,371
[Dylan] Yeah,
you guys definitely have

69
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:36,872
your philosophical differences.

70
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,607
Well, yeah,
but so do you and I.

71
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,409
You're just not much of
a dick about it.

72
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,044
Well, you know,
sometimes you are.

73
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,314
Yeah. Well,
I've been a dick sometimes,

74
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,984
but it's always easier
to forgive somebody

75
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,585
you're not sleeping with.

76
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,853
[Lucas] That's
definitely true.

77
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,959
[chuckling]

78
00:06:58,526 --> 00:06:59,795
What's so funny over there?

79
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,464
Just remembered,
I got laid off.

80
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,234
Yeah. That's funny timing.

81
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,845
[Dylan] <i>I wish
I didn't have to tell anyone.</i>

82
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,081
<i>And so many others
to tell, fuck.</i>

83
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,251
<i>Forget it, I mean,
there's good in this.</i>

84
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:24,820
<i>Face death and
know yourself, right?</i>

85
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:25,855
<i>I mean, bullshit.</i>

86
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,025
<i>But it is a fire,
isn't it?</i>

87
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,495
<i>It's a fire that burns
always in the background.</i>

88
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,864
<i>But only with me,
the heat's turned up.</i>

[♪]

91
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,323
What is it that you
have to confess, my child?

92
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,829
I've been having
suicidal thoughts.

93
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,532
Knowing what
you've been through,

94
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,134
that is not a surprise.

95
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:49,105
I've spoken to people
who considered suicide

96
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,240
after a tragedy.

97
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:55,010
But as you know,

98
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:57,613
suicide is a sin.

99
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:02,651
I understand the position
of the church, but...

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,255
but I miss my son.

101
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,425
He is with you always.

102
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,095
Remember that when
you're feeling lonely.

103
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:20,202
I feel that I'm not
the same as I was before.

104
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,772
Like a part of me has died.

105
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,543
My body just...

106
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:29,778
just keeps moving.

107
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,382
No, you're still alive.

108
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,885
You're still here.

109
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,386
All of you.

110
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,056
[♪]

111
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,994
Afternoon.

112
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,764
I'd like a hand gun, please.

113
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,799
What's a woman like you
need a gun for?

114
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,802
You have children?

115
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,872
[♪]

116
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:39,215
Hi, folks,
sorry about that.

117
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:43,385
Unfortunately, it appears that we
were delivered a corrupted file,

118
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,956
so tonight's screening
will not be able to continue.

119
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,391
We are offering refunds
at the front box office

120
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,860
so we can take care of you
out there.

121
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,463
Again, we apologize
for the inconvenience.

122
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,531
Thank you.

123
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,900
What the hell?

124
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,368
Cheers.

125
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,536
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

126
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:02,938
Movie night.

127
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:08,944
[whistles]

128
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,113
Do you guys think she did it?

129
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,717
Oh, definitely.
She's gone out of her damn mind.

130
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:16,185
- What's stopping her?
- No, I don't buy it.

131
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,721
Looks like she's gonna have,
like, a moment of

132
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,154
religious awakening
or something, I don't know.

133
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:21,156
Yeah, like eureka!
Murdering children is bad.

134
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,660
- [chuckling]
- Yeah, exactly.

135
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,128
I don't know, I got that
she's good at heart and...

136
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:29,231
I don't know, maybe she thinks
this isn't what God wants.

137
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,500
I mean,
children die every day.

138
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,436
Who's to say what "God" wants.

139
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:38,040
And people use religion to
justify so many horrible things.

140
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,109
It's normal, frankly.

141
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,678
So how about this?

142
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:45,014
How about she has
a eureka moment,

143
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,416
but instead, she realized that
she doesn't believe in God,

144
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:48,951
so it doesn't have to feel good.

145
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,621
Okay, so then what happens?

146
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,190
Just turns the gun
on herself and... splat.

147
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:56,825
No, no, I don't buy that.

148
00:11:56,992 --> 00:11:59,962
No, it's like... it's like
the Isaac story in the Bible.

149
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,064
She thinks God's gonna stop her.

150
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,099
When she realizes
nothing is stopping her,

151
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,401
she loses her faith.

152
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,770
[Emily] I like that,

153
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,104
but I don't think that is
what was going to happen

154
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,439
in the actual movie.

155
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,941
I mean, I think that's what
I would want to happen

156
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,009
if this was real life.

157
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,279
What, you want some lady
to kill herself?

158
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:20,082
Sure.
She can if she wants.

159
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,284
The only thing stopping her
is her dumb religion.

160
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,086
What the fuck, Emily?

161
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,622
That's a really messed
up thing to say.

162
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,156
[Emily] I'm sorry,
but it's true.

163
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,558
I mean, if someone wants to
kill themselves, fine.

164
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,460
- Why do I care?
- It's not that,

165
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:32,928
it's just you're so
blatantly disrespectful

166
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,597
of people's beliefs.

167
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,432
People care about that stuff,
you can't just shit on it.

168
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,401
Oh, are we having to
come to Jesus moment?

169
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,502
Fuck you.

170
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,239
God, you're always
so damn touchy.

171
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:46,175
I mean,
who have I offended?

172
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,309
Maybe me.

173
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,613
God, why are you
acting so superior

174
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,816
to half the fucking
human race all the time?

175
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,254
All right, I'm good.

176
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,658
You can have that, Dylan.
I'm going home.

177
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,100
You must be very
bored of this by now.

178
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,236
Honestly, I've been having
a great time.

179
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:16,740
Don't be a dick.

180
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,410
- [chuckling]
- Fuck.

181
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,492
[Frank] What's the news?

182
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,026
He has it.

183
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,134
Oh, man.

184
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,770
Do you know how
he's taking it so far?

185
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,238
He's taking it in stride.

186
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,073
We had dinner afterwards,

187
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:53,909
but I don't know if
it's sunk in yet.

188
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,545
[Homer] I mean,
what did he say?

189
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,015
He said he's happy
he took the test.

190
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,720
He feels like he has
more control over his time left,

191
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,889
but that can change.

192
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:12,561
I mean, he's a rock
about this stuff.

193
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,563
You can't always tell with him.

194
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:19,769
You remember when his mom died
and he was visiting us.

195
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:21,437
He didn't say a word about it.

196
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,110
[Frank] Did, uh,
that doctor say anything else?

197
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,013
There's no treatment,
there's no cure.

198
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,081
About ten years.

199
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,794
[♪ dance]

200
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,056
[♪]

201
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,066
Listen, Dylan,
I just wanted to let you know

202
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,369
I heard about the test
and I'm really sorry.

203
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,005
Oh, thanks for saying so,

204
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:32,040
but don't worry about it
right now.

205
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:35,410
Tonight, let's just have some
drinks and have a good time.

206
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,779
- [woman] If you say so.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,480
It's good to see you
out and about though.

208
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,283
I know I wouldn't be up for it
if I was in your situation.

209
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,853
Yeah, well, you know,
they say friends always help.

210
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,823
- Yeah, that's a good attitude to have.
- Mm-hm.

211
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,893
[♪]

212
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,232
[woman] Obviously,
I'm here for you if you need anything.

213
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,034
[Dylan]
Yeah, well, thanks.

214
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,637
And, uh, is your show
still this week?

215
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,839
[woman] Yes, on Wednesday,
will I see you there?

216
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,707
- Yeah.
- [woman] Cool.

217
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,676
- Hey.
- Dylan, who's that girl I saw you dancing with, huh?

218
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,043
I don't know.

219
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,379
Do you think you
want to maybe find out?

220
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,281
- Probably.
- Yeah, probably.

221
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,319
So I heard you guys talking,

222
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,388
does that mean you
know about the test?

223
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,159
So what do you do
for a living?

224
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,695
Literally nothing.

225
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,030
I'm unemployed.

226
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,298
- I just got laid off.
- Unemployed.

227
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:31,133
[Dylan] I know, you should
actually be very jealous.

228
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,501
It's so much fun.

229
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,837
I get to, like, hang out
and read all day.

230
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:35,972
It's amazing.

231
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,472
I don't know if that's for me.

232
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:38,675
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,909
I've got a future
to worry about.

234
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,143
Aren't you worried
about your future?

235
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,679
- No.
- No, okay.

236
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:43,713
Not even,
you can't make me.

237
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:44,881
Okay.

238
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,515
What about you?
What do you do?

239
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,717
- I'm a server.
- Okay.

240
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,686
But I'm thinking
about grad school

241
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,386
and I read a lot of books.

242
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,723
- Oh, we should get along then.
- Really?

243
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,390
Do you ever write anything?

244
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:56,926
Yeah, I do.

245
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,995
I actually want to write a book,

246
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:03,600
but I'm gonna wait 'til I'm
in my 30s, I'm not ready.

247
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,836
If I'm still a server
when I'm 30, I'll panic,

248
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,270
and then I'll write a book.

249
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,739
I'm basically waiting
for a midlife crisis.

250
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:12,675
Good, you have to have
a dream to fall back on.

251
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,611
Yeah. What's your
fall-back dream?

252
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:16,045
- Basketball player.
- [laughs]

253
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,615
But besides that...
That might not work out.

254
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:20,850
- No.
- I might make a movie.

255
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,952
- A movie?
- Mm-hm.

256
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,888
- What about?
- I don't know yet.

257
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,624
I'll have to wait for
my midlife crisis.

258
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,726
[woman] Oh, well,
that's gonna be a while,

259
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,661
so how about in the meantime?

260
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:34,931
Just focus on my dancing
and drinking tours.

261
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:36,633
Oh, that'll be
good for tonight.

262
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,767
Mm-hm.

263
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:47,242
Uh, I felt...

264
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,878
really just dumbfounded.

265
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,915
I actually asked Lucas
what they were talking about

266
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,618
when they mentioned
a test, you know.

267
00:17:55,652 --> 00:18:00,657
I heard it in passing and
then Lucas told me and...

268
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:05,293
honestly, I didn't really know
how to talk to Dylan about it

269
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,295
'cause...

270
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:09,832
what do you do
in that kind of scenario?

271
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,802
How do you support your friend?

272
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,741
I was just kind of blown away.

273
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,476
You know, I've...

274
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,245
nothing like that in my life.

275
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:29,418
And, you know, Dylan has
some past history with this,

276
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:34,590
so he gets it and maybe
that's why he's been

277
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:37,026
so chill about it all.
I don't know.

278
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,095
[Dylan] It's good that
you guys are in town, though.

279
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,030
[man] Yeah, it's always good
to see you, Dyl.

280
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,865
- [man 2] Yeah, it's good to be back.
- Mm-hm.

281
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:43,866
[man 1] Can't believe
you're smoking.

282
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,467
[Dylan] Why?

283
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,436
I've smoked for so long,
you should be used to this.

284
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:48,838
Frank, how's work life?

285
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,940
Work life is good,
well balanced.

286
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,441
Actually just got promoted.

287
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:55,144
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, just kind of like,

288
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,780
felt like it's time for a
new challenge, which is good.

289
00:18:57,814 --> 00:18:59,314
Good for that old, uh,
you know,

290
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,983
personal growth
and that shit.

291
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,685
You, uh...
You found a job?

292
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,988
Nope. I haven't really been
looking very hard.

293
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,024
I'm gonna get something
part-time I think.

294
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:09,892
- [man] You gonna be a poor boy?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be a real poor boy.

295
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:12,028
[man] What are you gonna do
with all that time, poor boy?

296
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:13,863
I'm gonna read and, like, watch movies
and, like, hang out with friends.

297
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,064
And I'm also learning French.

298
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:16,364
- French?
- Stupid.

299
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,635
What's wrong with
learning French?

300
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:22,905
It's impractical.
We don't live in Canada.

301
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,974
- You should learn Spanish.
- Dutch.

302
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,477
Dutch is stupid. Even the Dutch
don't speak Dutch.

303
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,846
You know, the Dutch
settled New York,

304
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,347
which is where my
wedding is. You coming?

305
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,382
What a fucking segue.

306
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:37,887
We're downtown Chicago
home of the segues.

307
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,488
Oh, God.

308
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:41,389
How do you do that?

309
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:43,358
- He has a disease.
- Very carefully.

310
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,761
- It's very impressive.
- He has a disease.

311
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:45,995
Yeah, I am coming to
your wedding.

312
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,562
It will be great.

313
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,065
Is there some kind of
bachelor party I have to go to?

314
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:51,100
Probably not.

315
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,935
Just like not super into
the whole BP vibe

316
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:54,837
with the strippers and all that.

317
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:58,107
Just kind of goin' more low key.
You can come.

318
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,876
- You got a date?
- [Dylan] I do not.

319
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,443
- You don't?
- No.

320
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,246
[man] You should make him,
you should find someone.

321
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:05,681
Yeah, I, uh, you know,
I hear there's

322
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,917
sophisticated ways
on the internet

323
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,886
to get people to go
to dates with you

324
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,054
and they make romantic comedy's
about them now.

325
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,355
I know how much
you like rom-coms.

326
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,556
[Dylan]
I do, I do love rom-coms.

327
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,192
- Hugh Grantstan.
- They are great.

328
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,960
- [man] Really?
- [Dylan] Oh, yeah, they're amazing.

329
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,962
There's like so... like
there's so many adventures.

330
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,031
It's so cute.

331
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,766
My life could be a
little bit dull at times.

332
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,034
It could be nice.

333
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,434
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, we noticed.

334
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,503
[chuckling]

335
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,120
So what's the first album
you had as a kid?

336
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,088
[woman laughs]

337
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:49,491
It's embarrassing.
I had Mariah Carey.

338
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:51,194
[laughing]

339
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,663
I used to try to do that
whistle singing thing, you know?

340
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,965
- Mm-hm.
- Drove my whole family nuts.

341
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,767
[Dylan] I'm sure it did.

342
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,969
- What about you?
- It was, uh, REM.

343
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:01,737
It was my mom's
favorite album.

344
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,405
Me my sister used to
dance to it

345
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:04,640
every time we got
home from school.

346
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:05,975
- Oh.
- It was very cute.

347
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,076
That's cute, yeah.

348
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,812
Hey, have you decided
what you're gonna do

349
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:11,147
with the rest of your life?

350
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,248
You just gonna stay
unemployed forever?

351
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,416
I mean, I'd love that.

352
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:17,119
That's great, but
I am not an aristocrat,

353
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,622
so I think I'm gonna
become a tutor,

354
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,291
that way I can keep
most of my free time.

355
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:24,193
I have never met
anyone so enamored

356
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:25,828
with their own free time.

357
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:28,097
You know, you have to do
something with all of it.

358
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll figure something out.
What about you?

359
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,534
I thought you were holding off
your novel 'til your 30s?

360
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,836
Yeah, my novel, I am.

361
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:37,372
But in the meantime,

362
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,507
I decided I want to
go back to school.

363
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,543
Cool, what for?

364
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:46,048
I was putting it off
'cause, you know,

365
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:48,184
getting a master's
in creative writing

366
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:50,653
doesn't really get you
a hell of a lot of jobs.

367
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:51,954
- No.
- But, uh,

368
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:53,856
if I can get a scholarship,
you know,

369
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,125
it's just a paid vacation
doing what I want.

370
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,627
Oh, that sounds like a really...

371
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,695
Yeah, sounds like a good way
to spend your 20s.

372
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,963
You want to go back to school?

373
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,132
Maybe for film,
but I don't know yet.

374
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:06,235
I've only been unemployed
for like three months,

375
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,004
so have some patience with me.

376
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,805
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

377
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,208
You can get a week,

378
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,043
and then I'm cutting off
all contact.

379
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:16,245
You're putting
a lot of pressure on me.

380
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,748
I think it's good.
I think it'll be good for you.

381
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:25,254
I didn't treat him like shit,

382
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,455
I was a little
tiny bit sarcastic.

383
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:32,061
You are protecting everyone
in the world from me.

384
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:34,562
Like, acting like
I'm some kind of monster.

385
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:35,932
Maybe you just don't like me.

386
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:38,601
Maybe that's the...
Maybe that's the thing.

387
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,837
That's not it.
You know that's not it.

388
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,005
What is it then?

389
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,809
Maybe who you are is
not good with who I am.

390
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:53,916
Listen, maybe
you should just go.

391
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,017
Yeah, fine.

392
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:57,086
Jesus Christ.

393
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,892
[door closes]

394
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:03,993
Fuck.

395
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,103
[Dylan]
Are you okay?

396
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,473
[Lucas] Bet you're
sick of this by now.

397
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:21,310
I know I am.

398
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,478
You know, if I had some of those
fancy noise canceling headphones,

399
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,981
I'd probably be fine.

400
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:27,883
I've had enough.

401
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,355
Yeah, well, I guess I'm
kind of glad to hear that.

402
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,058
I like Emily,
but I don't like you guys

403
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:37,793
yelling at each other
all the time.

404
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,496
So do you think it's over?

405
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:47,670
Yeah.

406
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:00,649
Oh, man, I don't know.

407
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,587
I'm just afraid of being
alone right now I think.

408
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:10,926
I guess it's good 'cause
I'll have time to myself, but...

409
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,161
I don't know, it comes
quick with me, you know?

410
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:15,998
It's like I just feel like
I need someone there.

411
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,503
I guess I have time to
figure stuff out, you know,

412
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,172
try some things,
distract myself for awhile.

413
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,776
Yeah, I know what that's like.

414
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,145
What do you want to do?

415
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,213
I don't know, maybe
I'll meditate or...

416
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:33,315
Wait, isn't that
just sitting in a room

417
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,017
trying not to
think about anything?

418
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:36,952
Well, I mean, I guess it
depends on how good I am.

419
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:39,455
That seems like literally the
worst distraction in the world.

420
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:41,290
[laughs]

421
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:42,391
Yeah, we'll see.

422
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,496
What about you though?

423
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,532
You and Lizzie have been
going out for a while now.

424
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,801
- How's that going?
- It's going pretty good.

425
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,369
Things aren't that
serious right now.

426
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:57,306
Well, did you tell her
about the test?

427
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:58,407
No.

428
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,376
Really?

429
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:01,644
I mean, I figured
it happened so recently,

430
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,345
you guys have been
going out, so...

431
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,481
It's only... We've only been
together for like two months.

432
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:08,217
You know,
it's not that serious.

433
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:11,987
If you say so.

434
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,768
[♪]

435
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:57,199
[♪]

436
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,421
- See this tooth?
- Mm-hm.

437
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:20,823
Right here?

438
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,558
It's fake.

439
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:28,764
I, uh... I lost it in
a car accident when I was nine.

440
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,300
My dad was driving us all
to school

441
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,502
and we got hit in
the intersection

442
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:34,870
by a bunch of teens.

443
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:39,074
I was the only one hurt 'cause
I wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

444
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:42,511
But I bounced off
the dashboard,

445
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:44,180
and I was only upset
when they said

446
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:46,182
that they couldn't
find the tooth,

447
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,817
'cause I wanted to leave it
for the tooth fairy.

448
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,886
[chuckling]

449
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,656
I bet you look cute
all toothless, though.

450
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:54,456
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

451
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,492
I actually kinda
liked it, you know?

452
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:58,827
It scared my little sister
so much.

453
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:02,131
I would just
put stuff in it, you know,

454
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:05,434
broccoli or gum
just to mess with her.

455
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:09,104
I was upset when they told me
they were filling it up,

456
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:10,640
- you know?
- Mm-hm.

457
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:13,275
I felt like I'd been robbed of
a special talent.

458
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:14,376
You can't just take it out?

459
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:17,112
[Lizzie]
It's glued in there good.

460
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,049
Otherwise, I probably
would have shown up

461
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:21,483
to our first date
without it in.

462
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,353
Oh, damn.
That would have been hilarious.

463
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:25,888
Hi, nice to meet you.

464
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:29,458
This is what I look like.
[laughs]

465
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,993
No, that might have
ruined our date, though.

466
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,461
[Lizzie] It would have been
a good story.

467
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:36,398
Well, we can pretend
it happened later if you prefer.

468
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:38,167
[Lizzie]
We'll just tell everyone

469
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,203
you vomited in horror
at site of it.

470
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:43,138
[laughs]

471
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:50,212
I have always thought of Dylan
as, like,

472
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:53,816
the younger brother
I always wanted but never had.

473
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,185
I actually think he's two months
older than me or something,

474
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,386
but that's not the point.

475
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,121
Um...

476
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,491
We always knew it was
a possibility, right?

477
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,097
Like, I don't know if it's
a 50/50 chance or what,

478
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,199
but...

479
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,268
when it actually happened...

480
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:17,072
it was devastating.

481
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:22,945
And, uh, I don't think any of us
were ever the same afterwards.

482
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:31,621
But, um, I love the guy
and I think he's...

483
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:33,422
he's doing a great job.

484
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,430
[woman] I'm so sorry
to hear that, it's awful.

485
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,866
[Jessica] I guess he didn't
tell you about it.

486
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:45,034
I'm sorry to just
dump it on you like that.

487
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,435
I thought you knew already.

488
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,239
I mean,
I knew about his mom

489
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:53,409
and I knew that he could
possibly have it also,

490
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,811
but I never knew
he was taking the test.

491
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,982
It makes sense, though.
We aren't that close anymore.

492
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,085
I feel weird about it.

493
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,054
I don't know if I'm
supposed to know.

494
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,288
I think it's okay.

495
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,791
I think he wants
his friends to know,

496
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:09,858
just doesn't like
talking about it much.

497
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,799
How much time does he have
before it settles in?

498
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:17,634
[Jessica]
About 10 years.

499
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:18,735
That's rough.

500
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:24,674
I always wondered if it made
him live his life differently.

501
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,509
Like, with that
hanging over his head.

502
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:31,648
- Probably has to, doesn't it?
- Yeah, I think it does.

503
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,981
I mean, I kind of hope so.

504
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,484
To you find some sort of peace.

505
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:44,493
Hey, there.

506
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:47,630
- Hey.
- You working on something?

507
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,799
Yep, I'm writing a script.

508
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,934
I thought we were waiting
for our midlife crisis.

509
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:54,970
Well, I'm having mine early
so I'm gonna make a movie.

510
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,306
Wow, that's exciting.
What's it gonna be about?

511
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,540
I don't really know yet.

512
00:29:58,574 --> 00:29:59,541
I'm kind of just
brainstorming.

513
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:01,510
Maybe, like an adaptation.

514
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:04,380
An adaptation.
That's so boring.

515
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,181
Why don't you write
something more personal?

516
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:07,817
I don't know.

517
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,151
I feel like a movie about me
and my friends hanging out

518
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,286
and me reading
would be kind of boring.

519
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,792
Come on.
No skeletons in your closet

520
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:17,660
you can mine for
emotional effect, huh?

521
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,061
How about your childhood?

522
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,830
There's always something
in our childhood.

523
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:23,999
That's ridiculous. Haven't you
noticed how well adjusted I am?

524
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,401
[Lizzie]
No, not really.

525
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:27,469
That's bullshit.

526
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:30,506
I have a job now.
I'm a true adult.

527
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,040
Yeah, well, I guess
having a job at 26

528
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,676
is pretty impressive.

529
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,311
I know, I am
truly awe inspiring.

530
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,980
Can be in your movie?

531
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:40,549
Yeah, probably.
Wait, can you act?

532
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:45,921
No. But I haven't tried since
I was seven, so who knows?

533
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:47,222
I mean, that's fine.

534
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,758
Honestly, I just
don't have any money.

535
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,693
So I'm just gonna have
my friends be in it anyways.

536
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,494
You gonna send it to festivals?

537
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:53,730
If it isn't complete shit.

538
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:56,265
That's exciting.

539
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,902
Maybe it'll rub off on me and
I'll finally start my book.

540
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:01,403
What would you
write yours about?

541
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:02,571
My childhood.

542
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,274
That's where all the drama is.

543
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:08,678
So not a vanilla
upbringing for you?

544
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:11,513
You know how I
told you my dad died?

545
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:13,549
He had cancer,

546
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,117
and he died
when I was in middle school.

547
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:18,287
[Dylan]
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,421
That's okay.

549
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:23,893
Um, you know, you get older,
learn to live with it

550
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:27,630
because the days keep coming and
you don't have a choice, so...

551
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,599
I think it would be good
to write about, though.

552
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,636
So I can finally
air everything out

553
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,806
and understand better
what happened

554
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,442
and understand how I...

555
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:41,711
learned to live with it.

556
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:46,649
Yeah, but it seems like
it would be hard to do,

557
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:48,283
just emotionally.

558
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:49,384
[Lizzie]
Mm, yeah.

559
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,987
Maybe that's why
I'm putting it off.

560
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:55,825
[Dylan] Were you close
with your father?

561
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,761
Yeah, very.

562
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:01,731
But it was okay because
my sister was young at the time,

563
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:05,668
so... I had to
take care of her.

564
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,605
I had to be responsible,
you know, and...

565
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,773
I had to make sure she was okay,
which meant I had to be okay.

566
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:12,441
[Dylan]
Mm-hm, yeah.

567
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,878
But it was good to not
be alone during that time.

568
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:18,514
It was nice to have someone else
to think about beside myself.

569
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,819
Yeah, I guess you should
write that book then.

570
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,187
Yeah, probably.

571
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:30,058
[traffic noise]

572
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,668
- [Lucas] Hey, man.
- Hey.

573
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,837
- What's going on?
- Nada.

574
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:43,840
You all packed and
ready for tomorrow?

575
00:32:43,873 --> 00:32:45,507
Yeah, I got that
big old wedding to go to.

576
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,844
Yeah, that's good.

577
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,278
What have you been up to?

578
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,982
Well, today I went to
that psychic.

579
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:54,550
Oh, God.

580
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:57,052
Yeah, I know what you're
thinking, but... Thanks.

581
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:58,721
But it was actually really cool.

582
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,289
It was super legit and amazing
and I really recommend it.

583
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,658
You have to go some time.

584
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,559
She just knew so much
about me, you know?

585
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:05,795
She knew that I was having
relationship problems and all that.

586
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,462
But you know what
she also said?

587
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,064
She said I'm gonna have
a change in my love life soon.

588
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm gonna meet someone
when I least expect it.

589
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:14,704
- That sounds conveniently vague.
- It's not really, you know?

590
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:16,405
I mean, it is a little bit
'cause she can't see details,

591
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,841
but, you know, she also said
that I should lean on my friends

592
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,743
when I'm having a tough time.

593
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:21,911
Is that why you're
here right now?

594
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,412
Of course.

595
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,314
That and I needed
the coffee, so.

596
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,050
Well, good,
I like this psychic.

597
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:28,150
She was cool.

598
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:32,889
You know also,

599
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,090
I've been meaning to
ask you this for a while now,

600
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:36,726
but you know how
I've been going around town

601
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,528
- to different churches to check them out.
- Mm-hm.

602
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,463
I'm... I've been having
a good time, you know?

603
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:44,399
It's been pretty eye-opening
and I thought maybe...

604
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,935
maybe you want to
come some time.

605
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:48,771
I don't know.

606
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:50,272
I mean, you know
I'm not religious.

607
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:51,874
[Lucas] Yeah, I know.

608
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,911
I guess, I don't know.
I guess I could come sometime,

609
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,379
but I can't promise I'm
gonna pray or anything.

610
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,548
[Lucas] Nah, man, you don't
have to do anything like that.

611
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:00,850
[Dylan]
Okay, we can do it.

612
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:01,918
Sweet.

613
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:13,228
Um, sort of
simultaneously, um...

614
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:18,133
shocked and, like, totally
as though it was almost fated,

615
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:21,771
um, and just kind of horrified,

616
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:27,777
and not really sure
what to do about it.

617
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,980
That there's, um...

618
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:33,116
there's, like,
an intellectual level

619
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:36,284
on which it makes sense
to grapple with it

620
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:39,321
insofar as it means that

621
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:42,125
expectations
need to be revisited

622
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:43,926
for what your life
is gonna be like

623
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,829
and for what our relationship
is gonna be like.

624
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:50,833
But the actual meaning of...

625
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:53,836
of what it is to have
a degenerative disease

626
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,504
is just sorta
overwhelming to me,

627
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:59,976
Even though I remember
seeing your mom, um, you know,

628
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:02,344
I didn't see what
she started like.

629
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:05,514
Uh, and so it's
something where, like,

630
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:08,751
I know it's coming,

631
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:10,352
but I haven't seen it yet,

632
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:13,823
and so it's a little bit
easier to not think about it.

633
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:18,628
And I don't know how much
I should be thinking about it,

634
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:22,330
but it definitely
casts a shadow.

635
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,468
There's just nothing...
I don't...

636
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,037
it's just sort of...

637
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:32,875
it feels totally like
beyond what I can process,

638
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:37,080
um, and it bums me out.

639
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:48,423
[♪]

640
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:58,201
[indistinct chatter]

641
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:03,039
[♪]

642
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:07,210
He looks really happy.
It's quite cute.

643
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:08,911
Anybody else, tear up?

644
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,512
No, I don't approve of that.

645
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:13,683
When do you think they're
gonna start having babies?

646
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:15,383
I can't imagine
they'll waste much time.

647
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,586
I almost feel bad I don't.

648
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,287
[indistinct chatter]

649
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:29,866
Can't believe our little
Frank's all grown up.

650
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,399
At least we didn't
ruin that wedding.

651
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,568
Kidding me, Dylan.
You're the soul that wedding.

652
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:35,004
You owned that wedding.

653
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:37,073
Yeah, you're right.

654
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:40,042
- It's just weird calling Frank a husband.
- Husband?

655
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:41,944
I don't think he's quite
earned that moniker yet.

656
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:43,813
[Homer] But he's
probably banging right now.

657
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:46,182
You know, we should
all text Frank,

658
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,885
you know, encouragement.
You can do it buddy.

659
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,720
No, same advice.

660
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:53,388
Don't worry Frank, everyone
cries the first time.

661
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,925
[chuckling]

662
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:59,095
I haven't spoken to you
in a long time, Dylan.

663
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:01,597
I'm curious,
what have you been up to?

664
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,766
- Do you have a job yet?
- Yeah, I've been tutoring.

665
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,433
I'm trying to make
a movie in my free time.

666
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:07,036
You're making a movie?

667
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:08,838
That's pretentious.
What's it about?

668
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:13,109
It's about me finding out
about the test.

669
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:14,210
Oh.

670
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:17,213
You want any help with that?

671
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,948
[Dylan] Yeah, I mean,
that would be great,

672
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:21,416
just to get feedback
from people who, like,

673
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:24,620
know what it was like
for me growing up.

674
00:37:24,654 --> 00:37:26,555
You sure you
want to make that?

675
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:28,724
It's gonna be out in
the open for everyone.

676
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:30,226
You might wish you hadn't.

677
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,830
Oh, Dylan, look.
It's time to go man.

678
00:37:33,863 --> 00:37:34,897
All right.
Let's get out of here.

679
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:36,065
Okay. Say goodbye.

680
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,399
[Dylan] You guys
get home safe.

681
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:38,500
- Have a good night.
- Good to see you.

682
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,303
Great wedding.
Super big party.

683
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:42,571
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

684
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:51,981
[keys jangling]

685
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:58,453
Good night, Homer.
Thanks for letting me stay here.

686
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,522
Dylan, Dylan,
before you go, sit down.

687
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:02,191
Let's... Let's talk about
this movie.

688
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,295
What's up?

689
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,797
You know,

690
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,667
we've known each other
since we were five and...

691
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,503
I got to see your mother
go through her symptoms.

692
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,673
And...

693
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:22,879
I just...

694
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,215
I just think and hope
you're ready

695
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:28,951
to show that to the world.

696
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:32,889
You know, show them
what she's gone through

697
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,191
and what you've gone through.

698
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,392
I mean, I don't feel like

699
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:38,861
I have to go into
that much detail.

700
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:41,063
But I think the detail is key.

701
00:38:41,097 --> 00:38:44,466
Otherwise, your audience isn't
gonna really understand you,

702
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:45,735
you know?

703
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:47,803
They don't know much
about Huntington's

704
00:38:47,837 --> 00:38:49,537
and so...

705
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:54,542
when you're ready
with the script,

706
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:58,147
please send it to me.

707
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,584
We can read it together
and talk about it,

708
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:02,752
and try to figure this out.

709
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,820
Okay?

710
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,722
Yeah, of course
I'll send it to you.

711
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:09,625
I don't know.

712
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:11,559
I just feel like I had to
make something

713
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:12,962
in response to it.

714
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:17,800
Yeah, but are you ready to
show that kind of ugliness?

715
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,182
[no audible dialog]

716
00:39:56,504 --> 00:40:00,209
So, I hear you're working
on a movie, that's exciting.

717
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:02,111
What's it gonna be about?

718
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,147
Um, it's about...

719
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:06,949
I don't...
I don't really know.

720
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:09,785
I just started writing it,
so I haven't gotten that far.

721
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,988
You should ask me when
I'm further along.

722
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:14,857
Okay, so what's the premise?
Have you gotten that far yet?

723
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:19,395
It's about someone who
finds out they're going to die

724
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:22,198
and figuring out what to do
with the time they have left.

725
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,769
Like the...

726
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,404
you know,
<i>The Death Of Ivan Ilyich.</i>

727
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:29,939
Have you ever read that book?

728
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,273
I don't know.

729
00:40:31,307 --> 00:40:32,375
It's just an idea,
I could change it.

730
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,680
Yeah, I guess that could
be hard to write about.

731
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:41,917
[Dylan] Yeah, I mean,
it's just an idea.

732
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,154
Maybe you can take a look at it
when it's further along.

733
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:47,857
Yeah, I'd be happy
to take a look at it.

734
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:52,928
Maybe I'll make it
something happier.

735
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,297
Well, it's yours,

736
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,532
so you can make
whatever you want.

737
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:02,738
Yeah, I guess I'd make
something happier.

738
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,214
Thanks, Olivia.

739
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:15,017
Yeah, thanks for coming out.
Goodnight.

740
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,020
Oh, good luck too, I guess.

741
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,488
[Dylan] Thanks.

742
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,123
[car door opens]

743
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,226
[car door closes]

744
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:33,235
I look straight in the camera.

745
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:34,370
[Dylan] Yeah.

746
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,307
So, what was your reaction
when you first found out?

747
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:41,544
Well, I definitely cried.

748
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,879
Um, you called me on
the phone.

749
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:46,615
Can I refer to you as you?
That's okay?

750
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,653
Um, and I was at work
and I was tearing up

751
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,788
and I went to the stairwell

752
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:56,092
and one of my colleagues
caught me

753
00:41:56,125 --> 00:42:00,262
and it was like my first
or second week at the job,

754
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:02,031
and it looks like I was crying

755
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,700
because of work was really hard
and I was totally overwhelmed.

756
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,436
And then I had to
explain to this person,

757
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,340
the whole thing in, like,
five minutes to them,

758
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:14,944
that you are going to die

759
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:17,113
rather painfully and...

760
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:20,182
and, I mean,
sadly and soon,

761
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:23,719
and that I had
experience with it

762
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,255
and that was, uh,
very intense.

763
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,424
Um...

764
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:32,561
Yeah, I think, uh,
for a couple months,

765
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:35,197
maybe more than a couple
months there, I was, like,

766
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,266
it was probably, like,
the first or second thing

767
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:38,934
I thought about every morning.

768
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:41,504
And, um...

769
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:44,940
Yeah, now I'm more used to it.

770
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:47,276
I feel like, uh...

771
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:49,812
you're more used to it,
I'm more used to it,

772
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:52,314
and, um...

773
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:57,419
we'll just see where it goes,
I guess. I don't know.

774
00:42:57,453 --> 00:43:01,223
Otherwise, there's some optimism
around medicine right now,

775
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:03,859
but we'll also see about that.

776
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,437
[Dylan] Oh, shit.

777
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,039
You're still in my bed.

778
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,041
You serious?

779
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:22,711
Sure wish I could stay here
all day, though.

780
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,016
You can do what you want.

781
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:29,485
'Cause I'm a stay in
this comfy bed all day.

782
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:34,757
I'm gonna do it.

783
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:36,992
I'm gonna get up.

784
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,028
Mm-hm.

785
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:48,504
[Dylan]
This is really impressive.

786
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:50,539
I'll follow you in, say,
about like half an hour.

787
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:51,974
Come on.

788
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,043
Feel the morning air, huh?

789
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:56,779
Give that back,
you asshole. Ugh.

790
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,148
It's on the ground if
you want it, over here.

791
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,116
Fine. I'm up you bully.

792
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:03,485
You want to get
breakfast at Tony's?

793
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,321
I really could use some coffee.

794
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,123
No, I was just gonna stay here
and get some work done.

795
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:11,060
You don't have time for
a little food or just coffee?

796
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:15,064
No, I'm just gonna get started
on being responsible here.

797
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:18,100
Okay.

798
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,036
Um, suit yourself, I guess.

799
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,371
I'm working tonight.

800
00:44:22,404 --> 00:44:23,839
Do you want to hang out
later this week?

801
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:24,974
Yeah, I'll text you.

802
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,209
Okay.

803
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:30,079
I guess I'll head out then.

804
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:32,014
- Yeah, I'll see you.
- Okay, see you.

805
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,782
[door opens]

806
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,920
[door closes]

807
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:44,994
[man] But the Lord
came down to see the city

808
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:47,396
and the tower that the people
had begun to build.

809
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:49,633
And the Lord said...

810
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:57,239
if there's one people
speaking the same language,

811
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:59,074
they have begun to do this.

812
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:02,511
Then nothing that
they plan to do

813
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:04,013
will be impossible for them.

814
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:09,952
Come let us go down and
confuse their language

815
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:12,488
so that they may not
understand each other.

816
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:16,626
And so the Lord
scattered them

817
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,430
from there across
the entire Earth.

818
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:25,401
This is why
it is called Babel,

819
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:29,071
because there,
the Lord confused

820
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,440
the language of
the whole world.

821
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:38,615
Having fun yet?

822
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:41,483
It's not really my thing,
but it's interesting.

823
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:43,720
Hold on. I want you to
talk to this pastor.

824
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,555
Come on, man, it's not
a big deal. He's really cool.

825
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:53,128
Pastor Hammond, it's
good to see you again.

826
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:54,830
It's good to have
you here this week.

827
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:56,332
Thank you.

828
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:58,267
Uh, this is actually
my roommate, Dylan.

829
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,368
Pastor Hammond.

830
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:01,771
It's good to meet you.

831
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:03,673
Nice to meet you too.

832
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:07,142
Are you a, uh,
regular church goer, Dylan?

833
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,480
No, I'm not, uh, but
I enjoyed your sermon.

834
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:13,650
It was kind of
a weird start for me,

835
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:16,586
but I liked the way
you interpreted it.

836
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,987
So you're not
a member of the flock.

837
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:21,624
- No.
- Well...

838
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:23,258
it's good to
have you here, though.

839
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:26,261
And, uh,
you're welcome anytime.

840
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:29,465
And I'm always here if
you have any questions.

841
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,201
You know, I think
I do have one.

842
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:34,203
Um, have you read
<i>Don Quixot</i>?

843
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:36,872
- Yes.
- Okay.

844
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:38,407
So I want to know...

845
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:42,544
when does Don Quixote's
soul go to heaven?

846
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,081
When Alonzo regains his sanity
or when he dies?

847
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:49,184
When Alonzo dies.

848
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,354
There is only
one soul per person.

849
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,525
But one soul
can contain multitudes.

850
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,663
Okay. Actually have
a second question.

851
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:02,364
Is there a place around here
I can get ice cream?

852
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,034
Does gelato work?
'Cause there is

853
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:08,237
a nice little place
about two blocks down.

854
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:11,340
Perfect, thanks.

855
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,242
It was good seeing.
I'll see you next time.

856
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:14,309
Good to see you. Yeah.

857
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:25,622
Oh, hey, Lizzie.

858
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:27,724
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

859
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,925
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

860
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,193
Good, do you
mind if I join you?

861
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:33,596
Yeah, please,
sit down, yeah, yeah.

862
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,497
What are you up to today?

863
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,767
Um, I am actually writing
a grant proposal

864
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,669
for a performance piece.

865
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:40,703
- Cool.
- Yeah.

866
00:47:40,737 --> 00:47:42,004
Well, that's exciting.

867
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:43,606
Yeah, it's not the most fun,

868
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,240
so actually it's
good to see you.

869
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:47,075
Maybe you can distract me
for a minute.

870
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:48,410
Oh, please, my pleasure.

871
00:47:48,444 --> 00:47:50,512
What are you doing?
Just reading, or...

872
00:47:50,546 --> 00:47:51,714
[Lizzie] Just reading until
I have to go to work.

873
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:53,583
Typical day for me.

874
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:54,950
That sounds like
a nice day to me.

875
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:57,252
[Lizzie] Yeah, it's fun.

876
00:47:57,286 --> 00:48:00,355
Oh, I... I really am glad
I ran into you

877
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,459
'cause I was just thinking
how I should really

878
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:05,060
get to know you
a little better.

879
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:06,128
- So...
- Oh.

880
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:07,630
I was actually thinking earlier

881
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:10,633
about how I have to
try to get to know you

882
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,301
and all of Dylan's friends
better, so...

883
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:15,404
Yeah. I mean, just seems
like you've clearly

884
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:18,808
been doing a great job of
keeping him in a good mood.

885
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:22,411
Even with the test results and
everything he's been through,

886
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,413
- so...
- Uh, wait, what test?

887
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,448
Was he... Was he
studying for something?

888
00:48:26,482 --> 00:48:28,984
I feel like... I feel like
he never tells me anything.

889
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:32,354
You don't know?

890
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:37,559
I shouldn't be
talking about this, I...

891
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:39,629
Shit, I feel like
such an ass.

892
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:43,633
[Lizzie]
Um... I'm sorry, um...

893
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:47,336
I'm confused.
Is it something serious?

894
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:49,906
[Jessica] Um...

895
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:52,074
It's something I think
you should know about,

896
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:54,009
and I'm kind of
surprised you don't,

897
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,613
but I can't tell you.

898
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:58,648
You're going to have to
talk to him about it.

899
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:05,487
[knocking on door]

900
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:09,258
- Hi.
- Hi.

901
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,660
Dylan, I think we should talk.

902
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:13,997
Sure. Is something wrong?

903
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:16,666
Yeah, there is, but
I don't really know.

904
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,035
Um, I don't know
how to start this.

905
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:22,070
I don't really know
what's going on.

906
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,174
I don't really either, so
can you tell me something?

907
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,877
Yeah, I just spoke to Jessica

908
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,079
and she, uh, told me something
that she wasn't supposed to.

909
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:36,451
Something about you and a test
and now I'm pretty worried.

910
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:37,854
So what do you want to know?

911
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,823
I want to know about the test.
What is it?

912
00:49:40,857 --> 00:49:42,859
Is there something wrong
that you're not telling me?

913
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,494
I mean, there was something,
but I didn't want to tell you

914
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:46,863
'cause I didn't
want you to worry.

915
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:49,032
- Is it an STD?
- No, it's nothing like that.

916
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:50,967
It's just, I had
a medical test done.

917
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,037
It came back negative.
It doesn't affect you.

918
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:56,706
Dylan, that's not true.

919
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:57,874
Why are you lying to me?

920
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,742
Why is Jessica
telling you this?

921
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:01,310
I'm the one who should
be able to decide

922
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,145
who knows about my
own personal shit.

923
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:04,681
Why don't you want to tell me?

924
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:06,749
Why are we spending
all this time together?

925
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:08,517
What's the fucking point.

926
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,753
Look, it's just not something
you actually want to know, okay?

927
00:50:10,787 --> 00:50:12,689
You should be fucking happy
I didn't tell you.

928
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:14,724
Oh, yeah, it's so Goddamn
merciful of you to lie to me.

929
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:16,091
Maybe it is.

930
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:17,894
Dylan, is it serious?

931
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:26,069
Look, I don't want to do this.
I think you should just leave.

932
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:28,470
Dylan.

933
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:31,941
Just leave.

934
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:35,745
Okay.

935
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,118
[door closes]

936
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:45,320
I'm sorry.

937
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:48,925
I bet you probably wanted to
break it to her your own way

938
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,292
and I kind of ruined that.

939
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:52,629
I assumed that
she knew already.

940
00:50:52,662 --> 00:50:54,764
- Well, she didn't.
- I know.

941
00:50:55,832 --> 00:50:57,834
Did you talk it through,
though?

942
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,903
I mean, it's probably good
to have it out

943
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:03,773
and in the open for
your guys, right?

944
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:07,043
No, it's not good. I mean,
we talked about it, but...

945
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:12,314
I didn't want to tell her
so we broke up.

946
00:51:12,347 --> 00:51:13,448
I'm sorry.

947
00:51:16,518 --> 00:51:20,155
But wait, have you
still not told her yet?

948
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:21,724
Does she still not know?

949
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:23,059
No, she doesn't.

950
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:24,727
Dylan, why not?

951
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:28,163
You guys have been seeing
each other for almost a year.

952
00:51:28,196 --> 00:51:30,633
Why won't you tell her about it?

953
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,770
I guess I shouldn't judge
how you handle the situation.

954
00:51:33,803 --> 00:51:35,504
It's your issue to deal with,

955
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:38,708
but you are never going to have
a healthy relationship this way.

956
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:42,244
I mean, listen, Jessica,
I can decide for myself

957
00:51:42,277 --> 00:51:44,814
whether or not my relationships
are healthy enough.

958
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,983
I just want you to know
in the future,

959
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:50,019
if I'm seeing someone,
not to tell them.

960
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:54,489
I'm sorry, Dylan, but
that's a little fucked up.

961
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:56,125
Are you just gonna lie
to everyone you date?

962
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:58,594
- What is my alternative?
- I don't know.

963
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:00,163
You could try to make
the relationships work.

964
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:01,329
Oh, yeah, but do you know
what that means for them?

965
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:02,965
They have to wait it out.

966
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:05,300
They have to watch me die
slowly over the years.

967
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,536
But if they really cared,
they wouldn't leave.

968
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:09,005
They would stay.

969
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:12,108
I don't want
them to stay, okay?

970
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:15,078
I don't want anyone there
with me when I'm sick.

971
00:52:16,979 --> 00:52:18,014
I'll be dead anyways.

972
00:52:23,686 --> 00:52:24,887
Shouldn't you let her know

973
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:27,724
so she can decide
how to handle it?

974
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:30,292
I was thinking the other day,

975
00:52:30,325 --> 00:52:33,796
what if it was John that
had it instead of you,

976
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,801
whether I would stay and
I feel like the answer is yes.

977
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:40,970
That's really easy
for you to imagine,

978
00:52:41,003 --> 00:52:43,072
but you don't have to live it.

979
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:45,041
Shouldn't you let
whoever you're with

980
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:47,877
get to choose how
they react to it?

981
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,046
I mean,
right now it isn't fair

982
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,582
because you have all the power.

983
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:54,083
You haven't told her yet,

984
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:55,818
and... and you're just
planning on leaving her

985
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:57,720
in a couple of months
and she doesn't know.

986
00:52:57,754 --> 00:52:59,122
It isn't fair.

987
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,258
I mean, it would
make her miserable.

988
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,061
Yeah, at first.

989
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:09,899
But at least she'd
get to decide what to do.

990
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,071
There's no point
arguing over it.

991
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:19,142
I mean, it's over and
it's better this way.

992
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:21,010
[Jessica] Is it?

993
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,913
Yeah.
Long-term at least.

994
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:39,662
[sighs]

995
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:53,209
Hey, guys, thanks for
reading the script.

996
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:55,745
Yeah, about that.

997
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:59,215
The script, I don't
mean to be harsh,

998
00:53:59,248 --> 00:54:01,851
but there isn't really
a plot, you know?

999
00:54:02,985 --> 00:54:04,987
<i>And it's too happy</i>

1000
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:07,489
because you're dancing around
the subject matter.

1001
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,524
The script sucks.

1002
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:12,195
<i>I feel like you need a reason
for people to keep watching.</i>

1003
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:13,796
<i>You don't have one.</i>

1004
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,934
The main issue here is that
you don't really explain

1005
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:21,904
what's gonna happen to you,
so most of the time

1006
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:25,274
<i>we're sitting here, and you're
going through something</i>

1007
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:26,642
<i>really, really painful.</i>

1008
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:28,476
I understand that,

1009
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,779
but you don't help us
understand it.

1010
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:31,446
You don't show it.

1011
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:34,684
I mean, I don't really want
my movie to be that painful.

1012
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:37,119
I have my own reasons
for why I'm okay with it,

1013
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:39,989
and, like, that's what
I want people to understand.

1014
00:54:40,022 --> 00:54:42,692
I know, I know.
I know you're okay with it,

1015
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:47,096
but there are not really
any stakes in this.

1016
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:49,031
Your reasons aren't enough.

1017
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:51,834
I feel like you need
to have characters

1018
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:53,501
with their own reactions.

1019
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:57,106
You know, we all reacted to
this diagnosis differently.

1020
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:59,041
Yeah, but why would I want
to show those reactions

1021
00:54:59,075 --> 00:55:01,043
when they're, like,
universally depressing?

1022
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:02,812
Then why are you
making the movie?

1023
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,379
I mean, I don't...

1024
00:55:04,412 --> 00:55:06,115
look, I don't want the movie
to be like that, okay.

1025
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:07,583
I want it to be
something positive.

1026
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:10,019
It's tragic.

1027
00:55:10,052 --> 00:55:12,121
I don't want my movie
to be a tragedy.

1028
00:55:12,154 --> 00:55:14,223
But then why are you
making it about this?

1029
00:55:26,836 --> 00:55:28,403
- [Lucas] Hey, man.
- Hey, what's going on?

1030
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:30,606
Nothing much.

1031
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:36,078
You don't seem like
you're in the best mood.

1032
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:39,649
I'm not. I just had my first
feedback on the script.

1033
00:55:39,682 --> 00:55:42,385
Ah. And that went badly,
I take it, huh?

1034
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,619
Apparently, it's shit.

1035
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,656
Well, I mean, I read it
and I liked it.

1036
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,490
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1037
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:51,559
It's shit, I mean,
I need to write... re-write it.

1038
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,797
Okay, so then why is it shit?

1039
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:57,767
I don't know.

1040
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,336
I felt like I was being honest
about how it made me feel,

1041
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:02,405
but apparently,
that's not enough.

1042
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,741
I don't know, man.

1043
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,412
It's kind of weird to me that
you're even making this movie.

1044
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:11,113
Why?

1045
00:56:12,214 --> 00:56:13,816
'Cause you don't like to
talk about it.

1046
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,220
I mean, I don't like how it
makes other people feel.

1047
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:19,789
No, man, you don't like

1048
00:56:19,822 --> 00:56:22,124
how other people's feelings
about it make you feel.

1049
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:23,759
I mean, should I?

1050
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:26,362
It's not exactly the best
influence most of the time.

1051
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:27,964
You gotta talk about it.

1052
00:56:27,997 --> 00:56:30,299
I mean, you're just gonna
get locked in your own head.

1053
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,735
- You're gonna isolate yourself.
- Is that so bad?

1054
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:36,205
I mean, I understand it
better than anyone else does.

1055
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:39,108
Yeah, but the entire point of
this was so you could explain it.

1056
00:56:41,576 --> 00:56:42,878
I don't know.

1057
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:47,984
Look, I'm gonna go to bed.

1058
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:50,753
We could talk about this later.

1059
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:52,989
I'm going out of town
tomorrow, remember?

1060
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,791
I forgot, actually.

1061
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,895
You know you can call me
if you need anything.

1062
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:02,131
Don't worry about it.
I'll be... I'll be fine.

1063
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,004
You always say you're
gonna be fine, but...

1064
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:11,007
I'm not sure you are.

1065
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:13,809
No.

1066
00:57:15,711 --> 00:57:16,812
I'm okay.

1067
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,482
We can talk about this
when you get back.

1068
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:22,184
Goodnight.

1069
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:32,661
[water running]

1070
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:45,941
[film projector running]

1071
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:49,011
[♪]

1072
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:18,707
[♪]

1073
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:32,421
I'm here to audition for
the part of the mother.

1074
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:34,323
Okay, um...

1075
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,659
so do you, I don't know,

1076
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:40,096
have anyone in your
family that's ever had

1077
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:43,232
like a degenerative brain
disease or anything like that?

1078
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:48,370
Um... no, I don't think so.

1079
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:52,741
Okay, all right, well, we're
gonna have you try and shake,

1080
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:55,377
like someone who's
suffering from an illness.

1081
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:57,847
So if you just
give that a try.

1082
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,548
And the line is, uh,

1083
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,350
"Have you done your laundry?"

1084
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:02,918
Okay.

1085
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:08,757
Have you done your laundry?

1086
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,262
Okay, so yeah,
that's not quite right.

1087
00:59:13,295 --> 00:59:16,365
So, um, you know a lot
of like side to side.

1088
00:59:16,398 --> 00:59:19,702
So I want more,
like, more random,

1089
00:59:19,735 --> 00:59:22,805
every direction and
also your entire body.

1090
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:26,942
So, like, your... your legs and
your arms and everything.

1091
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:28,612
Okay, so if you can just
give that another shot.

1092
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,718
Have you done your laundry?

1093
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:42,491
It's still a...
a little bit off.

1094
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,460
So, um...

1095
00:59:44,493 --> 00:59:46,162
[sighs] Let's try this.

1096
00:59:46,195 --> 00:59:48,297
Can you take a look at my hand?

1097
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,032
Like tense it up?

1098
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:54,203
Just kind of like more random.

1099
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:11,420
[Emily]
Long time no see.

1100
01:00:11,453 --> 01:00:13,088
I was really surprised
when you called me.

1101
01:00:13,122 --> 01:00:15,424
Yeah, I mean,
Lucas is out of town

1102
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:17,159
and I've been feeling,
like, antsy.

1103
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,028
- I needed advice.
- Glad to help.

1104
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:21,931
- First off, how are you?
- I'm good.

1105
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:24,833
I am applying to grad school
in international law,

1106
01:00:24,867 --> 01:00:27,002
- so, yeah.
- Oh, really?

1107
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:28,270
Yeah, so I've just
been doing research

1108
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,673
for my application
papers and stuff.

1109
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:31,675
I didn't know you
were interested in that.

1110
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:34,710
It's perfect, you know,
I... I get to yell at people

1111
01:00:34,743 --> 01:00:36,345
all over the world
that I'm right.

1112
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:39,048
But what kind of
advice do you need?

1113
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,816
Has the test got you down?

1114
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,653
Kind of. I've been trying to
make a movie about it

1115
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:45,120
and it's not going that well.

1116
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:47,456
Well, it's like
a bleak movie.

1117
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:49,525
What's wrong with it?

1118
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,527
I guess I tried to
not make it that bleak.

1119
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:54,664
Oh, I don't know how you thought
you'd get away with that.

1120
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:58,367
This movie is going to have to
revel in the bleakness.

1121
01:00:59,768 --> 01:01:02,304
Yeah, I suppose so, but
that doesn't make it easy.

1122
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:05,541
Just being in that
emotional state.

1123
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,576
Yeah. Of course.

1124
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:10,879
It sounds hard, but it'll
be worth it, you know?

1125
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:13,382
I mean, why do you want to
make this movie anyways?

1126
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:18,254
It's your revenge
against your fate.

1127
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:21,056
You get to use movie
how you want to.

1128
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:23,759
You're gonna be
the one in control.

1129
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:26,996
Yeah, well, not entirely.

1130
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:29,398
I mean other people are
gonna get some say in it.

1131
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:31,635
Yeah, but you get
the most say.

1132
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,404
Fuck, I got so much
to re-write.

1133
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:38,207
Do you want to be in the movie?

1134
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,209
I can't really afford actors.

1135
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,411
Sure, it'll be fun.

1136
01:01:42,444 --> 01:01:44,614
But don't write anything
nasty about me, okay?

1137
01:01:44,648 --> 01:01:47,082
I'm really just
a big softie at heart.

1138
01:01:47,116 --> 01:01:48,183
I know.

1139
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:50,886
Good.

1140
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:52,955
[laughs]

1141
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:57,627
[paper crinkling]

1142
01:02:19,749 --> 01:02:21,884
[Dylan] So what was your reaction
when you first found out?

1143
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,388
Um, well, different from
the movie,

1144
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:29,558
I had come out to see you
back in Chicago.

1145
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:32,662
But, um, we spent
the weekend together.

1146
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:34,330
I had to leave to
go back to work

1147
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:36,465
the morning you got
the results.

1148
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:39,101
And so I remember,
um, you know,

1149
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,569
driving around with you,

1150
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:44,340
spending time thinking
about these two futures

1151
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:48,444
where, you know, you were
gonna cast aside something,

1152
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:52,582
but you were largely at peace
with... with either outcome.

1153
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:57,620
And then, uh, it... it sort of
left and I had to go.

1154
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:00,690
And, uh, later that afternoon,
you know,

1155
01:03:00,724 --> 01:03:02,191
back in my office in New York,

1156
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:07,196
you called and
you said you had it.

1157
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:09,865
And I, you know, I...

1158
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:12,635
I honestly expected
that you would have it.

1159
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:15,437
Not necessarily
optimistic in that regard,

1160
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:18,641
but I... I, you know,

1161
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:21,210
it was difficult for me
to think that perhaps

1162
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:23,713
there was a kind outcome
where you didn't.

1163
01:03:24,246 --> 01:03:29,017
Um, I remember really...

1164
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:32,154
just a surreal feeling,
kind of floating through,

1165
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:34,323
uh, the rest of my day
at work.

1166
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,525
And then back home
to my apartment

1167
01:03:36,558 --> 01:03:39,395
uh, where the rest of us
were gonna assemble,

1168
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:43,600
and I was gonna tell them
this terrible news.

1169
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:48,671
Um... it you know, really...

1170
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:51,306
I found it more difficult
than I was expecting

1171
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,975
to share that with them,

1172
01:03:53,008 --> 01:03:56,178
and also it's not something
that there's, uh, you know,

1173
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,514
really much that can be done.

1174
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:03,552
You, um... you know, you wait,
but as I've waited,

1175
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,487
I do find myself looking at you

1176
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:07,423
and sort of looking
at our time together

1177
01:04:07,456 --> 01:04:09,558
and seeing little ticks.

1178
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:12,695
Uh, some, you know,
little movements or triggers

1179
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:15,732
or forgetfulness that without

1180
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:18,567
kind of the vocabulary
of the disease,

1181
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,604
I would just excuse away as...
as Dylan being Dylan.

1182
01:04:21,638 --> 01:04:23,105
But now it's...
it's always,

1183
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:27,009
well, what if this is
the start of something?

1184
01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:30,680
- [woman] Hi.
- [Dylan] Hi.

1185
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:32,615
I'm Ellie.

1186
01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:34,717
I'm here to audition for
the part of the mother.

1187
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:36,351
Well, for this role,

1188
01:04:36,385 --> 01:04:39,188
you're gonna have to play
somebody who's got tremors.

1189
01:04:39,221 --> 01:04:40,690
You're gonna have
to try shaking.

1190
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:45,093
So, um, just give it a shot,
uh, and the line is,

1191
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:46,763
"Have you done your laundry?"

1192
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:48,665
Okay.

1193
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:08,618
Ha... Have you done
your laundry?

1194
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:14,356
Yeah that's...
that's... that's good.

1195
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:18,360
Okay. Thanks.

1196
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,869
[footsteps approaching]

1197
01:05:27,035 --> 01:05:29,238
[Lucas]
Hey. You miss me?

1198
01:05:29,271 --> 01:05:31,273
I did.
How was your business trip?

1199
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,809
It was actually really good.

1200
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,644
And I do have some news.

1201
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:36,846
They're trying to get more
people out at that new office

1202
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,413
and I think they
want to send me.

1203
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,684
Well, congrats,
Mr. Fancy Businessman.

1204
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:44,787
Thank you. I mean, it's not
set in stone, but, you know.

1205
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,756
I might get an offer
in a few months.

1206
01:05:47,556 --> 01:05:49,258
That mean you'd have to
move out there?

1207
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:52,662
Well, yeah, I mean,
it is a big promotion.

1208
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,231
Well, congrats.

1209
01:05:58,635 --> 01:05:59,969
Thanks.

1210
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:01,604
So how have things
been here without me?

1211
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:03,606
They've been good.
I've just, uh...

1212
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,807
I've been getting
some shooting done.

1213
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:05,942
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1214
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:07,509
That's amazing.

1215
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:21,189
[steady tone]

1216
01:06:29,264 --> 01:06:31,300
[utensils scraping]

1217
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:36,806
You okay man?

1218
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:39,742
You've been staring off into
space for like five minutes.

1219
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,277
[Dylan] Yeah, I'm okay.

1220
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,881
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1221
01:07:07,971 --> 01:07:10,807
No. I'm not okay.

1222
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:15,577
You don't have to be.

1223
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:24,486
You're gonna be okay.

1224
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,488
It'll be okay.

1225
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:28,858
I've been editing it.

1226
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,127
I don't think I should be
looking at it.

1227
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,768
You're doing this for a reason.

1228
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,873
I need a fucking smoke.

1229
01:08:00,023 --> 01:08:03,026
You know, the furies have
really crawled up my ass.

1230
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:08,865
I don't think they're
gonna forgiven me.

1231
01:08:09,531 --> 01:08:11,034
[Lucas] What do you
need to be forgiven for?

1232
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,141
I hated her.

1233
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:21,844
I hated looking at her.

1234
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:28,618
You know, I always
imagined she was dead.

1235
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:29,986
But what if she wasn't?

1236
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:33,188
What if she was
in there somewhere and...

1237
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:35,692
knew how much I hated her?

1238
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:40,596
You were just a kid. You can't
blame yourself for that.

1239
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,031
Yeah, I don't think
they care about that.

1240
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:43,166
Who?

1241
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,500
The furies.

1242
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:48,203
Man, that's not real.

1243
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:02,417
[indistinct chatter]

1244
01:09:04,654 --> 01:09:06,723
Well, hello there, sir.

1245
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:08,323
Hi.

1246
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:12,028
I think we have seen you here
one other time maybe?

1247
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:13,361
Yeah, last time I was here,

1248
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:15,031
you said that I could
always come around

1249
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:17,633
if I needed to talk and I
thought I'd take you up on that.

1250
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,870
So you're thinking of
joining the flock then?

1251
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:24,607
No, no, I'm not.
I should be honest about that.

1252
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:26,308
Um, no, but I heard

1253
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:29,779
a pastor always has
a friendly ear

1254
01:09:30,245 --> 01:09:31,480
for people who need it,

1255
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:33,082
and I feel like
I need it right now.

1256
01:09:33,116 --> 01:09:34,382
Well, yes.

1257
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:36,819
Sort of comes with
the job, you know.

1258
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:41,224
We always like to keep a
door open for those in need.

1259
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:45,762
So, what is it exactly you
feel you need to talk about?

1260
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:48,998
Um, so I have
a genetic disease.

1261
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,900
That means that I'm
going to die young.

1262
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:57,305
Oh, well, cut right to
the chase, huh?

1263
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:01,576
I'm sorry to hear that.

1264
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:04,914
So how long do you have?

1265
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:09,118
About 10 years before
the symptoms start kicking in

1266
01:10:09,152 --> 01:10:11,921
and a few years after that,
but not pleasant ones.

1267
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:15,224
Well, 10 years is good.

1268
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:17,260
And, you know,

1269
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:20,529
the time that
you've been given is a gift.

1270
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:24,133
So, have you...
I mean,

1271
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:28,204
have you come here to
ask me what it's all about,

1272
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:31,540
and why it is that you
have to suffer through this?

1273
01:10:31,573 --> 01:10:33,075
Honestly,

1274
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:34,944
I just wanted to see how
a stranger would take it.

1275
01:10:36,411 --> 01:10:38,547
Do you believe me
if I told you that

1276
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:39,849
I'm happy most days?

1277
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,052
Yes.
I would believe that.

1278
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:45,655
I mean...

1279
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,925
if you're blessed
with a love of life

1280
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:50,626
and the people around you,

1281
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,062
there's no reason why
you can't be happy

1282
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:54,964
right up through
the moment of the end.

1283
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:57,967
Okay, glad to hear that.

1284
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:01,637
But I have a second problem.

1285
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,072
Say I was seeing someone

1286
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:07,342
and I refused to tell them
about the disease,

1287
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:12,148
and they found out anyways
and we broke up.

1288
01:11:13,548 --> 01:11:15,284
I guess I just wanted to know

1289
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,086
if it was wrong of me
to deceive her.

1290
01:11:18,855 --> 01:11:21,924
Yes, I would say so.

1291
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,028
Yeah, and you know,
frankly, I...

1292
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:29,699
I don't think you'd be standing
here asking me this question

1293
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:32,268
if you didn't already
know the answer.

1294
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:34,369
Yeah, I guess
I had an inkling.

1295
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:36,672
It's just hard,

1296
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:40,009
'cause, you know,
telling her would really hurt.

1297
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:44,013
And I didn't think
it was gonna last anyways.

1298
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:50,019
Well, you just said
it would be 10 years, right?

1299
01:11:50,052 --> 01:11:51,120
[Dylan] Yes.

1300
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:55,024
And so are they
trying to find a cure?

1301
01:11:55,057 --> 01:11:56,125
Of course.

1302
01:11:57,093 --> 01:11:59,362
Well, then, you don't know
that it won't last.

1303
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,332
You can hope for a miracle,

1304
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:06,068
and... and better than
most people,

1305
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:09,372
you can believe that your
prayers will be answered.

1306
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:14,143
I honestly haven't thought
about the cure very much.

1307
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:16,478
Really?
That's kind of bizarre to me.

1308
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:19,481
I mean, I would think that
a person in your situation

1309
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:21,984
would be obsessed with the cure.

1310
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,255
It brings back uncertainty.

1311
01:12:27,023 --> 01:12:28,891
I liked knowing
what was gonna happen.

1312
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:33,329
Even if what's going to happen
is horrible?

1313
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,600
Yeah, I guess so.

1314
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:43,172
Well, I... I would recommend
that you tell her

1315
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,841
and that you pray for a cure.

1316
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:52,415
But you're gonna do
the thing that you feel

1317
01:12:52,447 --> 01:12:54,817
is the right thing
for you, I'm sure.

1318
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,420
Yeah.

1319
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,156
I guess you have a point.

1320
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:04,093
Thanks for talking to
an atheist like me.

1321
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:07,529
I got some things I gotta do.

1322
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,201
Of course.

1323
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,805
You're in my prayers.

1324
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:26,315
Hey, Lizzie.

1325
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:29,085
Yeah, I know you're not probably
very happy with me right now,

1326
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:31,654
but I felt like we could talk.

1327
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:34,223
Yeah, I thought...

1328
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:36,459
wanted to tell you
the truth about the test.

1329
01:13:39,494 --> 01:13:40,863
Yeah, could you come over?

1330
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:44,700
Okay.

1331
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:57,013
[knocking on door]

1332
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:08,891
- Hi.
- Hi.

1333
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,595
It's been a while.
Are you doing okay?

1334
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:14,296
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

1335
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,165
First off, I just
want to say I'm sorry.

1336
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,468
I've been thinking about
how we left things

1337
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:22,171
and I feel like I should've
been more honest with you.

1338
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:25,674
Come on, I got something
I want to show you.

1339
01:14:36,318 --> 01:14:37,386
Is this part of your movie?

1340
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:39,855
Yeah.

1341
01:14:40,656 --> 01:14:42,191
That's supposed to be my mom.

1342
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:45,294
She had Huntington's disease.

1343
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,400
Is that you?

1344
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:53,369
Yeah.

1345
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,905
I always hated looking at her.

1346
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,209
And the test?

1347
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:01,477
I have it, too.

1348
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,780
In 10 years, I'll start
showing symptoms.

1349
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:09,285
I'll lose muscle control and
become manic and obsessive.

1350
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,822
Is there a treatment?

1351
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:13,923
No.

1352
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:16,826
Are they looking?

1353
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,895
Of course, I mean,
no one wants this to exist.

1354
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:24,767
This is kinda messed up.

1355
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,136
I said I wanted to know, I...

1356
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,639
I guess I got what I wanted.
I was afraid.

1357
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:32,608
I was right to be.

1358
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,192
I'm sorry.

1359
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:55,297
I was planning on
breaking it off with you

1360
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:56,632
so you'd never have to know.

1361
01:15:58,602 --> 01:16:00,469
You were planning to do that?

1362
01:16:00,503 --> 01:16:01,605
Yeah.

1363
01:16:03,506 --> 01:16:04,940
That's kind of fucked up.

1364
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:09,712
You just knew that whole time
you were...

1365
01:16:10,513 --> 01:16:12,314
planning to throw me away.

1366
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:26,862
Yeah, I don't know what
else I'm supposed to do.

1367
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:30,666
I can't have kids because
I could pass it on to them.

1368
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:34,803
And I don't want to get married
because I don't want anyone

1369
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:38,073
feeling like they have to
be there with me

1370
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:41,343
after the point where
I'm already gone.

1371
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:44,346
I don't understand then.

1372
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:47,483
Why am I here?

1373
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:50,219
You could have just
let it end with us.

1374
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:54,624
Because I wanted you
to understand

1375
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:57,826
that I never wanted to
fall in love with anyone

1376
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:01,598
because I would be ashamed
if they...

1377
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,202
felt like they
had to stay with me.

1378
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:09,705
I don't want anyone there
with me when I'm sick.

1379
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:10,839
I just...

1380
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,576
I want to be alone.

1381
01:17:16,045 --> 01:17:17,780
I mean,
I'll be dead anyways.

1382
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:25,955
I don't think I would want
to watch it happen either.

1383
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:29,058
I think it would get to me.

1384
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,096
Like it would make my skin crawl
every time I looked at you.

1385
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:42,538
I think that's how I felt
every time I looked at my mom.

1386
01:17:56,686 --> 01:17:58,287
[Lizzie] What do you
want to do now?

1387
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:01,390
I don't know.

1388
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:04,393
I could be with you longer.

1389
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:06,929
But still,

1390
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,432
at some point
we'd have to split.

1391
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,936
Yeah, barring a miracle.

1392
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,806
It's confusing.

1393
01:18:21,645 --> 01:18:23,412
I don't think
I believe in miracles.

1394
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:41,463
- So what do you want?
- I don't know.

1395
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:47,269
You know, I normally take
the time in a relationship

1396
01:18:47,303 --> 01:18:48,937
when, um...

1397
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:50,973
you know you're not gonna have
kids with someone as the...

1398
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:54,109
as a point to break it off.

1399
01:18:56,078 --> 01:18:58,414
You know, if you're not gonna
get married, then...

1400
01:18:58,447 --> 01:18:59,783
what's the point?

1401
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:02,652
You're just...
wasting each other's time.

1402
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:06,955
I mean,
I can understand that,

1403
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:09,892
but I just don't get to
feel that way anymore.

1404
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,630
You know, when
my dad was sick,

1405
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:18,133
um, I had to take care of
him sometimes, you know?

1406
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:23,872
And he looked so weak.

1407
01:19:25,809 --> 01:19:27,176
But he was still himself.

1408
01:19:29,813 --> 01:19:31,947
He could still crack jokes,

1409
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,482
and make us all feel better.

1410
01:19:35,384 --> 01:19:36,485
He was still himself.

1411
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:41,691
Yeah, but I won't be.

1412
01:19:45,829 --> 01:19:47,396
[Lizzie] I don't...

1413
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:50,834
I don't think I can stand to
watch that.

1414
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:53,335
You don't have to.

1415
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:55,437
I know.

1416
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:02,044
And I'm sorry, though.

1417
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,518
I'm really sorry.

1418
01:20:10,687 --> 01:20:11,954
It's okay.

1419
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:22,030
You know, it's not like we
were about to get married.

1420
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:24,801
No, we weren't.

1421
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:30,640
Sorry.

1422
01:20:37,446 --> 01:20:40,048
I understand why you
didn't want to tell me.

1423
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:41,150
Are you glad I did?

1424
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:46,922
Yeah, I guess.

1425
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:49,793
Good.

1426
01:20:59,736 --> 01:21:02,938
Um... I don't...

1427
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:05,073
the way I feel about it now

1428
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:07,042
I don't think is
appreciably different

1429
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,679
than how I felt about it then.

1430
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:13,115
I've... written...

1431
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:16,118
I've written all these
e... emails

1432
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:21,156
that sort of don't get sent.

1433
01:21:21,758 --> 01:21:23,693
They don't...

1434
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:28,263
uh, they can't
account for, uh...

1435
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:31,033
this thing and...

1436
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:34,771
and... and they don't adequately
take stock of our relationship.

1437
01:21:34,804 --> 01:21:38,741
I... I just... I haven't...
I haven't sent any of them.

1438
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:43,545
I don't feel as if
I'm better equipped, um,

1439
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:48,083
to answer this question,
uh, in front of, uh, a camera

1440
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:51,855
than I am sort of by myself
in a room at my computer.

1441
01:21:52,755 --> 01:21:58,661
And then I think
part of it is...

1442
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:01,731
sick... sick looks like
something.

1443
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:06,836
Uh, your ma... your...
I remember your mom,

1444
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,472
and your mom was sick
and your mom looked sick,

1445
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:12,675
and I never knew your mom
any other way.

1446
01:22:13,843 --> 01:22:16,078
Uh, and...

1447
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,250
you don't look sick now,

1448
01:22:21,951 --> 01:22:23,018
and...

1449
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,320
you don't look sick now,

1450
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:32,327
but, uh, have the same thing
your mother did.

1451
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:35,765
So I haven't been able
to sort of reconcile,

1452
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,134
uh, moving in that direction,

1453
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,803
given that your mom

1454
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:44,239
didn't look any other way
and was sick.

1455
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:47,677
So, um, uh...

1456
01:22:52,214 --> 01:22:56,485
at the end of the day,
you know,

1457
01:22:56,518 --> 01:23:00,289
it's pretty hard to
intellectualize it

1458
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:02,558
and... and say
how I feel about it.

1459
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:07,162
Um, but again, at the end
of the day, I just...

1460
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,699
I don't want my friend to die.

1461
01:23:18,675 --> 01:23:20,208
[Dylan] Reset.

1462
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:22,712
One second, I'm gonna get you
to do a couple more.

1463
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:24,781
Fuck.

1464
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:34,924
I don't know if
I could do that again.

1465
01:23:50,974 --> 01:23:52,742
I can't...
I can't do that again.

1466
01:23:53,977 --> 01:23:55,778
[Dylan] All right,
get up, that's fine.

1467
01:23:55,812 --> 01:23:57,412
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1468
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:00,817
I'm okay. Fuck.

1469
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:04,921
I'm sorry, I wish I could
do another take for you.

1470
01:24:04,954 --> 01:24:06,856
I can't do that.

1471
01:24:06,889 --> 01:24:07,957
That's okay.

1472
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:11,493
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1473
01:24:15,798 --> 01:24:17,967
[Dylan] Just put your heads down
and don't look at the camera.

1474
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:20,036
[man] You guys can...
Sorry, you can come back towards me a bit.

1475
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:23,438
Okay, that was a little much.
Keep going, keep coming.

1476
01:24:23,472 --> 01:24:24,974
Right about there.
That's great.

1477
01:24:25,008 --> 01:24:27,409
[boy] You mean this way?
Or which way?

1478
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,311
- Okay, so both of you...
- [woman] So you're gonna

1479
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:30,913
turn back the way you were.

1480
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:32,749
[Dylan] And put your head
on top of her shoulder.

1481
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:34,249
[woman]
And then... Yeah.

1482
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:36,119
[Dylan] And you lift
your head up a little bit.
