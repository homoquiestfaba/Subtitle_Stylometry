1
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,636
Please.
Thank you.

2
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,064
- You like this? - A lot.
- It's beautiful. - Yes, Yes.

3
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,693
Look, love, it's late.
My uncles are coming. Come on.

4
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,279
Yes, but what if they don't like me,
what will we do?

5
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,408
- Love, but what do you care?
- Be... - You are so beautiful!

6
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,327
You just have to be yourself.
Don't worry.

7
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,541
They are important people. Maybe a little 
harsh, but not put off.

8
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,085
They are nice.

9
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,296
Next week I will be working in their company.

10
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,174
I do not want to say or do things that could compromise...

11
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,301
.. this wonderful opportunity that they offer.

12
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,973
- You will do nicely. Trust me. 
Will I? - Of course.

13
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,226
Listen, what I was saying
on the train...

14
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,478
Yes, I will probably miss
Pordenone,...

15
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,231
.. But it is a job that I cannot refuse.

16
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,234
Do you realize!
If all goes well, we will live in Rome.

17
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,612
We will meet wonderful people.
We will have children.

18
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:32,492
And maybe one day we will have a
villa with servants, like my uncles.

19
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,494
Yes, but I have to go to the hairdresser.

20
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,123
I look like a schoolhouse teacher
with this hair.

21
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,585
- I should be a little 'more chic.
- It 's late. You have to go now?

22
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,005
- It'll only take a moment. I'll be quick.
- I would not make them wait...

23
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,092
- Okay. Hurry though, eh?
- Okay.

24
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,020
- Goodbye.
- Hurry up, eh.

25
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,515
I'm sorry,
the hairdresser is full.

26
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,143
- There is no one else around here?
- Sure.

27
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,022
You leave the building, go right,
second left,...

28
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,775
.. Pass under an arch,
immediately to the right, there is a bridge.

29
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,987
After the bridge, the first
left, straight ahead.

30
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,032
- It is on the right.
- Thank you.

31
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,781
This honey is from the square in Rome,
right in the middle.

32
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:22,287
Two euros! But it is good! Oh!
Come on, finish your breakfast. Thank you.

33
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,873
You have to eat. Camilla where is it?

34
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,543
Did you see?
Do you know why there's all this unemployment?

35
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,048
Because people are spoiled
by the latest technologies.

36
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,927
- What movie? - It is too late!
- Mangia! Always late!

37
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,284
I think the world will end now that all
the planet speaks Chinese. 

38
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,953
- Who wants your opinion!
- I'm telling you.

39
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,915
They don't give a damn about anyone
or what we think.

40
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,835
- We just have to pay taxes.
- We pay taxes, right.

41
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,213
Look who it is.

42
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,967
 Where were you when I was in the elevator
stuck for two hours?

43
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,096
Being young and unmarried...
Or, at least, one of the two.

44
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,098
- Did you see when she did that?
- Beautiful!

45
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,727
- Don't believe it. - Why?
- The weekend is on his mind.

46
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,064
But when?
Always.

47
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,317
- If you want my opinion...
- Again?! - Can I say something?!

48
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,486
I think...

49
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,365
- It was a romantic movie, very interesting. 
- I did not understand anything.

50
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,951
It's a most beautiful story of "The King's Speech."

51
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,829
- It was most beautiful.
- What do you mean? - I do not understand.

52
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,748
- What was intended by the author.
- Why?! - Not at all wanted!

53
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,210
- The incomprehensibility of life...
- Let's eat?

54
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,379
- Do you see that...
- Yes.

55
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,465
- If I had to vote for an Oscar,
I'd have doubts. - But you do not vote...

56
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,260
- Who is it? Maria! - I want to see.
- If I had to vote...

57
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,641
I can't see who it is,
but I think it's Brad Pitt.

58
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,854
"This week we are
interviewing Tony Blair,...

59
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,275
... the winner of Miss Universe,
and Johnny Depp."

60
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,745
Excuse me... Excuse me, can you tell me where is
this address?

61
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,874
Er... Er... Ah, yes... ah, yes...

62
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,710
Take the first right.

63
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:07,131
Go a hundred meters.
You will find an ice cream parlor.

64
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:15,098
Then go straight for 50 meters
when there go left.

65
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,141
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

66
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,281
At the next traffic light crossing...

67
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,410
There is a seafood restaurant,
you cannot go wrong.

68
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:41,416
It is straight on, turn right, then again
100 meters and turn right again.

69
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,421
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you. - Your welcome.

70
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,103
- Congratulations. - Yes?
- I have a super gift for you.

71
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,607
- What gift?
 -A special gift for a special man.

72
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,818
- What is this special gift?
- It's Me!

73
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,613
I'm already all paid for.
I'm all yours, all yours.

74
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,491
- Look, there must be a mistake.
- You can do whatever you like.

75
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,495
- Ah, yes? Please, go away.
- I cannot. You're upset.

76
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,084
- Who...?!
- They told me that you're stressed and
you'd be surprised.

77
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,630
- But you are the lucky winner.
- Winner of what?!

78
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,382
- The winner of the contest.
- But what contest?

79
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:23,137
Domi and Fabio have paid me and told me
to congratulate you.

80
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,640
That they were wrong and that you need
to accept their apologies.

81
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:31,354
- These two gentlemen I do not know them.
Will you leave?
- I will not tell.

82
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,649
I am here to fulfill your dreams.

83
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,652
Please, Miss. Leave!

84
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,905
But you're Mr. Debroca,
room 504.

85
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,783
I'm not Mr. Debroca
but the room is right.

86
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,787
- Please, leave now...
- Is anyone there?

87
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:54,001
- Sorry, sorry.
- I told you to wait.

88
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,880
No, it's not like you think.
Have a seat, please.

89
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,133
We were to meet at noon, the door was open...

90
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:06,639
- So you do not enter without knocking!
- Nice way to meet your wife!

91
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,684
- This is not my wife.
- No!

92
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,812
I hope you're joking.

93
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,525
Of course I'm kidding.
She's my wife.

94
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,903
I am Uncle Paul.

95
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,156
Giovanna.

96
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,450
Uncle Sal.

97
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,911
Aunt Rita.

98
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,663
Anna.

99
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,918
- Anna! But isn't your name Milly?
- Milly?...

100
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,964
Milly, of course, Milly.
Anna is the second name.

101
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,216
- Milly!
- Milly.

102
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,304
We will be waiting downstairs,
don't worry. Come on.

103
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,932
- Paul... - Yes
- Yes, yes. - See you later.

104
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,983
I want to die! My life is over!
I am ruined!

105
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,986
Tell them the truth,
that there was a mistake.

106
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,490
But how?! They've seen us
on the bed! I am in my underwear...

107
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:12,246
They won't understand... What they'll think...
I'll never convince them, it's useless.

108
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:17,585
They will think I called an escort.
Why did you jump on me?

109
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,629
I was paid to make love with Mr.
Debroca.

110
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,717
- And leave the door open! - Yes
- Are you an idiot? - I thought it was closed.

111
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,513
They're the kind of people who think
they are in charge of everything.

112
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,017
Milly's coming.
We have to get out of here.

113
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,644
You have to pretend to be my wife.

114
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,774
I pretend to be your wife?
I'm no actress. Plus...

115
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,527
-You just called me an "idiot".
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

116
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:49,033
I need your help because if
Milly comes, I'll jump out the window.

117
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,912
- Do you not understand that sooner or later
they'll discover everything? 

118
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,748
I need time,
then I'll think of something.

119
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,793
It is important that we leave immediately
and get away.

120
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:21,049
What's the matter?! Are you crazy!
Go! You have the wrong person!

121
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,012
Sofia! Sofia!

122
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,682
- Sofia! Whats happening?!
- What do you want?!

123
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,776
Call the police!
Go away! I am serious!

124
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:44,156
I'm going to work!
I have to go to work! These people are crazy!

125
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,075
- What is this car?!
-You'll be late for the studio. 
126
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:52,581
- But I'm late for work!
- Get in, Get in.

127
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,167
Sofia... come with me.

128
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,852
Hello and welcome to TG3.

129
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:19,107
Today we have a special guest:
Leopoldo Pisanello.

130
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,445
- Welcome, Mr. Pisanello.
Welcome to TG3. - Thank you, yes...

131
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,740
Excuse me, but why am I here?

132
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,869
To answer our questions,
for our interview.

133
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,872
- What did you have for breakfast?
- Me?

134
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:40,087
Er... coffee latte and two slices of bread with butter and jam.

135
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,131
Two slices of bread... And how was it?

136
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,884
Good... toasted.

137
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,888
- Ah, so you prefer toast.
- Yes, that's right, yes.

138
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,766
Why? Can I ask you?

139
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:58,897
I don't know. I just like it.
I usually prefer the toast.

140
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,776
- White or whole wheat?
- White.

141
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,237
So we can say without a shadow of a doubt...

142
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,283
.. Leopold Pisanello prefers two slices of bread toasted.

143
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,622
Yes, and a latte... without sugar.

144
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:20,294
Do you shave before or after breakfast? 

145
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,179
- Extraordinary!
- Me?

146
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,265
Me?

147
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,525
Still here! Enough! Go! Sofia!

148
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,069
Sofia! Go away!

149
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,158
Leopoldo! You were great!

150
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,912
- The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
- Yes, but...

151
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,706
They want you on tomorrow's news at 20:00.

152
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,043
- What are you saying! Me? But why?
- You're famous!

153
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:31,174
- Mariangela, open the bottle and pour him a drink.
- I'm going to open it.

154
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,178
- Meanwhile you sit down.
- Ok. - Be right back. - Yes

155
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,318
- You have arrived! Well! - Hello.
- Taste my specialties.

156
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,810
Please.

157
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:36,740
(Giancarlo) # The time has fled... #

158
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:45,082
(Giancarlo) # And I die in despair! #

159
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:53,965
# And I die in despair! #

160
00:34:54,884 --> 00:35:05,769
# And I've never loved life so much!#

161
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,461
- What's the name of the hotel?
- I can't remember.

162
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:24,592
- It's in the center? - Yes, more or less.
It was... was red...

163
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,102
We're here. Sorry for the delay.
We have been waiting for you.

164
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,230
Er... yes... uh...

165
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:45,363
You couldn't find
something more simple?

166
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,700
We need to meet people rather important.

167
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,745
- We like you dressed like that.
- Like how?

168
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,622
But some of our friends
may not understand.

169
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,752
- I lost my suitcase on the train,
- Then that's it. Oh, well.

170
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,882
Well, we have organized a trip,
a private Vatican tour.

171
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:09,012
- Beautiful. True love? - Yes,
I know him well. - Come on, then.

172
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:14,017
- I hope they let us in.
- I don't want to go in!

173
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:18,980
- Miss... are you okay?
- Yes, yes, thank you.

174
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,901
Thanks, but...

175
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:27,989
Oh, but... but... but you are...
But you are Pia Fusari?

176
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,494
You recognized me?

177
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:38,041
Yes, but you... Oh, my God, but you
are one of my favorite actresses!

178
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,543
I'm flattered.

179
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,549
But you walk down the street here
like a normal person?

180
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,761
We're making a movie here.

181
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,183
- You want to come and see?
- Me?!

182
00:39:55,267 --> 00:40:00,313
Yes!

183
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,317
But that is Juliet Falcone!

184
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:11,408
No! There is Luca Jump! I love
Luke Salta, he is so charismatic!

185
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,451
No, I do not believe it!

186
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,540
It 's amazing. He painted the ceiling
lying on scaffolding.

187
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:23,837
Working all the time 
lying on your back! I can't imagine!

188
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,714
I do, perfectly.

189
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,318
Please sit down, Mr. Pisanello.

190
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,823
- This will be your new office.
- My new office!

191
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,826
.. but I'm not an employee.

192
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,829
Very funny.

193
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:32,460
Serafina, come. Look. We have 
a famous person in our company.

194
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,963
- Good morning. - Take care of him,
Give him everything he needs.

195
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,967
- All day.
- With pleasure. - Thank you.

196
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,470
- You will take care of me
all day? - Yes

197
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,808
- Whatever you need,
I'm here. - Yes

198
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:58,444
Calm down.

199
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:03,366
- How was your day?
- My day? - Yes

200
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,868
It's been good.

201
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:10,373
Oh, I did spill coffee on some documents, 
but I avoided spilling all of it.

202
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,625
The rest of the day went good.

203
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,462
Did you hear that? Mr. Pisanello
happened to spill his coffee.

204
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:21,509
But his reflexes
avoided a tragedy...

205
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,345
.. with no probable loss of human lives.

206
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,389
Why did he spill the coffee?

207
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,892
It will be on the news at 21:00, 
with our distinguished guests...

208
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:34,480
.. the leaders of Italy,
the ambassador of Brazil and the UN.

209
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,733
Mr. Pisanello...a statement.

210
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,901
- A statement!
- Yes, a statement.

211
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:45,116
- A statement... so?
- Tell us anything. - So?

212
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,412
I think... I think... Ah, maybe it's going to raining.

213
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,790
You heard it. Pisanello
Leopold says it could rain.

214
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,251
Can you tell us how you will sleep tonight?

215
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,380
Normally I sleep on my back.

216
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,175
Leopoldo Pisanello says
he sleeps on his back.

217
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,178
You never sleep on your stomach?

218
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,932
No, I suffer a bit 'of gastritis.
Not a serious thing...

219
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,518
- On my belly I don't like like it that much...
- How much?

220
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,814
- Enough! Please! Stop it!
- It 's important! - Enough!

221
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,776
Enough! Go!

222
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,404
What do you want from me?! How to sleep...

223
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:29,202
What do you think? I only have these printed dresses.

224
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,955
I have to buy something now that you're so famous.

225
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,834
Sofia, I'm tired, I have a headache.
Forget it.

226
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,421
I had a terrible day.
Let's not go to the premiere of the film.

227
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:45,343
But we must go!
We have to keep up our image.

228
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,179
Sofia, but who cares!

229
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:52,600
Do you really think anyone cares if Leopoldo Pisanello
doesn't attend the premier of a film?

230
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:58,439
- Sure! 
- But Sofia, I am Mr."Any Fool".

231
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,985
And you're my wife, the wife of 
Mr. "Any Fool".

232
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,822
But you said you'd go.

233
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,467
It's Gina Francone.

234
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,265
Ah! It's Tony Branca.

235
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:39,522
There he is. Good evening.
Good evening.

236
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,900
But who do I see? Here he is!
Leopoldo Pisanello.

237
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,907
He is accompanied by the lovely Sofia.

238
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,912
Very elegant, with that dress.

239
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:59,500
Yes, Sofia is wearing a printed cotton dress.

240
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,796
.. And a coat that seems to match.

241
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,050
- Yes, definitely. - And I
I've never... a ripped stocking.

242
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:13,264
We're checking. Yes, it is a
rip in the left stocking.

243
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:17,810
Lady Pisanello, the run in the stocking,
tell us, it's desired?

244
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,772
- I have a run? - Yes,
very impressive, very fashionable.

245
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,816
Don't we not see it, Martina?

246
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,069
- Then we will see you soon in Cannes?
- Absolutely.

247
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,906
- Well, sorry, but there's Gina Franconi.
- Please.

248
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:34,702
- Mr. Pisanello. - Yes? - I am
Marisa Raguso,your fan. - Thank you.

249
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:40,041
I think you are very very sexy,
most of all these players "frocetti"...

250
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,168
.. Making superhero movies.

251
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,422
- Sure. - It would be nice to have a little
more time to talk.

252
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,426
- Let me know what you think of the
cultural situation in Italy. - Me?

253
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:55,556
Tell you what, I'll give you my phone number.
Call me.

254
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,851
- Your Number?
- Anytime. - All right.

255
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,982
- Mr. Pisanello, tell us the truth.
Do you wear briefs or boxers?

256
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:10,863
- Boxers, large, white.
- I knew it! I always knew!

257
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:15,451
It 's clear, a type of boxer.
It 's cool! I knew it!

258
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:29,241
Bravo, you were fantastic. Come, 
let me introduce a fan of yours.

259
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,120
She has seen all your movies.
Milly, right? - Yes, Milly.

260
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:38,959
- Hi. - I'm sorry.
- So you're one of my fans. - Yes

261
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,839
I have seen all of your films.
- I'm so flattered.

262
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:48,635
- No, it's true. - Yes? -
I believe that you are an amazing actor.

263
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:54,725
When you play an Arab or
terrorist or a divorced father...

264
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,395
- I always dreamed of being able to meet you.
. - Can we have lunch together?

265
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:05,152
- What? You and I! - Eh.
- Together? - I only have an hour.

266
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:09,406
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

267
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:14,661
You are the sexiest man in Rome,
second in World Film. Did you know?

268
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,872
Yes, that's what they tell me.

269
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,916
- Shall we?
- Yes

270
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,669
Thank you.

271
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:27,674
- Do you want to have many children?
- No, children? No.

272
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:32,179
You become their slave.
Diapers, schools, diseases...

273
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,517
- Then they grow up, they leave,
and you never see them anymore. - Not so.

274
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,270
For me it was so.
You see, I ran away from home.

275
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:45,317
My father was a drug dealer and 
stole for my mother in stores.

276
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:49,154
What could I do?
Was I not right?

277
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,957
- Look!
- He's a great actor.

278
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:06,422
- There is the actor, Luchino Salta.
- Where? - Yes, that's him.

279
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,466
But he's married.
Who's that with him?

280
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,972
What's up? What is it?

281
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,808
I'm fine, I'm fine.

282
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:23,564
I cannot believe you are here
to lunch with me.

283
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,109
But I am the lucky one, you know?
I usually eat alone now.

284
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,988
No! You alone? You are married,
it is written all over the papers.

285
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:36,076
Marriage is like wine:
it is a wonder if it is good, if not...

286
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:42,207
We split up. The press does not know.
It's still a secret.

287
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,252
Of course.
No, I won't say anything.

288
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:52,134
- What are they doing?
- He ​​looks into her eyes. He wants her.

289
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:59,850
I'd like for you to stop by and watch me 
on the set this afternoon.

290
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:04,104
So  you can give me some advice,
and you can tell me what you think...

291
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,900
Then, perhaps,
we can go to my hotel to talk about it.

292
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,029
Because, you are interested in my ideas?

293
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,909
- Should I be interested in something else?
- No, no. - Ah. - No, absolutely

294
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:21,163
It's just that Anthony, my husband, always says
my head is in the clouds.

295
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,041
This, perhaps, is a bit true, but...

296
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,502
He doesn't take your ideas seriously?

297
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:30,172
No, not seriously, respects them, but
they are scientific.

298
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,550
Yes, because I am a high school teacher.
I teach astronomy.

299
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,178
- Who would think?
- Yes

300
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,141
So I would doubt you are interested in
my ideas for acting.

301
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,645
Astronomy, then the sky,
the planets, the stars...

302
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,398
- You're... you are... Wait, I do not mean
. - I say nothing.

303
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:53,654
- Are you the scale (Libra)?
- No, I'm Sagittarius. - Oh...

304
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,697
He took her hand.

305
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:02,955
- She should give him a slap.
- No, actually, I'm sure she likes it.

306
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,466
- Are you hurt?
- No. .. not.

307
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,720
Good morning. We are at the home of Mr. Leopoldo
Pisanello.

308
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:23,600
It's half past seven, and Mr.
Pisanello is shaving...

309
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:29,481
.. an event that we document 
from first to last gesture.

310
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,734
Mr. Pisanello is having his hair cut.

311
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:37,364
- Look, just a trim.
- He opted for only a trim.

312
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,380
Sorry. We are all full.
There are no tables.

313
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:58,260
- You must be wrong. My husband booked
yesterday. - There must be a mistake.

314
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,638
- How is this possible? 
- There's no table? Okay, we'll come back again.

315
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,392
- No, Mr. Pisanello.
- Please, this way.

316
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,729
- What a shame! - What manners!
- How dare you!

317
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,231
But we are loyal customers!

318
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,985
- They are right. They were in line
before us. - Nonsense.

319
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,029
Please, this way. Come in.

320
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,912
When I saw you in the office I could not resist.

321
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,790
They say that power is an aphrodisiac.

322
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,172
- And who is she?
- My best friend.

323
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:40,052
I promised her you'd have sex 
with her after me.

324
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,138
This will be one of the happiest days of her life.

325
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,183
You know, he's worried
because he is married.

326
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:52,689
Mr. Pisanello, for you
rules do not count. You're special.

327
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,050
What  "Pagliacci"?! What plans?
What airplane?!

328
01:08:12,075 --> 01:08:15,500
Where do you want to take my husband?!

329
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
This is crazy! What does he say?!

330
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,000
They already took away your son.
Now he wants to take away you too!

331
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Star? But you cannot sing! 
It's not true!

332
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,000
He sings only in the shower! 
No, he cannot sing! No! 

333
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,000
- Enough, enough... 
- I'll kill him! It will make me feel better.

334
01:08:56,756 --> 01:08:58,800
We want to introduce you to some people.

335
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,761
Mr. Massucci, the administrator of your company

336
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,389
has organized this festival to welcome you.

337
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:10,770
It 's an opportunity to learn about the
top business people in Rome.

338
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,691
He spoke very highly of you
and we are eager to meet you.

339
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:19,654
It would be a nice chance for your wife
to make a good impression too. - Oh, sure.

340
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:23,533
- Don't drink too much, honey.
-I'd better have a coffee.

341
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,786
- Does anybody want a drink?
- No. - Coffee? - No.

342
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,290
Look who it is! Here he is, come on,
I want to introduce my nephew.

343
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:34,085
- Good morning! Thank you. Beautiful party.
- Meet Antonio.

344
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:39,841
Pleasure. So, here's the famous nephew.
I've heard such great things about you.

345
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,428
You have the perfect image for our community,

346
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,598
and image is very important to us.

347
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,351
- Do you follow football?
- No.

348
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,109
- Is that you?
- Yes.

349
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:01,613
- What are you doing here, Anna?
- Milly!

350
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,823
My wife...

351
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:08,870
- Hello, how are you? - Well, thank you.
- Pleasure. - All mine. - Milly.

352
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:14,000
- We have to go. - Yes - Sorry.
- Hello. Coffee? Thank you.

353
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,506
Coffee with milk, please.

354
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,261
- Anna!
- Hello!

355
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:29,265
- Milly. - Since when?
- I'm Milly. - Ok.

356
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,353
- There's my wife.
- Do not worry, do not worry.

357
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:40,235
- I was just going to call you. 
How about Tuesday? - Usual hours?

358
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,862
- Anna!
- Oh God!

359
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:47,158
- Oh, Lady! Hello.
I did not expect to meet you here. - I am Milly.

360
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,285
Ah, Milly? Anyways, Milly,

361
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,747
can you come by my office 
tomorrow at about three?

362
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,916
- I don't know, I have plans.
- Okay, I get it.

363
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,001
Well, if you feel like it, come by at about 3:00.

364
01:10:57,044 --> 01:11:01,381
- I recommend wearing the black bra...
- Yes - The thong... - Yes

365
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,676
- But do you go sailing?
- No.

366
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,679
- Hunting?
- No.

367
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:13,393
- Anna, how are you? - How are you all right!
- Milly. Milly, Milly.

368
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:18,564
I'm so nervous!
I can't afford to make a fool of myself.

369
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:21,943
The most important men in Rome are here. 
- Yes, the "cream of the cream".

370
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,905
- It 's the whole list of my clients.
- I'm so nervous...

371
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,784
You're too tense, my friend.
Relax or you'll have a heart attack.

372
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,787
How can I relax when my
life is falling apart!

373
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,957
How does your wife put up with you if
you're always so nervous?

374
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,209
Because she loves me for who I am.

375
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:43,298
- And who is this...smooching by that actor
Luchino... what's his name? - Salta.

376
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,425
- What smooching?!
- You know.

377
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,844
You said that they only held hands.

378
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,722
No, there must be an explanation, because 
for me Milly is like the Madonna.

379
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:55,977
The explanation is simple:
He's a movie star, a sex symbol.

380
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:59,230
And Milly is beautiful and has never looked
at another man.

381
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,858
But women don't always know themselves.

382
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:06,112
Especially those who have a hysterical husband
who fears his own shadow.

383
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:10,742
Why the hell does he have to smooch
if he seduces with his eyes?

384
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,120
You probably couldn't seduce a woman with your eyes.

385
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:19,375
I want this job, but
I look like a small minded idiot.

386
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:22,503
Your wife was a virgin when you married?

387
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:26,966
- None of your business.
- I bet she was, yes.

388
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:31,971
- We did wild things together.
- What do you mean by "wild things"?

389
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,015
Having sex with the lights on?

390
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:38,853
Believe me, I was not a virgin.
Okay, I was a virgin.

391
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:45,526
- You need a lesson!
- By whom? Certainly not from you.

392
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:50,031
And why not?
Everything is already paid for. It 's free.

393
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,034
- But there are people.
- I don't see anyone.

394
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:51,082
Smile! Smile!

395
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,712
My God, you cannot!

396
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,839
my cousin!

397
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,052
We met by chance.
I have anything to say, nothing. Come on.

398
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,596
Nothing, nothing! Please...

399
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,849
We met by chance!

400
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,061
I was waiting for my wife.

401
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,498
Be respectful
at least for the procession.

402
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:45,886
Roberto, I can't take it anymore.
Why me, Roberto?

403
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:50,516
- What's going on?
- Sir, I think you must resign.

404
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:54,895
- You are very, very famous.
- But why?!

405
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:59,275
- Look at this, the pills...
This morning it was full. - Ah. - Mamma Mia!

406
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:05,865
- Why am I famous?
- Why? You are famous for being famous.

407
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,659
But I have not done anything, Roberto.

408
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:14,415
Excuse me, but, as I see it, don't all those who are famous
deserve it?

409
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:17,752
I don't know! You see that! 
You ask for my opinion?!

410
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:20,796
Everyone asking for my opinion.
I do not know!

411
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,924
All I do is answer questions.
My life is a living hell!

412
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,136
A journalist asked me two days ago if there is a God.

413
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,555
I said, "What do I know? I do not know,"
and she was upset.

414
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:33,559
"Mr. Pisanello doesn't know if there is a
God" And I do not know?!

415
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,312
Everyone asks me things...
"Pisanello"

416
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,565
"How do you scratch your head?
With the right or the left?"

417
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,650
"With both hands."
"Oh, he scratches with both!"

418
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,780
There! I scratch my head with 
whatever hand I think is best. Okay?

419
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:51,952
Some secret! - The way I see it, sir,
I kind of agree with them.

420
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:57,458
Being a celebrity,
excitement, special privileges...

421
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:02,463
.. The adoring crowds who want an autograph,
every woman's dream.

422
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,217
Women! But you do not know...
"I love him!" They kneel!

423
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,094
"Ah, Pisanello! How beautiful!
He's so beautiful!"

424
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:12,223
They all want to be in bed 
with me... in threes, fours...

425
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,308
I have enough problems with two...

426
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:19,188
The wife of a man of your caliber
knows he has to be shared with the public.

427
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,732
It's not normal...
Don't interrupt me...

428
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:25,486
Can't I speak to someone without being interrupted...

429
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,696
Enough!

430
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:32,451
Take me home! Enough!
I'll report you for violation of privacy!

431
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,830
You are heartless!

432
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:40,125
Bravo!
You're better than I had imagined.

433
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:43,963
- Why are you so quiet?
- Because I have committed adultery.

434
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,757
Consider it part of your training.

435
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:49,468
We did some things I've never done before. Never.

436
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:54,223
- Why not? - Because of Milly.
She would be upset.

437
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:58,727
But with me you had no problem.
Is it because I'm a prostitute?

438
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:02,898
With you I felt uninhibited.
But now I feel guilty.

439
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:06,235
Milly would never commit adultery.
She would never betray me.

440
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,404
Maybe she wouldn't mind you 
learned something.

441
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:12,408
Some things I can't do with
Milly. She's like a saint.

442
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:16,996
Yes, like Madonna.
Only where is Saint Milly?

443
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:20,916
The virgin Maddona is the one who married her.

444
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:32,052
- Like this?
- It 's beautiful here!

445
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,556
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks, I cannot.

446
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,018
But why not?

447
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:44,648
- Here.
- Thank you.

448
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:50,279
I love the old songs,
those of my childhood.

449
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:54,825
- they are very beautiful.
- when I once danced.

450
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,453
Eh, yes?

451
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,460
- Eh? - You are very good.
- Yes, so are you...

452
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:09,340
Ma ..  didn't you want to talk?

453
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:14,595
- Nostalgia is my weakness.
- Memories are so beautiful.

454
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,183
Did anyone ever tell you
that you're beautiful?

455
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:26,190
It is not true, no. My husband maybe 
once but never a movie actor.

456
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:30,235
Please don't think of me as an actor,
I am a human being like everyone else...

457
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:34,865
.. with the same feelings, the same
vulnerabilities, the same desires.

458
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:40,871
I'm sorry,...
when you kiss those beautiful women in the cinema...

459
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:45,250
.. You seem to me, how should I say...
A crazy man.

460
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:49,380
A kiss is just fiction on film.

461
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:53,384
Yes, I know, but I've always wondered


462
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:58,097
.. I wondered what it would be like
kissing Luke Salta.

463
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,143
Now you know.

464
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,773
- That was beautiful! - Wonderful?
- No, no more.

465
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:11,527
- Wait.  Now we take a nap.
- What? A nap?

466
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:13,654
Well, at this point 
I can't go back.

467
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:21,036
- You're so charming.
- No, no, no, no. What a mess!

468
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:24,915
- I don't see the problem.
- Yes there is a problem.

469
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,502
I would love to make love with you...

470
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:32,297
.. So I could tell my grandchildren something,
but I can't commit adultery.

471
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:34,299
Forget the semantics...

472
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:39,054
I love all of you.

473
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:44,059
My Lady, I do not know what to do.
I do not know what to do.

474
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:49,064
I love my husband, but I am so curious.

475
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:53,277
Life is so short, there are certain moments
already written in destiny.

476
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:59,658
- This is one of those moments. - No, wait
a moment, please. I must go to the bathroom.

477
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,912
Don't move. Do not move from there.
Do not go.

478
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,765
Okay. 

479
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:54,439
Who is that?
He seems interesting!

480
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:03,323
We're on the road with Aldo Romano.
It is true that you are a bus driver?

481
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,659
What do you want? I don't understand?

482
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,329
- It 's true that you bring your clothes to the laundry?
- Yes, but what do you want?

483
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,708
- Do you like hamburger?
- No, I don't like it.

484
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:16,170
- Is that a stain on the jacket?
- Yes, it's marinara sauce.

485
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:19,715
- How did this happen?
- I have to tell everyone?

486
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:24,970
I was eating a plate of rigatoni. Why does it matter to you?

487
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:44,823
- Gabriel, Camilla, Sofia.
- Hello, Dad! - Hello! - Hello!

488
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,576
You know it's all over?

489
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,871
It's back to business as usual.
I'm so happy!

490
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,749
Now Aldo Romano is all over the news.

491
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:59,213
To celebrate we go to eat a pizza in Velletri. I'm buying.

492
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,007
- Who is it?
- Aldo Romano.

493
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,186
Milly Stay calm, stay calm.

494
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:04,064
Better to go to bed and have a regret...

495
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:08,068
.. Or just go and have a
regret for life?

496
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:12,072
What do I do? Better remorse, no?

497
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:16,326
Better remorse, absolutely.

498
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:27,295
- Yes, better remorse. - Shut up.
- What? - Shut up or I'll kill you.

499
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:34,719
Now open the door and let's go. 
Not a word.

500
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:39,975
- Are you ready love? 
- Don't even open your mouth.

501
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:43,979
If you do what I say
it will be okay.

502
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,983
- Got it? - Yes
- Then give me your money and jewelry.

503
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:53,447
- You know who I am? - No, I don't 
and I don't give a damn.

504
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,367
- Shut up and stop crying.
- Here.

505
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:02,122
- Give me your wallet.
- But don't get up.

506
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:06,126
- Give me your watch. - Yes
- The watch. - Yes

507
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,628
Open up.

508
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:13,633
Open up, I am in charge of
hotel security.

509
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,011
Open up, Luke!
I know you're there.

510
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:20,640
- My wife! That's my wife.
- Your wife? - Yes

511
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,227
- But you said you were separated!
- Oh, what a fool!

512
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:28,106
- I do not want to end up like the other woman
in the paper. - I'm finished.

513
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:30,484
Oh...

514
01:31:30,526 --> 01:31:34,279
Listen to me.
Let's do this... you're not finished yet.

515
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:38,033
Let's do this. Go to the
bathroom and hide in the shower.

516
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,745
- I'll put her in bed.
- Yes - Go and shut the door.

517
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:46,041
- Together. - Yes, good.
- Close. Go to bed.

518
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:49,127
Open up!

519
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:55,175
- Now sir, explain why you 
didn't open the door. - Come on.

520
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,011
- Come near the bed.
- Didn't you hear me knocking?

521
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:02,307
- What's going on? Are you crazy?
- Did you not hear?

522
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:06,186
Didn't I hear what? I'm
here with my girlfriend and I was...

523
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:08,438
He is not the woman's husband?

524
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,816
- We didn't know!
- She said it was her husband.

525
01:32:11,817 --> 01:32:15,570
You're all crazy! I will sue!

526
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:18,573
Please forgive us and please excuse us.
What have you done?

527
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:24,829
I do not understand what is happening.

528
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,207
- It was not my fault.
- Leave.

529
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:31,169
- Look, this was not my fault.
- Madam, be patient!

530
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:37,050
- I'm sorry. - I'll call lawyers.
- Sorry.

531
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:41,179
- Anyway, I...
- Come, madam. Thank you.

532
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:46,726
- It shouldn't have to end like this.
I don't know what happened... - Have a seat, ma'am.

533
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,856
- But...
- Enough!

534
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:55,735
- Thank you. A million thanks.
- Imagine.

535
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:59,447
I take my leave now.

536
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:05,328
In fact, here is the watch.
I'll also give you my ring. Take it all.

537
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,706
- Thank you. Really, thanks.
- Thank you.

538
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,876
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye.

539
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:14,379
I can't believe it.

540
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:23,263
Of course... right,
you're really cute.

541
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:27,517
- What?
- He's right, you're pretty.

542
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:33,898
Thank you. Ma .. you are a thief, right?

543
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:39,904
Yes, I'm a thief specializing in hotels.

544
01:33:39,905 --> 01:33:44,534
- But I also do some mugging.
- Oh yeah?

545
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:50,290
- Ah. Exciting.
- You're exciting.

546
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:57,797
You know I've never made love with a criminal.

547
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:03,011
- My husband is a businessman
very respectable. - Yes? - Yes

548
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:10,310
You know what they say: Opportunity 
makes you a thief. We take this opportunity?

549
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:15,065
- Sure. - Of course.
- We are in a hotel room.

550
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:21,071
- We're in bed, you're in your underwear.
 - I'm already undressed.

551
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,282
- So. - So what?
- So, anyway...

552
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,159
How nice!

553
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:55,165
Tonight there's a film preview.

554
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:58,501
Can we go without the
casino and enjoy the film.

555
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:01,880
We can't be out there posing for journalists.

556
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:09,387
- Look, we were not invited.
- Ah...

557
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:12,515
Then we can stay at home and enjoy the film.

558
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:19,939
And I no longer have to share you with
models, actresses and sexy secretaries.

559
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,944
Ma ..  Hey! Hey! Hey!

560
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:27,655
I am Leopoldo Pisanello.

561
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:30,909
Good morning, ma'am. 
This morning I had breakfast...

562
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:34,162
.. I put butter on two slices of bread,
 and jam.
.

563
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,790
Then I made lather with the shaving gel
.

564
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:41,711
Because that's how I shave
with gel. I really like the lather.

565
01:36:41,712 --> 01:36:45,715
I am Leopoldo Pisanello.
Good morning. Want an autograph?

566
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:50,845
I Leopoldo Pisanello. You want it?
I Leopoldo Pisanello. Lady!

567
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:55,809
I'll give you a scoop: I wear boxers.
Do you want to see them?

568
01:36:55,851 --> 01:37:02,357
Do you want to see the boxers? Here they are.
I wear white boxers, large.

569
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,735
Here they are. It 's a scoop!

570
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:12,075
Lady! I'm Leopoldo Pisanello.
Do you think a trim would be better?

571
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:16,329
And she's my wife.
Miss, look. A tear in her stockings.

572
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:21,876
The run is fashionable.
It's a "trend".

573
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:27,257
Do you want to see Pisanello on one leg only?
Here it is, on one leg.

574
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:31,886
E 'scoop exceptional.
This morning I had breakfast...

575
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:38,351
Enough paparazzi!
Enough paparazzi! Enough!

576
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:42,397
- Excuse me, but I know you. - Yes ..
- Yes, I remember the face.

577
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,524
You are... What was your name?

578
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:48,236
- I Leopoldo Pisanello. - That's it.
- You want an autograph?

579
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:53,908
- Yes, if you want to... Tenga.
- I'll give you an autograph. - Please.

580
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:59,247
- I Leopoldo Pisanello,
if you remember. - Thank you. - It's me.

581
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:04,043
- You see? - Yes, let's go home,
there are children. - Come on.

582
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:09,007
Here, here.
Surely he remembers me.

583
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:13,303
This gentleman was once my driver. 
Right?

584
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:19,183
- Yes - There. - I told you:
Life can be cruel and unsatisfying...

585
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:22,562
whether you're famous...

586
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,064
.. or poor and unknown.

587
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:30,820
But, between the two, it is definately better to be.

588
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,533
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- Thank you. - Lord. - Goodbye.

589
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:39,954
Come on.

590
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:45,168
- You know what he said?
- Yes, I understand... I get it.

591
01:38:53,969 --> 01:39:02,226
- Milly? Milly? - Where were you?
I was worried.

592
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:06,356
- What happened to you?
- I went to find you.

593
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,984
Then I lost the phone. I was lost
in Rome.

594
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,070
But where were you?

595
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,864
With my uncles, but I was thinking of you 
every single minute.

596
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:18,743
- Did it go well?
- We're going home.

597
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:21,371
- Home?
- Yes, let's go back to Pordenone.

598
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:24,374
- But we just got here.
- It doesn't matter.

599
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:28,336
You don't want to meet my uncles 
and their jerk friends.

600
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,255
I don't want that job.
I want my old job back.

601
01:39:31,256 --> 01:39:34,634
Maybe we won't be rich, 
but we will have a better life
.

602
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:40,348
- Don't you still want to teach?
- Yes. Yes, but... - No "but".

603
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:42,767
We'll go back home and have a life...

604
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:47,897
.. A life much better,
with children.

605
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:56,406
And I can... I can paint a little. 

606
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:06,541
Okay. I'm surprised.
I don't know what to tell you.

607
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,877
Don't say anything. Make love.

608
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,631
- How?
- Before leaving, we celebrate.

609
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,801
Now I'll teach you something about the stars.

610
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:24,809
- I will ravage you. So, don't be surprised.
- Ravage me.

611
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:44,639
# I'll say my lines. #

612
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:53,481
#A great show for twenty-three hours. #

613
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:58,277
# Put on your costume... #

614
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:04,408
# .. and your face. #

615
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:14,794
# The people pay and they want to laugh. #

616
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:25,179
#And if a Harlequin shall steal your Columbine,... #

617
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:31,394
# .. laugh, clown... #

618
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:36,274
# ..  and everyone applauds. #

619
01:42:36,775 --> 01:42:44,031
# Laugh, clown... #

620
01:42:44,074 --> 01:42:57,336
# .. your love is broken. #

621
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:00,548
# Laugh. #

622
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:07,597
- No! - The name!
- Devil! But really... #

623
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:11,475
# (chorus) - What are you doing?
- To you! To you! #

624
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:17,607
# In the throes of death you will tell! #

625
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:21,736
- Help!
- Edda! #

626
01:43:23,113 --> 01:43:28,743
# Ah, are you? So be it! #

627
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:39,962
# The comedy is over. #
