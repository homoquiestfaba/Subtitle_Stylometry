- Morning, Mrs. Veda.
- Alice.

Sure.

Hmm.

24
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:47,066
OK, it's like this,
guys are like microwave ovens.

25
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,070
And ladies are like
conventional ovens.

26
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,671
Guys only need a few seconds,
you know, like a microwave,

27
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,740
to get...
switched on.

28
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:59,311
While ladies,
they typically need to...

29
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,012
preheat for a while.

30
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,681
But God created sex
with boundaries

31
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,351
and for a purpose.

32
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:07,752
Does anyone wanna take a stab
at what the boundary is?

33
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:08,920
Yes, Wade?

34
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:10,156
- Marriage.
- Very good.

35
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,324
And does anybody
know the purpose?

36
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,328
- To have children.
- [Father Murphy] Perfecto.

37
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:19,731
When a man and a woman receive
the sacrament of matrimony,

38
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,135
God calls on them to create
children in his image.

39
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,704
Any sex outside of one man,
one woman, one marriage

40
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:27,939
is against God's plan.

41
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,877
Um, what about sex
with yourself?

42
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,446
[students laugh]

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,348
Can you create children
from sex with yourself?

44
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,850
- No.
- [Father Murphy] Right, so?

45
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,120
- [Heather] It's against God's plan.
- [Father Murphy] Exactly.

46
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,988
[male student] So, is that what the
Bible means by "spilling your seed"?

47
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,491
- Is it spilling if you catch it?
- [students laugh]

48
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:47,426
[Father Murphy]
All right, all right.

49
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,095
We are called on to be chaste
until we are married.

50
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,399
And that means no sex...
with yourself or anyone else...

51
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,868
until you stand at that altar
and you say "I do"

52
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,904
or else it is damnation
for all eternity.

53
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,341
And remember...

54
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,008

00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:17,021
I'm not even having sex, they should
just give them to the slutty girls.

58
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:20,758
Oh, have you had to watch the
partial-birth abortion video yet?

59
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,962
- It's really awful.
- No, no! Don't ruin it for me.

How was Morality?

61
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,866
It was fine.

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,770
Did you know that masturbating
is a sin?

63
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:36,108
Ew. Of course. Why?

64
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,478
I was just wondering.

Making me rewind <i>Titanic</i>
back to the car scene twice

66
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,551
is probably also a sin,

67
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,986
just in case you were wondering
that next.

68
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,921
Look, I only
asked you to do that

69
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,923

what Kate whispered to Leo

- Mm-hmm.
