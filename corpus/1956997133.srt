00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,958
Get inside.

184
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,186
[Toby]
God, what a shitty day.

185
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,493
[Jude]
Even shittier night.

186
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,408
[Casey] Well, at least
we didn't pay the double vig.

187
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,933
So, let's at least
salvage our buzz.

188
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,544
Go to the bar.

189
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,590
Dollar drafts.
Potential ladies.

190
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,374
I'm declaring
this night done.

191
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,593
Yeah.
Me too.

192
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,942
No, no.
Come on. Come on.

193
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:30,248
I can't go out
without my boys.

194
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,033
All right. All right.
I'll make you a deal.

195
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,295
We'll-- we'll,
uh, flip for it.

196
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,992
[Toby] It's amazing how there

197
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,473
are moments in life when things could go one way...

198
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,954
Come on.
Be bold.

199
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,433
...or they could go another.

200
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,435
[Jude]
There you go.

201
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,959
...to be such a bastard.

202
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,003
[Laughs]

203
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,309
All right. All right.
All right.

204
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,658
Here's the deal--

205
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,747
heads, we go back
to our shitty, shitty rooms,

206
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,358
and our pathetic lives.
But tails...

207
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,970
The bar.
[Laughs]

208
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:59,147
Both options exist as completely separate

209
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,844
and viable futures for just

210
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:04,152
the smallest, unmeasurable nanosecond.

211
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,111
But once you step into one future,

212
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,244
you never know what the other could have been.

213
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,550
Nice.
Good.

214
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,077
Bet you a round that

215
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,513
the next beer
ordered is German.

216
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,820
I'm down to a dollar.
Casey, cover me.

217
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,216
[Man]
Hey.

218
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,348
Give me a Heineken.

219
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,349
Yes.

220
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,655
No, jude.
Heineken's German.

221
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:29,960
No,
nut sack,

222
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,528
it's from Holland.
We won.

223
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,660
Hey.
What's the haps

224
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:34,922
on the craps,
little white bitches?

225
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,097
Hey, what's up,
Duane?

226
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,360
Duane Harrison. Power forward.

227
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:39,709
If I hadn't tutored him in stats,

228
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,406
he would've been kicked off the team.

229
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,669
What y'all doin' here?

230
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,235
[Toby]
Chillin'.
[Duane]
Oh, okay.

231
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,323
This is my man,
Toby.

232
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,411
He's the reason I'm not

233
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,543
failing statistics
this semester.

234
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
Hey, man.
What's up?

235
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,676
Hi.

236
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,112
All right.
Later.
Later, Duane.

237
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:53,680
Hey. They're takin'
the conference this year.

238
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,986
I'm gonna take a piss.

239
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,945
Me too.

240
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,470
[Arcade sound]

241
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,349
[Overlapping chatter]

242
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,404
Hunter mcguire. All-around jock.

243
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,886
Known on campus to be cool like a dude.

244
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,974
Little one-on-one?

245
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,323
I never would've thought

246
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,454
she'd look at me twice.

247
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,412
Yeah.

248
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,026
[Arcade voice] Let's go.

249
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,906
Ah.
[Buzzer]

250
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,835
Bet a buck.

251
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,885
[Buzzer]

252
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:09,843
Wow.

253
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,674
I kind of destroyed you.

254
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:15,718
It looks like it.

255
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,459
You're a really
good loser, though.

256
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,547
Oh,
thank you.

257
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,549
It means a lot.

258
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:21,593
I'm Toby.

259
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,683
You can call me "loser,"
if you want.

260
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:24,684
Nice to meet you.

261
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,780
I think my turn's over.

262
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,697
Yes.
Pay up, chump.

263
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,611
[Jude] Toby. You didn't
even have the balls

264
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:40,874
to get that girl's number.

265
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,180
Cost me my last dollar.

266
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,791
Here, Casey.
Take it.

267
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,357
Congratulations.
Go have a party.

268
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,619
[Casey]
You owe me ten more cents.

269
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:48,664
[Jude]
What?

270
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,883
It's $1.10 with the vig.

271
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,886
Out of the mouths of babes.

272
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,539
It's clear the only
people making any money

273
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,845
out of this stuff
is bookies,

274
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,455
and they make it with
their fucking vig.

275
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,630
I want my fucking vig.

276
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,154
Well, you can collect
your fucking vig

277
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,503
when you become
a fucking bookie.

278
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,765
Until then,
fuck off.

279
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,027
[Casey]
Fine. Okay.

280
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,463
[Jude]
Can you believe this, Toby?

281
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,030
He thinks
he's a bookie now.

282
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,945
And then, sometimes, you open your own mouth.

283
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,817
I read this article,
a couple weeks ago,

284
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,557
about sports betting.

285
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,690
It said the biggest growth
market was college students,

286
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,170
aged 18 to 24.

287
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,482
And destiny speaks.

288
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,788
[Jude]
This is the best idea

289
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,050
in the history of mankind.

290
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,051
[Toby]
I wasn't serious, man.

291
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,183
I was kidding.

292
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,445
[Jude] Can it possibly
be this easy?

293
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:31,794
[Casey]
What are you guys thinking?

294
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,622
[Jude] Think about it.
What does a bookie need?

295
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,971
[Toby]
What about the risk?

296
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,668
[Casey]
Isn't this, like, a felony?

297
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:37,887
Jesus,
ladies.

298
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,411
This isn't the sports
book at Caesar's.

299
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,326
Yeah.
But felony...

300
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,329
There's gotta be some way
to do this anonymously.

301
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,330
Felony.

302
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,506
How are we gonna
get bettors?

303
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,812
Economics 233--

304
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,379
marketing
in the new millennium.

305
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:54,469
If-- if demand exists,
in a specialized market,

306
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,471
merely make your
presence known,

307
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,778
and word of mouth
works wonders. So...

308
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:02,172
That's it. Where do we make
our presence known?

309
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,478
At the frats.

310
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,611
[Laughs]
Yes. Exactly.

311
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,832
The-- the money thing.
We have to have...

312
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,791
$2-3,000.
I mean...

313
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,535
How about
an emergency student loan

314
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,494
from financial aid?

315
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,323
But I mean,

316
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,585
it's a really,
really bad idea.

317
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,934
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Casey.

318
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,501
I love this idea.

319
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,764
Uncle Sam will fund
the whole fucking thing.

320
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,245
Come on.
We all know

321
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,986
we're only going
to school to make money.

322
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,423
Puritan work ethic.
Delayed gratification.

323
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,511
We work our asses raw now,

324
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:38,730
and pray to God that we get

325
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,689
a six-figure job
in the future. So...

326
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,822
What's the harm in gettin'
a little ahead now?

327
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:46,651
Uh-- fine.
Fuck it.

328
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,739
Fuck it.
Fuck the money.

329
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,741
Let's just do it for
the fun of it.

330
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:53,571
The action.
Pure and simple.

331
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,661
I'm not--

332
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,534
we all have to agree.
Three or none.

333
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,887
[Laughs]
What is that?

334
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:05,932
Is that a smile?

335
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,281
That smile
looks like a yes.

336
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:08,673
Yes.

337
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,632
Yes?
Yeah.

338
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,981
C-dog.

339
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,723
Um,
I have to think about it.

340
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:15,767
What?
Uh...

341
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:16,594
Casey.

342
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:17,595
Casey,
come on.

343
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,596
Come on.

344
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,511
[Laughs]

345
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,731
[Laughs]

346
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:23,558
Fine.

347
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,907
[Laughter]

348
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,218
We were immortal.

349
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,263
Kings of our world.

350
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,917
Masters of the future.

351
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,049
Old enough to be brilliant.

352
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,834
Young enough to be stupid.

353
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,749
[Toby] Hey, Duane.

354
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:41,837
I need a little favor, man.

355
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,925
Can I meet you at practice?

356
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:53,588
Duane.

357
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:57,679
What's up,
man?

358
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:58,680
How you doin'?

359
00:14:58,723 --> 00:14:59,899
New arena's tight.

360
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,857
Yeah. But it's not
enough to play well.

361
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,860
I gotta fill
up the seats too.

362
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,166
Well,
there she is.

363
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,124
Better men have
died trying.

364
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:13,303
What did you do to this?
God, why didn't--

365
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,740
hey.

366
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,090
Loser.

367
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,745
I don't remember you
being on the team.

368
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:21,877
Yeah.

369
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,662
Actually, Duane asked
for a little help.

370
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,794
Listen.

371
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:28,188
Do you want to go out
with me on Friday?

372
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,495
What do you got for me?

373
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,715
There's this lambda
party I heard about.

374
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,804
It's gonna go off.

375
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,719
Are you a lambda guy?

376
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,720
No.
I'm not.

377
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,548
Oh.

378
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,593
Well, then how did you
figure we would get in?

379
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,292
Oh--
can you get in?

380
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,642
I thought maybe...
You could...

381
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:48,817
Let me get this straight.

382
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,950
You want to take me
to a lambda party

383
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,517
that you need
me to get us into?

384
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,955
[Laughs]
No. I-- that's--

385
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:56,999
that's not what I mean.

386
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:00,002
I'll see you around.

387
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,003
Hey.

388
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,352
Hey.

389
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,875
Stop.

390
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,574
Listen.
Listen to me. Please.

391
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,576
I was not straight up
with you before.

392
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,838
Here's the deal--

393
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,579
my friend and I,
we're starting this--

394
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:14,756
this sports
betting business.

395
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,800
Okay?
And...

396
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,367
We need clients.

397
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,761
We thought that lambda would
be perfect hunting ground

398
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,459
for suckers,
you know?

399
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:25,767
That's cool.

400
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,247
It's--
it's cool?

401
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,378
Pretty balls-out.

402
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,814
I didn't expect
that from you.

403
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,382
[Man]
Catch you later, hunter.

404
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,383
Why is that?

405
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,124
You're kinda white bread.

406
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,214
Hey,
if you do this,

407
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,521
then I'll take you
on a real date.

408
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,480
Why don't we see how
the party goes, first, huh?

409
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,789
Can you get three of us in?

410
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,144
All right.
Check list.

411
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,841
Uh...
Cell phone's a go.

412
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:57,929
The guy who
cloned it said

413
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,018
it's pretty much
untraceable.

414
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,062
Nice.

415
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,237
The big board is a go.

416
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,543
Whenever you
guys get bets,

417
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:03,892
you write
'em on these cards,

418
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,286
and then you put
'em up on that board.

419
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,418
And then, I get a shitty
Internet connection

420
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,420
to get the odds,
and then I do the math

421
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,465
on my shitty computer--

422
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,857
how many times
to I have to--

423
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,773
we're not spending $1,000
on a new fucking computer.

424
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,601
I'm just saying,
it would be so much easier--

425
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,909
I heard you
the first million times.

426
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:21,953
[Toby]
Come on.

427
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:22,867
This is a fucking
business meeting.

428
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,999
Is it judgment day,
bitch?

429
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,261
Is that what you're
trying to say?

430
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:26,262
[Toby]
Yeah. It's judgment day.

431
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,785
Here.
Two grand.

432
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,873
Emergency student loans.

433
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,310
Nice.

434
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:32,834
Bankroll is a go.

435
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,096
What are you doing?
What--

436
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,445
it's all there.
I need 500

437
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,056
to make an impression
with the frat guys.

438
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,144
You gotta come out big

439
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,319
to establish
some credibility.

440
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,842
As long as we get it back,
man.

441
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:41,843
Yeah.
Some of it.

442
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:44,933
[Toby]
All right.

443
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:48,197
Business cards.

444
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,764
Here.

445
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,505
Remember.
When we pass these out,

446
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,768
we are not the bookies.

447
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,422
We're just
a satisfied customer,

448
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,814
doing our favorite
bookie a solid

449
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,077
by passing along the word.

450
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,688
Obviously,
do not tell them to ask

451
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,081
for jude, Casey,
or Toby when the call.

452
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,343
We gotta have code names.

453
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:05,780
Well, I don't really
wanna take any calls.

454
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:08,217
Doesn't matter, man.
You gotta have a code name.

455
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,218
Why?

456
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,090
Because it's cool.

457
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,439
It's cool.

458
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,483
I'm Frankie.

459
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,311
I'll give you $500
for that name.

460
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:16,530
Of our money?

461
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,880
All right.
Fuck you, then.

462
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,795
Dean got more pussy
than Sinatra anyway.

463
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,057
I'm dino.
Casey, you're Sammy.

464
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,887
Why?
I'm not black--

465
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,976
[both]
Sammy.

466
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:28,846
[Laughs]

467
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,500
[Jude]
What else?

468
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,023
Rules?

469
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,024
Yeah.

470
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,113
Rules. All right.
Yeah. Rule--

471
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,810
rule number one--
uh...

472
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,464
No matter what happens,

473
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,030
we share everything.
Three ways.

474
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:39,857
Nothing comes between us.

475
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,858
That's right.

476
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,164
You didn't tell
this hunter chick

477
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,339
what we're doing,
did you?

478
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:46,821
No, man.

479
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,869
I'm not a chump.
I wouldn't do that.

480
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,569
All right.
Good.

481
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,659
So,
rule number two.

482
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,096
[Toby]
No bets over $500.

483
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,924
People bet too much,
they get into debt.

484
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:03,925
And we get ratted out.

485
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,622
[Toby]
Any bet over 500,

486
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,494
we refer to our
old bookies.

487
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,495
Agreed.

488
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,018
I have a rule.

489
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,977
Nobody touches
my shitty laptop.

490
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,329
[Toby]
Hey. Hey. Hey.

491
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,982
[Toby]
Come on.

492
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,377
All right.
Let's do this.

493
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,944
All right?

494
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,252
How's it going?

495
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:28,167
Good.
Plus three?

496
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,952
Hey. For you?
Have a great time.

497
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,303
Hey.
Right hand.

498
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,740
Right hand,
please.

499
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,787
Other right hand.
Right hand.

500
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,092
[Jude]
Casey. This way.

501
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,365
There. Tobe.
Game room.

502
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:55,672
Let's go reel
these suckers in.

503
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:56,760
Hey,
I think I should

504
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,372
hang back with hunter,
you know?

505
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,025
Guy's pussy-whipped
already.

506
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,201
All right.
Yeah. Fine.

507
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:05,029
Casey.
Let's do this.

508
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,988
Excuse me.

509
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,342
I wanna go watch.

510
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,525
Oh.

511
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:23,526
[Laughs]

512
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,006
Hey, guys.
I'm really sorry.

513
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,051
Come back when you
got more money, huh?

514
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,749
Okay.

515
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,142
What's the buy-in here?

516
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,014
Oh, I think it's a bit rich
for you kids. It's 100 each.

517
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,363
[Jude]
What do you think?

518
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,147
Bling. Bling. Bling.

519
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:38,976
[Toby] Julius Garrett.

520
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,935
The richest fuck in the forest.

521
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,153
If we got Garrett's business,

522
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:42,980
we'd have a business.

523
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:45,940
What's up?

524
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,030
Hey.
You got a light?

525
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:52,903
Hey.
Listen.

526
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,992
I didn't mention
this before,

527
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:58,387
but could you
pretend not to know

528
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:59,997
what's going on here?

529
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,391
I wasn't supposed
to tell you.

530
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,392
Sure.
My lips are sealed.

531
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,480
Don't worry about it.

532
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,481
Thanks.

533
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,091
Let's start on ten.
I'm in.

534
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,832
So, what made
you guys decide

535
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,793
to do this
bookmaking thing?

536
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:17,363
Oh, it's just to scrape up
some extra cash, you know?

537
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,756
I'm on academic
scholarship, so--

538
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,105
what's the real reason?

539
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,110
Just the action.

540
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,287
Action?

541
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,463
Yeah. The action.
I mean...

542
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:35,163
Either you know it,
or you don't.

543
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,519
I know it.

544
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,217
I don't know if you do.

545
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,003
Well, maybe you'll have
to show me sometime.

546
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,309
[Laughs]

547
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,484
I'll think about it.

548
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,362
Hey.
How about dinner next week?

549
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,582
I can't.
I, uh...

550
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,975
I got three midterms,

551
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,413
a monster paper past due,

552
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,546
and two away games
with the soccer team

553
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,200
the week after that.

554
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,033
Yeah. It's really
busy for me too.

555
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:20,469
All those midterms
and stuff.

556
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:23,603
How 'bout three
weeks from now?

557
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,084
How 'bout four?

558
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:31,959
How 'bout five?

559
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,091
How 'bout three?

560
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,745
That's what I thought.

561
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,704
Smart guy.
Don't Welch.

562
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:39,445
Two pairs.
Queens and eights.

563
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,272
Three deuces.

564
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,883
Whoo.
Whoo-hoo.

565
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,841
[Garrett]
Come to papa.

566
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,669
Makes me up only
1150 for the week.

567
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,671
[Casey]
Mm.

568
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:49,846
[Laughs]
How's that?

569
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,633
Uh, I-- I won big
on that bears game.

570
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,286
[Laughs]
Sweet.

571
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,853
[Jude] See,
if you boys are serious,

572
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,594
you should hook up
with my bookie.

573
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,204
He's solid.

574
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,642
Do you have some
of those cards?

575
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:06,341
[Jude] It's an on-campus
drop-off, pick-up.

576
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:09,431
And they're off.

577
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,654
Let's go dance.

578
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,968
What's up?
Let's go.

579
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,927
I'm in.

580
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,279
[Jude]
Oh. What is that?

581
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,759
What is that?
Oh. Oh. What's up?

582
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,238
Now, see,
that's...

583
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,457
That's gotta
be disappointing.

584
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,460
That's can't feel good
for you right now.

585
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:42,421
[Jude]
Sorry. [Laughs]

586
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,250
There you go.

587
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:48,731
[Jude]
Oh. Oh. Oh. What is that?

588
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,819
[Jude]
What is that, case?

589
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,212
Oh. Oh.
That's in your face.

590
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:53,214
[Casey] ...You keep
using the same offense.

591
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,172
[Jude] Well, why don't you
learn how to defend my...

592
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,739
[Casey] Why don't you
do something different?

593
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,741
Why don't you fucking
cradle my balls

594
00:23:58,785 --> 00:23:59,829
real gentle?
You know how--

595
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,701
[phone ringing]

596
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,922
[Phone ringing]

597
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,012
Oh, fuck.

598
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,231
Take it.

599
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,233
Yeah?

600
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:13,843
Uh-huh.

601
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,844
Yeah?

602
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:18,413
Uh, this is,
uh, dino.

603
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,894
Buck fifty on Philly.

604
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,985
Yeah. Let me get you
the latest on that.

605
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:25,986
Casey.
What do you got there?

606
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,117
My name's Sammy.

607
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,205
Right.
Fuck off.

608
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,206
[Casey]
And it's at, uh...

609
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,556
Minus 15 and a half.

610
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,861
[Jude]
Right.

611
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,690
Hello? Sir.
Yeah. Uh...

612
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,258
[Stammers] Philly's
givin' 15 and a half.

613
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,217
Okay. You're--
you're-- you're-- uh,

614
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,220
a new client,
I assume?

615
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,266
Okay. I-- I need your--
your name,

616
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,703
and your,
uh, phone number,

617
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:49,357
and, uh, we'll call
you back with the--

618
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,403
the drop-off
and pick-up info.

619
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,885
[Jude]
Okay. Okay. Um...

620
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,191
Is that it?

621
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,367
Yeah.

622
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,369
That's it.

623
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,197
Cool.

624
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,155
All right.

625
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:08,942
Holy shit.

626
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:09,943
[Applause]

627
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,074
Ah.

628
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,162
[Jude]
Go.

629
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,294
[Laughs]
Go.

630
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:15,383
Oh. Nice.
There he is.

631
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:16,427
Our cherry.

632
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,821
This is our first bettor,
boys.

633
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:21,389
Oh. An occasion like
this calls for--

634
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:24,479
[phone ringing]

635
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:28,831
This is Frankie.

636
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,530
Okay. Yeah.
San Fran.

637
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,575
[Beeping]

638
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,100
Uh, can--
can you hold one one second?

639
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,320
Hello?
This is Frankie.

640
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,845
Uh, let me put
you on hold.

641
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:46,457
One-- one--
one second.

642
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,807
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah.

643
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,115
Can I-- can I take
down your information?

644
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,856
Yeah. Just give me your
name and-- and, uh,

645
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,423
and address,
please.

646
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:01,429
No. No. I've got 'em comin'
in at plus six and a half.

647
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,517
The over's 45 and a half.

648
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,692
That's-- that's
direct from Vegas.

649
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,389
Hey. Can you read this?
What is this?

650
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,391
Is that a nine or a four?

651
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,697
I can't read any of these.

652
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,612
Sorry.
Here. Here.

653
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,179
Can I int--
sir?

654
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,355
Can you turn
down the music?

655
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,879
Can I interest you
in a parlay or a teaser?

656
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:17,967
Hold on.

657
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,142
What's--
what is that number?

658
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,491
That's a--
that's a-- a four.

659
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,318
Or, um, uh...

660
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:22,755
Maybe it's a seven.

661
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:24,452
I can feel the fucking
tumor growing.

662
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:25,279
We gotta get headsets,
man.

663
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,281
[Beeps and whirring]

664
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,022
It's fucking jamming,
dude.

665
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,284
Good luck, sir.
Here. Go, go, go.

666
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:32,068
Go.
Fuck, man.

667
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,157
I tried to take
all--
[Casey] Dude, I can't
read any of these.

668
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,245
I'm sorry, sir.
We're--

669
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,769
we've been swamped today.

670
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,553
[Casey] Are you practicing
to be a doctor or something?

671
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,772
Okay.
We'll keep that in mind.

672
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:40,990
What can I help you with?

673
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,949
[Sighs]

674
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,698
[Casey] We can't
do it like this anymore.

675
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,144
We need a new system.

676
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:08,452
36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

677
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,150
That's it.

678
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,806
$4,340.

679
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,808
Can't we start
upgrading now?

680
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:16,896
[Laughs]

681
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,245
Yeah.
Let's go shopping, boys.

682
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,171
So, assuming
a maximum bet of $500,

683
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,825
I'm using
a probability-based formula

684
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,262
to calculate the risk
between straight bets

685
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,133
and over-unders with
teasers and parlays.

686
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:40,093
So, if we have too much
money on one team,

687
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,529
the computer tells us.

688
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,226
If we have enough
teasers and parlays

689
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,532
to statistically
balance it out,

690
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,838
the computer tells us.

691
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,578
If we want to know
how much money

692
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,145
we could make or lose
on any given day,

693
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,494
the computer tells us.

694
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:53,584
And if Toby's mom gives
me another blowjob?

695
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,543
The computer tells us.

696
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,503
I'll take that.
Give me two on Detroit.

697
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,722
[Man]
Two on Detroit. Got it.

698
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:01,810
50 on 'zona.

699
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:03,420
[Man]
Got you for 50 on Arizona.

700
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,248
[Toby] You had to love the frats.

701
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,555
In no time, we had over a hundred clients

702
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,513
lined up for the kill.

703
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,566
Soon, word of the bookies

704
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,350
spread across the entire campus.

705
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,889
Monday was collection.

706
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,978
Clients left payments in specific books

707
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:41,415
we assigned them and dropped them

708
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,590
in the night slot.

709
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,374
They had to be in by 6:00 A.M.,

710
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,246
or a double vig kicked in.

711
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,770
Jude worked the ass-early shift every Monday

712
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,729
to make sure no one else touched our books.

713
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,268
[Jude] Can this be this fucking easy?

714
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,634
What's the harm in getting a little ahead now?

715
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,563
[Toby] Friday was payout.

716
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,695
This time, each client had a different book

717
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,960
they were to check at a pre-determined time.

718
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,703
Jude made sure to use books that have never

719
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,968
been checked out in the history of the school.

720
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,143
Philosophy,

721
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,840
the unabridged works of Plato,

722
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,582
or anything in a foreign language.

723
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,068
It didn't start slowly and grow

724
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,287
like a plant you nurture.

725
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,028
It blew up like a fucking atom bomb.

726
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,552
And I mean immediately.

727
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,467
The future just happened.

728
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,485
We paid off the loans right away.

729
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,878
Pretty soon, we were making enough

730
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:39,881
to start blowing some serious paper.

731
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,802
I'm talking eight big on our best weeks.

732
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,151
Two on our worst.

733
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,153
We had to open a safe deposit box

734
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,634
at the bank to keep it all.

735
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,418
At this rate, we'd split 150k

736
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:56,767
by spring break.

737
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,769
We top out at a nickel.
Call that other number

738
00:30:58,813 --> 00:30:59,988
for the other
bookies I gave you.

739
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,772
Hey. I got it right here
in front of me, man.

740
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,600
I can't believe you of all
people are complaining.

741
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:05,646
We're small time, man.
We can't take that.

742
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,213
Call that other
number I gave you.

743
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,257
Okay.
You're all set then...

744
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,868
You're all set.

745
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,565
Sammy.
Dino.

746
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:14,133
Frankie.

747
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,662
[Man 1]
The one pushing the cart.

748
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,751
[Man 2] How do you
know that's the guy?

749
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,318
[Man 1]
I saw him with the books.

750
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:29,104
[Man 3]
Okay. Let's do it.

751
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:31,106
Fuckers.
Toby.

752
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,412
Tobe.

753
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,415
Case.

754
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,416
Is Toby with you?

755
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,593
[Ringing]

756
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,073
Oh, pick up the
fuckin' phone.

757
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,552
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

758
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:45,425
[Phone ringing]

759
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,426
Hey.

760
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:47,470
Toby.

761
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:48,645
Be at the fountain
in 15 minutes.

762
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,038
I'll meet you there.
What?

763
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,345
I got-- I got jumped for
three big on the way home.

764
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,477
But I know the guys who
did it. We'll get it back.

765
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,001
Hey. Hey.
Jude. Hold on.

766
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,655
Okay? Just don't-- don't do anything stupid.

767
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,483
No, no, no. No.
Listen to me.

768
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,008
If we let one guy
get away this...

769
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,705
Then it's gonna get
around that we're soft.

770
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,402
Dude.
Hold on, okay?

771
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,751
Okay. Listen. Just let me think.

772
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,797
All right?

773
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,146
I don't know.

774
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,931
Get a couple big guys from the bar

775
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,758
to go with you to work on mondays.

776
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:15,759
Follow you home, or something.

777
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:16,891
Yeah. Maybe.

778
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,110
What about those
fuckers that jumped me?

779
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,808
Let's forget about them.
Just-- I don't know.

780
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,810
Chalk it up as an
operational loss.

781
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,116
We need to keep a low profile.

782
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,900
Let it go.
Oh,
fuck that.

783
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,902
Jude.
Just hold on, all right?

784
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,382
Trust me on this.

785
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,645
Okay? Don't-- don't do anything.

786
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,213
I gotta take a shower

787
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,605
before I go anywhere.

788
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,346
Hey, you did--
you did really good.

789
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,521
It was great.

790
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,872
Hey.

791
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,831
Are we cool?
Is everything all right?

792
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,354
Yeah.
I got it.

793
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,442
I'll be good.

794
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,530
Okay. Later.

795
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,665
Sorry.

796
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,774
So,
what's the plan?

797
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,906
Today...

798
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,735
You and me are gonna
get serious.

799
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:27,527
Ah.

800
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,227
I'm sorry.

801
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,315
A bet's a bet.

802
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,795
Can we get another round,
please?

803
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,666
I'll lose all day
if it gets you drunk.

804
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,888
[Laughs]
You wish.

805
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,759
All right.
How about this time...

806
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,500
I will play...

807
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:45,632
One-handed.

808
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:49,462
Okay. Just to humiliate
me even more.

809
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,899
Or we could
do something else.

810
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,074
No.
Let's play.

811
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,815
Let's just raise
the stakes a little bit.

812
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:57,296
Raise the stakes?

813
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:58,906
Getting beat
seven times in a row

814
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,473
isn't enough
punishment for you?

815
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:01,996
I'm not the one
afraid of losing here.

816
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,780
Oh,
I'm not afraid of losing.

817
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,043
Okay.
So then,

818
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,870
let's make the game
a little more exciting.

819
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,872
You're not gonna
get me naked.

820
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,961
Oh, well.
See ya later.

821
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:15,531
Oh,
come on.

822
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:16,793
What do you wanna bet?

823
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,317
Well,
it's...

824
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,883
It's gotta
be something risky.

825
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,929
You know?
Make your palms sweat.

826
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:24,975
I mean, if you're not
nervous about losing,

827
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,152
then why play at all?

828
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:29,197
Hmm.

829
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,851
We're not talking
about money, are we?

830
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:34,550
No.
Not this time.

831
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,900
If you lose...

832
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,467
I do get to see you naked.

833
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,557
And what are you
willing to risk?

834
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,907
I'll do whatever.

835
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:46,693
Okay.

836
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,477
If you lose...

837
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,871
I get to see your little,
secret betting operation

838
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,351
in action.

839
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:53,917
No.

840
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:56,094
No. No.
I-- that's--

841
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,138
that's off limits.

842
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,880
Sounds like it's on then.

843
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:08,106
All right.

844
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,803
One-handed.
Holding you to that.

845
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,504
[Man 1]
Dude. Roundhouse. Roundhouse.

846
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,940
Sweet.
How'd you do that?

847
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,727
[Man 1]
Oh, yeah. [Laughs]

848
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,946
[Man 2]
Damn.

849
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,950
[Man 2]
Oh.

850
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,827
[Ball clattering]

851
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,783
Oh, yeah.

852
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,047
Getting kinda easy.

853
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,882
[Toby] It's gotta be something risky.

854
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,973
Make your palms sweat.

855
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,428
Go, man.
Come on.

856
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,222
[Shouting]

857
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,199
You're dead.

858
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:39,431
Get that guy.

859
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:52,357
[Car honking]

860
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,239
Over there.

861
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:43,930
Come on.
[Grunting]

862
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,024
Come here.

863
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:54,027
[Grunting]

864
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,377
It's a little different
one-on-one, huh?

865
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,901
If you even call us again,
we'll fuckin' kill you.

866
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:02,078
Bitch.

867
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:19,487
Hey.

868
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,532
Hey.

869
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:23,317
You okay?

870
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,015
Never better.

871
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,192
What did you do today?

872
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,280
Nothin'.

873
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,284
Did you do your 131 paper?

874
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:36,417
[Laughs]
No.

875
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,245
It's due tomorrow,
man.

876
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,116
Mom? Is that--
is that you?

877
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,250
I'm just sayin', man.
It's due.

878
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,252
Dad? When--
when-- when--

879
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:46,688
when did you two fly in?

880
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:52,781
[Sighs]

881
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,217
[Larry]
Trevor Shannon?

882
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,089
What kind of name is that
for a black fighter?

883
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,960
Sounds like an Irish name.

884
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,398
He should be named
more like, uh...

885
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,444
Tyrik.
Or, uh, Calvin.

886
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,793
[Phone ringing]

887
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,752
Yeah.
This is Larry.

888
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,106
Vincent.

889
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,281
Huh?

890
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,457
Take this call.
It's another college kid.

891
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,545
[Sighs]

892
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,200
This is gonna suck.

893
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,680
Whatever.
You told her a date.

894
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,943
The more the merrier,
right? [Laughs]

895
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,554
This is a bad idea.

896
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,904
I think a bad idea
is keeping a $500 limit,

897
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,471
when we can handle
much more than that.

898
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:31,559
Hey. Hey.

899
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,169
Lower your voice
in the hall, man.

900
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:34,475
I told you.
We can't do that.

901
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,129
It's way too risky.

902
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:38,044
It's how clients
get in deep shit.

903
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,045
Cops get called.

904
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,525
You worry like
a school girl.

905
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:41,613
Case.

906
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,223
I'm not ready yet.
Gimme a second.

907
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,964
We can't take that
kind of trouble.

908
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,444
Come on, Casey.
We're late.

909
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,315

[Jude]
Oh, what? Me?

00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,714
Excuse me,

913
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,672
I'm the man of your dreams.

914
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,155
Yes.
May I help you?

915
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:04,157
Uh, reservation for six.

Somebody's layin' off.

919
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,080
Like we need this bullshit.

920
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,343
Relax. Relax.

921
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,867
Next time you talk
to one of his clients,

922
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,521
you get some info.

923
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,958
Nice fuckin' room.

924
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:26,266

Cheers.
I'm fuckin' starving.

929
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:38,365
Do you eat at all?

[Waiter]
Madame.

931
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,369

[Jude laughs]

933
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,163
How's it goin'?

934
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,601
It's goin'.

935
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:02,955
This loud kid with
the crazy hair...

936

Same.

940
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,330
What the fuck is happening
in this goddamn country?

941
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:31,723
Don't let it ruin
your enjoyment

942
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,508
of, uh, chardonnay
with veal. Huh?

943
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,736
So, hunter.
That's a nice dress.

944
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,303
[Jude]
It's very mature.

945
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:48,391
Thanks.

946
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:49,741
I put down 20 bucks

947
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:51,960
you were gonna show up
in a Jersey and cleats.

948
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,309
Yeah.
That's funny.

949
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,354
I should've put down 50

950
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,139
you'd show up
in nothing at all.

951
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:59,228
All right.

Here we go.
Okay, you two.
This round is over.

953
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:03,232
Let's take a little trip

954
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:04,625

I, uh... I-- I--
I think it's going well.

957
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,112
You're such an asshole.

958
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,288

00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:01,808
Good.

1080
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,550
We're understood.

1081
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,204
What's wrong with this guy?

1082
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:07,857
Son,
are you all right?

1083
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:10,817
I'm fine,
mom.

1084
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,254
Mm.

1085
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:14,690
He's cute,
right?

1086
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,649
Yeah.
Adorable.

1087
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:25,223
Fuckin' miserable
police academy reject.

1088
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:26,876
Holy shit.
You were a big help.

1089
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,834
[Laughs]

1090
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:38,366
[Phone rings]

1091
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,542
Yeah.

1092
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:41,543
Hold on a minute.

1093
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,459
Hey.
Larry.

1094
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:47,767
[Vincent]
You want 25,000 on Michigan?

1095
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,768
[Laughs]

1096
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:50,074
That's a lot
for a college kid.

1097
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,946
What's your name?

1098
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,252
"Julius Garrett."

1099
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:56,689
You've called here before.

1100
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:57,995
Yeah.
What's your reference?

1101
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,999
Of course I know them.
Do you?

1102
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,522
[Vincent] What's their
fuckin' number then?

1103
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,654
[Casey]
This is yours?

1104
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:06,699
It's good,
right?

1105
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:07,830
Come on.
Let's go for a ride.

1106
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:08,831
Do some shoppin'.

1107
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,746
I've gotta study.

1108
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,662
Fine.

1109
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:14,663
It's you and me,
Casey.

1110
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:15,664
Here.
You drive.

1111
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:17,623
See?
[Laughs]

1112
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,714
I think you should really
take it down a notch.

1113
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:22,889
No, man.
On the contrary,

1114
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,022
I think you need
to take it up a notch.

1115
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:26,719
[Sighs]

1116
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,721
[Engine rumbles]

1117
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:32,855
[Tires screeching]

1118
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:34,857
It's a totally
student-run operation.

1119
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:36,207
I heard it's huge.

1120
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,947
No shit?
I swear to God.

1121
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:39,688
They make
a shitload of money.

1122
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:41,647
It's a totally
awesome idea.

1123
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:55,965
Hey.

1124
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,232
Do you guys know what
we're doing in there?

1125
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:03,973
Yeah.

1126
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,846
Everybody does.

1127
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,067
What are we doing in there?

1128
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:12,895
Um...

1129
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,854
Studying.

1130
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:20,512
Yeah.

1131
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:23,080
See you later.

1132
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:24,907
Bet you get a 4.0,
man.

1133
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,128
[Laughter]

1134
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,870
Oh, dude.
I'm so stoned.

1135
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:32,828
[Laughter]

1136
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,533
Jesus.

1137
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:42,708
You're late.

1138
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,449
Colleen says these
have to be done by noon.

1139
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:48,061
Don't touch these.
Ever.

1140
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,715
Asshole.

1141
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:58,071
[Phone ringing]

1142
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:01,379
What?

1143
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,380
How's it hanging, kid?

1144
00:52:02,423 --> 00:52:04,077
Who's this?

1145
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,080
You guys are, uh, operating
in territory that's,

1146
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,169
uh,
already spoken for.

1147
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,085
We need to discuss some arrangements.

1148
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,826
Yeah. Yeah. We're doin'
fine on our own.

1149
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,349
Thank you.

1150
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:19,266
I don't think you exactly
understand what I'm sayin'.

1151
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,051
No. I think
I understand you exactly.

1152
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:23,183
[Sniffs]
You wanna fuck us.

1153
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,451
And we don't
wanna bend over.

1154
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:31,452
End of story.

1155
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:34,020
No.
I can find you.

1156
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:35,935
Yeah?
What's my name?

1157
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:47,990
Now I'm mad.

1158
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,366
Hey.

1159
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:19,152
Dude, I still got
papers in there.

1160
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,110
Idiot.

1161
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:23,112
[Beep]
This is Frankie.

1162
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,418
Tampa bay's at,
uh, six and a half.

1163
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:25,898
Toby.

1164
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,769
Toby.
Guess what.

1165
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,162
Guess what I did
with that girl Hanna

1166
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,511
from art history class.

1167
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:31,469
Whoa.
Hi.

1168
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,082
Hi.

1169
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,823
[Toby]
Oakland's at nine.

1170
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,999
It's really hot right now.

1171
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,827
Hey.
Where's jude?

1172
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,958
Hold on.

1173
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:44,177
He's still at the library.

1174
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,396
Does he know about her?

1175
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:48,050
Uh-- [Sighs]
Don't worry about it.

1176
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:50,227
Just tally these, man.
We're way behind.

1177
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,011
We'll hit a parlay instead.

1178
00:53:52,054 --> 00:53:55,667
And go with an even dollar
on t.B. And Miami.

1179
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,583
All right.
Even 50 on Tampa giving seven.

1180
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:01,063
Done.

1181
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,500
[Ding]
[Beep]

1182
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:04,676
[Toby]
Frankie. What's up?

1183
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,025
Did you check
your book on time?

1184
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:07,287
[Door opens]

1185
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:09,115
Hey.
[Toby] I can't
do anything for you.

1186
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,899
We can't pay you twice

1187
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,987
because you
call up and say so.

1188
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:12,945
It doesn't work that way.

1189
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:16,949
I'm gonna go.

1190
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:18,167
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1191
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,256
I was invited.

1192
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,127
Casey, what's go--
does she know?

1193
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,476
Jude--

1194
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,173
Jesus Christ, Toby.
You fucking told her?

1195
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,174
[Hunter]
Will you calm down?

1196
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,219
All right?
I'm leaving.
Fuck you.

1197
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,916
No, no, no, no, no.
It's fine. Stay.

1198
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,004
Make yourself at home.

1199
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:29,962
You already fucked
everything up.

1200
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:30,963
[Toby]
Jude--
Jesus, Toby.

1201
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,312
What the hell
are you thinking?

1202
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,792
[Toby]
Calm down.
Casey,
fuckin' help.

1203
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:36,316
Lock the door
and hit the blinds.

1204
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,970
It's no big deal,
all right?

1205
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:40,755
Ah.
Fuck.

1206
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,843
Cheap ass shit.

1207
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,062
[Toby]
Dude. She's cool, okay?

1208
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:44,803
You know what this is?

1209
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:45,891
This is what happens...

1210
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,980
When you only think
with your dick.

1211
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:51,026
[Toby]
Come on, man.

1212
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,724
Don't be a fucking asshole.

1213
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,726
I'm--
I'm the asshole?

1214
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,641
You fucked us.

1215
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:58,947
You fucked everything.

1216
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:02,081
Fuck, man.

1217
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:03,430
Motherfucker.

1218
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:07,304
[Grunting]

1219
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:12,047
I'm good. I'm good.
Get the fuck off me.

1220
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,398
Not till you promise
to calm down.

1221
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:16,225
Calm down.
Get off of me.

1222
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,401
Do you want
me to get someone?

1223
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:18,837
It's okay.
Just go.

1224
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,491
Yeah. You go ahead.
He's got it under control.

1225
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,196
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1226
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,850
Fuck you.

1227
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,338
Hey.

1228
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,253
I'll see you later,
girl.

1229
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:45,951
I thought I might
find you here.

1230
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:48,649
That got a little
out of control.

1231
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:50,216
Are you okay?

1232
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:51,739
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine.

1233
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:53,350
Let's just-- let's go get
some food or something.

1234
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,091
This doesn't piss you
off even a little bit?

1235
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,919
I mean,
he took a swing at you.

1236
00:55:57,963 --> 00:56:00,095
If one of my friends
came at me that way,

1237
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,183
I would either
write him off,

1238
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:02,750
or try to help him out,
maybe--

1239
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:04,056
look. Listen.
This is my problem, okay?

1240
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,710
Why don't you
let me handle it?

1241
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:06,798
All right?

1242
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:08,582
All right.
All right.

1243
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:21,029
Hey.

1244
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:23,728
Hey.

1245
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,904
Listen, man. I'm sorry
that I brought hunter here.

1246
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:28,646
[Sniffs]
Did you catch up with her?

1247
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:32,563
Yeah.
I saw her.

1248
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:36,175
I was out of it, man.
I was...

1249
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,265
I was really
fuckin' out of it.

1250
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:41,310
I'm sorry.

1251
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:43,269
I'm just worried about you.

1252
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,272
You know?

1253
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:50,189
All right.
Um...

1254
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:51,973
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

1255
00:56:52,017 --> 00:56:55,150
and um...

1256
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,152
You know, we always
do everything together.

1257
00:56:57,196 --> 00:57:00,112
And so,
I have a proposition for you.

1258
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:03,985
I will stop using
right now...

1259
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:05,465
If you agree to expansion.

1260
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,859
Kill the limit?

1261
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,077
Yeah.

1262
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:14,996
And you'll quit right now?
Just-- just like that?

1263
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,084
Cold Turkey?

1264
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,216
Yeah.
Absolutely.

1265
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:22,526
[Laughs]

1266
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,353
You always gotta have
things your way, don't you?

1267
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,529
[Laughs]

1268
00:57:25,572 --> 00:57:27,226
Yeah.
[Laughs]

1269
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:28,270
What, are you new?

1270
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:35,974
Okay.
Yes.

1271
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,933
It's-- it's done.
I'll kill the limit.

1272
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,636
All right.
Deal.

1273
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:06,091
Is it all gone?

1274
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,615
Yup.

1275
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:12,619
Flushed all of it.

1276
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:15,317
Which, uh,
which toilet did you use?

1277
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,841
[Laughs]

1278
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:17,929
I'm not telling you.

1279
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:20,584
[Laughs]
I'm joking.

1280
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:22,542
Not that it would
matter anyway.

1281
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:29,506
I'm not looking
forward to tomorrow.

1282
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:34,423
Yeah.

1283
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:35,512
It'll be all right,
man.

1284
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,470
Yeah.

1285
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:48,394
I'm glad we're friends,
Toby.

1286
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:51,005
Yeah.
Me too.

1287
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:54,182
[Snoring]

1288
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:01,407
Get up.
Police.

1289
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,451
Right there.
Come on.

1290
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:03,409
Let me see your hands.

1291
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:06,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Geez.

1292
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:08,545
Can someone
toss me my pants?

1293
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:13,854
What?

1294
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:15,247
Do you think I'm stupid?

1295
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:18,642
You think I'm stupid, huh?
Is that it?

1296
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:19,991
You think nobody noticed

1297
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:21,732
all the expensive
shit you got here?

1298
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:25,126
That big, wide-ass
screen t.V. With the, uh...

1299
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,477
High-definition receiver,
plus the thx DVD?

1300
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,438
This looks like a fuckin'
best buy commercial.

1301
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:35,615
How 'bout that $50,000
car parked downstairs?

1302
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:40,489
What? Did you just found
it in the street, or...

1303
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:42,840
Are we doing a little
low-grade drug dealing here?

1304
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:45,625
Maybe some x, or some,
uh, some grass?

1305
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,714
Maybe some coke,
or some little--

1306
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:50,108
nothing.

1307
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,109
How 'bout the dog?

1308
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:52,371
[Officer]
The place is clean.

1309
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,503
We can't find anything.

1310
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:55,940
[Jude] Hey, mark.
How's it goin'?

1311
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,554
[Dog yelps]

1312
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,819
Is there some sort
of official apology

1313
01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:07,778
we should be expecting?

1314
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:13,348
What happened,
you guys?

1315
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,396
They fuckin' kicked
the door in, dude.

1316
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:18,876
They thought
it was a drug bust.

1317
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,355
Fuck 'em.

1318
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:21,530
We're free and clear now.

1319
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:23,054
They're not gonna
raid us twice.

1320
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:24,838
We'll sue
their ass.
[Phone ringing]

1321
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:28,450
[Beep]
Hello.

1322
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:31,758
[Toby]
Oh, hey. What's going on?

1323
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:37,808
Okay.
What do you need?

1324
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:40,506
Oh, yeah?

1325
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:41,594
Fuckin' asshole.

1326
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,682
What was that?

1327
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,902
It's Julius fuckin' around.

1328
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,599
Says he wants
a hundred grand

1329
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,687
on next week's
Preston game.

1330
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:48,862
It's Julius Garrett.

1331
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,559
He's fuckin' loaded.

1332
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,126
He can totally
cover that bet.

1333
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,868
$100,000?

1334
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:57,262
Guys, the spread
is ten points to Kingston.

1335
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:59,133
That's five easy baskets.

1336
01:00:59,177 --> 01:01:01,832
Preston's a bunch
of honky white boys.

1337
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:05,009
We're leading the league.
We'll beat 'em by 20, easy.

1338
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:07,315
We cannot take that bet,
jude.

1339
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,316
There's no way.

1340
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:11,755
Gimme the phone.

1341
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,148
Wh-- what about the limit?

1342
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,410
We killed the limit,
Casey.

1343
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:16,673
[Toby]
Yeah. If you stay clean.

1344
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:18,065
That was the deal.

1345
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:19,066
Look at me.
I'm--

1346
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,459
I'm keepin'
my side of the deal.

1347
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,681
Gimme the phone.

1348
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:42,350
[Beeping]

1349
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:47,399
Yeah. Hello. Can I speak
to, uh, Julius, please?

1350
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,444
[Professor felix]
Your early exams

1351
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,316
are showing you at a 3.68.

1352
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,666
You know that's not a 3.7.

1353
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,235
Fortunately,
your scholarship allows

1354
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:59,759
for one
probationary semester.

1355
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,282
Now,
my office is here to help.

1356
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:03,154
So, let's see
what we can do

1357
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:04,372
to get you back on track.

1358
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:14,556
Sir.

1359
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,819
[Announcer] Dobson pressured by boucher...

1360
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,603
[Casey] I hope Kingston
has an off night.

1361
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,605
Stop worrying,
Casey.

1362
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,173
Preston sucks.
It won't even be close.

1363
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:23,174
Nice.

1364
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:24,349
[Knocking on door]

1365
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:35,490
Hey.

1366
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:36,578
You guys are so fucked.

1367
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,450
What?

1368
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:39,799
Rumor has it jude
fixed the Preston game.

1369
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,366
He paid off some
of our starters

1370
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:42,933
to make sure
the game is a blowout.

1371
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:45,457
Oh, Jesus.
It was a gift.

1372
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,024
Who cares if they play
a little harder than usual?

1373
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,547
Who cares?

1374
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,810
Don't you understand that
if anyone gets wind of this,

1375
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,682
it's not just
the ncaa investigating,

1376
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:55,206
it's the FBI.

1377
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:57,730
The entire athletics
department of this school

1378
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,385
will go up in flames.

1379
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:02,256
This goes beyond
taking a couple bets.
Hey.
Hold on.

1380
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,216
Jude, did--
did you do this?

1381
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:06,217
What?

1382
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,045
Holy fuck,
jude.

1383
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:09,916
That's fucked up.

1384
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,918
You stay away
from the athletes.

1385
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:21,580
[Toby] You should've
talked to us first.

1386
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:30,502
Hey, d.

1387
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:32,025
What up,
h?

1388
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:36,638
So,
we're gonna win today?

1389
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:37,596
Shit...

1390
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:41,469
We'll see.

1391
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:43,471
Listen, uh, can I talk
to you for a second?

1392
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:45,082
Yeah.
What's up?

1393
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,866
I know you like Toby.

1394
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,912
He's cool.
Why?

1395
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:51,740
All right.
Here it is. Um...

1396
01:03:51,784 --> 01:03:52,872
He and some of his friends

1397
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,700
are running
a bookmaking operation.

1398
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:56,920
Jude paid off some
of your teammates

1399
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:58,660
to make sure you guys
take it by ten.

1400
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:00,445
You know I got nothing
to do with that shit.

1401
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:01,750
I know.
I know.

1402
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:06,973
Then let me tell
you something.

1403
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,192
Do what you want with it.

1404
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,675
We ain't coverin'
that spread.

1405
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:17,984
[Vincent]
College players sell cheap.

1406
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,769
I give 'em just ten
each to take a dive.

1407
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,075
But this kid...

1408
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:24,382
He tried to buy 'em off
for a nickel a pop.

1409
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:25,992
Not in my town.

1410
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:27,733
They're in pocket now.

1411
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:28,865
Julius did well.

1412
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,431
Fuckin' children.

1413
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,478
Should I erase
Garrett's debt?

1414
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:35,915
Yeah.

1415
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,918
Mm.

1416
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,702
Ouch.

1417
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:42,574
[Vincent] Oh, yeah.
I finally got this kid's name.

1418
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:43,749
[Phone ringing]

1419
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,794
[Video game sounds]
Jude.

1420
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:47,492
Turn that shit down.

1421
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:48,710
[Phone ringing]

1422
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:49,798
Hello.

1423
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:51,017
[Hunter] Listen to me.

1424
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:52,236
I'm giving you the heads up.

1425
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:53,585
You're gonna get screwed.

1426
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:56,544
Someone outbid jude.
The team's gonna shave.

1427
01:04:56,588 --> 01:05:00,244
No way they can win by ten.
Call it off.

1428
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,073
Hey.
That was hunter.

1429
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:04,552
She said
somebody outbid you.

1430
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,989
The team is gonna
shave points.

1431
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,033
Oh,
whatever, man.

1432
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:09,253
She's trying to fuck
with your head.

1433
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:10,645
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna find out.

1434
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:29,751
Duane.

1435
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:30,927
Hey. Hey.
Come here.

1436
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,841
Two minutes.
Two minutes.

1437
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:33,930
Please.

1438
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:38,108
What?

1439
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:40,632
Are you in on it?

1440
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:41,633
Fuck y'all.

1441
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,764
Duane.

1442
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,244
I had nothing
to do with this, man.

1443
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,072
Swear to God.
I had nothing to do with it.

1444
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:47,682
Whatever, man.

1445
01:05:47,726 --> 01:05:49,771
Yo, I can't
be talkin' to you.
Hey.
Hey. Hey.

1446
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:50,990
Hey. Duane.
Listen.

1447
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,253
I'm fucked here.
Okay?

1448
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:54,776
My ass is on the line.

1449
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,387
You gotta help me out.

1450
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,649
Just cover
the spread for me.

1451
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:58,650
Ten points.

1452
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,261
This ain't no playstation,
bitch.

1453
01:06:01,305 --> 01:06:03,872
You think I can just go out
there and do it by myself?

1454
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:05,874
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1455
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:06,658
I'm begging you.

1456
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,312
What do you need?

1457
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:09,878
What is it gonna take?

1458
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,706
Because I can help your
family out with bills,

1459
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,665
and groceries...
Ya know?

1460
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,710
I can do that stuff.

1461
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:19,540
So,
that's how it works?

1462
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:20,628
I'm your nigga now?

1463
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,072
Fuck.

1464
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,477
[Phone ringing]
Yeah.

1465
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:45,740
It's true.
We are in serious shit.

1466
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:48,047
Have Casey call Julius to cancel the bet,

1467
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,657
and you start laying it off now

1468
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:50,963
to cover that hundred grand.

1469
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,834
It's way too late
to lay that much off, man.

1470
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:54,880
Those players are
not gonna fuck me.

1471
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:58,057
Relax, come back,
and watch the game.

1472
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,364
Son of a fucking bitch.

1473
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:01,539
[Beeping]

1474
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:03,497
[Phone ringing]

1475
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:15,161
I'll be right back.

1476
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:17,598
[Beeping]

1477
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:18,599
[Phone ringing]

1478
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:19,861
[Phone ringing]

1479
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:21,211
Speak.

1480
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:24,257
Yeah. I wanna put
a hundred grand on Preston.

1481
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:26,825
You wanna put how
much on Preston?

1482
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:28,827
100 grand.

1483
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,176
Or anything close.

1484
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,352
I'm willing to put down
40 cash in collateral.

1485
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,139
Ah.
This must be jude.

1486
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:40,273
It's-- it's a friend of jude's.

1487
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:42,754
Oh,
I see.

1488
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,365
So, you help him with his operation, and so forth.

1489
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:48,673
Did you get a lot
of action today?

1490
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:51,850
I hear you decided to take real bets.

1491
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:54,809
You're big shots now, huh?

1492
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:08,432
Fuck.
[Car honking]

1493
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:13,524
Tell you what,
friend of jude.

1494
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:16,962
I hope you can cover for
our young friend Julius.

1495
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:17,832
Because we're
gonna be serving

1496
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,660
as his collection agency.

1497
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:36,024
Oh, shit.

1498
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,768
[Laughs]

1499
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:46,296
Fuck me.

1500
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:48,385
Fuck me.

1501
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,169
[Crowd cheering]

1502
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:52,128
Ugh.

1503
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:20,591
[Announcer] Blocked by o'shea.

1504
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:24,290
Ortega wanted a foul, but clearly that was clean.

1505
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:25,639
We come back the other direction--

1506
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:26,945
oh, through the middle.

1507
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:28,468
That's a layup. Right there.

1508
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:29,948
He just let him drive right to the basket.

1509
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:31,689
Where is the defense from Kingston?

1510
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:34,953
And Kingston state really can't get anything going.

1511
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:36,215
Layup, no good.

1512
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,825
They've missed yet another one,

1513
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:39,218
and we come back the other way.

1514
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:41,133
Preston looking inside. They've got it.

1515
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,483
Puts it up and off the glass good.

1516
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:45,006
This is unbelievable.

1517
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,443
I have never seen Kingston play so poorly.

1518
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:47,879
...signaling for a timeout.

1519
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,924
He wants to slow things down,

1520
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,187
and get Kingston back on track.

1521
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:53,928
[Toby] Five baskets.

1522
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:55,887
Ten points.

1523
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,584
$100,000.

1524
01:09:57,628 --> 01:10:00,108
Is this gonna be okay?

1525
01:10:00,152 --> 01:10:02,154
Who the hell knows?

1526
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,721
It's too late to pull over now.

1527
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:04,983
[Announcer] Underneath...

1528
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:06,724
Up and good.

1529
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:08,116
Harrison with the layup.

1530
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,380
What a beautiful layup.

1531
01:10:10,423 --> 01:10:12,033
He drove right down to the basket untouched.

1532
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,864
And Harrison now looking again from the outside

1533
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:17,909
drives inside...

1534
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,824
Two-handed slam.

1535
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,130
And again with a beautiful dunk.

1536
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:24,263
Now, that's a first team all American for you.

1537
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:26,309
He turned things around and all the kids are playin'...

1538
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:27,701
Stolen by friarson.

1539
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:28,789
Back to Harrison.

1540
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,922
Alley-oop. It's gonna be--

1541
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:32,271
good.

1542
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:33,968
That was beautiful.

1543
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:35,318
We've got another team that's shown up out here.

1544
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:37,015
There's Harrison again.

1545
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,059
And they take the lead.

1546
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:39,496
A beautiful three-pointer.

1547
01:10:40,845 --> 01:10:41,933
Keep it up.

1548
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:44,109
Running the other direction.

1549
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,285
Kingston state a whole new ball club

1550
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:47,373
since substitutions early in the first half.

1551
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,766
And another jam--

1552
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:50,115
oh, yeah.
[Laughs]

1553
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,205
Harrison, now with nine assists...

1554
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,033
Ten rebounds-- and there's a three...

1555
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,730
It's good.

1556
01:10:56,774 --> 01:10:59,733
Look at the leadership of Duane Harrison.

1557
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,128
[Whistle]

1558
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:05,304
Oh.
It's a fuckin' foul.

1559
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,306
Harrison fouled there with no time left.

1560
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,917
Just one second remains.

1561
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:11,005
And who would've thought it?

1562
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,877
Come on. Come on.
Two more points.

1563
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,400
Please, God.

1564
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:16,576
...of Harrison, with a beautiful comeback.

1565
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,577
He hits the first one.

1566
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:20,101
Holy shit.
Oh, God.

1567
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,451
One more point.
Please, God, please.

1568
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:23,801
[Toby]
One basket.

1569
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:26,369
Come on.
One basket.

1570
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:27,935
Come on...

1571
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:42,080
[Shouting]

1572
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:43,647
Duane.

1573
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,126
Motherfucker yes.

1574
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,693
[Cheering]

1575
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:48,652
Yeah.

1576
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:52,177
I love you.
Yeah.

1577
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,397
[Laughs and shouts]

1578
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,224
Hey. Hey.

1579
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:57,965
[Laughs]

1580
01:11:58,009 --> 01:11:59,924
I'm just so glad we're
not getting killed.

1581
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:03,580
Oh.

1582
01:12:03,623 --> 01:12:09,412
[Phone ringing]

1583
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,370
Yeah.

1584
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:16,375
Hold on a minute.

1585
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:17,768
It's the fucking kid.

1586
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:18,899
He wants to know

1587
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,858
if we're gonna cover
for Julius' debt.

1588
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:29,257
Let me make this clear.

1589
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,912
You are lucky to walk
away dead even from this.

1590
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:35,612
So do that. Walk away.

1591
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:38,223
If I hear you take
any more action...

1592
01:12:38,266 --> 01:12:40,181
There'll be consequences.

1593
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:46,057
Find this kid.

1594
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:50,453
[Toby]
Let it go, jude.

1595
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:51,541
It's over.

1596
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:55,240
We're getting that money.

1597
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:56,807
I'll guarantee you
those guys are holding

1598
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:00,071
at least a hundred big after
collection, before payout.

1599
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:02,421
So, we go and get
our hard-earned share.

1600
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:04,249
You've lost your mind.

1601
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:06,033
No,
I haven't.

1602
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:12,300
You need a nap,
or something.

1603
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,606
Oh, fuck you
and your nap.

1604
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,173
You need to stop
being such a pussy.

1605
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:16,435
Oh,
I'm a pussy?

1606
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:18,698
We go and we take
what we deserve.

1607
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:20,570
You should be thankful.

1608
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:23,050
There's no way that
this is gonna happen.

1609
01:13:23,094 --> 01:13:25,052
You need help.
Listen to yourself.

1610
01:13:25,096 --> 01:13:27,315
Take your help
and shove it up your ass.

1611
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:28,621
I've kept my side
of the deal.

1612
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,057
Please stop this
crazy fuckin' talk--

1613
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,972
you're either with me,
or you're not.

1614
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,060
You're in or you're out.

1615
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,417
I'm out.

1616
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:46,117
[Phone ringing]

1617
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,466
What?
Dino.

1618
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:52,123
Yeah.

1619
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:53,690
What am I?
Fuckin' t.V. Guide?

1620
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:55,431
I don't know what
channel it's on.

1621
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:58,129
Hey.

1622
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:06,137
I just came by to tell
you it was the mob.

1623
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,140
They were trying to get
us under their thumb.

1624
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:11,272
I guess it's a good
thing you won, then.

1625
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:13,231
Yeah.

1626
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:15,189
Yes,
it was.

1627
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:19,280
I'm sorry.

1628
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:23,328
I'm--
I'm done...

1629
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:25,286
With this whole thing.
I'm out of it.

1630
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:28,725
Yeah?

1631
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:30,335
Yeah.

1632
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:32,337
Can I just come in?

1633
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,992
And we can talk
about it maybe?

1634
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:38,517
Hunter, I don't see what
the problem is, you know?

1635
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,519
The problem?

1636
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:43,653
You're taking risks...

1637
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,612
That involve more people
than just you.

1638
01:14:46,656 --> 01:14:50,964
You're taking chances
with other people's lives.

1639
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:52,226
Toby...

1640
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:56,927
You need to learn
when to walk away.

1641
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,885
Go home.

1642
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:24,563
[Beep]

1643
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:27,523
You have one new message. [Beep]

1644
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,872
[Jude] Hey. Listen.

1645
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:30,221
Your Christmas present's in your desk drawer.

1646
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,788
You can go ahead and open it.

1647
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:32,876
It doesn't seem possible,

1648
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:34,225
but if you have any balls left,

1649
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:35,356
meet your two best friends

1650
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,315
at our old bookie's place at 12:00.

1651
01:15:37,358 --> 01:15:39,273
[Beep]

1652
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,593
Thanks for drivin',
man.

1653
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:57,901
I'm fuckin' hammered.

1654
01:15:57,944 --> 01:16:00,686
Why are we picking
this money up so late?

1655
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:05,343
I guess they didn't wanna
sit on such a big payout.

1656
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:07,475
Mm. It's right here.
It's right around the corner.

1657
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,393
[Mumbles]

1658
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:18,008
[Sniffs]

1659
01:16:18,051 --> 01:16:20,401
Ah.
Here do a quick bump.

1660
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:21,489
No.
No?

1661
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:22,578
What are you doin',
man?

1662
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,362
I'm just--
I'm tired, man.

1663
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,493
I need a little...

1664
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:26,625
Celebratory pick-me-up.

1665
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,376
All right.

1666
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:41,074
Ah.

1667
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:44,556
Wait here for me.

1668
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,862
Seriously. What the fuck are
you doing with that, man?

1669
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:47,820
Relax, man.
It's just in case.

1670
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:48,821
In case of what?

1671
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:49,909
You don't remember
what happened

1672
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:52,520
to me the last
time I was here?

1673
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:54,305
Dude, you should
give me the gun.

1674
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,654
No.
Fuck you.

1675
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,440
They don't even know that
we're coming, do they?

1676
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,922
I'm not doing this.

1677
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,141
All right.
Listen.

1678
01:17:04,184 --> 01:17:05,403
That's-- that's our
money in there, man.

1679
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:06,491
That's ours.

1680
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:07,971
I'm not leaving
until we get it.

1681
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:09,799
Well, I'm not gonna
be a part of this.

1682
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:10,887
Yeah?
Well, then fine.

1683
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,411
Fuck you.
You're not driving my car.

1684
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:16,196
Fine.
Then I'm just gonna walk.

1685
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,328
Yeah--
you're gonna--

1686
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:19,330
Casey. Case.
No, no.

1687
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:20,679
Dude. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1688
01:17:20,723 --> 01:17:22,507
Look at me. Stop.
I'm sorry, okay?

1689
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,248
I'm sorry.
It's me.

1690
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,597
It's just you
and me here now.

1691
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,555
I can--
I can do this shit myself.

1692
01:17:27,599 --> 01:17:29,035
I just--
it would--

1693
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,734
it would mean a whole lot
to me if you had my back.

1694
01:18:04,157 --> 01:18:05,898
Casey.

1695
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:10,033
Are you gonna
help me or not?

1696
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:17,431
[Car honking]

1697
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:18,563
[Tires screeching]

1698
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:38,844
I'll be in and out, case.
No problem.

1699
01:18:58,211 --> 01:19:00,344
Hey.

1700
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:01,345
Toby,
what the fuck?

1701
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:03,826
No. It's off.
Get out of here.

1702
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:05,697
Oh,
fuck you.

1703
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,785
Jude.
Come on, man.

1704
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:07,960
Hey.

1705
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:09,396
[Grunting]

1706
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,876
Give me the gun.
I figured
a way around this

1707
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,008
so no one has to get killed.

1708
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:13,749
Give me the damn gun.

1709
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,446
Ugh.

1710
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:17,187

1711
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,449

[Grunting]

1713
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:21,539
I've got a way around this.

1714
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:24,672
Jude.

1715
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:25,804
Jude.

1716
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:26,892
You gotta trust me.

1717
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,329
I got a plan.

1718
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:30,330
Okay?

1719
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:32,115
Let's go.
Let's just go.

1720
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,551
Jude,
do it my way.

1721
01:19:33,594 --> 01:19:34,639
This one time.

1722
01:19:34,682 --> 01:19:36,946
Trust me.

1723
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:54,485
[Toby] Sometimes you dig yourself

1724
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:55,834
into such a deep hole...

1725
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:58,924
The only way out is to keep on digging.

1726
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:06,758
Whoa.

1727
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:09,500
Nice face.

1728
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:13,156
I should see the other guy,
right? Huh?

1729
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,461
So,
uh...

1730
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:16,072
Tell me I came
here for a reason.

1731
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:18,814
You owe me and
my associates $100,000.

1732
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:20,859
Now, we're assuming
that's a loss,

1733
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:23,601
but we want you
off our backs.

1734
01:20:23,644 --> 01:20:25,516
You're right.
It is a loss,

1735
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:27,648
and things are only
gonna get worse.

1736
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:28,954
The thing is...

1737
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:32,436
I think that I have a way
we can work this out.

1738
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:35,047
Go ahead.

1739
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:36,614
I'm listening.

1740
01:20:36,657 --> 01:20:38,137
One last bet.

1741
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:40,183
You pick the game.
You pick the team.

1742
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:43,186
If you win,
we pay you $100,000.

1743
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:44,970
And we won't take
any more bets.

1744
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:47,625
If we win...

1745
01:20:47,668 --> 01:20:49,192
You leave us alone
and we forget that

1746
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:51,150
any of this shit
ever happened.

1747
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:57,287
What are you,
stupid?

1748
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,897
No.

1749
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:02,074
We're gamblers.

1750
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:03,554
Like you.

1751
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:12,606
I'll call you about
the game tomorrow.

1752
01:21:16,523 --> 01:21:17,916
We're not the same.

1753
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,572
You and your friends
are gamblers.

1754
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,705
I'm a businessman.

1755
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:34,193
[Boxing bell]

1756
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:35,238
[Announcer] Trevor Shannon,

1757
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:36,500
the defending champ,

1758
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:37,936
comes out in the white trunks.

1759
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,546
Rodriguez, the number three contender,

1760
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,679
comes out in the white trunks with red stripes.

1761
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:43,289
[Toby] A boxing match.

1762
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,422
Fuckin' mafia. What do you expect?

1763
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:48,816
The guy Larry gave us was Trevor Shannon--

1764
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,296
defending middleweight champion.

1765
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:53,952
Larry's guy was umberto Rodriguez.

1766
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:59,175
Our guy Shannon was favored four to one.

1767
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:00,611
But Larry made it clear

1768
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:04,267
it was an even-money bet between us.

1769
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,659
No odds and no vig.

1770
01:22:05,703 --> 01:22:07,792
Sweet of him.

1771
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,141
[Announcer] It's an overhand right.

1772
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:10,490
Shannon's hands down by his sides,

1773
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:12,144
and he is out.

1774
01:22:12,188 --> 01:22:13,841
I don't even think we need a count for this one.

1775
01:22:13,885 --> 01:22:15,582
Referee walks over and takes a look,

1776
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:18,368
and Trevor Shannon is out cold.

1777
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:21,849
I have no idea what he was doing with his hands.

1778
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:24,722
He looked so good defensively

1779
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:26,680
up to that point in the fight.

1780
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:28,726
[Toby] It all went as planned.

1781
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:30,815
We knew the match had to be fixed.

1782
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:31,990
So, we bet like mad dogs

1783
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:33,035
against the guy Larry gave us.

1784
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:35,776
What is that?
Is that a smile?

1785
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,996
[Toby] We bet everything.

1786
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,303
You're a fucking genius.

1787
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:42,870
[Toby] I mean, total liquidation of assets.

1788
01:22:42,914 --> 01:22:44,655
Jude gave up his car,

1789
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:46,178
we sold our t.V., our stereo,

1790
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:48,528
our satellite dish, our furniture.

1791
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,835
Everything but the ass God blessed us with.

1792
01:22:50,878 --> 01:22:53,751
We bet all of our earnings from the operation.

1793
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:57,015
We even bet our credit card limits on the Internet.

1794
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:59,017
[Phone ringing]

1795
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:05,806
Yeah.

1796
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,721
Hey.

1797
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:09,114
No kiddin'.

1798
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:10,986
Oh,
that hurts.

1799
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,814
Ouch.

1800
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:16,817
Oh, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.

1801
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:19,603
Ah.
No.

1802
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:21,779
No.
We hit nothin'.

1803
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:26,523
I'll talk to you later.

1804
01:23:26,566 --> 01:23:28,655
That was sal.

1805
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:30,005
He just told
me some college kid

1806
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,529
took him big on this fight.

1807
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:36,663
[Vincent] He's cryin'
his ass off right now.

1808
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:39,623
He's such a fat moron.
He never knows the call.

1809
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:49,850
Fuck me.

1810
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:52,070
Good job,
kid.

1811
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:54,159
[Toby] 100 went to Larry, as promised.

1812
01:23:54,203 --> 01:23:58,120
300 went to Frankie, dino and Sammy.

1813
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:02,124
It was the big score...

1814
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:03,473
And we came out on top.

1815
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:05,431
[Laughter]

1816
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:11,307
[Toby] And with that, it was over.

1817
01:24:14,832 --> 01:24:17,748
Jude wasn't the first genius to flunk out of college.

1818
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:23,710
All right,
man.

1819
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:26,626
You take care.

1820
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:29,107
Yeah.
You too.

1821
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,066
Later,
man.

1822
01:24:33,677 --> 01:24:36,897
[Toby] We stay in touch, but...

1823
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:38,899
It's not the same.

1824
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:39,770
What is?

1825
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,429
I lost my scholarship,

1826
01:24:46,472 --> 01:24:47,821
but with the hundred grand,

1827
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:49,780
I'm covered into grad school.

1828
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,698
Casey--

1829
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:57,875
he switched majors. Made Dean's list.

1830
01:24:57,918 --> 01:24:58,919
It's a big campus.

1831
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:01,748
I see him, but not often.

1832
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:06,623
I wonder all the time...

1833
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,015
Is there any significance

1834
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:11,149
to the people we meet in our lives?

1835
01:25:11,193 --> 01:25:13,934
Does our life follow fate?

1836
01:25:13,978 --> 01:25:15,110
Or chance?

1837
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:19,244
I saw hunter the other day on campus.

1838
01:25:19,288 --> 01:25:22,378
I asked her if there was any way

1839
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:24,815
she would give me a second chance.

1840
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:27,948
She looked me right in the eye,

1841
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:29,124
and said she'd play me for it.

1842
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:30,342
Best two out of three.

1843
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,808
Ugh.

1844
01:28:55,852 --> 01:28:58,289
[Grunting]

1845
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,856
Maybe we should
get a wheel barrel.

1846
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:00,857
[Muffled screams]

1847
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,946
Wheel "barrow."

1848
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:04,904
Right. "Wheel barrel."
That's what I said.

1849
01:29:04,948 --> 01:29:05,992
Should I get one?

1850
01:29:06,036 --> 01:29:08,821
[Muffled protests]

1851
01:29:08,865 --> 01:29:11,041
No.

1852
01:29:11,084 --> 01:29:13,870
Oh,
I know that look.

1853
01:29:13,913 --> 01:29:14,958
[Muffled protests]

1854
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:16,786
You hungry?

1855
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:19,223
Huh?

1856
01:29:19,266 --> 01:29:20,659
[Muffled screams]

1857
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:22,182
I think eating would,
uh...

1858
01:29:22,226 --> 01:29:24,620
Make you happy again.

1859
01:29:24,663 --> 01:29:25,751
Give me that.

1860
01:29:25,795 --> 01:29:27,753
Last time,
you almost cut your toes off.

1861
01:29:27,797 --> 01:29:29,102
It was raining.
Remember?

1862
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:31,714
My hands were wet.
It slipped.

1863
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:34,325
Give me that.

1864
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,327
[Muffled screams]

1865
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,156
Yeah.
You're moody.

1866
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,462
Maybe we should
go to Charlie's,

1867
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:42,333
and get some of that
chicken piccata you like.

1868
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,074
[Trunk closes]

1869
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:45,423
That's with the red sauce,
right?

1870
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,382
[Chainsaw starts]
