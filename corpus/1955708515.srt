1
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,512
Do you know what day it is?

2
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,276
Yes.

3
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,578
- What month?

4
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,186
What year?

5
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,051
- Yes.

6
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,685
- I want you to
color the flowers in.

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,250
50 that none of them look
exactly the same.

8
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,464
The petals can either be...

9
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,964
- I remember.

10
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,290
- Good.

11
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,630
But how can I know for sure?

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,270
- Four purple flowers'

13
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,738
Four green flowers.

14
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,604
Blue centers on two
purple flowers.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,903
Two green.

16
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,273
Purple centers on two purple,

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,937
two green.

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,640
- Purple and green what?

19
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,753
- Flowers.

20
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:15,875
Green Eaves on four...

21
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,652
The four flowers with
purple centers.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,919
Blue leaves on the other four.

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,460
- That's good.

24
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,427
Now can you show me'

25
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,624
- I know these tests
were made for children.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,736
- That doesn't mean
they're not useful.

27
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,608
I know this all
seems easy to you now,

28
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,478
but it hasn't always been'

29
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,480
And it may not always be'

30
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,146
And that doesn't
mean you don't have

31
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,254
to show me.

32
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,357
Tell me what you see'

33
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,062
- The water.

34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,035
- Where is the water?

35
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,534
- The ocean.

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,108
- Are you standing on a beach?

37
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,575
- Yes.

38
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,710
- Is the sand warm?

39
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,612
- Yes.

40
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,051
- How about the water?

41
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,855
- I don't know.

42
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,424
- Go to the water.

43
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,389
- I can't.

44
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,391
- Why not?

45
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,133
- There's broken
glass in the sand.

46
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,938
- I want you to use
the sand to cover

47
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,311
up the glass,

48
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,812
and make yourself a
path to the ocean.

49
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,380
When your feet touch the water,

50
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,460
you will raise your right hand.

51
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,170
Sleep'

52
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,210
I think you need to
clear your mind.

53
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,350
- I'm sorry'

54
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,877
See?

55
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,078
I stopped'

56
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,244
- Focus on your body
and your breath.

57
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,251
Focus on your balance'

58
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,420
Know that if you stay focused,

59
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,291
you won't fall'

60
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,125
If you fall,

61
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,631
we start all over again.

62
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,096
Janie?

63
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,268
You look dehydrated'

64
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,438
- Thank you'

65
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,038
- That's good.

66
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,347
It's easy to forget
how much water

67
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,951
our body needs'

68
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,685
Just a little more now.

69
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:17,863
- Thank you'

70
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,034
- Your father called
this morning.

71
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,904
He didn't want me to wake you.

72
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,375
- What he say?

73
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,071
- Well, there's good news
and bad news.

74
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,545
<i>- Okay.</i>

75
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,948
- The bad news is, he may have to
stay in Tokyo a few months more.

76
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:02,951
"And?

77
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,521
- And...

78
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,353
I told him how well
you've been doing.

79
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,621
And he wonders if
maybe you're ready to

80
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,390
start spending some
time out of the house.

81
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,888
- Really?

82
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,727
- Only if you feel ready'

83
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,698
- I do.

84
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,535
- Good.

85
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,106
It's good to see you smile.

86
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,500
- How long do I get to go for?

87
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,227
- Lets start with a few hours.

88
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,974
- What should I do?

89
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,434
- Anything you want.

90
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,650
This time, is your time.

91
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,354
Are you sure you're ready?

92
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,141
Who do you see?

93
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,710
- I see me.

94
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,483
- Are you all right?

95
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh'

96
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,132
Step back, this way.

97
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,494
You should be more careful.

98
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,077
There are a lot of ways
this world can hurt you.

99
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,840
- One hour and
seventeen minutes late.

100
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,869
- I know.

101
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,174
I'm sorry'

102
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,750
I lost track'

103
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,580
- I didn't call to remind you,

104
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,848
because I'd like to
treat you as an adult.

105
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,685
But keep an eye on the time.

106
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,592
And call me if
you're going to be late.

107
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,687
<i>- Okay.</i>

108
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,229
- Now...

109
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,964
tell me about your day'

110
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,226
- I don't hear anything.

111
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,131
- Maybe it stopped'

112
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,470
- Well, it's a big house.

113
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,733
Water runs even when
you're not using it.

114
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,565
- It's never happened before'

115
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,371
- I'm sure it has.

116
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,413
You just never noticed.

117
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,517
- How am I suppose to sleep?

118
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,988
- Well, it's
stopped now, hasn't it?

119
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,190
- But what if it starts again?

120
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,037
- Hello?

121
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,544
Are you okay?

122
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,348
Are you okay?

123
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,286
- This is embarrassing.

124
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,051
I'm picking up a friend

125
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,992
to go to the airport and...

126
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,324
I got here early.

127
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,325
- Oh, okay'

128
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,157
- I must've fallen asleep'

129
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,498
- I was just checking.

130
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,632
- Yup.

131
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,666
No worries.

132
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,704
- Have we met before?

133
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,713
- I don't think so.

134
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,842
- You just look really familiar.

135
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,723
That's me.

136
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,554
I'm Savannah by the way'

137
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,855
- Margo.

138
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,098
- You're just in time.

139
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,297
- I can explain'

140
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,030
- I know.

141
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,638
- I would've called but,

142
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,981
my phone ran out of batteries.

143
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,141
- It's not a punishment'

144
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,281
The rules were put
in place for your

145
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,912
protection, little girl.

146
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,486
Everything we do,

147
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,219
we do for you to get better.

148
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,594
- I know, but...

149
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,222
- And you'll feel
so much better after.

150
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,063
All the way down'

151
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,471
Just try to relax'

152
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,341
Remember,

153
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,780
the more you fight it,

154
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,898
the more it's going to hurt.

155
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:09,948
But when it's over,

156
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,020
you'll be that much
closer to you again.

157
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,654
Now open'

158
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,827
How are you feeling today?

159
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,097
- Better, thank you'

160
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:33,931
- I'm so glad.

161
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,244
You do understand, don't you?

162
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,514
Why I take your well
being so seriously.

163
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:55,425
Why we do the things that we do.

164
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,362
When your mother died,

165
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,605
I made a promise to your father.

166
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,541
That promise means
I'm going to spend

167
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:13,913
the rest of my life
worrying about you,

168
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,075
and caring for you.

169
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,723
Whether either one
of us likes it or not.

170
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,217
- Hello?

171
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,181
- Hello?

172
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,896
- Hello?

173
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,192
Hello?

174
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:32,897
Hello?

175
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,984
- Re-center,
and start again.

176
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:39,857
- God damn it!

177
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,659
- Re-center

178
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,462
And start again.

179
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,894
- Just leave me
alone for a minute.

180
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,913
- I'm worried that
you're not taking

181
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,112
proper care of yourself'

182
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,278
- I'm fine.

183
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,848
- There's a difference in you.

184
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,018
- I'm getting better.

185
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
- Of course you are'

186
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,742
And I know it can't be easy.

187
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,832
- You don't know anything.

188
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,536
- I just want what's
best for you, little girl.

189
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,542
- You just want...

190
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,702
you just want.

191
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,905
- Calm down.

192
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,304
I'm right here with you.

193
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,674
- You're not my mother

194
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,712
You're the fucking house keeper.

195
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,594
- Now you're just being hateful.

196
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,705
- That's because I hate you.

197
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,232
Little girls, and little girls,

198
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,366
and...

199
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,441
- I don't know why
you put yourself

200
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,571
through this.

201
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,871
- Little girls.

202
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,007
- You don't remember?

203
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,610
This is how it starts.

204
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,389
- Little girls, little girls,

205
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,423
little girls are all
fucking hateful.

206
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,028
- This is what you want?

207
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,038
You get this way and you

208
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,870
don't leave many choices'

209
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,467
What Tm suppose to
do now is call the police.

210
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,546
Do you know what
will happen then?

211
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,945
Do you remember?

212
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,881
You wouldn't rather stay here?

213
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,044
In your home'

214
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,277
Where people love you'

215
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,890
We've come to close
to losing you.

216
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,584
Too many times'

217
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,830
From your first moment till now.

218
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:56,600
I've seen every version of you.

219
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,838
You can be well if you want to.

220
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,608
That's it.

221
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,677
Come here'

222
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,615
Come to me.

223
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,267
Stop fighting.

224
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,819
You know how to make it stop.

225
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,117
But you need to give
yourself permission.

226
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,056
- Shut up, bitch'

227
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,485
Shut the fuck up'

228
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,769
Shut up'

229
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,181
I'll cut your god damn
cunt open.

230
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,112
Is that what you like?
Huh?

231
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,739
Come here'

232
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,916
That's what you like'

233
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,420
Here you go.

234
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,353
I'm gonna beat you bad.

235
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,214
Hurt you'

236
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,749
- Sun choke.

237
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,078
Now clean this mess up'

238
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,668
- Shit.

239
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,309
- I mean, nothing's been stolen,

240
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,309
but someone has
definitely been in my house.

241
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,742
- No one's in the house now?

242
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:57,812
- I mean, you can't
really see now,

243
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,347
but this was foggy.

244
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,950
Like someone had been
using my shower.

245
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,247
- What's out that door?

246
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,516
- It's a balcony.

247
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,913
- Well, I think the
place is clear.

248
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,249
Let's go,

249
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,785
I'll get your report down,

250
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,047
and figure out the
best way to proceed to

251
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,657
ensure that this
doesn't happen again.

252
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,047
<i>- Okay.</i>

253
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:40,897
- Can I help you?

254
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:17,927
- Settle down.

255
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,049
Settle down'

256
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,564
Because you've proven
you can't be trusted,

257
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,141
because you choose to trample

258
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,540
all over the rules
you agreed to.

259
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,770
The collar you're wearing
was designed for a dog,

260
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,898
because that's how
you force me to treat you.

261
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:45,982
If you go beyond a certain

262
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,089
perimeter around the house,
you get a shock.

263
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,559
It's simple enough for
a dog to understand,

264
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,039
but you can test it
if you don't believe me.

265
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,928
There are three levels.

266
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:03,893
One.

267
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,103
Two.

268
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:18,942
- Please stop'

269
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,527
- If you go beyond the boundary,

270
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:25,686
it goes straight to three.

271
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,130
Would you like to
see what that feels like?

272
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,341
Your father is going to
be so disappointed.

273
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,213
- You let me talk to him.

274
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:49,710
Then we'll see.

275
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,179
- You need to get well,
little girl.

276
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,018
Now where were you?

277
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:08,958
- Nowhere'

278
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,973
- Where were you
and who were you with?

279
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,032
- Nobody'

280
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,369
- I saw you'

281
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,544
I know what this is about.

282
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:25,746
Do you really want
to risk everything

283
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,516
we've accomplished
in this last year?

284
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,594
Are you so desperate
to destroy yourself?

285
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,059
- It's not what you think'

286
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,099
- We'll see.

287
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,602
Sit.

288
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:05,928
Don't make this any
harder then it already is.

289
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,237
And...

290
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:01,911
- This will make
you feel better.

291
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:42,007
Be the reflection of the
moon over the water.

292
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:44,911
The moon doesn't get wet.

293
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,716
And the water is never broken.

294
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:52,750
For all it's vastness,

295
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,257
the moon and the
entire sky can be

296
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,561
reflected in a puddle'

297
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,469
Even in a drop of water

298
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,870
When you cease to be the water,

299
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,969
and become the reflection.

300
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:19,114
You begin to fully realize the
limitless. of the light.

301
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,734
- What's going on in here?

302
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,864
What are you doing?

303
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:25,902
- Nothing.

304
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,800
- Come here and let
me look at you.

305
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,759
Tricky, tricky'

306
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,082
You've been busy'

307
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:41,551
- I didn't.

308
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:43,786
- Where's your toy then?

309
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,455
Where are you hiding it?

310
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,880
All right, you've had your fun.

311
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,537
Now give those to me.

312
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,043
You use to do the
same thing when

313
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:08,282
you were a baby'

314
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,086
If you thought
something was yours,

315
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:12,655
you wouldn't give it
up for anything.

316
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:21,765
You are entitled to
absolutely nothing.

317
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,930
The only thing standing
between you and the abyss,

318
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,409
is how much I love you'

319
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,639
You know what happens when
we run out of options.

320
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,282
You think this is the
end of anything?

321
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,109
You think it'll be
any different once I'm gone?

322
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,014
Who would you be without me?

323
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,240
- My god, what happened?

324
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,334
Are you okay?

325
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,609
Jesus, Ma-

326
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,738
Margo?

327
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,013
Do you remember me?

328
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,251
Can I take you home?

329
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,792
I can come inside,

330
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,218
if you don't want to be alone'

331
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:43,591
What is this?

332
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,222
What are you doing?

333
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,067
Margo, please...

334
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,508
- Why are you doing this?

335
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,379
I was just trying to help you.

336
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,005
Stop

337
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:21,635
- Margo, please.

338
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,494
- Good morning, little girl.

339
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,456
- Good morning.

340
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:05,095
- Please, I don't want it.

341
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:22,875
Please'

342
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,050
I need to go to the bathroom.

343
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:29,782
Will you just tell me what

344
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:33,013
I need to do to make this stop.

345
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,852
Please'

346
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,687
Just tell me what
I did and I'll fix it.

347
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,027
What are you gonna
do when people

348
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,036
find out about this?

349
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,299
Huh?

350
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,534
What are you gonna do?

351
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,018
Don't, please'

352
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,053
Please'

353
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,304
Please.

354
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:51,466
You can look at me, you know.

355
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:55,645
You could talk to me.

356
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,920
I think I understand
what you want.

357
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,527
And if it's going to
make things okay,

358
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:06,861
I want to give It to you.

359
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,162
But you have to look at me.

360
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:26,710
You have to come closer.

361
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,048
Closer

362
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,451
Closer

363
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,576
What?

364
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:23,242
I'm sorry'

365
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:27,941
I didn't mean to upset you.

366
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,675
Fucking say something to me'

367
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,653
- All right.
We're almost done.

368
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,779
Do you need the paper?

369
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:39,748
No.

370
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,950
I can do it.

371
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,027
- Good.
Lets begin.

372
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,531
In futurity...

373
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:47,794
- I prophecy'

374
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,029
- That the earth from...
- Sleep.

375
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,161
- Grade the sentence.
- Deep.

376
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,707
- Shall arise and...
- Seek.

377
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,833
- From her maker...
- Meek.

378
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:57,966
- And the desert wild...

379
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:01,278
- Become a garden mild.

380
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,813
- I'm going to give you a word.

381
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,647
And I'd like you to
repeat it back to me.

382
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,490
I read a poem
that reminded me of you.

383
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:13,390
Wadda goda grazes.

384
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,150
- Matchbook.

385
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,857
That's good.

386
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,796
- I read a poem
that reminded me of you.

387
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,627
Can you ask me the
name of the poem.

388
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:29,536
- Ask me the name.

389
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,671
You fucking asshole'

390
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:32,801
You motherfuh...

391
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:35,140
I fucking hate this stupid,

392
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,740
motherfucking shit.

393
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,213
- Now stand.

394
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,380
Raise your right arm.

395
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,560
Now walk with me.

396
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:53,901
Put your right hand on the wall.

397
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,832
Hit the wall with your forehead.

398
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,537
- You are better at
throwing a javelin

399
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,612
<i>discus and shotput.</i>

400
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,212
I am the better swimmer.

401
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,717
You are better with people.

402
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,583
You are taller.

403
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,790
You are better making.

404
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,558
You are better making.

405
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,525
Our names are different.

406
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,228
Our faces are different'

407
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,872
I like to talk about
what it's like at the

408
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,566
bottom of the diff.

409
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,776
I like to talk about
to talk about what

410
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,208
it's like on the way down.

411
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:32,989
I was a breech birth.

412
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,469
I came out the wrong way.

413
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:45,705
My mother's cervix
wasn't dilated enough

414
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,007
for my head to pass through.

415
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,305
So I got stuck.

416
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,548
She wouldn't let me go.

417
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,154
Like she knew what would
happen when she did.

418
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,694
She died less than
an hour after I was born.

419
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:16,731
I killed her

420
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,649
I wonder sometimes
if I meant to.

421
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,481
Or would it...

422
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,820
How it would've
been if it was me.

423
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,382
But I know now,

424
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,063
that I'm still here
because of you.

425
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:45,435
I had to be here for
you to find me.

426
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:49,831
No'

427
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,673
I know what a difficult
position you're in.

428
01:12:58,441 --> 01:12:59,715
I know you're afraid'

429
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,455
You didn't want or...

430
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,685
expect things to
turn out this way.

431
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,696
But I want to know you too.

432
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:16,028
I know you imagined
a thousand versions

433
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,230
of us before you
finally found me.

434
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:26,474
There's a void in me,
that I know exists

435
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,740
in you too'

436
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,710
An empty space'

437
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:35,617
Where we both belong.

438
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:45,954
Margo'

439
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:54,770
Margo, please'

440
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,403
Janie, please'

441
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,072
- Janie?

442
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:05,573
Is that your real name?

443
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,570
- Sun choke.
