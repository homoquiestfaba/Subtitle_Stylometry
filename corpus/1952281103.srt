00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,175
<i>Hi, you've reached Meryl Morgan.
I can't take your call right now,</i>

2
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,803
<i>so leave a message and 
have a great day! Thanks.</i>

3
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,930
<i>Hello, it is me. Your...your husband.</i>

4
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:02,277
<i>At least legally I'm still your husband,</i>

5
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:04,904
<i>as recognized by the
State of New York.</i>

6
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,326
<i>And who need to argue
with the Governor?</i>

7
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>I wanted to call and just say hello,
as it is aproaching the three months anniversary of our "being separated".</i>

8
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,870
<i>I thought perhaps it might be nice to get together as you know,</i>

9
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:20,072
<i>as occasions like this only come around
once in a lifetime.</i>

10
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:25,809
<i>And, oh yes, and I saw the cover of
New York Magazine, writte "Estate Issue".</i>

11
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,902
<i>And there you were. And you looked lovely,
frankly.</i>

12
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,823
<i>You are staring out from every news stand,
and bus and taxi.</i>

13
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,981
<i>And ...it is,</i>

14
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,908
<i>It is genuinely incredible 
how you have built your business</i>

15
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,150
<i>into the premier boutique real estate firm in the city...</i>

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,113
<i>I'm quoting here from the article.</i>

17
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,168
<i>I have five copies. This way, 
if we ever get back together</i>

18
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:46,858
<i>and lose yours, we are covered...</i>

19
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,004
<i>Hi, you've reached Meryl Morgan.
I can't take your call right now,</i>

20
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,502
<i>so leave a message and 
have a great day! Thanks.</i>

21
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,906
<i>Anyway the point is...</i>

22
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:02,374
<i>The point is that I am sad.</i>

23
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,351
<i>And I miss you.</i>

24
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:08,050
<i>And I bitterly regret of what I did.</i>

25
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:11,713
<i>And it would be very, very nice, if you,</i>

26
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:14,626
<i>called or...in fact
if we could see each other.</i>

27
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,420
<i>I hope you are getting the gifts.
I know they are not all... perfect.</i>

28
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:23,024
<i>The ice sculpture, I can see
was a disaster.</i>

29
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,387
<i>I did specified they shouldn't 
leave it if you weren't home.</i>

30
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:27,389
<i>And I will be suing.</i>

31
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,056
<i>Talking of which, I must
get back to work.</i>

32
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,380
<i>I'm actually in court.
I have a man here...</i>

33
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:41,764
<i>Isn't this a beautiful view?
You can take this whole apartment just by charging people to come<i>

34
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,344
<i>and look at this.</i>

35
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,277
<i>And, if you like this,
you are going to love these.</i>

36
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,276
<i>What I call,</i>

37
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,595
<i>the ball room, or the...</i>

38
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:52,399
Grand salon.

39
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,288
It's the perfect combination
of classic architecture,

40
00:02:55,323 --> 00:02:57,316
and enunciate elegance.

41
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,884
You are pregnant?

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,179
I mean, if you are planning on having a baby,

43
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:18,625
this is the most magical place.
- How many children do you have?

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,202
How many? Let me see...
I have...

45
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,072
I have zéro.

46
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,351
My husband and I are separated.

47
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:31,899
I know what you are thinking.
The clock is ticking, right? L'horloge tic-tac, oui!

48
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:36,634
But I'm...You know, I'm considering adoption and...

49
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:42,250
Got to stay optimistic, you know.
Don't get down on yourself.

50
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:47,079
<i>Mister Morgan, I have the depositions
on the Anderson case for you.</i>

51
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,981
<i>Excellent, I'm here to page, though.</i>

52
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:51,050
<i>Now, where were the stars about?</i>

53
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,481
You can buy a name of star now.

54
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:58,254
It's seventy-five dollars and you get
sliction  map and the certificate.

55
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,774
Can we look for something more...impressive.
Can I buy the constellation?

56
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,969
I don't know. You can buy a black hole.

57
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:10,373
I'm not sure, the black hole isn't exactly
where our message is depointing our relationship.

58
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,544
Slucious, redante.

59
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,995
<i>Thank you and thank you to everyone</i>

60
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,332
<i>at The National Breast Cancer Foundation.</i>

61
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,230
<i>I'm so honored to be here tonight</i>

62
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,805
<i>On behalf of Park Avenue Realty.</i>

63
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:27,580
Thank you to Jimmy, my waiter,
a table number two. Yes, you!

64
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,120
I'm not done with dessert yet.

65
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:35,762
<i>This eve, we present the crises.</i>

66
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:40,146
Are we going to use this crises

67
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,306
to come out stronger,
better and

68
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,865
more powerful than ever before?

69
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,411
You bet we are!

70
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:52,720
<i>But...</i>

71
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:56,515
what that means...

72
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,318
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:13,206
Well I...Basically, what I'm sayin' is a...

74
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,530
We want your money!
Right now!

75
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,668
- Great speech!
- Thank you.

76
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,831
- And you look fantastic tonight, by the way.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:32,194
I still don't entirely understand
what are you doing here.

78
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,387
Breast cancer.
I'm against it.

79
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,689
Look, I just want to talk. I'll talk now,
I'll talk later, I'll talk tomorrow,

80
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:41,895
I'll talk over lunch, diner, brunch, snack time.

81
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,372
Ok, I get it.

82
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,934
- You are available for talking.
- Yes, yes.

83
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,298
Hey Jackie !

84
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,426
Jackie, how very nice, how are you ?

85
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,833
Mister Morgan.

86
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:03,012
- What do I have tomorrow ? 
- That Pina lunch.

87
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,694
Barbecue I imagine?

88
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,921
- What about after lunch?
- Excuse me. Hello Mrs Morgan.

89
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,361
- Hi Adam.
- After lunch you have the former conference call.

90
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,414
- Do I dare ask about the diner?
- Meryl got the shine at seven o'clock at Mr Rabelais.

91
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,664
You've got Mr Thompson for diner at seven.

92
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:23,640
You know, I think it just would be easier if Jackie and Adam
spoke to each other.

93
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,749
- Excelent idea.
- See that.

94
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,642
What happens with Paul at the lunch?

95
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,622
- Well..
- Don't mumble, Adam. Let's get it.

96
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,808
- How's your apartment?
- It's good.

97
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,796
So much more space without the golf clubs.

98
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,236
- How's your hotel?
- It's nice, it's nice.

99
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,926
There is no one sicken the snooze alarm,

100
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,361
for fifteen minutes before actually want to wake up.

101
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:47,267
I really enjoy not having anyone
walking to the master bedroom wearing their shoes

102
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:49,409
filled with dirt and germs from whole of the city...

103
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:53,273
That must be very, very nice. As is not stepping
on discarded Lady Gillette in the shower.

104
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,908
Which I actually become to miss.

105
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:01,390
I can push Mr Rabelais at nine o'clock
if Adam can reschedule Mr Morgan dinner.

106
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,383
- I think I can't.
- Just do it, be a man.

107
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,746
Excelent then...

108
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,661
Shall we say at Danube...seven ?

109
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,059
Ok.

110
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,766
- Great. Terrific.
- Good night.

111
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,584
Good night.

112
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:28,454
So...

113
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,466
Did you get the yucca? 
I know you like plants.

114
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:37,704
And far, far away there is now galaxy
called Meryl.

115
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:43,479
You have to stop sending me things.
It's just getting very awkward.

116
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,422
I understand. I will.
I promise.

117
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:48,485
I just have one more little thing.

118
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,061
Ok, look, i know you always wanted
us to go, and I procrastinated

119
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,125
but I thought this might make up for it.

120
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,192
Dr Tobin is apparently the best
marriage counselor in the city.

121
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,751
I know who she is. I found her duplex on Madison.

122
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:11,086
Ok. And the Lerners recommended it.

123
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:13,960
- Erick and Fiona ?
- Yes.

124
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,525
They've been divorced a year.

125
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,341
They have, but one thing they do agree
is how much they love Dr Tobin.

126
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,712
- Apparently she wrote some book.
- Yes.

127
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,398
"The magic marriage mythe".

128
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,874
Don't you see? You are so well read.
I really miss that.

129
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,311
It's all about people's expectations that

130
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,945
their spells will be the answers
to all their problems.

131
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,665
when in fact they should be facing reality

132
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,468
and not asking their partners
for more they can get.

133
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,843
Brilliant, brilliant..

134
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,530
I don't know. I found her theory kind of depressing,
don't you?

135
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,715
Yep, yep.

136
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,102
If you do.

137
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:54,738
Can you...can you please stop being so
agreable, please.

138
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:57,760
Whatever you say.

139
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,453
So...

140
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,891
-See, you know, I'd do showing tonight
but I think my client is a town house.
-Yes. 

141
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,825
Will you walk with me?

142
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:31,633
Absolutely, yes.

143
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:32,932
Adam, we are gonna walk.

144
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,436
- You are going to walk?
- Yes.

145
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,388
Is everything all right?
Did we do something wrong?

146
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,946
No, everything is ok.

147
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,257
We did something wrong.

148
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,431
Here comes the rain.

149
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,385
Did you slept with someone else, Paul?

150
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:58,301
You are not gonna talking about the weather.

151
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:04,865
OK, all right, it's overcast with 
one hundred percenters chance of perception.

152
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,926
- Did you slept with someone else?
- I'm sorry.

153
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,436
I was confused.
I was an idiot.

154
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,952
I was wrong. I made a terrible mistake.

155
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,579
I love you.

156
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,499
Do you still love me at all?

157
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,314
I don't know if I can sort of love you.

158
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,745
- Or love you a little.
- Well, I'm fine with that.

159
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,319
Honestly, I can get by
with less love for a while.

160
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,092
Many years.

161
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,673
That's not me.

162
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,042
I have to go. I have the meeting.

163
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,345
Look...

164
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,631
I just think we should give
Dr Tobin a chance.

165
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,176
- You know...
- Hey, there is my client.

166
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,213
What is he doing in the rain without an umbrella?

167
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,568
What we are doing in the rain without an umbrella?

168
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:05,497
Mr Rabelais ?

169
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,086
Mr Ra...

170
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,055
<i>A man who was murdered tonight?
Girard Rabelais?</i>

171
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,952
<i>He was international arm stealer.</i>

172
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:45,101
<i>FBI was moving into convicte it.</i>

173
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,837
<i>So Rabelais was working with us</i>

174
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,825
to captured this man.

175
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,934
Anton Forenski.

176
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,703
We think that's why Forenski had him killed.

177
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:56,520
If we find a murderer, maybe
he'll lead us to Forenski.

178
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,658
And you gonna be our star witnesses.

179
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:03,015
But right now I just wanna concentrate
on keeping you safe.

180
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,810
What do you mean "safe" ?

181
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,089
- This guy is still out there.
- Yeah, but he doesn't know who we are.

182
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:13,079
I'm gonna give you twenty-four hours protection
in your apartment anyway.

183
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:16,434
Oh, well...We don't live together.

184
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,129
He's at the hotel 'cause
we are separated.

185
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:21,526
My wife and I see someone
once a week.

186
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,662
Is not by any chance Dr Tobin, isn't?

187
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,080
I know it's been a rough night,
so get some rest and I'll talk with both of you tomorrow.

188
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:31,120
Right.

189
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,455
Mrs Morgan, this is Marshal Henderson.
He will be taking care of you.

190
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,576
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

191
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,938
You do...want me to stay tonight?

192
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:43,253
No, no I think I'm gonna be fine 
with Marshal Henderson.

193
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,299
Well, If you think you can handle it,
but...

194
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,893
Mrs Morgan, I have a car right over here.

195
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,390
Well, good night.

196
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,119
Mr Morgan, Marshal Ferber.

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,587
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.

198
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:03,308
- You are in good hands.
- Yes, I'm sure.

199
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,624
<i>..guess time.</i>

200
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,498
<i>That is good news, Vincent.</i>

201
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,843
<i>We'll be tomorrow on the island.</i>

202
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:13,968
No problem.

203
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:23,753
<i>Hello.</i>

204
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,551
Oh hi, Marshal Lasky.

205
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,399
Oh...

206
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,910
You gonna send someone
to reveal Marshal Henderson it's good, 

207
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:32,991
because you know, he's been up there the whole night.
He must be exhausted...

208
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:35,837
can you hold on just a sec...?
My intercome is ringing.

209
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:38,763
Ok, I'm just get...I'm gonna put you on hold.

210
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,190
Ok.

211
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,943
Hi Mike.

212
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:48,658
Yep? Ok.
Thank you.

213
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:54,895
Hi, so I-I can see your guys
are already here because the doorman

214
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:57,845
said they just
sent police officer up.

215
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,199
What?

216
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,281
Hey. How are you doin'?

217
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:09,374
Ok, Ok.

218
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,836
Get back inside!

219
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,932
Oh, my God!

220
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,044
Help!

221
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:37,880
<i>Stop pushing the button.</i>

222
00:14:58,596 --> 00:14:59,603
Sir, it's an emergency.

223
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,790
Well, I certainly hope so not.

224
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:05,968
Thank you. Do you mind, do you mind ?

225
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,810
Not at all.

226
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:14,810
We checked the building security camera, but he was
pretty careful about keeping his head down.

227
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,203
So, is-is Marshal Henderson ok?

228
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,349
He was wearing his west. He will be all right.

229
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,515
But this guy is still out there.

230
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,255
I recommend you both enter
the Witness Relocation Program.

231
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,180
What?!

232
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:29,195
- Hang on.
- Wait... - Hang on.

233
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,887
Do you mean where they sent you out

234
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:35,068
into the middle of nowhere, yeah?

235
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,654
- Oh, no, no.
- I tell you what...Why don't we...

236
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:40,518
Why don't we just look at all the options.
Cause I'm sure there are options.

237
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,538
And where?
Where we go?

238
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,875
We can't revealed that
until you are on the jet.

239
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,680
There is a jet?

240
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,619
So-so it's out of the city?

241
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,691
Here is what I think we should do.
Let's just stay logical

242
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,503
and examine all the parametres, if that's possible.
- I can't leave. I can't leave.

243
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,330
I have a company to run.

244
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:58,247
- We both have companies to run, so that's...
- Right, right. So who's gonna running my business?

245
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:03,610
- All I'm saying is...
- And what about all our friends

246
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:07,661
and our family?
We just-we just up and disappeared, we leave?

247
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:12,018
That's crazy?
That's nuts! That's what you are suggesting?

248
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,716
We don't know what he's suggesting
because you haven't actually stop talking yet so...

249
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,988
Excuse me, this isn't the first time
we've done this.

250
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,686
We'll get a list of people to contact.

251
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:23,681
But first, we got to get you
to a safe location.

252
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,450
And what happens if you never find this man?

253
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,512
We'll find him. In the meantime
we'll put you on a temporary spot

254
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,138
until we can find the more permanent site.

255
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,900
What do you mean by permanent?

256
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:35,699
I don't mean permanent. I mean official site.

257
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:39,625
Yeah, but you said permanent. 
So, so if you don't catch this guy

258
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,818
then the official site becomes the permanent site?

259
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,317
So, why we don't just let him explain that a little bit.

260
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:48,491
Oh no, no, no I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

261
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,244
Really, I can't, you know.

262
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,336
I am New Yorker.
You know, I was born here.

263
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,228
This is my home. I don't have bagels
in another parts of the country.

264
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,605
I don't even like Connecticut!

265
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,308
This man is a professional killer.

266
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:06,326
He found you in one night
and he'll keep coming back.

267
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,550
Wouldn't you rather live some place else
than die in New York ?

268
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,126
Meryl?

269
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,170
- I'm thinking.
- There is nothing to think about.

270
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,870
If you wanna live,
you are out of options.

271
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:26,014
I'm sorry, I don't need to drive

272
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,750
our personal problems into this, but

273
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,566
at this exact moment, I can't

274
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,056
commit spending the rest of
my life with my husband.

275
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,193
I know exactly how do you feel.

276
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,592
This is just a temporary location.
You'll be there a week at most.

277
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,820
We are looking to arrange the separate sites
afterwards, but first

278
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,705
we got to get you out of city.

279
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,606
I don't...You won't tell me where I'm going
so I just...

280
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,000
I just don't know how with this?

281
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:05,021
Well...This, 'cause it's pretty?!

281
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,422
Now, that we are on the jet, 
can you tell us to where we are going?

282
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,640
Ray, Wyoming.

283
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,925
Is that near Phil, Vyoming ?

284
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,571
Here your temporary IDs.

285
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,876
You'll be in seclusion, 
just in case you run into anybody,

286
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:45,067
we don't want you using
your real identities.

287
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,338
- Meryl Foster?
- You'll be under the care of Marshal Clay Wheeler.

288
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:50,500
He's also the sheriff in town.

289
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:53,525
Meryl, you are Clay's cousin from Chicago.

290
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,718
You haven't seen him for five years. 
Since he's been visiting you and Paul.

291
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,398
Any questions?

292
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,405
<i>Do we get the movie?</i>

293
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,762
<i>We are here. It's time.</i>

294
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:34,637
Marshal Wheeler will take good care of you.

295
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:36,630
You are not coming?

296
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:38,943
I'm going back to find this guy.

297
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,505
Good luck.

298
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,401
Good-bye.

299
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:46,122
- Thank you Marshal.
- Thank you.

300
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,296
- Thank you Marshal.
- Thank you.

301
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,139
Is that him?

302
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:34,701
If it is, I feel safe already.

303
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,078
- Oh, my God!
- What?

304
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:53,917
You gonna love this.

305
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,455
- Shouldn't we writing this down?
- Don't worry , they are all over town.

306
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:06,460
The posters, not the bears.

307
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:10,145
- Hi, are..are you...
- Glad to see you.

308
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,300
Indeed.

309
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,764
- Can take your bag?
- Oh, thank you. - Thanks.

310
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,960
Come with me.
And got to stay stay away from...

311
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:25,014
Welcome to Wyoming.
I'm U.S. Marshal Clay Wheeler.

312
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,557
Thank you. Hello.

313
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,900
Hello. I'm Meryl Morgan.

314
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:32,415
No, I don't think so, Ma'am.

315
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:37,239
- You mean I've been wrong all these years?
- You are Meryl Foster.

316
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:41,203
I'm your cousin.

317
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,734
Are you cold?

318
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,701
There just.. only matter to bring one bag

319
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:50,305
so I didn't pack the right underwear for strike this count.

320
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:51,730
Same here.

321
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:57,180
Temperature really drop around here at night.

322
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,852
so you'll bet keeping yourself in warm.

323
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:03,508
Thank you, if there is, first to fit in...

324
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,196
Sure, there is "Bargain Barn".

325
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:08,735
Gotta to swing up there anyway.

326
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,954
I've never been to "Bargain Barn".

327
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:15,324
- Are you pulling on my leg?
- We don't have them in New York.

328
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,082
- What's got to do with anything?
- That's why I've never been to one.

329
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,744
I'm still not following you.

330
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:32,054
They don't have "Bargain Barn" in New York.

331
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:35,946
So that's why I've never been to one.

332
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:39,190
We also never been to one in Chicago.

333
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,562
Which is where we from.

334
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:43,308
- Oh, I see... - Oh Jeez...

335
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:51,472
It's huge. I have no idea.

336
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,688
Astonishing.

337
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,573
It's all about folk .

338
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:02,760
This can be right. 
A sweater... for nine-ninety-nine?

339
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:06,496
It's not right. It's two for one.

340
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:10,110
- C'mon.
- Where is man's wear?

341
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:12,722
Wait a minute.

342
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,616
Okay, see that woman, see that woman,

343
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:38,103
guess what is in his bags!

344
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,556
- French's bread?
- Guns. Big guns.

345
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,156
- Oh Lord, she's comin'.
- Oh my God, it's Sarah Palin.

346
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:48,351
Actually my name is Emma.
Emma Wheeler, 

347
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:50,812
but you can call me Deputy Wheeler.

348
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,924
- Oh... so. So, you are married?
- Oh yeah.

349
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:58,897
That's what she needed.
A couple more guns.

350
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:03,059
- I love them. Do you have mere?
- Just for bargains.

351
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,685
Actually , I'm a member of PETA.

352
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,204
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

353
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:15,285
So am I... except mines:
People for Eating Tasty Animals (PETA).

354
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:20,145
You got to know when you appreciate her humor.

355
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,600
Sometimes I think that will help.

356
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,097
Hey, I just want to say that
I think what you people are doing is very brave.

357
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:34,041
And it will be an honor to protect you
and I hope you'll be real comfortable here at us.

358
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:37,337
Thank you. Thank you very much...
I must say I imagine there is to be

359
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:41,151
less multiform, but this "Bargain Barn" is fantastic

360
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:45,344
so we move it here down to road,
in Applebee's....

361
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:51,206
Well this is Cody, Ray's forty-five miles that way
and there is no "Bargain Barn" in there.

362
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:15,035
Here is Ray.

363
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,791
That was it.

364
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,790
Could we do it again.
I think I missed this.

365
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,539
So, if that's Ray, where are we goin'?

366
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:36,269
Oh, a few miles outside the town.
We like to get away from the hustle and bustle.

367
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:45,254
C'mon in. Watch where you step.

368
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:53,000
Yep, that is it.

369
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:54,607
Home, sweet home.

370
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,705
- Very, very nice. 
- Yes, I love what you've done with the...

371
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:05,328
- ...the heads.
- Thanks.

372
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,095
Yeah, we killed all these animals ourselves.

373
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,800
Oh, that's great. I hate when you have
the decorator do it for you.

374
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,787
Well, I got brother around the Cheyenne
he's happy to garment so ...

375
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:18,136
That's handy. Any word from New York?

376
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:21,950
- No, ma'am.
- So, you folks are hungry? We got pleanty to eat.

377
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,010
- No no me, I had my fill on the four stars of New York flight.
- Chicago.

378
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:27,443
Chicago.

379
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:30,794
Well, you probably wanna be gettin' some shower...

380
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,464
I 'll show you to your room.

381
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:36,713
Hope you'll be comfortable in here. 
We fixed up this spare bedroom.

382
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:41,052
Not exactly the Ritz.
We usually only have one witness at the time.

383
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:44,215
The last was Vito "The Butcher" Emanuel.

384
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,905
Murdered five people before he turns
state's evidence.

385
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,666
- So, you actually do this all the time?
- Yeah.

386
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,765
About ten yers ago the government asked 

387
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:54,923
if we can hide somebody for a week.

388
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:58,820
There was since then a couple of times a year
they bring the somebody by.

389
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:02,087
Mankind is interested, actually.

390
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:06,107
Now they want me to retire.

391
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,742
So, you two are gonna be our last.

392
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,553
Well it's an honor
and that's a lovely witness room but um...

393
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:20,238
Mr Morgan ... Mr Foster and I 
are separated.

394
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,369
We are thinking of seeing a therapist, yeah.

395
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:29,715
So, how do you want to handle the sleeping arrangement then?

396
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:34,193
- Well I'm... I can sleep on the couch. - No, no I'll sleep on the couch.
- No, no, I'll sleep...really...

397
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:37,364
I'll be fine on the couch.

398
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,466
- And, um, do you have a cable?
- We have an anthena.

399
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,688
We got bunch of DVDs.
John Wayne and Clint Eastwood :) mostly.

400
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:48,611
That's great. That's great.

401
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:52,298
Oh but I see you have a computer.

402
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,221
So that means you-you have a Internet? 
You are on-line?

403
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:59,240
We do, but you'll need a code .

404
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,550
- Which you are not gonna give me.
- No.

405
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:05,689
Try to contact somebody back home 
is just too big risk.

406
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,090
I guess the same goes for the phone,
'cause I just have a couple of things I have to check on.

407
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,627
- If I can make one quick call.
- And, you know, you can supervise the calls.

408
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,123
- There is no dial tone.
- There is a code.

409
00:28:23,372 --> 00:28:27,129
So, I guess that is about it. 
There is towels and soap in the bath.

410
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,233
Great, terrific. Is there a code?

411
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:35,233
It's all right, silly.

412
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,970
- You sure you gonna be happy on that thing?
- Yeah, I'm good.

413
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,025
I'm good.

414
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,525
All right.

415
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:54,967
Good night.

416
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,649
Good night, good night, bye everyone.

417
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:02,650
Look Paul, I know how hard you are tryin'.

418
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,923
Really I do, I'm not not completely oblivious.

419
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:12,391
And believe me, it would...it would be so much easy
if I just can make myself forget.

420
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:17,415
But...

421
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,952
When I look at you, I just feel regret.

422
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:27,170
And sadness and-and deep desire to see you sufferin'.
intense  pain.

423
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:31,753
Listen that's not a problem, that's not a problem. 
I have more than willing to hurt myself.

424
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:34,769
Or would you prefer to do it. Whatever takes...

425
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:38,475
Just, tell me what to do.
Tell me.

426
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,579
I don't know.

427
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,222
- I don't know.
- The thing is, Meryl...

428
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:47,591
I'm just trying to be realistic.

429
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:50,950
You know, I'm human. I made a mistake.
I am not perfect.

430
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:53,129
No, I know you are not.

431
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:57,782
But, I was so in love with you.

432
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:02,375
And now I'm just...

433
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,158
I'm just...

434
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:11,337
I'm so dissapointed.

435
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:17,337
And I don't trust you anymore.

436
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,111
All right.

437
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,058
Good night.

438
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:33,257
Good night.

439
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,608
Jackie,

440
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,578
did you hear about the Morgans?

441
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:17,205
- Of course I heard, totally devastating.
- They are in protected custody.

442
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,165
- Adam, I heard.
- What we gonna do? 

443
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,560
What we can do?
We can...

444
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:25,205
- Yes?
- There is a client here for Mrs Morgan.

445
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,103
Sure, send him back.

446
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:32,268
- Can I help you?
- If you are busy, I'll come back later.

447
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:35,112
Not at all. He was just leaving.

448
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:39,392
Yeah, I'm in the market for two bedrooms,

449
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,402
friend refer me to Meryl Morgan.

450
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,939
- Would you have a seat?
- Yeah.

451
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,297
Excuse me.

452
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm Jackie. Mrs Morgan's assistant.
She's not in today.

453
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:02,013
Can I give you one other agent to talk to you?

454
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:07,057
You know, if she's as good as everyone says,
I'm sure she's probably workin' the way.

455
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,199
She is.

456
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,366
- I'm sorry for takin' of your time.
- Not at all.

457
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,353
Nice lookin' muffin there.

458
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,237
Enjoy your breakfast.

459
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:34,048
Howdy.

460
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:38,839
- How about bet I wake you?!
- Oh no, no I didn't really sleep.

461
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:41,294
- It's too quiet here.
- You're hungry?

462
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:46,324
Smells good.

463
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:49,526
Oh, that's impressive.

464
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:54,040
I've never turn my oven on.
Oh look at that, fire comes out from everything.

465
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,247
You want sausage or bacon above,
with your eggs and pancakes?

466
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,348
Oh,no, no thanks,  I'm actually vegetarian.

467
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,597
- Good mornin'.
- I got news for you , sheriff.

468
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:08,385
Your cousin here is a vegetarian.

469
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,596
Yeah, what a things gonna happen' in your own family?!

470
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,816
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

471
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:15,722
Good morning.

472
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:17,271
Good morning.

473
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,330
- Howdy.
- How did you sleep?

474
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:23,312
Not really it needs . Very, very quiet, isn't it?

475
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,771
I thought I've been actually hearin'
my cells dividing.

476
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,962
I kept prayin' for a siren.

477
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:30,832
Yes, or rumbling subway or something.

478
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,828
Speaking of New York, 
have you heard anything?

479
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,304
No, ma'am. You can ask 
every five minutes...

480
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,241
What they told me, I'll tell you.

481
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:44,850
I saw a photo of a young man, isn't it?
I tell you he was something.

482
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:47,628
That's our boy.

483
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:51,171
- Clay Junior.
- Oh, does he live in Ray too?

484
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:54,652
No, he married a girl from Omaha 
so he moved to a big city.

485
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:58,379
- Big city?
- Omaha.

486
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,625
Here we go, 
sunny side eggs, sausage and bacon,

487
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,969
home fries, homemade biscuits and country gravy.

488
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,562
- Can I get you anything else?
- No thanks just an angiogram.

489
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,611
We gonna make a rounds. 
It will be the best for you to stay here.

490
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:19,650
The minor people see you there,
the safer you are.

491
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,653
But it's a shame, cause Ray is the
friendliest place on earth.

492
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:26,161
Help yourself with anything
in the fridge if you are hungry.

493
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:29,157
- We will be back in couple hours.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

494
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,825
I can't believe this is happening.

495
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:39,991
Well, at least you didn't have 
the whole breakfast. 

496
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:42,191
I feel my organs shuting down one by one.

497
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,291
I thought Disneyland was
the friendliest place on earth.

498
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,069
No, no Disneyland is the happiest 
place on earth, 

499
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,036
Ray is the friendliest place.

500
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:54,678
People probably get confused all the time.

501
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:04,322
What if we never get out of here? 
What if we never get to Lincoln Center again,

502
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:07,236
or see the Mets, or see our friends,

503
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:09,883
or sit on Great monument with New York Times,

504
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,666
walk with the Shakespeare in park,
or go to Noble,

505
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:15,604
or order chinese? 
Good , do you know how long

506
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,555
will take to order a chinese,
it will be a weeks, and it will be cold.

507
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,549
Ok, stop, stop. Now listen to me, listen to me.

508
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:23,389
We are here and there is nothing
we can do about it.

509
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,464
There is no phone calls to make,
there is no connections to work,

510
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,364
there is no favors to call in.

511
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,492
I think you should treated
as a vacation.

512
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,727
A welcome break in your busy schedule.

513
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,399
- Okay. 
- Good.

514
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,079
Ok, you're right. Ok.

515
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:44,801
God, I'm going mad as a hatter...!!!

516
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,869
At least you are going your best shot. 
That's really all we can ask.

517
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,083
They did say not to leave.

518
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,252
Oh, c'mon...

519
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:56,849
Perhaps I can come with you,
to protect you.

520
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,114
And I really won't to be alone on my own.

521
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:22,908
God, I can't breathe,

522
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:25,501
air is too clean.

523
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,112
I'm gonna to shower.

524
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:44,159
Paul.

525
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,400
- Paul, don't move.
- Sorry?

526
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,989
There is a bear behind you.

527
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:53,049
Yes, there is.

528
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:55,572
Oh, shit!

529
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:59,019
No, no, no! Don't run.

530
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:01,037
The poster said not to run.

531
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:04,365
Wait. Hold on. I'm gonna to get it, okay, Hold on?!

532
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,136
Come back! No, Meryl!
Come back!

533
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,728
Come back! Please.

534
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,020
Meryl! Meryl! Meryl! Meryl!

535
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,904
Okay, oh God, okay.

536
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:16,409
Keep calm!

537
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:20,647
Ok avoid direct eye contact,

538
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:23,123
And speak in a false monotone.

539
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,392
Nice to meet you.
My wife is a member of PETA.

540
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,485
- I'll be meaning to join.
- Don't shoot at bear...

541
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,208
- I don't have a gun!
- because the bear

542
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,794
almost always lives...

543
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,855
long enough to mold the shooter severely.

544
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,964
I don't have a gun!!!

545
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,331
Soothing... Soothing...

546
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,493
Sorry... sorry...I don't have a gun...

547
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:48,149
- No gun.
- Wait, wait! there is one last thing... - What is it?

548
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,039
- You don't need to hear this?
- What is it?

549
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:57,720
Ok, at a last resort a summon cannonball position

550
00:38:57,755 --> 00:39:02,181
covering your neck and your head
with your hands and your arms...

551
00:39:02,182 --> 00:39:03,155
I didn't need to hear that! 

552
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,719
I know that. I told you that.
You never listen. 

553
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:09,088
- This is exactly...
- Do we knock this enough?

554
00:39:09,628 --> 00:39:10,912
Oh my God, Paull, he's comin'...

555
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:13,580
- Run, run!
- It says not to run!

556
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:15,573
Run! Run!

557
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:17,747
Run! Run! Run!

558
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:23,259
Okay, he's goin'.

559
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,683
Yeah, he's goin', we gonna be okay.

560
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:28,388
My eyes, I can't see.

561
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,602
That was close...

562
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:44,836
Oh no...

563
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,256
There you go.

564
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:54,812
Ok, let's have a look, see here.

565
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,659
- You are from Chicago, Mrs Foster ?
- Yeah, that's right.

566
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:03,840
I've always dream about Chicago...

567
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,719
Oh, well I'm sure one day you will get there.

568
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:08,530
Oh, no I don't wanna go.
I just always dream about it.

569
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:13,829
Is this gonna be much longer? 
Because my husband

570
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,618
- is very uncomfortable.
- Oh Lord I'm hurt.

571
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:20,626
Oh, yeah. Oh, look at him.

572
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,632
He's a mass. 
He should see a doctor.

573
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:31,000
Laughter really is the best medecine.

574
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,748
So... You sprayed yourself with
the bear spray, Mr Foster.

575
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:41,355
Oh no, actually I hurt him.
I mean unintentionaly, of course.

576
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:45,270
Anyway, do you think maybe
he should see a specialist?

577
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:49,717
Well, I'm the only doctor in town 
so I'm better specialist as gets.

578
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,281
Do everything from geriatrics
to pediatrics.

579
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,152
Well don't want to confuse us too.

580
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:59,501
No. You don't.
And it's a great thing about being a doctor in small town.

581
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:02,676
You've seen it all. 
Anyway, physiologically,

582
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,873
is all the same. Body is the body.

583
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:07,749
So, see if we can take care

584
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,766
of that boo boo in your eye, Mr Foster.

585
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,415
You see, just calling it boo boo
makes me feel better already.

586
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,449
Let's go next door, the exam room.

587
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,098
Say, would you like to come with us Mrs Foster?

588
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:20,356
- No, it's fine. 
- Be careful there, Mr Foster.

589
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,891
Say, do you like stickers?

590
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:26,052
Here, let's take a little visit to giraffa room.

591
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:11,186
"You've reached Trish Pinger at 
"Gotham adoption agency"...

592
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:12,445
please leave a message."

593
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:17,006
Oh, hi Trish. This is um...Meryl Foster,
um...

594
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,817
Meryl Morgan calling.

595
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:24,293
I just...I was...I was just calling to thank you
so much for everything that you've done for me

596
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:27,904
but I'm now...sort of in the middle of something,

597
00:42:27,939 --> 00:42:31,065
I might be relocated...
I won't might be in New York...

598
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,309
I'm..I'm in God knows where.

599
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:36,193
That not sound very stable right now, right?

600
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,488
Probably I can't believe you gonna 
help me adopt a baby...

601
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:53,688
Got to sue them for that.

602
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,301
Ok, I'll walk... Good night.

603
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:00,562
Good night.

604
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:09,904
Paul.

605
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:13,224
I called "The Gotham adoption agency".

606
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:19,246
I filed for adoption
two months ago.

607
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:23,400
You did?

608
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:29,074
So, I wanted to tell them that
I couldn't go through it now.

609
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,160
Two months ago?

610
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,252
Must be a big decision for you...

611
00:43:40,472 --> 00:43:42,968
I really thought about tellin' you...
but I didn't ...

612
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:45,394
really know where we were at...

613
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:47,882
And,and to be honest, 

614
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:50,487
you know, from the time when we started 
having trouble getting pregnant,

615
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:52,809
you weren't exactly support it...

616
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:54,915
You know, I'll always find it possible
to believe what... you say that,

617
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,161
'cause between fertility doctors and the injections,

618
00:43:57,162 --> 00:43:59,171
and the woman who chanted over my sperm...

619
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:02,179
C'mon, I've apologized for that so many times!

620
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:03,993
That I was pretty supportive.

621
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:06,985
Was I enjoying having sex on a scheduled time
exactly to your ovulations?!

622
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,594
Maybe not as much I should have done.

623
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:10,056
And I'm very sorry about that.

624
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:12,958
Or talking about reproducing
every second of every day.

625
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,731
It wasn't every second of every day,

626
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,719
I just wanted to be a mother.

627
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,917
And I wanted to be a father. 
I was the one who suggested adoption in the first place.

628
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,354
So why we've never meet with an adoption agency?

629
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:25,394
Because by that time you were
become so wired,

630
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,101
and so crazy that they will not
bless us to raise

631
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:28,896
a goldfish,
and let alone a baby.

632
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:31,216
You know I was wired from a hormone shots...

633
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,095
and I'm not normally that crazy.

634
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,074
And instead of you staying home...

635
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:37,493
and dealing with it...

636
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:40,333
you flew off to LA on a business meeting...

637
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,241
And then... Oh right!

638
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:44,959
I know what I did.
I slept with someone else and I'm so sorry!

639
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:46,858
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

640
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,392
I'm so sorry! 
I'm so sorry!

641
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:49,816
I don't know how many times I suppose to say that?!

642
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:51,688
I thought you've been completely irrational.

643
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:54,360
This two are worse than Vito "The Butcher".

644
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,451
I  kind of like them.

645
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,729
I wish there's somebody who can help them.

646
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:04,331
Yeah. Muzzles!

647
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:06,718
<i>- You think that I'm unreasonable?
- You aren't.</i>

648
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,894
<i>Is that helpful?
Is that constructive?</i>

649
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:10,388
<i>Is that mature?</i>

650
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:13,374
<i>It's mature. I don't know what it's "mature".</i>

651
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:16,931
<i>Oh, that is mature. Yes, mock my accent.
Mock my heritage.</i>

652
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,947
<i>We got to get them out of the house.</i>

653
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:20,902
</i>Yeah sure, go ahead.</i>

654
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,788
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

655
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:26,279
There is all these meetings being reset.
All these clients.

656
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:28,948
You think you've got problems?
She's the president of the firm.

657
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:30,331
Nothing happens here without her.

658
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:32,328
And everybody is looking at me like:
"Where is she"?

659
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,279
I'm gonna lose my job.
Without him I'm superfluous.

660
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:36,891
I can't used to you even with him.

661
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:41,215
Meryl Morgan's office?

662
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,967
She's not in, today.
Hello Mrs Pinger, yes...from the adoption agency.

663
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:46,979
What?

664
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:49,233
Meryl called you?
Yesterday?

665
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:53,015
Do you happened to...have that number?

666
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,496
Yes.
Could you just hold?

667
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:00,129
Hold on, just one moment.
Yes?

668
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:05,658
Thank you so much, Mrs Pinger.
All right!

669
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:15,555
This is Mike, Clarence,
Jackson and Wendy.

670
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:18,239
This is the one I'm gonna put you on, Meryl.

671
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,254
No, I'm sorry. No offence for Wendy.

672
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:22,839
But I'm allergic to you..
And I had once

673
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:24,886
very bad horse experience.

674
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,874
<i>I was thrown.</i>

675
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:29,951
It was on the carousel park department, still you know...

676
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,869
- You ride, Paul?
- Well I do, a little bit, yes.

677
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:35,871
I had some lessons when I was a child.

678
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,417
You had riding lessons?

679
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:40,350
Well, I've never knew that.

680
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,487
Yes, well I didn't tell you everything, so...

681
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,272
Yeah, I knew that.

682
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:05,797
Hey!

683
00:47:06,496 --> 00:47:08,204
Hey, I'm not on my horse!

684
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,723
<i>I'm not on my horse!</i>

685
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,720
<i>Get back on, we got target practice next.</i>

686
00:47:31,554 --> 00:47:33,345
All right, c'mon Meryl, your turn.

687
00:47:34,863 --> 00:47:36,672
All right, let's just get this over, will ya.

688
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,665
All right, this is a loaded gun.

689
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,370
- See, don't point that at another person while you are on stroke.
- Okay.

690
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:44,298
And, are you left-handed or right-handed?

691
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,956
Well, I...you know I write with left hand,

692
00:47:47,957 --> 00:47:50,407
but I play tennis and badminton with my right hand.

693
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:53,513
I text with my right hand.
I cut right...I cut cake with my left hand.

694
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:56,272
Ok, we gonna do it like this. 
Line it up to the sight.

695
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,663
To the can. Don't make gun goes up
it's gonna hit back.

696
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:01,470
- Okay.
- Move your shoulder. Ok?

697
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:04,611
- Yeah. - Don't put your finger 
on the trigger if you are not ready to shoot.

698
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:06,231
All right.

699
00:48:18,483 --> 00:48:20,456
This is nothing, you should see 
how long takes it to order dinner?

700
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:38,391
There you go!

701
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:40,650
- Good hit off.
- That was good.

702
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:43,329
- Wow, it's very, very loud.

703
00:48:44,497 --> 00:48:46,211
No, no. 'Cause I got two more cans.

704
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:48,646
I'm just gonna cock a gun for it.

705
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:51,215
Fascinating. A week ago she was
basically armored.

706
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,531
- All right.
- Yeah, I know.

707
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:54,898
- When you are ready to go.
- Ok.

708
00:48:55,168 --> 00:48:56,638
Keep your finger of the trigger.

709
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:58,308
You are ready.

710
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:07,612
- Missed!
- I think it's my turn now, isn't it.

711
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:09,882
- No, I'm not done yet.
- I think you're fine, it's my turn.

712
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,336
- I'm not done yet.
- It's my turn now, it's...

713
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:14,818
This thing is loaded.

714
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,565
Let me give you two NRA (National Rifle Association) class.

715
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:20,513
- Paul's turn.
- Thank you.

716
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:23,121
You are rude. Selfish.

717
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,931
- Just do it like you wanna kill.
- Right. Thank you.

718
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:30,370
Pull lever. Relax.

719
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:36,085
Relax.
Find your target.

720
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,790
Take a deep breath.

721
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,858
Easy.
Easy.

722
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:41,783
God in heaven that hurt.

723
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,602
- Agony.
- Yes.

724
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:48,318
Could you take it just for second?

725
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:51,067
I think I'm really done some damage. 
Meryl, I think I have a welt. A quite big welt.

726
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:53,027
Look at that.

727
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:54,653
- You see that?
- Yes. It's quite...

728
00:49:54,653 --> 00:49:56,859
Ugly.

729
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,309
It's really easy to hurt your shoulder
shooting of riffle.

730
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:03,767
- I didn't.
- Could you just..wait outside?

731
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:05,611
Play with the toy.

732
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:06,699
Thank you.

733
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:09,954
- You ever shoot before, Meryl?
- Nop.

734
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:12,086
Nop, never held a gun before in my life.

735
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:14,790
But I could use wandering some
intense negotiations at work.

736
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:17,254
- I'm a real estate broker.
- You kidding?

737
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:17,884
No.

738
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:21,943
My Mom is getting on
and she's movin' in with me.

739
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,424
I can't get any buyers on her house.

740
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:31,521
Oh, it's lovely, it's... 
But you know... 

741
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:34,665
when a market likes this, you really need to focus 
more on presentation. And...

742
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,516
I mean, just, you know...Just out of the 
top of my head think 

743
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:44,065
maybe that cheers sitting on front line
it looks very, very comfortable.

744
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,646
But have you ever considered
moving inside the house?

745
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:47,475
No.

746
00:50:48,664 --> 00:50:51,614
- Let's just think about it. It's...
- I will.

747
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:55,166
Would you mind to come around
and take a look at the place?

748
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:59,142
- Oh no, not at all.
- Do you spare her call?

749
00:50:59,177 --> 00:51:01,604
Absolutely. I'm used to being separated.

750
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,327
- The shoulder.
- The shoulder.

751
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,866
That's not separated. Just a tiny little bruise.
You aren't a school girl.

752
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:14,238
- Hi there.
- Hey! - Hey!

753
00:51:15,568 --> 00:51:16,646
How's your arm healin'?

754
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:19,417
Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing. I just went to the doctor
'cause Meryl was so worried.

755
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:23,630
Can I...give you a hand?

756
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:26,273
- Yeps, yeah.
- No problem.

757
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:38,612
I really just wanted to apologize,

758
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:40,171
for any trouble we may caused you.

759
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:42,732
I know there's been certain amount 
of screaming and shouting, so...

760
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:48,885
That's okay, I know what is like.
Me and Clay had a few countainers.

761
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,944
Really?

762
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:53,342
That's quite unconfident to hear

763
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,217
'cause you two seem so happy.

764
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,189
We are, but that doesn't mean 

765
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,156
that we hadn't call on foot a few times.

766
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,907
Really?

767
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:06,411
How'd you two touched things out, 
if I might to ask?

768
00:52:06,446 --> 00:52:08,220
Well...

769
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,246
He bought me a Remington 270 with
the night scope and "Emma" engraved on it

770
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:19,150
And he gave me some cows.
I love cows!

771
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,310
Great! Brilliant! I wish I 
thought of the cows thing. That's good.

772
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:28,065
Yeah, there is just one time
we were really buttin' heads.

773
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,833
Something about his brother.

774
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:33,273
It's not important but...

775
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:35,650
Anyway, God were we hardly talkin',

776
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:41,213
and...
he asked me on a date.

777
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,603
A date?

778
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:48,582
Yeah, just like two kids in the high-school.

779
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:53,222
He asked me out, we went out to dinner,

780
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:56,526
we talked and it work like magic.

781
00:52:56,561 --> 00:53:00,655
Very interesting.
Well, speaking of work,

782
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:03,629
I'm pretty much done here so...

783
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,522
See you later.

784
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:11,140
Thanks for coming.

785
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:13,490
Just while we standing here
I just want to point on a few things...

786
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:16,155
This whole railings is brand-new 
and actually Doc' built it himself.

787
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,554
Fresh color paint. 
I don't know if you guys wanna go inside

788
00:53:20,589 --> 00:53:22,587
kind a getaway of the land.
- I'll stay here.

789
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:25,631
You stay with me?

790
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:29,538
Listen, before you take those shoes off
you wanna go around

791
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,363
this biggest yard?

792
00:53:31,398 --> 00:53:33,716
I'll be right back.

791
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,184
You know, that kitchen little showzen... 
 
792
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:37,994
you can take it down,
you can build a gorgeous playing room down.

793
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:40,857
What's up?

794
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:43,673
This may sound strange,

795
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:45,144
but...

796
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:48,279
Would you like to go on date with me?

797
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:52,792
- You know, that does sound strange.
- Just, it's been a while sice we dine together.

798
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:55,785
We just had a dinner in New York.

799
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,732
And I thought it went well until the murder.

800
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:00,948
- Meryl, you're comin'?
- Oh, yeah. Just one minute.

801
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,308
I'll be in. Sorry.

802
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:04,441
Shall we say seven-thirty? 
It's a place called "Annette's"

803
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,714
I'm told this is the only place to eat in town.

804
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:08,829
Literally.

805
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:12,908
And it would just be a chance to sit and talk
like we used to before infertility

806
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:15,134
and unfidelity.

807
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:17,668
And separation.

808
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:22,251
I will pay.

809
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:23,489
Well, if you gonna pay...

810
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:37,507
Luckilly, I called to had gotten the table
near the mayonnaise.

811
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:41,580
- You must know someone.
- And I know you said no more presents, but I...

812
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:43,797
went on-line with Emma's supervision and

813
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:46,096
downloaded a CD of New York noises, 
that you can sleep.

814
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:49,599
Car hornes, subways, women
fighting in Bloomingdale's.

815
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:51,682
I think you might be actually on it.

816
00:54:53,726 --> 00:54:55,381
- Well, thank you.
- Very welcome.

817
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,545
- To your salads.
- Thanks.

818
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,600
Oh, actually I asked for mine
dressing on the side.

819
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:04,629
- I thought you are kidding.
- Yeah I know, that always gets a laugh.

820
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:08,345
- Have you been waitress a long time, Kelly?
- Oh, forever.

821
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,887
I can't get by on nursing
there is not just enough sick people in town.

822
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:15,553
- That's so unfair.
- Oh that's not so bad, most people around here have two jobs.

823
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:18,158
Sometimes three. I'm office assistant fire chief.

824
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:24,620
Oh really. Then, could you ask the gentlemen behind
us to please put down his cigarette?

825
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,291
Well, I can't do that. That's Earl and he owns this place.

826
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:32,002
- Why this calls Annette's?
- Annette was his wife.

827
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,281
She divorced him about ten years ago,
he doesn't want be paid.

828
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,375
Excuse me.

829
00:55:41,526 --> 00:55:44,649
Hi. I'm Meryl Foster,
I'm Clay's cousin,

830
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,771
and this is my husband Paul.
We are visiting from Chicago.

831
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:50,860
How do you do. I'm Earl Granger,

832
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:53,382
my granddaughter Lucy.

833
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:54,611
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

834
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:59,045
I was just wondering would you mind terribly
blowing smoke in another direction.

835
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,005
Thank you.

836
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:07,511
Chicago. I don't know how you 
do things in Chicago,

837
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:09,190
I've never been there,

838
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:12,264
but, this is God's free american country,

839
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:16,911
we don't take kindly the outsiders
tryin' to tell us how to live.

840
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:21,127
Well, people in Chicago are just as 
Americans in God's weariness 

841
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,799
as people in Wyoming,I mean

842
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:25,552
not me specifically, I'm an agnostic.

843
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:29,085
Next saying you've been tellin' us 
you are democrats?

844
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,210
Well, there is gotta be a few of us in town.

845
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:35,893
Fourteen. We know who they are.

846
00:56:35,928 --> 00:56:40,193
Thirteen. Will Harry died a month ago.

847
00:56:40,228 --> 00:56:42,205
Of natural causes or... ?

848
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:45,542
You are not getting smart with me, 
are you tea drinker?

849
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:48,474
You know what I did to the last man
who called me that?

850
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,069
I steal his crockett.

851
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:58,482
- Doc'!
- Howdy, Fosters.

852
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:02,113
- How are you tonight?
- We are good, we just had a lovely evening at "Annette's".

853
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,624
Must be Earl's night-off.

854
00:57:06,178 --> 00:57:07,176
Yeah.

855
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:15,398
- You okay? - We just need to call
Clay and Emma, they said they picked us up .

856
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,387
They are playing a poker with Millers
and Caseys .

857
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:23,448
Just take my truck. 
That one right there.

858
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:27,040
Oh, we couldn't possibly.

859
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:32,463
- I don't need it 'til tomorrow.
Doors are open, keys inside.
- Really?

860
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:36,662
Around here everybody leaves the keys 
in case somebody need a ride.

861
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,292
You don't do that?

862
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:43,095
People do take each other's car, but..

863
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,497
The return policy is little bit fuzzy.

864
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:50,390
You'll be sure to return mine, all right?

865
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,095
- Okay Doc', thanks.
- Thank you.

866
00:57:55,245 --> 00:57:57,426
Which one is it?

867
00:57:57,461 --> 00:57:59,959
I don't know, they are all exactly the same.

868
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,218
<i>Are we lost?</i>

869
00:58:05,253 --> 00:58:06,699
<i>Certainly not.</i>

870
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:10,790
<i>Are we lost?</i>

871
00:58:10,825 --> 00:58:13,489
<i>Certainly not. I turned
right to the broken fence.</i>

872
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,842
And left after the second big rock?

873
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:18,626
Second big rock?

874
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:22,152
Then we are lost.

875
00:58:22,187 --> 00:58:26,010
I'm going right up here.
No, I'm going around.

876
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,193
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

877
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,369
Why her?

878
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:42,492
You want to discuss it now?

879
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:46,378
- In the middle of absolutely nowhere?
- I know it's probably not the time, but...

880
00:58:46,413 --> 00:58:48,584
Why her?

881
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:52,516
I mean, you meet lots of women, 
you 're always at lunches and meetings, so...

882
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:57,417
Why her? And it was just she was pretty?

883
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:01,696
Who says she was pretty?
She's quite idiot, actually.

884
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:05,649
- A leper. Elephant-man had a sister...
- I Googled her.

885
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:10,010
Yeah, I just put under "loose legal ladies".

886
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,492
She's pretty.

887
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:20,857
So, what she like?

888
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,398
Reserved and little bit cynical.

889
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:33,425
I know, I can see that.
That make sense.

890
00:59:34,785 --> 00:59:36,401
It's probably like, you know,

891
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:41,850
going to a spa, very 

892
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,981
quiet, and cool and laid back.

893
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:50,301
Nobody nagging you,
or asking you questions

894
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,187
like some crazy, neurotic woodpecker.

895
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:56,732
you won't get an abolition... 
until you passed out...

896
00:59:56,767 --> 01:00:00,369
It was nothing. It was really nothing.

897
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,578
You know, I was stupid, 
I had a few drinks.

898
01:00:04,674 --> 01:00:07,783
I was upset about us...and...

899
01:00:07,818 --> 01:00:10,097
just happened, I did not enjoy it.

900
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,043
I was just feel quilty all the time...

901
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:15,794
and her parfume smelled little bit like a burrito.

902
01:00:19,523 --> 01:00:23,007
And...you...are...easily

903
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:30,844
the sexiest, the most exciting woman I've
ever been with or ever wish to be with it.

904
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,066
Hm.

905
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:43,430
I sort of believe you.

906
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:48,479
Good.

907
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,467
Progress.

908
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,452
<i>Maybe wasn't the fragrance.
Maybe she just smells like a buritto.</i>

909
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:00,895
<i>Very possible.</i>

910
01:01:39,746 --> 01:01:40,415
Hi.

911
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,006
- Good morning, Lucy.
- Lucy.

912
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:50,323
- Doc'.
- Hey, Doc'.

913
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:51,778
<i>Hey, Fosters.</i>

914
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:57,443
<i>It's a store. 
It's a real store.</i>

915
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:03,503
What was a hangle with kashmir? 
When they say they haven't, they just say go and look.

916
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,718
Excuse me, but you've never known, when you stick...

917
01:02:06,257 --> 01:02:08,357
So, you are a lawyer?

918
01:02:09,566 --> 01:02:11,618
Ah, sort of.

919
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:15,316
Well, this is about my granddaughter, Lucy.

920
01:02:16,336 --> 01:02:18,541
She's gonna be the next American Idol.

921
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:21,659
Is she? That's great, that's lovely.

922
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,317
Good.

923
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:27,300
Cheer her Dad sick, 
her mother is off to the army.

924
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,273
So that's leaves it up to old grandfather
look after her.

925
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,617
Truth is, I-I need a will.

926
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:36,875
Ah...

927
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:42,053
Ok well, the problem is
I really don't practice that kind of law.

928
01:02:43,244 --> 01:02:46,405
- What you practice?
- No, no ! He can't do it, he can't do it.

929
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:49,622
Hey listen, I got to go, 
I told Doc' that I'll help him with the house today, you know.

930
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:53,029
So, I'm just gonna go and show it.
I 'll see you later and have fun.

931
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:59,548
I got my financials cleared back to 1953.

932
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,458
Good, great that's sounds fun.

933
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,462
Okay. Okay.

934
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:08,514
But you know what? Despite our cultural differences,
I think you and I are going to be good friends.

935
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:13,013
Or not.
It's completely up to you.

936
01:03:23,914 --> 01:03:25,476
Eighteen.

937
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,248
- You had it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

938
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:30,230
- Window shut.
- Excellent.

939
01:03:30,615 --> 01:03:31,719
Well done.

940
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:35,327
<i>We got N 32.</i>

941
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:38,613
<i>N... N thirty-two.</i>

942
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:40,659
<i>N 33</i>

943
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:42,389
Hey, how you've got it away with Earl?

944
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:45,586
Really well, yes, I made such a beautiful will, 
he asked me to kill him.

945
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,773
- Oh look at you, country lawyer.
- Look at you, country real estate person.

946
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:53,759
- Well, is the doctor having enough money for his Mom's house?
- Yes, she's incredible, right up to date.

947
01:03:53,975 --> 01:03:57,518
Well, it was just second thing thougt.
You know what they say: "Location, location, location".

948
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,740
Next step is B4.

949
01:04:00,775 --> 01:04:01,820
B4.

950
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:07,216
That's so funny.
B4.

951
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,395
Like "before".

952
01:04:11,076 --> 01:04:13,632
Like B-4 and after...

953
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:18,527
Where is the fire when you need one?

954
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:21,744
G46 says!
G46!

955
01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:22,841
<i>Oh my God. Bingo!</i>

956
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:24,711
Bingo!
Bingo!

957
01:04:24,746 --> 01:04:26,424
- God, Bingo !
- I'm out.

958
01:04:27,495 --> 01:04:28,806
<i>Yes!
Ys!</i>

959
01:04:33,678 --> 01:04:37,352
- Why we are so happy?
- We just won fifty dollars. That's three sweaters.

960
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:42,504
<i>Please, listen to me. 
You can not call that number.</i>

961
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:44,907
We've been through all of this Jackie,
you heard what a Marshall said?! 

962
01:04:44,942 --> 01:04:46,444
We couldn't endanger their safety.

963
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:49,969
- There are rules here.
- Wait, God you are scary,little man.

964
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:52,392
Haven't you ever done anything
to break the rules?

965
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:06,289
Hello, Jackie Drake, 
Mrs Morgan's assistant ...

966
01:05:06,492 --> 01:05:07,485
Adam?

967
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:14,584
Oh my God...Oh my God, I'm so sorry, 

968
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,957
It was a reflex.
I took self-defense course.

969
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:20,668
I got an A in teaser and...
Would you like to go on movie with me tomorrow?

970
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:35,382
<i>Couldn't be drain.
Couldn't be...</i>

971
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:36,819
<i>I was really suprised.</i>

972
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:37,859
- Congratulations.
- Great night.

973
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,234
See you tomorrow.

974
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:41,126
Mañana.

975
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:41,699
<i>Good night.</i>

976
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:44,269
Good night.

977
01:05:55,144 --> 01:05:56,883
Well, I'll go... Good night.

979
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:58,028
Good night.

980
01:06:24,453 --> 01:06:25,301
Come in.

981
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:34,823
Come in.

982
01:06:39,768 --> 01:06:40,100
Hello.

983
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:42,940
Hi. Are you asleep?

984
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:49,416
- Very much so, yes.
- I hate to interrupt that. Just to see this!

985
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:54,690
Good God.

986
01:06:55,323 --> 01:06:57,437
Is that ice?

987
01:06:58,426 --> 01:06:59,653
I don't know.

988
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,737
I've never seen anything like it in New York
outside the Planetarium.

989
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:12,887
<i>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.</i>

990
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:18,628
<i>Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,</i>

991
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,631
<i>Or bends with the remover to remove:</i>

992
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:25,896
<i>O no! it is an ever-fixed mark</i>

993
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:30,196
</i>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</i>

994
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:37,584
Shakespeare (Sonnet 116). From my wedding. 

995
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:41,241
Was he there?
We've never got his gift.

996
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,693
- It was my vows to you.
- I know.

997
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:50,580
Well, at the time I thought you've written.
I was so disapointed when I found out.

998
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:54,245
Do you remember your vows to me?

999
01:07:56,798 --> 01:07:59,036
"There was once a girl from Nantucket".

1000
01:07:59,337 --> 01:08:02,047
- No, that's not it...that's not...
- It's all right, it was a long time ago.

1001
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:06,017
God, it's amazing how many stars.

1002
01:08:07,008 --> 01:08:10,757
<i>I promise never to take you for granted</i>

1003
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:13,436
<i>I should word you in kind</i>

1004
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:17,004
<i>Never allowed my affections to be recanted</i>

1005
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,364
<i>or stop mumbling at your behind.</i>

1006
01:08:21,419 --> 01:08:23,418
<i>Also Meryl...I should vow,</i>

1007
01:08:23,419 --> 01:08:28,418
<i>Your vict, your fusil to condemned animal slaughter,<i>

1008
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:31,014
<i>Your wisdom, your laugh</i>

1010
01:08:31,848 --> 01:08:34,384
<i>Your inability to boil water.</i>

1011
01:08:35,397 --> 01:08:37,986
<i>To be your best friend to the rest of my life</i>

1012
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,951
<i>And to thank to God you are not sure about 
fulfilling your into being my wife.</i>

1013
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:56,570
And the next thing I heard was:

1014
01:08:56,981 --> 01:09:00,084
"Do you, Meryl Judith Baker, 
take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?"

1015
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,780
And I said: "I do".

1016
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:04,340
And then I heard: 

1017
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,825
"Do you, Paul Michael Morgan, take this woman 
to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

1018
01:09:07,699 --> 01:09:09,392
And your mother said: "He doesn't!".

1019
01:09:09,663 --> 01:09:12,772
But I ignored her and then I heard
"I now pronounce you man and wife."

1020
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:14,256
Then...

1021
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,047
I don't remember.

1022
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:20,105
- "You may kiss the bride."
- Right.

1023
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,554
Right.
Right.

1024
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:27,001
- You may kiss the bride.
- Yes.

1025
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:30,176
And then we had a buffet
beginning with meatless pigs and blankets.

1026
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,552
You may kiss the bride.

1027
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:40,746
Oh, really?

1028
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,768
You sure?

1029
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:50,343
Very, very honestly.

1030
01:10:17,966 --> 01:10:18,972
Sorry. Sorry.

1031
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:22,709
<i>Sorry, we have to practice that.</i>

1032
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:27,963
<i>Aw, that was awkward...</i>

1033
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:33,372
<i>Hey, Marshall Lasky.</i>

1034
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:36,259
Yes, Sir.

1035
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:38,606
Right.

1036
01:10:39,478 --> 01:10:41,562
All right, take care.

1037
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:45,737
They got you separate sites ready
and they want you to leave tomorrow evening.

1038
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:47,332
Tomorrow?

1039
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:48,297
<i>Yep.</i>

1040
01:10:48,663 --> 01:10:50,129
Wow, that's soon?

1041
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:53,587
Well, the good news is
you still got to go to the rodeo.

1042
01:10:53,622 --> 01:10:56,198
<i>And the rodeo dance.</i>

1043
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,649
Yes.

1044
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:04,566
<i>Doctor Simons' office.</i>

1045
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:07,344
Yeah, is that the doctor Simmons
in Columbus, Ohio?

1046
01:11:07,565 --> 01:11:10,537
<i>No, this is the doctor Simmons 
in Ray, Wyoming.</i>

1047
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,594
Sorry, my mistake.

1048
01:11:16,674 --> 01:11:18,901
There is somebody using your name
in Claymont, Ohio.

1049
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:35,826
You know what?

1050
01:11:36,545 --> 01:11:38,292
- I had enough running for me.
- Really?!

1051
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,522
- Yeah.
- You are probably tired out of last night.

1052
01:11:42,345 --> 01:11:43,710
God, I was amazing.

1053
01:11:44,423 --> 01:11:47,720
Yeah, I'm realy glad that
I was there to see it.

1054
01:11:47,755 --> 01:11:49,157
Yeah.

1055
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:51,410
All right.

1056
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:52,843
Wait.
Listen.

1057
01:11:53,595 --> 01:11:56,368
We got through the whole adoption thing.

1058
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,161
It is possible that I did drag my feet a little bit.

1059
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:03,343
You would be a terrific mother, 
caring, supportive,

1060
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:06,837
- and completely smudering.
- I'm so looking for it, that.

1061
01:12:06,975 --> 01:12:09,699
But I am not sure that I would be good at it.

1062
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,573
- Really? That's what you are worried about?
- Obviously, yes.

1063
01:12:16,256 --> 01:12:18,089
What makes you think
I would be a good father?

1064
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:19,380
Well..

1065
01:12:20,618 --> 01:12:23,519
If I had to pick one thing...

1066
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:26,469
I would say it was the mouse.

1065
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,967
What you are talking about?

1066
01:12:28,713 --> 01:12:31,093
Don't you remember, you know
we had a mouse in our apartment,

1067
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:33,462
and all the sudden the cereal box 
started moving?

1068
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:35,207
Oh yes, yes.
The shaking granule.

1069
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:37,503
Yes, and I ran out, tried balcony, 

1070
01:12:37,538 --> 01:12:40,181
you know, you could just taken a broom
and swept it off,

1071
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:42,961
but instead you stood there
for hours trying

1072
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:45,517
to coxswain little guy into a shoe box

1073
01:12:45,606 --> 01:12:47,219
using your own breadth for safe bars.

1074
01:12:47,526 --> 01:12:49,751
Yes, terrible waste for cheese seems, eventually.

1075
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,359
Led to his death.

1076
01:12:52,177 --> 01:12:54,281
When I saw that, I just...

1077
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,778
I knew you'll be a great father.

1078
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:02,445
Especially if we adopt a rodent.

1079
01:13:03,324 --> 01:13:04,913
Thank you for being honest.

1080
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:09,639
Listen, while I am...speaking honestly.

1081
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:12,798
I wonder if we might also discuss
the whole business of separate sites.

1082
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:13,410
I don't want to preassure you.

1083
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:16,655
No, no, actually I've been thinking about it too.

1084
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:21,942
You know, why don't you finish your jogging
we'll talk about it when you come back, ok ?

1085
01:13:23,934 --> 01:13:24,563
Ok.

1086
01:13:25,513 --> 01:13:28,994
- Take the bear spray.
- Ok.

1087
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,200
Take the bear fly.

1088
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,390
Thank you.

1089
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:44,349
<i>Clay?</i>

1090
01:13:45,457 --> 01:13:46,849
C'mon in.

1091
01:13:51,965 --> 01:13:53,352
- Hey, Clay?
- Yeah?

1092
01:13:54,008 --> 01:13:57,953
I just looking for Emma in the house.
Is she around, I just wanna to talk to her.

1093
01:13:58,598 --> 01:14:01,592
She's gone in to Cody for supplies,
will be back about an hour.

1094
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:08,681
As you can probably see,
the things are going much better between me and Paul,

1095
01:14:08,716 --> 01:14:13,380
but you know, some very big decisions
need to be made regard our future

1096
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,343
and possibility
that we are not goin' back to New York...

1097
01:14:17,212 --> 01:14:21,159
An the fact is, well...I slept with someone else
while Paul and I were separated.

1098
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:24,670
Emma will be back about an hour.

1099
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:31,930
I kind don't know what to do.

1100
01:14:32,356 --> 01:14:33,836
Grab a bucket.

1101
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:36,958
Ok.

1102
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:47,491
Which of these are skim?

1103
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,251
Put your butt down there, 
get that stool.

1104
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:57,347
Grab above the teet.

1105
01:14:58,033 --> 01:14:58,725
Good luck.

1106
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:06,754
You know there is a school thought that says: 
What Paul doesn't know, won't hurt him,

1107
01:15:06,789 --> 01:15:09,641
and suddenly guess sound narcissistic if I do tell him.

1108
01:15:10,191 --> 01:15:14,968
But how can I expect complete honesty
from him if I'm asking any less of myself?!

1109
01:15:15,003 --> 01:15:17,528
Isn't that just the height of hipocrisy?

1110
01:15:17,671 --> 01:15:19,123
Could be.

1111
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:24,777
- I don't hear much help going on over there.
- Oh, sorry.

1112
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:30,462
Aw.

1113
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,693
- Is this hurt them?
- No, if you are gentle about it.

1114
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:41,195
I get it.

1115
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:46,848
See, I get it...
You are telling me to be honest.

1116
01:15:46,883 --> 01:15:49,477
But to be gentle.

1117
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,146
I was telling you the ease up on her teet,

1118
01:15:52,544 --> 01:15:54,291
but I guess it work both ways

1119
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,151
That's very wise.

1120
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:58,583
I doubt that.

1121
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:02,984
Start to talking about it isn't easy.

1122
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:07,073
It's like that book "Men are from
Mars, and women are from Venus".

1123
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:09,865
- You read that book?
- I read the cover.

1124
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,505
Pretty much sound it up.

1125
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:25,864
Bang it up buddy you do good?

1126
01:16:42,021 --> 01:16:44,038
Howdy.
I'm glad you came.

1127
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:59,806
Thank you, Ray!

1128
01:16:59,992 --> 01:17:03,808
Keep your dancin' shoes on!
'Cause...now we gonna kick it!

1129
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:05,692
C'mon, you dance.
Follow me.

1130
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:25,917
- I wanna tell you something.
- I know.

1131
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:28,539
- I'm very light on my feet.
- No. Well, yes.

1132
01:17:28,574 --> 01:17:30,938
But something else.

1133
01:17:32,992 --> 01:17:36,413
I thik we should go to this
official site together.

1134
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,169
You do?

1135
01:17:42,313 --> 01:17:43,355
Yeah.

1136
01:17:45,419 --> 01:17:47,151
That's so great.

1137
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:49,805
- That's so great.
- I know.

1138
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,985
- And... one other thing.
- Yeah.

1139
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,441
- When we were separated...
- Yeah.

1140
01:18:11,476 --> 01:18:13,546
I slept with someone else.

1141
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:39,113
It just happened once.

1142
01:18:39,705 --> 01:18:40,706
Once.

1143
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:44,881
Really, and it was just 
because I was just...I was feeling,

1144
01:18:45,243 --> 01:18:47,835
you know, just hurt... and rejected.

1145
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:52,337
- You are upset?
- No. No. No.

1146
01:18:52,372 --> 01:18:55,402
I'm... What I'm?
A little suprised.

1147
01:18:55,437 --> 01:18:58,709
If you gonna be mad, be mad.
But, please...

1148
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:01,618
Please, don't stop talking to me.

1149
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:05,558
Yell, scream, I don't care
but honestly...Whatever you want!

1150
01:19:05,593 --> 01:19:07,720
There is nothing to scream about. 

1151
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:09,797
We were separated,
you ran out, this things happened so.

1152
01:19:11,065 --> 01:19:11,947
There it is.

1153
01:19:13,422 --> 01:19:15,159
- Hey, Paul.
- Howdy.

1154
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,610
- Do you wanna ask me something?
- No.

1155
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:41,339
Do you mind?

1156
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:43,751
No, no, no.

1157
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:56,244
Do you wanna talk?

1158
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,765
No, no, not should do.

1159
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,319
I always want to talk.

1160
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:03,923
Go ahead.

1161
01:20:08,686 --> 01:20:09,642
It's okay, never mind.

1162
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:06,967
Hey, excuse me.
How you doin'?

1163
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:08,418
Howdy.

1164
01:21:08,882 --> 01:21:11,353
i'm lookin' for two friends of mine, 
Paul and Meryl.

1165
01:21:11,388 --> 01:21:17,710
Aw, the Fosters. They are probably on the way to rodeo 
but they are stayin' at the Wheelers.

1166
01:21:17,745 --> 01:21:20,217
Wheelers. And where is that?

1167
01:21:20,252 --> 01:21:23,771
Ok, so go down this road and
when you see the broken fence make a right.

1168
01:21:23,777 --> 01:21:26,062
And when you come to second big rock...

1169
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:39,163
Good morning.

1170
01:21:39,698 --> 01:21:41,835
Better shake your legs if you wanna eat.

1171
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:45,218
Do you know where Paul is?

1172
01:21:47,553 --> 01:21:48,177
Thank you.

1173
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:00,854
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1174
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,610
What you think this is fooling?

1175
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:11,651
Isn't this, I mean,  what screwed us up in the first place?
Not talking?

1176
01:22:11,686 --> 01:22:14,908
Is it? Sorry it was stupid of me, 
I thought it was sleeping with other people.

1177
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:16,461
But maybe you are right. Yes.

1178
01:22:16,496 --> 01:22:18,239
You know, never mind.

1179
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:19,775
All right.
What would you like me to do?

1180
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,053
Would you like to beg for informations?
Then I will. What was his name?
- Larry.

1181
01:22:24,493 --> 01:22:26,482
Larry. Are you serious?

1182
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:30,094
Larry, he's recently divorced, 
he just asked me for dinner.

1183
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:32,781
That's all right, I think i got the picture. 
You probably had a few drinks and...

1184
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,588
you mourned about your horrrible husband,

1185
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:36,396
went back to his apartment. I got it.

1186
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:40,661
No, no, we back to our apartment.

1187
01:22:40,696 --> 01:22:43,259
Right, we are selling the place.
Thanks so much for telling me.

1188
01:22:43,294 --> 01:22:47,294
Look, we both made mistakes. 

1189
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,779
I made a mistake, your seem to be just litte like revenge.

1190
01:22:51,646 --> 01:22:52,900
Are you serious?

1191
01:22:54,215 --> 01:22:55,793
Revenge...I mean...Do you...

1192
01:22:56,183 --> 01:22:59,632
Do you not know me at all? And all you've been
thinking that I will sleep with someone for revenge?

1193
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:02,262
I would sleep with someone to hurt you?

1194
01:23:02,297 --> 01:23:04,907
- Well, at this point I don't know what I'm thinking.
- Oh, my God.

1195
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,263
- Screw you.
- Meryl, can I just say this?

1196
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:08,195
Meryl, can I... can I speak?

1197
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,563
No.
Not to me.

1198
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:11,291
- Meryl!
- Ready to go?

1199
01:23:11,326 --> 01:23:16,181
- I think I'm gonna pass on rodeo. I'm sory.
- Yeah sory, me too.

1200
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:18,703
I've a lot of packing to do.

1201
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:19,722
I'm sorry.

1202
01:23:21,284 --> 01:23:23,284
Okay, then.

1203
01:23:25,443 --> 01:23:26,826
Hold on.

1204
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,539
I know it's not my business, but...

1205
01:23:33,692 --> 01:23:37,799
I watched you two over the past few days...
Laughing together about 

1206
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:40,762
inside New York jokes.

1207
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:44,857
I don't find them funny, but...I think 

1208
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:50,395
you can always tell
a lot about a couple by the fact

1209
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,094
that they still laughed together.

1210
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:57,134
Thanks, I appreciate that.

1211
01:23:59,044 --> 01:24:02,068
I think guys...I think he's funny.

1212
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,046
Makes me laugh.

1213
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:08,803
But, if we gonna stay together, then...

1214
01:24:10,096 --> 01:24:14,239
you know, I guess we have to
scaled back on our expectations.

1215
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,996
I want expect everything from him 
and he won't expect everything from me.

1216
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:21,189
You can not expect everything from each other,

1217
01:24:22,672 --> 01:24:25,220
where is that make any sense?

1218
01:24:25,255 --> 01:24:27,058
you got to stop thinking about,

1219
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:29,563
just get over the bullshit
and make it work.

1220
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:38,105
She said something like i was gonna...

1221
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,265
C'mon, honey, let just go.

1222
01:24:42,816 --> 01:24:45,194
We'll pick you up
and take you to the airport.

1223
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:44,706
- What was that?
- Oh my God!

1224
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:46,856
<i>- Oh my God, it's him.
- We got to call Clay and Emma.</i>

1225
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:49,155
- The phone is the code.
- Christ!

1226
01:26:01,427 --> 01:26:02,923
What? Are you kidding?

1227
01:26:13,956 --> 01:26:16,234
Oh God, I'm out of bullets.

1228
01:26:16,269 --> 01:26:18,302
Something I've never expecting to hear you say.

1229
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:21,865
We go outside.

1230
01:26:28,736 --> 01:26:29,662
C'mon.
Up. Up.

1231
01:26:31,256 --> 01:26:32,852
- C'mon! - I'm sorry! 
- C'mon!

1232
01:26:56,526 --> 01:26:58,170
<i>Ok, we gonna find Clay.</i>

1233
01:26:58,205 --> 01:27:00,532
<i>It'll be easy.
He wear a cowboy hat.</i>

1234
01:27:08,743 --> 01:27:11,197
Nice drive, cowboy.
It's been a while since...

1235
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:13,602
anybody ride this bull eight seconds more.

1236
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:33,815
That's Clay.

1237
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:36,808
He's in the box.
Go. Go. Go.

1238
01:27:36,843 --> 01:27:40,601
Got yourselves a big hands for gold fighting Clowns.

1239
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,148
Oh my God.

1240
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:10,297
Sit.
Just sit.

1241
01:28:42,132 --> 01:28:43,461
Nice drivin', buddy!

1242
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,193
Thank you.

1243
01:28:49,713 --> 01:28:54,527
<i>Make claps for Tom O'Rea... 
...he'll be riding the Applebee bull killer.</i>

1244
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:58,429
<i>Last three cowboys get down on this bull,</i>

1245
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:00,188
<i>got dumped right out of the game.
Let's see Tom break catch free!</i>

1246
01:29:18,169 --> 01:29:19,313
<i>Get him, boys.</i>

1247
01:29:26,297 --> 01:29:27,474
I can't see.

1248
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,732
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1249
01:29:38,497 --> 01:29:40,142
<i>What's that noise?</i>

1250
01:29:40,177 --> 01:29:41,245
<i>Just run!</i>

1251
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,255
<i>- Just run!
- I'm running!</i>

1252
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:44,245
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

1253
01:29:48,846 --> 01:29:50,057
<i>Meryl, you're all right?</i>

1254
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:53,496
<i>- No! I really think I hurt my leg.
- oh God!</i>

1255
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:55,876
<i>I don't think I can walk.</i>

1256
01:29:55,911 --> 01:29:59,216
<i>Oh my God, we never gonna way from him.</i>

1257
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:00,885
<i>What?
Where is he?</i>

1258
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:07,248
All right, wait there.
I'll be back in a minute.

1259
01:30:07,283 --> 01:30:10,321
<i>Wait, wait! What are you doing?!
Where are you going?!</i>

1260
01:30:10,672 --> 01:30:11,737
<i>Please, don't leave me.</i>

1261
01:30:12,013 --> 01:30:13,616
You get...Keep your head down.

1262
01:30:22,687 --> 01:30:23,884
Aw! Bulllocks!

1263
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:28,337
Hey, I've got plenty of room on my wall 
for another head. 

1264
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:32,054
Drop it, son. 
Stay back away from my lawyer. 

1265
01:30:32,089 --> 01:30:34,293
If you just point out, say even if you kill me,

1266
01:30:34,294 --> 01:30:36,914
you'll have two more, these two will testified against you.

1267
01:30:36,949 --> 01:30:38,195
- Three.
- Four.

1268
01:30:38,451 --> 01:30:40,444
- Five.
- Five.

1269
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:43,313
- You are six, dump.
- Six.

1270
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:07,321
You're all right?

1271
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:10,197
Are you crazy?
You could be killed.

1272
01:31:10,744 --> 01:31:13,495
I'm just very touched
that it will emoted you.

1273
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,378
Of course it would have.

1274
01:31:15,413 --> 01:31:19,966
Oh God, I had this...this horrible moment where...

1275
01:31:20,544 --> 01:31:24,396
- I pictured what life would be like without you.
- That's exactly what I had.

1276
01:31:24,431 --> 01:31:28,492
When you were laying spured in the dust,
all I wanted to do is to protect you.

1277
01:31:28,527 --> 01:31:31,234
I lost all the physical fear.

1278
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:33,797
When it's coming back now tough, 
what in the God's name I was thinking?

1279
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:37,297
I know exactly what you were thinking.
You were thinking that...

1280
01:31:37,332 --> 01:31:40,990
that we were meant to be together, 
because, look what you did.

1281
01:31:41,025 --> 01:31:45,372
You risked your life for me. 
That's so nice.

1282
01:31:45,407 --> 01:31:47,069
- No.
- Sorry.

1283
01:31:47,104 --> 01:31:49,380
No, no.
I am sorry.

1284
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:54,293
I'm so sorry
for nearly curing an incurable romantic.

1285
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:57,281
I want you to expect everything from me. 
You not gonna get it,

1286
01:31:57,282 --> 01:32:00,201
but I promise to try and do it.

1287
01:32:01,857 --> 01:32:02,823
I love you, Meryl.

1288
01:32:04,081 --> 01:32:06,792
If you are in fact Meryl?
I can hardly see, I'm sorry.

1289
01:32:06,803 --> 01:32:09,046
I'm Meryl.
Trust me.

1290
01:32:10,839 --> 01:32:13,098
Cause I trust you all over again.

1291
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:37,512
Good bye, Lucy!
I hope I get to hear you on the radio soon.

1292
01:32:40,315 --> 01:32:41,938
- Earl.
- Lucy.

1293
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,184
- Eat the meat.
- Eat the meat.

1294
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:48,678
- Take care.
- Earl, I think we become good friends.

1295
01:32:48,915 --> 01:32:51,009
- Think what you want.
- Or not, whatever.

1296
01:32:51,877 --> 01:32:55,154
- So.
- I don't know what to say, except...

1297
01:32:56,522 --> 01:33:01,052
We are really truly, sorry... about...

1298
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:03,563
- About everything.
- Don't be.

1299
01:33:03,598 --> 01:33:06,625
The Fed's are so happy with us
they link Clay to keep his job.

1300
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,004
Is that right?
That's great news.

1301
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:11,349
- Oh, congratulation.
- Thank you.

1302
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,820
Mr and Mrs Morgan , we are waiting for you.

1303
01:33:13,855 --> 01:33:16,408
Okay, well I suppose this is it.

1304
01:33:17,201 --> 01:33:18,949
If whoever get attacked by the bear in the Central Park

1305
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:20,541
we would be the one to know what to do.

1306
01:33:20,576 --> 01:33:25,024
- You stay in good care of my favorite cousin, ok?
- Emma.

1307
01:33:26,665 --> 01:33:30,357
Really thank you for everything and...
And remember...

1308
01:33:33,953 --> 01:33:37,316
Clay, I'm better hug you,
you won't like it but I'm gonna hug you.

1309
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:41,078
Thank you. And listen
if you are ever in New York...

1310
01:33:41,113 --> 01:33:44,363
Something has gone terribly wrong.

1311
01:33:45,564 --> 01:33:47,865
Ok. Let's go home.

1312
01:33:51,324 --> 01:33:52,141
Adios.

1313
01:33:54,749 --> 01:33:58,959
- Sheriff, your life just got a whole lot simpler.
- So it's yours, baby.

1314
01:34:14,787 --> 01:34:19,126
<i>SIX MONTHS LATER</i>

1315
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:34,076
Isn't it amazing she slept the whole flight?

1316
01:34:34,444 --> 01:34:36,480
Isn't that amazing?
They'are not meant to do that.

1317
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:38,696
She false it.

1319
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:43,433
- No, she's perfect.
- Perfect, but nameless.

1320
01:34:43,468 --> 01:34:45,894
Or probably we finally come up 
with a name on the road home.

1321
01:34:47,133 --> 01:34:49,330
She could be Midtown Morgan.

1322

- Hurry, get that, get the phone.
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Oh, hello Adam, I missed you.

1330

No, no I'm taking the day off tomorrow,

1331
01:35:22,857 --> 01:35:24,560

01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:36,678
You know what I wish?

1336
01:35:36,713 --> 01:35:40,273
I wish as an older, wiser couple

1337
01:35:40,308 --> 01:35:43,232
we could give them an advice, 
like Clay and Emma gave us.

1338
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:45,486
Or we just could send them to Ray 
for the weekend.

1339
01:35:46,618 --> 01:35:47,202
Rae.

1340
01:35:49,968 --> 01:35:51,360
We call her Rae.

1341
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:53,160
R A E.

1342
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:54,944
Rae.

1343
01:35:55,179 --> 01:35:58,127
I quite like that.
I quite like that.

1344
01:35:59,612 --> 01:36:01,364
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

1345
01:36:01,563 --> 01:36:03,231
And you?
What are your thoughts?

1346
01:36:03,266 --> 01:36:05,802
- Rae.
- Rae Morgan.

1347
01:36:07,836 --> 01:36:11,033
Hey, this is our new apartment, Rae.

1348
01:36:11,068 --> 01:36:13,406
The one we have to get cause
I didn't want to stay in the old one,

1349
01:36:13,407 --> 01:36:15,564
where your Mama slept with Larry.

1350
01:36:15,599 --> 01:36:17,535
Just don't need to hear this.

1351
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:20,922
Come here, little girl.

1353
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:27,902
3000 square feet and...

1354
01:36:27,903 --> 01:36:32,000
a berry space ship master bedroom.

1355
01:36:32,275 --> 01:36:35,267
And come to see this view,
come and get this view, little Lady.

1356
01:36:38,213 --> 01:36:39,691
Oh right here, look at that.

1357
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:46,249
Can you believe?
Isn't that something, it is, it is!

1358
01:36:49,906 --> 01:36:51,184
That is quite beautiful view.

1359
01:36:54,472 --> 01:36:55,432
What?

1360
01:36:56,392 --> 01:36:57,449
What?

1361
01:36:58,197 --> 01:36:59,962
- How are you feeling by the way?
- Good.

1362
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,314
Very good.

1364
01:37:03,492 --> 01:37:05,914
