[Snaps fingers]

711
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,146
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, thanks.

712
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:11,984
Kid's roommate?
Found dead down in Cobb County.

713
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,716
All sliced up.

714
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,087
Fuck.

715
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:19,322
So Holland was, uh, here.

716
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:22,228
And Cobb is the opposite
direction from us.

717
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,732
- What, 40 miles?
- Yeah.

718
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,530
So we send everything up here.

719
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,230
She has to find their phone.
Needs charging.

720
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:31,296
We don't have
that kind of time.

721
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,399
<i>Well, I could head
out there.</i>

722
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,171
If I see something,
I won't make a move.

723
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,406
I'll just call it in and
keep an eye on things.

724
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,970
Yeah, that's good.

725
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:40,640
We send two detectives
to Cobb County

726
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,979
to check with the locals
and the roommate...

727
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,916
see if Tommy's there.

728
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,353
I got a feeling that he's in
the same place that Jess is.

729
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:51,052
You two?
Do the buddy-cop thing.

730
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,171
This is gonna be over quick,
all right?

731
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,698
So one way or the other,
one of us is gonna slice you.

- Ahh!
- Sit there.

736
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,185

You'll like that.

Hey, boss, you, uh...

742
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,971
You recognize this kid?

743
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,203
He was, uh...
he was with the girl in Ashville.

744
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,904
[Groans]

745
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,879
It's another loose end.
I fixed it, though.

746
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:46,437
I, uh... that's what I do.

747
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,710
I am a fixer.
It's what you pay me for.

your type...

750
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,888
so can I just kill him
real quick?

751
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:58,393
If that's all right
with you?

752
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,985

Why don't you two
run around the facility...

756
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,286
a little bit...

757
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,989
find something to hit me
in the head with...

758
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,625
or stab me with?

759
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,896
Something fun.

760
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,572
I'll be right back...

761
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:23,237
and then
I'll find you two.

762
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,804
It's going
right here.

763
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,267
Shake them.

764
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:27,632
Just go slow.

765
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:29,637
Oh, God!

You all right?

770
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,139
You okay?
All right, untie me.

771
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,944
Listen, we really
gotta hurry up.

772
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,541
We got to find
a safe place.

773

I don't know why
they want to kill me.

774

anything.

Me neither, okay?

776
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,825
I don't know about this guy
but the one with the mask...

777
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:52,622
he kills girls and
videotapes it, all right?

778
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,458
It's his thing.

779
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,158
That's what this girl told me,
and she's dead now.

780
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,996
Aah!

781

[Whispering]
Calm down.

785
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:09,973
Wait.
He had a mask on, too.

786
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,308
Then he got her,
or they did.

787
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,972
I don't know.
Listen to me.

788
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,744
We have to focus, okay?
Because he's right.

789
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,910
This place is locked up,
and we've got nothing.

790
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,919
Not actually nothing.

791
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,754
- What the fuck?
- No, no.

792
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:27,090
The signal, it makes these
loud air horns go off.

793
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,442
Give me a hand.
I'm gonna move this.

794

[Grunting]

795
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,088
All right, all right.
I'll go down first.

796
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,953
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

797
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,992
What if there's no way
out from underneath?

798
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,392
What? No. We could get trapped.

799
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:35,054
If there's
a signal down there...

800
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,224
it might be able to
shield the feedback

801
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:38,823
from the thing, right?

802
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,424
- Wait, wait. No.
- Just shh, shh!

803
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:41,731

calm down.

calm for me, okay?

Yeah, it's me, Tommy.

820
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:32,009
- I'm on the girl's phone.
- It's the kid on two.

821
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,514
What's your name?

822
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:35,777
- Jess.
- Jess. I'm on Jess's phone.

823
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:39,719

so I don't know where we are.

down there?
