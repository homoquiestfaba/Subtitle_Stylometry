1
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,290
Deep breath.

2
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,460
Another.

3
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,016
I need you
to be honest with me.

4
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:15,691
You're show signs of cirrhosis.
Your glands are swollen.
You're jaundiced.

5
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,694
Your body's telling me you're malnourished

6
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,614
but you say you're eating like a horse.

7
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,367
One of you is lying.

8
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,319
I knew this was a bad idea.

9
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,168
You may be developing some type of anemia.

10
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,340
I won't know until I run some tests.

11
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,148
<i>Anemia
What are the symptoms of anemia?</i>

12
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,534
Feeling better?

13
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,747
Yes, a little bit.

14
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,044
You just fell right over.

15
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,922
Thanks again for helping me.

16
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,717
How old are you?

17
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,220
Twenty-four.

18
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:34,102
They say that human
body stops growing at age 25.

19
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,900
Yes.

20
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,238
You're in the last stages
of something.

21
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,949
Like a...

22
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,992
caterpillar...

23
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,704
turning into a butterfly.

24
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,794
I don't think so.

25
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,714
Want a blowpop?

26
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,090
What?

27
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,550
A blowpop.

28
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:14,471
It's like a sucker but it's got gum inside.

29
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,639
Oh, yeah, sure.

30
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,434
Cherry, grape, sour apple or watermelon?

31
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,479
- Grape.
- One dollar.

32
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,448
Thanks.

33
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,038
Yes?

34
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,457
Do you have any...

35
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,459
Smokes?

36
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,880
- Yeah.
- Reds, spirits, slims or malts.

37
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,592
Reds.

38
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,137
Good choice.

39
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,514
Do you smoke?

40
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,183
And he called me a twant.

41
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,952
Then he wrecked my car
and now the fucker
owes me money

42
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:06,582
and he's trying to say we're square
because I made him sleep
on the couch for a week.

43
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,779
- You guys live together?
- Not any more.

44
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,659
I kicked him out after he started
to use my place to sell meth.

45
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,747
- How much does he owe you?
- $400.

46
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,709
Maybe you should just let it go?

47
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,629
You won't have to deal with it any more.

48
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,592
Maybe you're right.

49
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,768
You shouldn't let anyone
talk to you like that.

50
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,533
So what do you do beside
sell candy and cigarettes?

51
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,868
I... I bartend.

52
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,047
Catering, shit like that.

53
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:04,956
What do you do?

54
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,918
- Security.
- Day shift?

55
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,629
Nights.

56
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,048
Sounds lonely.

57
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,385
I'm used to it.

58
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,183
You like working nights?

59
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,103
Yeah... yeah.

60
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,356
Sure about that?

61
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,485
I don't really have a choice.

62
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,195
Why not?

63
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,199
I have a skin disorder,
so...

64
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,995
- I can't go in the sun.
- What do you mean?

65
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,875
I burn really easily.

66
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,921
Well, you are on the pasty side.

67
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,091
No, it's not like that.

68
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,432
Shit!

69
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,729
The sunlight did that to you?

70
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,483
My God!

71
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,698
It's like you're a vampire.

72
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,419
<i>Vampire</i>

73
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,481
Who is this?

74
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:22,940
<i>Hello?</i>

75
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,777
Jacob.

76
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,196
<i>From the other night.</i>

77
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:32,242
Yeah, sorry, I didn't
recognize the number.

78
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,953
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

79
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,748
<i>- You are?
- I am.</i>

80
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,083
<i>What are you doing?</i>

81
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,169
Watching a talk show about
a guy with two heads.

82
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,879
It's disgusting.

83
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,341
<i>I can call back.</i>

84
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,260
No... are you kidding?

85
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,845
What are you doing tonight?

86
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,055
I...

87
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,932
naa... nothing.

88
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>There's a great band playing at Space Land.</i>

89
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>Want to go?</i>

90
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,398
<i>- Yeah. What time?
- They go on at ten.</i>

91
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,234
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

92
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,904
- Yeah, it sounds great.
- OK.

93
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,697
Where do you live?

94
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,492
<i>43½ State Street.</i>

95
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,370
And a half?

96
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,538
<i>Yeah... It's a... It's a...</i>

97
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,291
<i>It's a basement unit.</i>

98
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,765
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, I'm outside.</i>

99
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>- You're early.
- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

100
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,564
I can wait if
you're not ready.

101
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,151
<i>Or we could have a
drink before the show.</i>

102
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,491
<i>All I have is whiskey.</i>

103
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,536
Sounds great.

104
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,885
- Hi.
- Hi.

105
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,192
- I never have people over, so...
- It's great.

106
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,747
This is you, right?

107
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,749
Yeah.

108
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,002
God, you were so young.

109
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,672
I'll get the drinks.

110
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,482
You paint all these?

111
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,401
Yeah.

112
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,114
You're so talented.

113
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,117
- Yeah right.
- You are.

114
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,631
When I was little someone
told me that sometimes just

115
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,551
before the sun goes down,
it'll turn green...

116
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,762
for just a second.

117
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,765
I looked for it for so many years.

118
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,062
I never saw it.

119
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,401
So stupid.

120
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,444
No, it's real.

121
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,364
Yeah, right.

122
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,658
It is. It's called green flash.
It happens sometimes

123
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,493
right before the last part
of the sun disappears.

124
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:06,581
Caused by the same refraction effects
that make the red sunset.

125
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,583
Really?

126
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,335
Yes, it's rare, but it happens...

127
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,839
You just haven't seen it yet.

128
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,384
You ever see it?

129
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,762
No.

130
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,145
Can I use your bathroom?

131
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,815
- Yes... it's just around the...
- I'll be right back.

132
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,546
Sorry the place is such a mess.

133
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,793
Fuck...

134
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,225
What just happened?

135
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,145
I... got a nose bleed.

136
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,273
No, I mean...

137
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,861
I'm sorry.

138
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,948
I feel weird.

139
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,368
You want me to leave?

140
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,373
I don't know, maybe I should...

141
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,343
Look, it's not like I do it all the time.

142
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:09,514
- This friend of mine gave it to me...
- I can't do this right now.

143
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,980
Fuck!

144
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,132
Hey, man.

145
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,265
What you looking for?

146
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,683
Huh?

147
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,068
Hey, wait up, bro, wait up man.
I ain't going to bust you, man.

148
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:06,436
What you need in there?

149
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,903
Why you go busting that thing, man?

150
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:21,118
Ain't nothing but diseases and shit, man.
Rotten organs and blood.

151
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,959
Need blood, huh?

152
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,883
- No.
- No, no. Hold on a minute.
Hold on, hold on.

153
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,387
I might have something for you, man.

154
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:44,558
Let's see what Santa's got in his bag.

155
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,227
Ahh... jack pot.

156
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:49,980
Yes.

157
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,066
Here, bro.

158
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,944
Take it.

159
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,864
The hospital don't need it, man.

160
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,783
Probably expired or something.

161
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,745
Isn't this illegal?

162
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,790
It's just trash, man.

163
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,876
I can get some more.

164
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:16,214
It's going to cost you.
Another one of those about $150.

165
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,887
So you don't care?

166
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:23,916
About what?

167
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,225
What I'm doing to do with it.

168
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,065
Everyone's got their thing, man.

169
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,652
I make a trash run
this time every night.

170
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,743
Thanks.

171
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,298
Who is this?

172
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,133
It's Jacob.

173
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,512
<i>- I'm calling from work.
- Oh.</i>

174
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,514
Hi.

175
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,893
Are you working tonight?

176
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,487
I watched the sunrise yesterday morning.

177
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,322
Thought of you.

178
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,074
You did?

179
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,618
Yeah.

180
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,622
Listen, the other night
That wasn't me... I...

181
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:15,584
- Sometimes I get nervous.
- Okay.

182
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,505
I mean it's not okay.

183
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,053
Everyone's got their thing.

184
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,723
What do you mean?

185
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,894
That they don't want other
people to know about.

186
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,022
What's your thing?

187
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:53,664
My favorite TV show is
America's Funniest Home Videos.

188
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,419
We can't hang out any more.

189
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,647
Wait!

190
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,192
What's wrong
with your eyes?

191
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,303
Are you all right?

192
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,139
I'm not sure.

193
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:49,237
What are you drinking?

194
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,532
It's just...

195
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,451
just medicine.

196
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,207
What's wrong with your eyes.

197
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,084
I don't know.

198
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,212
- Take those off.
- No!

199
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,387
Let me see, okay?

200
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,064
Open!

201
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,450
You look okay now.

202
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,912
I do?

203
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,666
Has this ever happened before?

204
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,876
No.

205
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,630
You want me to take you to
a doctor, or something?

206
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:52,175
Maybe you should leave.
It might be contagious.

207
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:57,305
- Fuck that. Let me take care of you.
- Look. I just wanna be alone right now.

208
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:16,074
- Wait. Let me walk you.
- I have to ask you something.

209
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,583
What?

210
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,714
Can I have one of your paintings.

211
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,257
Hi.

212
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,259
You got the money?

213
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,095
Yeah.

214
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,639
Get in.

215
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,601
Can't we just... do it...?

216
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:11,940
No, I wasn't expecting you tonight, so.
We gonna have to improvise.

217
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,695
Come on, man.

218
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:19,156
Let me help you.

219
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:32,294
Hey, that's what I'm talking about.

220
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,881
My little brother, Russell.

221
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,515
Where are we going?

222
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,934
Don't worry.

223
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:50,979
I'll get what you need.

224
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:27,432
Wait here.
And don't do anything stupid.

225
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,573
Whose house is this?

226
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:59,047
Hey what's he doing, man?

227
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,647
No!

228
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,995
What the fuck is going on?

229
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,415
You're sick, man.

230
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,755
You should consider yourself lucky.

231
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,342
Dumb shit. Mother fucker.

232
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:52,016
Pleasure doing business with you, brother.

233
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,601
We'll see you again.

234
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,854
Real soon.

236
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,743
You're early.

237
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,078
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

238
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,332
What are you doing?

239
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:48,099
Hey!

240
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,801
That's my job.

241
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:53,430
You're security, buddy.

244
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:22,042
Yes, hello, I'd like to order
whole human blood, please.

245
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,672
This is my first time calling.

246
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,342
Sure.

247
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,595
Ah... it's...

248
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,057

Hello?

<i>Are you Jacob?</i>

252
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,336
<i>Yeah.</i>

Ginslegh.
LAPD.

254
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:12,676
We had a murder nearby,
a couple of nights ago.

255
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,469
You mind if I ask a couple of questions?

256
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,140
- No, come in.
- Thank you.

257
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:24,228
<i>Talked to your boss, he told
me you were on watch
on the night of the murder.</i>

258
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,773
Yeah, I read about that in the newspaper.

259
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:32,653
Take any breaks, walk around the
grounds, leave the premises for any...

260
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,907
I take my breaks in the kitchen
in the back there.

261
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,171
That's a nice jacket.

262
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:54,426
I remember when I was at work
you had to wear a uniform.
Jesus, was that thing uncomfortable.

263
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:58,847
Do you ever take that off
when you're on duty?

264
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:02,100
No, why do you ask?

265
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,185
Just...

266
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:05,394
following up a lead.

267
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:11,193
One of our eye witnesses said they
saw a guy with a dark coat running
around with some kind of logo on it.

268
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,823
So you're sure there's
nothing you could think of?

269
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,495
No, I wish I could help,
but I didn't see anything.

270
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,330
Listen, if you remember anything...

271
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,416
just give me a call.

272
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,336
Yeah, I will.

273
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,508
Thanks.

00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,480
<i>- Hello
- Hi, it's Mary.</i>

275
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:52,275
I showed your painting to a friend
of mine who owns a gallery.

276
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:54,694
What?

277
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:57,446
She said you're really talented.

278
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:03,120
<i>- You're kidding.
- No. This is real it's a
great opportunity for us.</i>

279
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,539
Us?

280
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:11,503
<i>Well, she says if your paintings sell,
then I get a finder's fee?
Because I found you?</i>

281
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:17,551
I think you're sitting on a gold mine
here and you don't even know it.

282
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,095
<i>- Oh yeah? How much?
- Thousands...</i>

283
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,432
<i>Per painting.</i>

00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,855
<i>Don't doubt me, man.
I'll change your life.</i>

285
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:38,258
Okay.

286
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:40,156
Okay.

287
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:45,787
She wants to see some of your best.
How about I come over tomorrow
night and we pick a few to show her?

288
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:04,097
This one for sure.

289
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:10,187
What would you call it?

290
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,702
I don't know this...

291
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,163
This one's really old.

292
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:31,833
Here... let me see it.

293
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,395
Wait... wait!

294
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,353
- My eyes? Are they?
- They look fine.

295
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,981
They're okay.

296
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,739
You're okay.

297
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,620
Ow!

298
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,153
I'm sorry.

299
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,072
No...

300
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,825
No, it's fine, it's just...

301
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:14,121
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

302
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:16,720
Hey.

303
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:22,045
It's alright.

304
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,487
Hey.

305
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:32,097
I don't want to hurt you.

306
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,894
I'm fine, I'm fine. Okay?

307
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:50,240
You don't understand I'm not normal.

308
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:57,501
- I want to be with you. But I'm afraid...
- That you're going to hurt me?

309
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:08,091
I understand.

310
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,627
Wait!

311
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:51,468
Where's the gallery again?

312
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,805
31st and Pico?
Santa Monica?

313
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:57,993
Okay.

314
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:00,501
Okay.

315
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,938
Bye.

316
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,479
You're going to have to sign in real quick.

317
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,380
What's the problem?

318
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,008
- Sorry, everyone's gotta
to sign in after hours.
- Give me a break here, okay?

319
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,219
- It's a new fucking day.
- I work the night shift.

320
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,764
- Whatever.
- Sir!

321
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,976
Hey, stop!

322
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:36,090
I'd like to include all of these in

323
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:39,261
the showing I have on Saturday.

324
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:45,183
- Can you believe that?
- No, it's happening so fast.

325
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:48,437
- She's amazing.
- She is.

326
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,815
Don't.

327
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:13,503
I got fired today.

328
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,717
That sucks. Is that what
you wanted to talk about?

329
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,351
No... I...

330
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,938
just want to apologize
for being such an ass hole.

331
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,446
- Hey?
- What?

332
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:47,120
What was that shit you were
drinking the other night?

333
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,166
What?

334
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:56,004
You know, you said it was medicine.
What's it for?

335
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,067
You know, maybe we
should just be friends.

336
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,573
Sure.

337
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:27,995
You'll get your finder's fee.
So, I'll see you later.

338
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,587
Hello?

339
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,632
Can anyone hear me?

340
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:44,428
Can someone open the door, please.

341
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,558
Shit!

342
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:57,148
Hi. I'm sorry for making so much
noise out here I just...

343
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:59,775
- Is Marcus working tonight?
- Let me see if he's here.

344
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:02,528
Thanks. It's really important.
It's an emergency.

345
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,030
- OK?
- Okay. Let me see if he's here...

346
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,576
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

347
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:18,920
What the fuck are you doing, huh?

348
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:23,389
- I'm sorry. I need...
- Shut the fuck up you piece of shit.
You want to ruin everything?

349
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,807
Huh?

350
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,181
Meet me at Southward
Avenue in two hours.

351
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,808
Fucking asshole.

352
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:35,395
And don't come back!

353
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,992
Russell, southside alley.

354
00:56:38,993 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah, man.

355
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:43,737
Not the front, the alley.
Yeah, now.

356
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,326
What the fuck, man!

357
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:53,204
Dude, this built like through
the drive-through? Huh?

358
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,331
So what now?

359
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:57,209
Fuck!

360
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:02,339
- Can't do nothing for you 'til next week.
- No.

361
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,405
You got to see yourself, kid.

362
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:09,939
After that little show there for nurse
Ratshit, I've got to be in my best
behaviour for at least a week.

363
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,433
I'll pay double.

364
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,645
Take it. There's got to
be something you can do.

365
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:22,109
We tried that shit, remember?
You didn't appreciate my creativity.

366
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,778
Shit!

367
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,244
You know, you are one fucked up
mother fucker, man.

368
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,788
- Yeah, Fuck you!
- What?

369
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,083
What did you say to me, bitch?

370
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,377
Fuck you say?

371
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:55,655
Call my brother.

372
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:20,329
Here.

373
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:33,633
I'm sick.

374
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:38,387
I have some kind of disease.

375
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:40,724
What is it?

376
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,230
I don't know.

377
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,069
I think it's...

378
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:06,083
Talk to me.

379
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,256
It's anemia.

380
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,302
Anemia?

381
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:21,848
That's a... that's a blood thing, right?

382
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,476
Yeah, it's a blood thing.

383
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:29,189
So that's what the medicine was for?

384
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,743
Is it serious?

385
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,538
Yeah.

386
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:49,292
Why didn't you want to tell me?

387
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,839
It's just too much.

388
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:56,758
I'm such a freak.

389
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,507
Hey...

390
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,680
I'm strong than you think.

391
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,642
Promise me you'll see a doctor, okay?

392
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,770
- Okay.
- I mean it.

393
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,441
I will.

394
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,013
I don't want to go in there.

395
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,224
Seriously?

396
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:34,438
Fuck it then.

397
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,775
We'll have our own party.

398
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:04,011
Get up.

399
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,431
Get up!

400
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,354
Move.
Move!

401
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:18,786
No, no, you stay. You move.

402
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:24,197
Where's my brother?

403
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:26,699
I don't know.

404
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,534
- Did you kill him?
- You know this guy?

405
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,871
Shut up!

406
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:36,585
- Please let her go.
- Answer my question!

407
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,218
No!

408
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:56,146
You want to help her, huh?
You start talking.

409
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:07,324
Just go.

410
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:10,744
Leave!

411
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:16,625
Shit!

412
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:21,565
How did...?

413
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,224
Let me get this straight.

414
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:42,062
This guy shot your girlfriend at
point blank range... but she's okay.

415
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:46,984
You think you killed his brother,
but don't know where his body is.

416
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:51,613
The only thing you're absolutely
sure about, is that you killed her.

417
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,325
Yes.

418
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:01,164
Look...

419
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,333
You're a nice kid.
You got no record...

420
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,961
No bad raps, nothing. It's like...

421
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,215
- It's like you don't even exist.
- I did it.

422
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,804
Okay.

423
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:17,514
- What did you do to her?
- You guys have the body, right?
- Yeah...

424
01:08:17,515 --> 01:08:18,932
We have the body.

425
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:21,727
How did you kill her?

426
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:25,646
Okay, the truth is,
I don't remember exactly.

427
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:30,068
- So, how do you know you did it?
- I can't explain it, but I know it was me.

428
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:39,827
- Wait, you're not going to arrest me?
- No. No, I'm not.

429
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,300
But I am going to check
on your girlfriend.

430
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:43,122
If you want to help her,
you'll arrest me.

431
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,667
There's no evidence and you can't
remember what you did.

432
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:52,632
Most people who confess to a crime
can't tell the cops anything about it
because they didn't do it.

433
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,305
Come back when you
remember what happened.

434
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:01,016
Stop!

435
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,773
She was burned?

436
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:10,859
- Go home.
- After sunrise?

437
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,339
What are you doing?

438
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:36,134
Promise me you won't leave this room.

439
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,720
What?

440
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:41,765
You have to stay in here.

441
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,809
Why?

442
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:50,065
I may have infected you.

443
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,070
I don't believe you.

444
01:09:55,177 --> 01:09:56,279
Hey!

445
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,950
- You have to stay in here!
- Don't yell at me.

446
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:05,080
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

447
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,460
Just...

448
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:14,339
- Just promise me you're
going to stay in here.
- Where are you going?

449
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:20,262
Did you kill that kid's brother?

450
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,821
He's dry, man.

451
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:15,168
I ain't so pretty no more, am I?

452
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:20,424
I have you to thank for that.

453
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,477
Old fart.

454
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:35,522
Didn't last very long.

455
01:12:40,944 --> 01:12:43,238
You hungry?

456
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,922
You know, I was really
pissed off at you, man.

457
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:06,970
There's nothing worse than waking
up in the middle of nowhere
with half of your face on fire.

458
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:10,891
But I got over it.

459
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:16,772
Once I had my first taste,
I got over it real fast.

460
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:20,692
Want some?

461
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:29,283
You got to drop the morals, kid.

462
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:32,245
You ain't gonna survive with that baggage.

463
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,415
You're already damned anyway.

464
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:43,006
Pull over, Russell.

465
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:56,395
Look at them all.

466
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:59,773
Think they're happy?

467
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:05,445
Most of them are probably staring
at the tail lights in front of them
wondering what the hell it's all about.

468
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:09,366
Why are they even here.

469
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:13,745
I saw it every day in that hospital.

470
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:17,874
A part of me wanted to help, but...

471
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:22,462
nothing did it for me.

472
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,177
Now there is.

473
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,640
It's going to be my fault.

474
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:43,608
What are you going to do, huh?

475
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:46,945
You going to stop me?

476
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,966
You know too many of my secrets, boy.

477
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:11,428
Now, you go and change your tune.

478
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,473
Or we going to have a problem.

479
01:15:18,037 --> 01:15:19,393
Okay, okay.

480
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:22,356
That's what I'm talking about.

481
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,358
Look, man...

482
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:27,444
I don't want to fight you.

483
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,530
We all alone in this world.

484
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:33,241
Me and you.

485
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,996
It's stupid for us to fight.

486
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:41,625
Look... um...

487
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:46,343
Why don't you help me might as
well dump this mother fucker.

488
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:51,885
Maybe we can talk a little bit more
about how we can work together.

489
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:54,303
Huh?

490
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,598
What do you say, Jacob.

491
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:33,426
Okay, boys.

492
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,721
Get to work.

493
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:45,063
- Marcus, I don't want to do this.
- Shut up, Russell!

494
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,817
- Come on, man, it's just too much.
You got to stop.
- Come here.

495
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,945
Give me the burner.

496
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,948
Give me the fucking gun!

497
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:01,496
Don't you fucking move!

498
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,874
What the fuck did I tell you nigger?

499
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:09,086
Everything's different now.
I ain't never going to stop.

500
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,256
You understand?

501
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,229
Wait there.

502
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:29,149
Help him!

503
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:36,698
Come on, man,
we ain't got all night.

504
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,133
- Your brother's crazy.
- Shut up.

505
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,716
This is what you'll be doing
the rest of your life.

506
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:59,763
Is that what you want?

507
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:03,892
Take a walk.

508
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,234
What did you say to him?

509
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,991
Fuck it!

510
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:24,705
Let's go.

511
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:30,815
Hey!

512
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:39,428
Stupid mother fucker.

513
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:45,327
You leaving me here?

514
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:54,628
It'll be over soon.

515
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,924
You mother fucker!

516
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:17,122
Come on. Wake up!

517
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,546
I'm so hungry.

518
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:29,635
Jesus Christ!

519
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:33,805
What did you do to her?

520
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:39,353
Stand up.

521
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:43,398
Let me see your hands!

522
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:47,361
I'm arresting you.
That's what you want, isn't it?

523
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:53,825
Stand up,
you piece of shit!

524
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,331
Tell everyone.

525
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,835
<i>Everybody got their thing, man.</i>
