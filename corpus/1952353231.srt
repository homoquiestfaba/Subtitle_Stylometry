Earth

00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:18,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,839
but I believe...
...Aang can save the world

16
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:53,684
I discovered a hidden library

17
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,763
I tore through scroll after scroll.

18
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:03,027
You did it! You're a earthbender.

19
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:06,309
Sozen's comet will return by the end of this summer

20
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:12,109
and Firelord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once for all

21
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:17,174
You must defeat the Firelord before the comet arrives.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,376
Book two: Earth
Chapter ten: The Library

23
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,251
What's out here?

24
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:30,958
A lot actually. There's hundreds of little...

25
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,424
Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise.

26
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:35,985
Just watch.

27
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:44,535
I'm putting an orchestra together.

28
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:45,671
Orchestra huh?

29
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,816
Well la dee da.

30
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:02,891
This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about?

31
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,635
We should be making plans.

32
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:06,240
We did make plans.

33
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:08,326
We're all picking mini-vacations.

34
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,298
There's no time for vacations.

35
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,658
I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.

36
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,589
I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara.

37
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,480
I've been training my arrow off.

38
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:20,903
Yeah. What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime?

39
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,815
Even if you do master all of the elements, then what?

40
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,059
It's not like we have a map of the fire nation.

41
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,934
Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?

42
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:32,093
Knock knock! Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home?

43
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:32,991
I don't think so.

44
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,615
We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war.

45
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,556
Alright, we'll finish our vacations,

46
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,446
and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.

47
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:46,794
Your turn Katara.Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,017
How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.

49
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,284
Oh yeah, I've been there.

50
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,132
It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine.

51
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,596
It's one of nature's wonders.

52
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,960
Must have changed ownership since I was here.

53
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,093
One mango please.

54
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:47,219
I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages ...

55
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,813
...while we plan our strategy.

56
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:50,967
Excuse me.

57
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,517
No worries, I clean up easy.

58
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,565
Oh, You're a living relic!

59
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:02,021
Thanks. I try.

60
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:05,231
An Air Nomad, right in front of me.

61
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:09,323
Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.

62
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:13,379
Tell me, which of the Air temples do you hail from?

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,695
The southern temple.

64
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:20,117
Oh splendid! Now tell me, what was the primary agricultural product of your people?

65
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:23,508
Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?

66
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,297
Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal.

67
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,820
So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy.

68
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,477
Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.

69
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,030
Certainly.

70
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:43,031
What, no Fire Nation? Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?

71
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,156
You've made a lot of trips into the desert.

72
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,218
All in vain I'm afraid.

73
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:50,342
I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom,

74
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:54,437
but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel...

75
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:56,812
...Wan Shi Tong's Library.

76
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,661
You spent years walking through the desert ...

77
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,914
...to find some guy's library?

78
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:05,569
This library is more valuable than gold, little lady.

79
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,227
It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge,

80
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,302
and knowledge

81
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,412
... is priceless.

82
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,649
Mm, sounds like good times.

83
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,507
Oh, it is.

84
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:20,321
According to legend, it was built by the great knowledge spirit,

85
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:24,347
Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his foxy knowledge seekers.

86
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:28,036
Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?

87
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,196
I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.

88
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:32,577
You're both right.

89
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:33,755
Handsome little creatures.

90
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:38,353
Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world,

91
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,886
and put them on display for mankind to read,

92
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,361
so that we might better ourselves.

93
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:47,392
If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation?

94
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:48,893
A map maybe?

95
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:52,296
I wouldn't know, but if such a thing exists,

96
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,140
it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library.

97
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,420
Then it's settled.

98
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:01,333
Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation

99
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,334
<i><b>AT THE LIBRARY! </b></i>

100
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:07,432
Uh, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick?

101
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,037
You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.

102
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,691
Of course there's the matter of finding it.

103
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,750
I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert,

104
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,556
and almost died each time.

105
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:22,203
I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross.

106
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,923
Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?

107
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,349
A sky bison?

108
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:29,591
You actually have one?

109
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,744
Sandbenders! Shoo! Away from the bison!

110
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,300
Tell me, sky bison. Are you the last of your breed?

111
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,931
Oh, delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue.

112
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:07,236
Oh the stories this beast could tell.

113
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,747
Shush, chatty monkey.

114
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,289
Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.

115
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:20,931
Aw, does this place even exist?

116
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,516
Some say it doesn't.

117
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,419
Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?

118
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,770
There it is!

119
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:41,069
That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it.

120
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:49,058
It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air.

121
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,999
Down there. What's that?

122
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,565
Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for.

123
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,963
The building in this drawing is enormous.

124
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,049
What kind of animal is that?

125
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:21,146
I think that was one of the knowledge seekers.

126
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:23,487
Oh, we must be close to the library!

127
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:26,941
No, this is the library. Look!

128
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,781
It's completely buried.

129
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,060
The library is buried!?

130
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,183
My life's ambition is now full of sand.

131
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,889
Well, time to start excavating.

132
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,231
Actually, that won't be necessary.

133
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,850
The inside seems to be completely intact,

134
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:55,937
and it's huge.

135
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,799
That fox thingy went in through a window.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,951
I say we climb up there and give it a look.

137
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,409
I say you guys go ahead without me.

138
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,396
You got something against libraries?

139
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:08,375
I've held books before, and I gotta tell you,

140
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:10,326
they don't exactly do it for me.

141
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,363
Oh, right. Sorry.

142
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,177
Let me know if they have something you can listen to.

143
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:24,013
Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again.

144
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,909
You can stay out here with Toph.

145
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,495
What's up?

146
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,419
Oh, it's breath taking.

147
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,433
The spirits spared no expense designing this place.

148
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,845
Look at those beautiful buttresses!

149
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,279
What's funny?

150
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,964
Nothing. We just like architecture.

151
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,656
As do I.

152
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:01,782
My word!

153
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:06,821
The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol

154
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,051
Eh, nice...owl.

155
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,837
I know you're back there.

156
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:36,320
Hello! I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.

157
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,995
You should leave the way you came

158
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:42,641
unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology.

159
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:47,809
Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?

160
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,452
Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong,

161
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,710
he who knows 10,000 things.

162
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,881
And you are obviously humans,

163
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:58,277
which by the way are no longer permitted in my study.

164
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,849
What do you have against humans?

165
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:05,054
Hmm, humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans,

166
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:08,807
like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago,

167
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:11,775
looking to destroy his enemy.

168
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:12,606
So...

169
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:15,138
who are you trying to destroy?

170
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,348
What? Oh, no,

171
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:19,419
no, no destroying, we're not into that.

172
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,000
Then why have you come here?

173
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:26,046
knowledge, for, knowledge's sake.

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,262
If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being,

175
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,766
you should at least put some effort into it.

176
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,494
I'm not lying. I'm here with the Avatar, and he's ...

177
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,175
the bridge between our worlds, he'll vouch for me.

178
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:42,519
Uh, yeah, I'll vouch.

179
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:46,096
We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.

180
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,532
You have my word.

181
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:50,219
very well.

182
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,105
I'll let you peruse my vast collection,

183
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,975
on one condition.

184
00:11:54,976 --> 00:12:00,861
To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge.

185
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,145
Please accept this tome as a donation to your library.

186
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:08,196
First edition, very nice.

187
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,160
I have an authentic waterbending scroll.

188
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,417
Oh...these illustrations are quite stylish.

189
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:22,635
Uh, oh, I know!

190
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,598
I suppose that counts.

191
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:30,850
Oh, great spirit, Check this out!

192
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,138
It's a special knot! That counts as knowledge.

193
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,647
You're not very bright, are you?

194
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,050
Enjoy the library.

195
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,486
Bright enough to fool you.

196
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,479
So,

197
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,372
you like flyin'?

198
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:04,875
Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see.

199
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:07,829
Well, I don't see the way you do.

200
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,824
I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet,

201
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,809
but this sand is so loose and shifty,

202
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,365
it makes everything look fuzzy.

203
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,752
Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy.

204
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,217
Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.

205
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,939
Eh, I've seen weirder.

206
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,070
Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left handed?

207
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:40,803
I always knew I was special.

208
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,904
The darkest day in Fire Nation history.

209
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,422
It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.

210
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,214
Sokka, where are you going?

211
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:09,095
I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day.

212
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,767
This could be promising.

213
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,173
The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.

214
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,877
Firebender.

215
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:22,984
They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.

216
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,244
That's so unfair!

217
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:27,926
Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation,

218
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,414
it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.

219
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,846
I need to know what happened on the darkest day.

220
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,082
Hello, little weird fox guy.

221
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,882
Seems it's trying to assist you.

222
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,847
Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you.

223
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,483
This room is a true marvel.

224
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,160
A mechanical wonder!

225
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,336
It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving.

226
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:28,229
Uh, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful?

227
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,627
Maybe these dials represent dates and times.

228
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:34,524
Sokka, try entering that date from the parchment you took.

229
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,138
shh, Katara

230
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,907
Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.

231
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:04,480
Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation, for sure.

232
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,150
Hey wait, what happened to the sun?

233
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:13,327
Great, you must have broken it.

234
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:15,128
It's not broken.

235
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,164
The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse!

236
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:23,768
It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it!

237
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:28,481
Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why.

238
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:32,042
Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse!

239
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,357
Sorry

240
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,641
That makes sense.

241
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:38,575
I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders.

242
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,990
This is huge.

243
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,053
Fine, you earned it.

244
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,855
We've got to get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.

245
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:54,361
We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless.

246
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:56,656
The Fire Lord is goin' down!

247
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,941
Mortals are so predictable.

248
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,462
And such terrible liars.

249
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,951
You betrayed my trust.

250
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:14,729
From the beginning you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.

251
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:18,429
You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation.

252
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,356
You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous.

253
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:24,159
We need this information.

254
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:28,268
You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified?

255
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:33,716
Countless others before you have come here, seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.

256
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,196
We had no choice.

257
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:38,348
Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.

258
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,253
And now I'm going to protect what I love.

259
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,544
What are you doing?

260
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,983
I'm taking my knowledge back.

261
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:52,891
No one will ever abuse it again.

262
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,697
He's sinking the building! We've gotta get out of here!

263
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:58,354
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

264
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,616
You already know too much.

265
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:14,484
I already told you, I don't want to snuggle.

266
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,000
Library's sinking

267
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,879
Library's sinking!

268
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,859
Great knowledge spirit, I beg you.

269
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,142
Do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes.

270
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,776
We've gotta get back to the surface.

271
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,362
Sokka, let's go!

272
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,017
But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna happen.

273
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:20,243
Don't be stupid, we'll find out later.

274
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,429
No, we won't.

275
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,106
If we leave this place we'll never get the information.

276
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:26,771
Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.

277
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:29,190
Katara, take Momo and get out of here.

278
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:29,723
But

279
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:30,656
Go£¡

280
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:32,743
Hurry, Sokka

281
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,647
What is it now?

282
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,291
Who's there?

283
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,946
Why are we doing this?

284
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,768
Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past,

285
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,279
then maybe it can project when the next one will be.

286
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,539
You can't possibly check every single date.

287
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,590
I don't have to.

288
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,761
We just have to check every date before Sozin's comet arrives,

289
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,457
because after that...

290
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
Well, try not to think about that.

291
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,194
Come on eclipse!

292
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,399
That's it, the solar eclipse!

293
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
It's just a few months away.

294
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:56,412
Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.

295
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,763
Don't make me put this down.

296
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,346
No, stop sinking.

297
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:34,372
NO

298
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:36,714
I'm sorry Appa.

299
00:21:55,781 --> 00:22:00,223
At least I'll have one specimen to add to my collection.

300
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:12,563
Your waterbending won't do you much good here.

301
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:19,168
I've studied Northern Water Style, Southern Water Style, even Foggy Swamp Style.

302
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:28,117
That's called Sokka style. Learn it!

303
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:36,604
Wait! Professor, let's go!

304
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:42,016
I'm not leaving. I can't. I've spent too long trying to find this place.

305
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:45,411
There's not another collection of knowledge like this on Earth.

306
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,621
I could spend an eternity in here.

307
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:50,985
Just go!

308
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,454
We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming.

309
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:23,640
The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!

310
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,739
Where's Appa?

311
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:40,183
