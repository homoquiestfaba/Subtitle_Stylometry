for everyone else.

thought everyone else

Riding that highway loop

12
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,370
was the only job he'd ever had,

classes he took

him staring at me.

Does 1t talk?

185
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,107
Are you keeping it?

186
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,048
No.

187
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,483
No it doesn't talk, or
no you're not keeping it?

188
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,282
No, I'm not keeping it.

189
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,448
Then why did you buy a
cage at the pet store?

190
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,422
Don't you have something to do?

191
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,652
Yes.

192
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,023
I'm helping you.

193
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,528
I don't need any help.

194
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,188
You don't want any help.

195
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,493
But I'm very good
with pets. I'll help.

196
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,760
It's nota pet.

197
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,165
It's not a pet?

198
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,395
You're a librarian
for god's sake.

199
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,768
Can't you whisper?

200
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,398
When I talk like this,
people don't listen.

201
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,772
Okay I found a parrot,

202
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,041
and I'm trying to find
out about it so I can

203
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,552
return it to it's owner.

204
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:25,219
Okay, so what does
it look like?

205
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,059
It's uh...

206
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,359
pink...

207
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,728
pink?

208
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,426
The parrot is pink?

209
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,233
Uh... no it's... well
it's green... with uh,

210
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,400
it's more green than pink, with
a yellow patch on it's head.

211
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,000
Hm... what's his name?

212
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,442
How would I know?

213
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,538
Well, ask him.

214
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,312
Wait. That's him.

215
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,149
Yellow-naped amazon?

216
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,120
All the way from south america.

217
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,647
Look here, it says "a
fine ker, gentle and clever."

218
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:59,560
has he said anything yet?

219
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,741
Wow.

220
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,506
Really?

221
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,979
Yeah, sometimes he sounds
like a little girl,

222
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,983
then he sounds like a
wise old preacher.

223
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
What's bring?

224
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,384
More like brrrinnng
the way a telephone rings.

225
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,883
I think that "Ma 17"
might mean something.

226
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,224
Are you sure he didn't
say "I'm seventeen"?

227
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,198
No, it was a capital M,
capital A, then the number 17.

228
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:41,500
How do you know it was a capital
a, and not a little "a", hmm?

229
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,267
Maybe that's his name.

230
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,309
Why would anyone name
a bird Ma 17?

231
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,245
Maybe... he's
a secret agent.

232
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,478
[laughing]

233
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,482
Wait,

234
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,717
I was kidding.

235
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,785
I can help you.

236
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,649
I'd like to meet him.

237
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,019
I can help you.

238
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,883
I'd like to meet him.

239
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,185
I'd like to meet him.

240
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,693
You can't, I work nights.

241
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,923
Wow, our schedules
are so opposite.

242
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,828
Ok, I'll come to work with you.

243
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,764
I get off at 9,

244
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:11,733
then afterwards I
can meet the parrot.

245
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,962
You can't come.

246
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,197
It's dangerous.

247
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,966
How?

248
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,029
You're out in the
middle of nowhere,

249
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,131
you never know who's out there.

250
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,642
Robbers, axe murderers...

251
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,542
murderers still use axes?

252
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,815
Lyman wait.

253
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,748
Lyman...

254
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,649
I'll sit on the far
side of the truck.

255
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,551
I just think it would be cool
driving around at night,

256
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,647
helping stranded people.

257
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,022
What are you afraid of?

258
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,719
I've never been
afraid of anything.

259
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,091
That's a big fat one,

260
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,755
you're scared to death of me,

261
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,991
and I'm just a
girl that likes you.

262
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,226
Where does that come from?

263
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,858
You don't even know me.

264
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,267
I'll help you with
your parrot search.

265
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,771
The last thing the parrot said,

266
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,170
the B of the air thing,

267
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,537
I think I know where it's from.

268
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,635
[phone noise]

269
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,805
Oh look who's got my number.

270
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,316
And now I've got yours.

271
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,316
I have to put an ad in the
paper and go to class.

272
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,654
And I lied. I'm
afraid of tornadoes.

273
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,758
PROFESSOR PAQUET: <i>"Comment dit
on il faut faire attention"</i>

274
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,896

275
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,906
Lyman?

276
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,373
<i>"Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez?"</i>

277
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,181
Lyman...

278
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,746
Scusi, cosa?

279
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,185
I mean... <i>"pourriez vous</i>

280
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,154

281
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,214
<i>s'il vous plait?"</i>

282
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,320
Non.

283
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,032
Than ks.

284
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,932
I'll put your order right in.

285
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,995
How are you...

286
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,972
Margie?

287
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,442
Tonight.

288
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,777
Why Lyman, is that you
starting a conversation?

289
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,907
I'm very well.

290
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,043
My feet hurt.

291
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,522
But thank you for asking.

292
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,991
How are you?

293
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,929
I feel... fine.

294
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,126
Hungry I guess.
I found a parrot.

295
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,033
Hmm.

296
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,633
You really think so?

297
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,973
Yeah.

298
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,343
I think it means

299
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,815
give some of what you have to
the people with nothing.

300
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,513
It's good advice, nobody ever
went wrong with that.

301
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,782
About the other
things he said...

302
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,948
[radio chatter]

303
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,014
You eat.

304
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,617
TOM ON RADIO: Lyman, you
still at Margie's?

305
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,286
Sure is.

306
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,955
We've got a jack-knifed rig
flipped at the

307
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,657
eldorado turnoff.

308
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,701
Ambulance is stuck downtown.

309
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,963
Copy that Tom, I'll put his
dinner in the warmer.

310
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,666
Thanks Margie.

311
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,477
[grunting]

312
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,382
How you doing?

313
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,182
TRUCKER: Scorched my crotch
with my damn coffee.

314
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,052
I think my leg's broke.

315
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,216
Emt's are on the way.

316
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,123
[phone ringing]

317
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:27,220
[grunting]

318
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,692
That your girlfriend?

319
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,533
She's not my girlfriend.

320
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,833
Hello?

321
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,929
Jeez, tell her I'm working.

322
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,065
FIONA ON PHONE: Lyman?

323
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,734
He's kinda busy right now,

324
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,436
he's gonna have to call
you right back.

325
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,036
Hold on... she says
it's about the bird.

326
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,945
Hang up!

327
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,813
I was right.

328
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,546
That thing the bird said,
it's from the bible.

329
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,451
Really?

330
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,080
She says the thing he said,
it's from the bible.

331
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,125
Just hang up, man!

332
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,386
It's kind of mystical and
spiritual...

333
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,726
and I don't know I think it's
one very special bird.

334
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,197
Ma'am, you tell that bird
to pray for me, will ya?

335
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,824
I don't really know
what it means,

336
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,266
but I think it's important.

337
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,263
Lyman?

338
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,135
For pete's sake.

339
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,798
Lyman, why would that man want
the bird...

340
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,001
Lyman?

341
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,601
MOTHER ON PHONE:
Who's Lyman?

342
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,579
Oh it's uh...
it's no one mom,

343
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,274
uh, what's up?

344
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,840
I know it's someone
special when you

345
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,442
whisper, Fiona Christina.

346
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,748
I'm a librarian.
I whisper.

347
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,847
No you don't.

348
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:32,294
Fiona, remember our little talk?
No one unavailable this time?

349
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,921
Where do you find them?

350
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,933
Mom, I'm almost 30, you
can stop raising me now

351
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,630
you know.

352
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,934
Hey there.

353
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,444
It's from ecclesiastes, the
old testament, after the

354
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,537
"nothing new under the sun"

355
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,549
and "everything has
a season bit."

356
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,678
Look. "Curse not the king,
curse not the rich.

357
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,451
Fora bird of the air
shall carry the word,

358
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,550
and that which hath wings
shall tell the matter."

359
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,492
weird huh?

360
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,929
That which hath wings
shall tell the matter.

361
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,989
What does that mean?

362
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,696
Well, it's about this preacher
guy who decides that all is

363
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,070
vanity, and since life is so
short, we should eat, drink,

364
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,508
be merry and enjoy god's gifts.

365
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,374
Lyman!

366
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,141
Show some respect.

367
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,012
That is what bookmarks are for.

368
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,745
Lyman...

369
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,684
Lyman...

370
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,744
is that your first name
or your last name?

371
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,415
Last.

372
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,117
So what's your first name?

373
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,489
Don't have one.

374
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,994
Everybody has a first name.

375
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,154
You can tell me, I won't laugh,

376
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,391
I promise.

377
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,297
They don't have first and
last names in the bible.

378
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,892
Jesus of nazareth...

379
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,029
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm...

380
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,437
Lyman of the highway.

381
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:04,310
[engine rewing]

382
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,389
140 this is 190.

383
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,264
Tell the troopers to watch
out for a red mustang

384
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,400
tell the troopers to watch
out for a red mustang

385
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,561
going north towards
decatur road.

386
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,764
Driving like he wants
to kill himself.

387
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,711
[phone ringing]

388
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,748
FRANK: I'm so hungry my stomach
thinks my throat's been cut.

389
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,345
Evening, frank.

390
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,856
The usual, darlin'?

391
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,017
Thanks, Margie.

392
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,118
You know anything about a '67
red mustang muscle ca

393
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,628
you seen it around?

394
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:51,634
A 427 cubic inch
390 horse engine?

395
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,695
No haven't seen it. Sure
would love to though.

396
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,175
By the way, Fiona says
to please call her.

397
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,042
She ran out of gas
on the 599 tonight.

398
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,547
Nice girl.

399
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,107
My, she sure can talk.

400
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,481
Met Lyman's girl.

401
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,111
She's not my girl.

402
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,416
That's not what she says.

403
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,753
You keeping secrets, Lyman?

404
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,384
Gotta go.

405
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,829
My ears are still bleeding.

406
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,294
Surprise!

407
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,963
I don't like surprises.

408
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,029
Of course you do.
Everybody likes surprises.

409
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,076
Nope, not me.

410
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,542
Well, I was worried about you.

411
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,374
How did you know where I live?

412
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,038
It's in the campus directory.

413
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,980
It's not an open invitation.

414
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,542
You didn't return my phone
calls, so I came over.

415
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,554
You'd thank me if you were
dead in the bathtub.

416
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,056
I don't even have a bathtub.

417
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,252
Why didn't you tell me you
lived in a place like this?

418
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,454
I've never told you
lots of things.

419
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,929
Man, if I lived in a
place like this,

420
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,694
it would be the first
thing that I'd tell.

421
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,862
Hey, do you ever go
anywhere in it?

422
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,906
It's my house.

423
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,133
I don't go places in it.

424
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,142
I come home to it.

425
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,905
I'll get it.

426
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,378
No it's okay, let me...

427
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,778
[dog growling]

428
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,213
- He's very protective.
- Jeez...

429
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,012
- No Floyd.
- Let go!

430
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,144
I wasn't attacking you
the phone's ringing...

431
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,585
let go, you stupid dog.

432
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,054
He is far from stupid.

433
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,320
Floyd, no.

434
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,985
How much do you weigh?

435
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,496
Hello, Mr. Lyman's
assistant speaking...

436
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,623
ELEANOR ON PHONE: I'm calling
about the lost parrot.

437
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,133
70?

438
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,327
'Scuse me...

439
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,892
sorry.

440
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,563
- Do you have my bird?
- Jeez, stop!

441
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,334
Can you describe
your bird for me?

442
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,534
He's green with a spot of yellow
on the back of his head...

443
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,077
every parrot's green.

444
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,406
Hello?...

445
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,969
let go!

446
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,673
Does your bird say
anything special?

447
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,273
He says, "speak for self"
and "shut up."

448
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,875
sometimes "prepare
to meet your maker."

449
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,386
I guess breakfast's
gonna have to wait.

450
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,218
Why do we have to
have the heat on?

451
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,985
It's gotta be like 100 degrees.

452
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,616
Non-t!

453
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,925
Parrots are very
susceptible to drafts.

454
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,127
You trying to get me to
take my top off?

455
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,699
Yes!

456
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,936
I just love it when the losts
match up with the founds.

457
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,469
It feels so right.

458
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,875
I don't know what I'd do
if I ever lost Floyd.

459
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,674
Are you sure you
want to do this?

460
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,551
Are you sure you
want to do this?

461
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,085
[dog barking]

462
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,693
ELEANOR: Shut up!

463
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,358
Hi.

464
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,901
Yeah, that's him.

465
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,503
Bring him on in.

466
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,172
Thank you for
bringing him back,

467
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,148
have a seat.

468
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,118
You can put him right there.

469
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,555
He's trouble is all he is.

470
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,388
I brought his things,
his toys and...

471
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,519
I never offered no reward.

472
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,153
No it's okay, I didn't
expect anything.

473
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,424
I'm just happy he's...

474
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,897
shut up...

475
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,558
shut up!

476
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,765
Jeez, I forgot how awful he is.

477
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,307
I was wondering, why did you
teach him the things he says?

478
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,536
Honey, I've had him for eight
years and the only thing he

479
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,204
learned in this house
is "shut up".

480
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:28,547
Between that dog and this
bird, I'm like to lose my mind.

481
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,779
Then why did you answer the ad?

482
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,788
He's worth a fortune.

483
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,381
People will pay seven or
eight hundred bucks

484
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,688
for a talking bird.

485
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,730
I'll give you a thousand
dollars for him.

486
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:45,564
Well I'm not selling it now.
He keeps the dog company.

487
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:49,070
We'll take the dog, too.

488
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,801
Dog's not for sale.

489
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:57,336
But okay you got me, I'll take
two thousand for the bird.

490
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,109
Two thousand?

491
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,274
Are you kidding?

492
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,681
No.

493
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,220
What are you doing?

494
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,380
You write that check for a penny
more than eight hundred dollars,

495
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,617
and I will divorce
you on the spot.

496
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,023
Fiona will you wait outside?

497
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,185
Please?

498
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,455
I mean it.

499
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,825
Don't push me.

500
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,554
I will take the kids to mom's.

501
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,922
I will take the kids to mom's.

502
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,591
You better have
a good attorney.

503
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:23,571
All right all right... 900.

504
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,837
Ahem...

505
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:31,040
ok, 800.

506
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,517
Ma'am, can I ask you where
you got the bird from?

507
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,987
Murray's retirement home.
They gave me the bird for free.

508
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,792
Where are you going?

509
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,997
Congratulations,
you own a parrot.

510
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,633
Were you actually going to pay
that woman two thousand dollars?

511
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,404
Are you one of those secret
lottery millionaires

512
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,070
who lives in a trailer?

513
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,772
I don't gamble.

514
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,474
Why does that not surprise me?

515
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,040
I need to find the real owner.

516
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,609
The wise man that taught
him what to say.

517
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,120
It's not random.

518
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:12,409
It's no joke.

519
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,980
It's no joke.

520
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,958
MRS. BLAIR: Oh yes, that looks
like shelton all right.

521
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,428
One of the lucky ones who got
out of here alive.

522
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,294
Shelton?

523
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,264
He was ruby Ballard's bird.

524
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,394
She died 12, 13 years back.

525
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,734
The family left him
to the center.

526
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,173
We kept him in the lobby
for a couple years.

527
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,734
Until his mouth got
him kicked out.

528
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,110
Pre to meet your maker?

529
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,207
Not what our residents want to
hear over their morning oatmeal.

530
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,252
I can imagine.

531
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,551
Anyway, it has been a real
pleasure, Mrs. Blair.

532
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,887
And if you would be so kind as
to e-mail me your records on

533
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,927
Mrs. Ballard's family.

534
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,655
Certainly, I'd be glad to.

535
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,390
I'm sure that the
inheritance you spoke of

536
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,125
will be a welcome surprise.

537
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,962
Here you go.

538
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,729
It says you work in a library.

539
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,702
Oh that's a cover,
mrs. Blair.

540
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,262
In our line of work,
we can't be too careful.

541
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,434
Thank you so much for
your cooperation.

542
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,171
You're welcome.

543
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:13,649
Inheritance?

544
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,742
MARGIE VO: The parrot brought up
a lot of questions for Lyman

545
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,447
but those only created
more questions.

546
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,651
He kept rolling ecclesiastes
over and over in his head.

547
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,660
Race is not to the swift,

548
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,753
nor the battle to the strong,

549
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,321
nor yet riches to men
of understanding.

550
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,130
But time and chance
happen to them all.

551
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,797
Wasn't that what he
saw every night?

552
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,703
Didn't it prove?

553
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:42,302
Prove what?

554
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,542
Anybody home?

555
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,347
I brought a
cage-warming present.

556
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,354
Hello there.

557
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,514
Polly want a...

558
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,852
shut up.

559
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,221
I'm an eagle.

560
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,692
Wow.

561
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,253
He actually said it.

562
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,595
How come his lips don't
move when he talks?

563
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,158
Only when he reads.

564
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,761
[whistling]

565
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,397
Why thank you.

566
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,464
So, does he whistle much?

567
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,411
First time.

568
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,115
Speak for yourself.

569
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:32,088
Lyman, don't forget,
read and release.

570
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,757
When I'm finished, I'll
release it back into the wild.

571
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,566
Where'd you get all this stuff?

572
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,106
It's like living
on an intersection.

573
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,440
People lose things,
I pick them up.

574
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,672
What?

575
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,681
I collect them.

576
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,343
You collect other
people's trophies?

577
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,283
I buy them,

578
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,619
at garage sales
and flea markets.

579
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,249
You're flawed...

580
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,294
people collect all
kinds of things.

581
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,193
Shows you can
accomplish something.

582
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,855
Well, they obviously
didn't mean very much

583
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,298
to the people that won them.

584
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,063
Ok houdini,

585
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,866
let's see you get out of that.

586
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,407
Hey, how come you have don't
have any photos around?

587
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,942
I don't take photos.

588
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,375
What about your family?

589
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,502
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

590
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,841
No.

591
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,209
What about your folks?

592
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,577
Why are you asking me all this?

593
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,583
I just asked about your parents.

594
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,085
Why does everything have to be
such a big deal secret with you?

595
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,144
It's not a big deal secret.

596
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,815
I was found by the side of
the road when I was four.

597
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,223
What?

598
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,854
Well, at least that's what they
told me in all the foster homes.

599
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,330
You're an orphan?

600
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,527
Jeez, I'm not an
orphan anymore.

601
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,901
I'm own man.

602
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,099
You don't have anybody?

603
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,664
Just me.

604
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,337
What's wrong?

605
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,107
It's just normal for me.

606
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,518
I can't miss
something I never had.

607
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,212
I just...

608
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,563
I don't know what I would
do if I didn't have

609
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,228
a family that was always
ready for me to come home.

610
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,180
I have to go.

611
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,689
Hey, I'm the orphan,
I'm not crying.

612
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:46,161
I have to go.

613
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,424
Sounds like you got
a loose rod...

614
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,228
Fiona, you need to
get someone to look...

615
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,840
what?

616
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,036
Stay tuned.

617
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,774
Could you be more specific?

618
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,340
A bird of the air
shall carry the word.

619
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,852
You're serious?

620
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,122
He has no family at all?

621
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:23,029
You sure he just doesn't
want you to meet them?

622
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,361
How much do you know about him?

623
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,992
Anything?

624
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,094
No, but it's not like that.

625
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,639
He works for the
highway department,

626
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,676
that's nearly like the police.

627
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,404
Amber, don't give me that look.

628
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,104
Conditioner.

629
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:41,207
He's just socially challenged.

630
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,378
Although he has a strange birth
date on his license,

631
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,720
and he does talk about
axe murderers.

632
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,023
Give some to the parrot.

633
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,073
Mmm...

634
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,377
mmm mmm, good.

635
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,821
Campbell's commercial?

636
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,521
Stay tuned.

637
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,663
Shelton?

638
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,798
Shelly?

639
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,707
Tim?

640
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,366
Calvin?

641
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,217
Grace?

642
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,392
Walter?

643
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,591
Joe?

644
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,792
Hen ry?

645
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,529
Billy?

646
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,382
[siren blaring]

647
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,927
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE:
Campus security!

648
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,122
You, under the car!

649
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,131
Come out. Now!

650
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,224
SECURITY GUARD: Up.

651
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,290
Spread your legs and put
your hands against the car.

652
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,030
This isn't what it looks like.

653
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,628
Whoa, hold on a minute.

654
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,002
Face forward please.

655
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,700
Lower your left hand, sir.

656
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,071
Is this your car?

657
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,769
No, it's not.

658
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,141
That's my truck over there.

659
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,010
I work for the
courtesy patrol, and... ow!

660
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,448
Just answer the question, sir.

661
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,712
It belongs to someone I know...

662
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,718
she's a librarian here...

663
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,083
she's my..

664
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,850
My... girlfriend.

665
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,823
You're going to steal
your girlfriend's car?

666
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,416
No.

667
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,359
You think I'd steal
this piece of shit?

668
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,691
All I know is what I saw...

669
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,754
what's going on here?

670
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,129
Do you know this man?

671
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,930
He says he's your boyfriend.

672
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,903
Depends, what was he doing?

673
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,769
He was prowling around,

674
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,708
acting really suspicious.

675
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,142
Is this your car?

676
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,146
Yes, sir.

677
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,446
Isn't she a beauty?

678
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,043
I was just waiting
for you honey,

679
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,215
you didn't leave me the key.

680
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,919
You know how you always forget?

681
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,759
Oh... yes.

682
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,633
You're right, they're
both still here on the ring.

683
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,330
Silly me.

684
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,032
I'm so sorry,

685
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,076
honey.

686
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,545
Would you drive, honey?

687
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:08,414
It makes me feel so safe.

688
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,850
Thank you officer
for being so vigilant.

689
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,218
There's no telling what
kind of idiot pervert

690
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,883
could be lurking out
here in the night.

691
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,393
From what I hear, there
are axe murderers everywhere.

692
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,659
It's unlocked.

693
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,196
So I'm your girlfriend now?

694
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,639
I just said it to
get rid of him.

695
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,040
Because I'm not
your girlfriend.

696
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,045
Your car is a deathtrap.

697
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,604
You mean Sacajawea?

698
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,445
Yeah.

699
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,248
Yeah, names are important.
After the indian scout.

700
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,085
She's a heroine of mine.

701
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,681
Why did you say I'm flawed?

702
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,284
Intuition.

703
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,919
I'm flawed.

704
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,156
Everybody's flawed.

705
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,596
I'm sorry I said it.

706
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,826
I don't want to
frighten anybody.

707
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,458
I was disappointed.

708
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,129
And then you were mean
to Floyd, and I love Floyd.

709
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,538
And he could be your friend too
if you didn't hate dogs so much.

710
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,008
Your intuition is
just terrible.

711
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,909
I don't hate dogs.

712
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,141
Has mrs. Blair called
you about the parrot?

713
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,206
I called and they
said she was fired.

714
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,718
I've put ads in the
paper and gone online,

715
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,688
I don't know.

716
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,987
Just don't bail on me, Fiona.

717
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,789
And I do like dogs,

718
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,024
I just haven't spent a lot of
time around them lately.

719
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:32,124
I did some research on Ma 17.

720
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:36,467
I think it's a phone number from
way back, like the 1930's.

721
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,030
But that would make
the parrot 80 years old.

722
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,509
Parrots are like the giant
tortoises of the bird world.

723
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,239
Whose number is it?

724
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,076
I don't know.

725
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,412
All the old records are
kept in the state library,

726
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,041
archive stuff,
for reference only.

727
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,042
Archive stuff,
for reference only.

728
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,682
JOHN: Hey, are you lost?

729
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,929
[dog barking]

730
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,827
Who is it, Floyd?

731
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,834
You didn't even check
to see who was there.

732
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,198
I could have been...

733
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,703
...an axe murderer?

734
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,569
Yeah, I know.
Come on in.

735
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,332
Just for a second,
after the library

736
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,072
I need to go home and sleep.

737
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,747
Lots of books.

738
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,450
Yeah, I buy them at yard sales.

739
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,425
Sometimes they're
even in the "free" box.

740
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,793
I mend them and I pass them on.

741
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,060
Exciting hobby.

742
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,033
Well, it's not collecting other
people's trophies but...

743
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:48,907
those trophies would've
been thrown away.

744
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,370
So would those books.

745
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,242
So would those books.

746
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,840
So, we gonna take Sacajawea?

747
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,579
I wouldn't get in your car even
if it was named mother teresa.

748
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,918
Fine, we'll take yours,
Wigglebutt.

749
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,481
Where's your leash?

750
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,390
He's not coming with us, is he?

751
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,860
He's at home for nine
hours while I'm at work.

752
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,127
He comes.

753
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,333
A seeing eye dog?

754
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,432
He's so short he
couldn't see over a curb.

755
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,340
This is embarrassing as hell.

756
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,310
It's the only way
they'll let him in.

757
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,974
'cause he hates to miss out.

758
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,812
Stop that.

759
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,681
I took up Shelton's mystery,

760
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,311
the least you could
do is participate.

761
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,787
He doesn't answer to shelton.

762
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,450
He's yours now,
you can name him.

763
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,720
He's not mine to name.
He's just the messenger.

764
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,489
So were just gonna keep
calling him the parrot?

765
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,996
I'll bet every time he sees
you, he's thinking.

766
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,293
"Oh, there's the human."

767
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,497
come on, "the canine."

768
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,266
he's calling security.

769
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,864
I'm going to be
handcuffed again.

770
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,807
PAUL: Sit.

771
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,539
Good boy.

772
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,547
Hi Fiona, back again?

773
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,207
Hi paul, just those
old phone books and

774
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,751
census records this time.

775
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,185
Funny.

776
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,587
You are so gullible.

777
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,294
I didn't know you could...

778
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,700
mmhmm.

779
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,602
What did you say to make
him look like that?

780
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,901
I told him your
nipples were orange.

781
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,034
They are not!

782
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,244
It's not 1930.

783
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,648
It's not 1931 either.

784
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:40,678
Keep working forward.

785
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,794
Did he just bite you?

786
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,858
No, I was just holding his
ear and I felt a pulse.

787
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,804
Of course he has a pulse.
You are so weird, Lyman.

788
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,488
Do you have any sections
on the bible?

789
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,182
LIBRARIAN:
The <i>"bible"</i> bible?

790
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,553
Yep.

791
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,117
Sure. Follow me.

792
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,265
Ma 17.

793
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,670
I found it.

794
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,208
It was in the 1932 book.

795
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,244
It belonged to A.J. Campbell.

796
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,302
Than ks.

797
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,644
So we uh... just need to check
the uh... current phonebooks

798
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,581
for relatives.

799
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,880
I'm way ahead of
you, dr. Watson.

800
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,751
There are two pages of
campbells and a whole column

801
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,983
of j's, fifty at least.

802
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,356
That's ok.

803
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,055
I'll call them all.

804
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,224
No, that's ok.

805
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,858
Let me, you sleep all day.

806
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,425
Can you check these out?

807
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:06,066
I don't have a
library card here.

808
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,076
You're all alike.

809
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,239
What?

810
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:18,218
Why are you acting so hostile
towards me, out of nowhere?

811
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,087
[screaming] Can I get some
service over here, please?

812
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,648
You're always looking
for something new,

813
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,920
something different,
something other than

814
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,394
what's right in front of you.

815
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,931
Can I get a tiny
hint of servility?

816
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,100
[banging]

817
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,737
Tough to handle these
wild mood swings, huh?

818
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,483
Here she comes.

819
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,887
Act like it never happened.

820
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,392
Here.

821
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,927
Be sure to return them.

822
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,360
Don't rip them, don't
dog ear them,

823
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,227
don't tear them, don't
spill anything on them.

824
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,133
They're in my name.

825
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,001
I'm sorry, it's just
a release, screaming

826
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,442
in other peoples libraries.

827
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,637
Come on, Floyd.

828
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,611
Come on.

829
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,808
You love me...

830
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,179
next time bring a pillow.

831
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:44,897
[engine rewing]

832
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:03,557
BEARDED MAN: Ahhh! I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you!

833
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,719
You worthless piece of shit!

834
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,695
You sorry ass piece of
stinkin' garbage.

835
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:16,201
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

836
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,967
Go ahead, shoot!

837
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,701
You'd be doing me a favor.

838
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,764
I don't want to shoot you, sir.

839
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,242
Not me, you idiot.

840
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,439
Shoot the goddamn car!

841
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,176
[sobbing]

842
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,776
This... this damn car
is killing me.

843
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:35,085
Shoot the car, please!

844
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,024
Please!

845
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,788
[gunshot]

846
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,659
Yes! Oh yes,

847
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,788
Yes!

848
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,161
Thank you.

849
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,564
Again!

850
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:47,363
[gunshot]

851
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,698
Yes.

852
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,170
Beautiful.

853
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,331
Now me.

854
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:56,208
No no, it's my gun.

855
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,506
Oh, thank you.

856
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:01,014
Thank you.

857
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,484
Yes!

858
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,855
140, this is 190.

859
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,593
I've got a wreck
at mile marker 92.

860
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,066
Send an ambulance.

861
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,195
TOM ON RADIO: Copy 190.

862
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,491
WHISPERS: Hey buddy, come on.

863
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:57,198
Come on.

864
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:24,828
[crying]

865
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,994
It's okay, it's okay.

866
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,574
I'm fine, I'm fine.

867
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,894
What are you doing here?

868
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,124
I've been looking
all over for you.

869
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,632
I've got a deadline.

870
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:32,894
I need to keep my head down.

871
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,061
Well, here.

872
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,162
Ms. blair from
the home emailed.

873
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,968
It's charles Ballard's
phone number.

874
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,804
Ruby's son.

875
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,844
Thanks.

876
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,369
You're amazing.

877
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,750
Were you hiding from me?

878
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:58,588
No of course not, it's just
quieter back here, that's all.

879
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,142
Well, somebody in this
town knows you.

880
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:24,117
Hello, is this
Mr. Charles ballard?

881
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,189
Mr. Ballard?

882
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:29,918
CHARLES BALLARD: You the
parrot fella?

883
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,325
Prepare to meet your maker.

884
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,556
Momma believed since you never
knew when you're really

885
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:40,090
gonna go, it was best
to keep a clear conscience.

886
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,330
That led to some pretty
awkward conversations,

887
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,965
I tell ya.

888
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,976
Some things a son
should never know.

889
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,342
When did you buy the
bird, Mr. Ballard?

890
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:56,316
We bought it for momma for
company after daddy died in '79.

891
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,377
That's when she had the
stroke and that's...

892
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,581
when she and the bird went
into Murray's home.

893
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,625
Do you remember who
you bought it from?

894
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,159
Yep, sure do.

895
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,092
He was being transferred
out of state,

896
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,494
so he couldn't take
the bird with him.

897
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,762
I've got some information
on him if you'd like.

898
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,564
I'll get it for you.

899
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,036
I think I found him here.

900
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:21,633
That's him.
Stowalski, Eli Stowalski.

901
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:28,212
Seen him ata screaming eagles
reunion about four years ago.

902
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,308
Nice to see him
after all those years?

903
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,752
Naw, he was always
a total asshole.

904
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,454
LYMAN ON PHONE:
Hello, Mr. Stowalski?

905
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,256
This may seem strange, but I'm
calling about a bird.

906
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,990
It's the parrot you owned Mr.
Stowalski, back in the 60's.

907
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,360
STOWALSKI: What?

908
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,331
What are you talking about?

909
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,696
That thing should have
been dead years ago.

910
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:47,928
No, sir, it's him all right.

911
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,062
Mr. Ballard confirmed it.

912
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,606
Ballard? That asshole?
What would he know?

913
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,164
Did you teach him anything in
particular, Mr. Stowalski?

914
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,676
Who, ballard?

915
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,972
No sir, the parrot.

916
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,774
I sure did.

917
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,542
I painted his head white

918
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,141
with shoe polish, I was an
instructor with the

919
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:07,916
101st airborne, "screaming
eagles" you know?

920
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:12,120
So, I taught him to say:
"I'm an eagle."

921
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:15,163
the boys in the flight ready
room would rub his cage

922
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,754
before flying,

923
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,822
for luck.

924
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,961
Gave them some confidence, a
feeling of self-worth you know.

925
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,632
Like we were all
in it together.

926
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,005
Do you remember where
you bought him from?

927
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,408
From the paper.

928
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,640
Damn thing cost me 50 bucks,
back when that was real money.

929
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,713
You recall when that was?

930
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,843
Let me see.

931
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:42,219
I was just transferred...
must've been early... june 1968.

932
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,656
That's all I know.

933
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,953
Good luck.

934
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,393
Thank you.

935
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,726
Asshole.

936
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,462
"Screaming eagles", huh?

937
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,165
I'm an eagle!

938
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,989
[answering machine]
No one is home.

939
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,822
Please leave a message.

940
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,328
Hi.

941
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,194
I'm not sure if this
is the right number,

942
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,097
but I'm calling about
a parrot you sold.

943
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,966
In the 60's.

944
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:33,235
Anyway, I own it now and...

945
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,242
I'd appreciate it if you
could call me back.

946
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,110
Eh... 555-0115.

947
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,810
My name is Lyman. L-Y-M-A-N.

948
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,146
Thank you.

949
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,650
[chirping]

950
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:59,657
Prepare to meet your maker.

951
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:03,466
[chirping]

952
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,377
DR. REYNOSA: Parrots
thrive on contact,

953
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,745
feather plucking is often
associated with loneliness.

954
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,216
Have you thought about
getting him a mate?

955
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,277
No, this guy's pretty ancient.

956
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,880
Sex would probably pop
his heart like a balloon.

957
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,823
Well I don't know about you,

958
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,351
but I'd say it's a better way to
go than dying bald and alone.

959
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:37,770
Why do you do that?

960
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,773
You didn't look
through the peep hole.

961
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,137
It's none of your business
how I open my door.

962
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,198
It's just not safe, that's all.

963
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,007
Just because I'm not afraid of
my shadow is no reason for...

964
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,070
hey, is everything okay here?

965
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,743
Yeah thanks john,
everything's fine.

966
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,911
What, Sacajawea
break down again?

967
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,249
Cause I can give you a ride...

968
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,448
oh no she's great,

969
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,289
but I would love a ride in
your new car some time.

970
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,625
Yeah, sure thing babe.

971
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,288
I can give you a ride
any time you want.

972
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,856
[alarm beeps]

973
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,729
That's avery unsafe color.

974
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:15,800
You're a very
unacceptable person.

975
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,367
He just got a promotion,
and he bought

976
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,937
a car he's wanted for years.

977
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,745
Did you see that tie, puking out
of the collar of his shirt?

978
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,810
Oh who made you
the fashion police?

979
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,320
I came to apologize.

980
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,651
I should have told
you I was there.

981
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,920
I'd just been given all this
homework I'd missed and...

982
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,483
I brought a present.

983
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,052
I hate all that flowers
of forgiveness crap.

984
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,031
It's for your dog.

985
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:44,162
It's got... it's got these
reflective stu ds on it.

986
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,867
Just like you.

987
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,139
His name is Floyd, and just
because he accepts your gift,

988
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,271
doesn't mean that I forgive you.

989
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,282
In that case, would
you go out with me?

990
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,116
How about you?

991
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,621
I can't.

992
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,157
Remember?

993
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,658
Our schedules are so opposite.

994
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,193
It would either have
to be early in the morning,

995
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,489
or really late at night.

996
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,893
Then come to work with me.

997
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,363
Tonight?

998
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,832
I'll pick you up.

999
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,893
But Floyd can't come.

1000
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,235
He sleeps a lot anyway.

1001
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,739
Are you serious?

1002
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,332
I can come?

1003
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,673
God, that is so cool!

1004
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,976
Floyd, get your butt in here.

1005
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,485
[clears throat]

1006
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,087
Change into this,

1007
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:46,690
I'll be back at 9.

1008
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:50,329
Roger that.

1009
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,100
And don't bend the
visor on the cap,

1010
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,607
I like it the way it is.

1011
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,081
Howdy.

1012
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,921
Deputy courtesy patrol officer
James reporting for duty.

1013
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,027
Do I have to wear
this sleeping bag?

1014
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,896
It is so not my color.

1015
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,335
Ok.

1016
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,236
From now on, you do exactly
what I tell you,

1017
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,399
or the free ride is over.

1018
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,237
- Got it?
- Got it.

1019
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,039
You don't get out of the truck,
roll down the window,

1020
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,373
or touch anything unless I say?

1021
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:32,845
Sir yes, sir.

1022
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,245
And if I tell you
to do something,

1023
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:35,442
you do it immediately.

1024
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,882
You don't ask why.

1025
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,180
You just do it.

1026
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,010
It's for your own safety.

1027
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,311
It's for your own safety.

1028
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,911
Understood?

1029
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,251
Understood.

1030
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,916
Ok.

1031
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,824
Now scoot across the
seat and kiss me.

1032
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,738
[knock on window]

1033
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:02,333
Oh, my god, it's you again.

1034
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,810
Sorry.

1035
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,505
It might help if you
turned off your light bar

1036
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,039
while you make out.

1037
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:14,919
[laughing]

1038
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,091
You're supposed to wear
clothes under the jumpsuit.

1039
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,184
I've got clothes on.

1040
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,320
What clothes?

1041
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,659
My underwear.

1042
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,256
What kind of underwear?

1043
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,130
Just wondering...

1044
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,796
well continue wondering.

1045
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,133
Did you know you have more
college credits than I do?

1046
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,769
I looked you up.

1047
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,507
You've taken every
utilitarian course

1048
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,674
offered over the
past ten years.

1049
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,481
Every fix-it, lifesaving,
plumbing, woodworking,

1050
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:49,353
italian, chinese,
self-defense,

1051
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,323
and yet no degree?

1052
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,793
I take courses to learn stuff.

1053
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,557
Well if you'd taken some
literature or philosophy

1054
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,723
courses, you'd understand
the parrot.

1055
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,858
I don't need a formal education
to understand the obvious.

1056
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,230
Oh, really?

1057
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,166
Tell me what's so obvious...

1058
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:03,431
"shut up."

1059
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,437
No, you shut up!

1060
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,737
No, "shut up."

1061
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,799
It's the first thing the
bird said, which means

1062
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:13,177
en and stop talking long
enough to understand the rest.

1063
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,910
[car screeching]

1064
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:23,022
You okay?

1065
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,230
You've gotta be careful,

1066
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,928
that truck must have been
going at least ninety.

1067
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,634
Okay, "stay tuned"...
be alert in case of danger.

1068
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,109
Ak for yourself...
make up your own mind.

1069
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,440
Be an independent thinker.

1070
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,138
Next,

1071
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,806
I'm an eagle.

1072
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,282
That just feel good to say it.

1073
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,285
I'm an eagle.

1074
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,548
Yeah, feels good.

1075
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,251
I like to say "I'm a
Tyrannosaurus Rex."

1076
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,990
come on, try it with me.

1077
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,531
Uh-oh, work.

1078
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,899
Stay here.

1079
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,100
What seems to be the problem?

1080
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:19,738
[speaking spanish]

1081
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,271
I couldn't fix
my car if I had to.

1082
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,974
The internal combustion engine
is all cause and effect.

1083
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,812
Anyone can understand
it, then fix it.

1084
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:58,875
As opposed to people?

1085
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,921
Well, they're
not so easy to fix.

1086
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,979
What is that supposed to mean?

1087
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:10,588
Relationships... they don't last,
they all break in the end.

1088
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:12,394
That's fairly pessimistic.

1089
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,196
I'm being honest.

1090
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:18,000
Take you, for instance.

1091
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,007
You've lived in what, a half a
dozen cities since you left

1092
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:26,069
school, with a whole string
of temporary friendships.

1093
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,376
Then you move on.

1094
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:31,577
I have friends and family
all over the country.

1095
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,587
What about you?

1096
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,953
Have you ever crossed
the state line?

1097
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:40,859
It's not like I've
got family to visit.

1098
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:45,991
Ok. I was engaged once,
but he wouldn't set a date.

1099
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,366
Then I found out he
was already married.

1100
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:53,305
No one else ever came close.

1101
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:59,176
Maybe they don't all last
Lyman, but like they say,

1102
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,773
doesn't mean the fall
wasn't worth the ride.

1103
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:14,493
You know, you could pick
your own first name.

1104
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,963
I never found a name
that seemed right.

1105
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,024
I guess my mom wasn't one for
sewing on name-tags.

1106
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,696
But what about your birthday?

1107
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,534
When do you have your party?

1108
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:29,236
It's not important.

1109
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,746
FIONA: take this exit.

1110
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,374
Make a right.

1111
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:41,081
I want to show you something.

1112
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:46,889
Your parents checked in here.
No previous address.

1113
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:52,797
And then in a moment, they were
taken, and you continued.

1114
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,267
After the accident, they
couldn't be traced.

1115
01:04:55,324 --> 01:05:00,672
No next-of-kin, and you
couldn't remember anything.

1116
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,176
Missing persons
turned up nothing.

1117
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,940
I chased every lead,
blood types,

1118
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:10,144
car registration,
every receipt.

1119
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,981
I just kept thinking that there
must have been somebody

1120
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,318
out there who would
have missed them.

1121
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,752
Code of the west, rule number
one, "don't inquire into a man's"

1122
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,493
"past." don't you read those
books you pass around?

1123
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,229
Rule number two,

1124
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:34,469
"take the measure of a man
for what he is today."

1125
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,501
you're right. I'm sorry.

1126
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,208
Do you hate my guts now?

1127
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:47,220
Yeah I do hate your guts, but I
sure like the bag they come in.

1128
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:53,289
Come on, lets eat.

1129
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,123
I understand about Ma 17

1130
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,827
and some of the rest, but then
there is the bible stuff.

1131
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,198
The "prepare to meet
your maker",

1132
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,703
you never know when
your number is up.

1133
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,329
Don't have regrets.

1134
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:06,998
The ecclesiastes
thing makes sense...

1135
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,373
yep, eat drink and be merry.

1136
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,877
I'm all for that.

1137
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,571
It's very optimistic.

1138
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,410
It is not.

1139
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,780
I'm prepared, and you just
keep your fingers crossed.

1140
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,080
You think the parrot
makes sense,

1141
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,849
but there are some things you
are never going to learn.

1142
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,754
You don't understand life
like I don't understand

1143
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,952
how to fix a car.

1144
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,154
It's all just one big
tangle under the hood.

1145
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,855
I think some women
believe that a man is born

1146
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,626
the moment they meet him.

1147
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:35,362
Now what'll you you have?

1148
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,937
Why thank you, Lyman.

1149
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,910
"T builder of men."

1150
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:48,415
well, I do my best.

1151
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,851
Margie, this is Fiona.

1152
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,114
I heard about you.

1153
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,884
Is my Lyman sweet
on you, honey?

1154
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,051
I think it's the
way that I dress.

1155
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,561
Thank you Lyman,
for bringing her by.

1156
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,893
I approve.

1157
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,955
MARGIE VO: They were
talking so hard,

1158
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,626
like there was a
fire somewhere and

1159
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,863
only their words
could put it out.

1160
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,269
I could tell just by the sound,

1161
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:17,505
seemed like Lyman was finally
getting closer to an answer.

1162
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,409
I left them alone.

1163
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:23,348
I decided dinner
was on me that night.

1164
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,419
How many campbells
have you called?

1165
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,086
I'm still trying.
I have dozens left.

1166
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,720
Some of these people just talk
and talk and talk, and

1167
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,323
I can't get them off the phone.

1168
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,868
What?

1169
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,495
Cheese stuck on your teeth.

1170
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:53,706
Toast crumbs at the
corners of your mouth.

1171
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:57,546
Butter on your lips.

1172
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,782
Want to go fishing?

1173
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:06,019
Oh Lyman, you say
the sweetest things.

1174
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,463
It takes a few seconds to reach
bottom, but it comes up quick.

1175
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:21,468
I've found hubcaps, cans, tools.

1176
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:24,739
Once I found a set of
braces, with a tooth in it.

1177
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,145
Wow Lyman, that's the mother
load. Now we can retire,

1178
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:33,313
and live happily ever after.

1179
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,015
Maybe one day I'll solve
a great mystery.

1180
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,058
The crime of the century.

1181
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,425
Until then I just
fish for clues.

1182
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,424
Fiona?

1183
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,943
Happy birthday... Mr. Lyman.

1184
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,241
What?

1185
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:05,718
I couldn't bear the thought of
you never having birthdays.

1186
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,584
But I don't know
what the date is.

1187
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,146
So I figured someone
better pick a date,

1188
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,919
and I say it's today.

1189
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,291
Unless you can prove me wrong.

1190
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,762
I declare this the
thirty something

1191
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,323
birthday of baby boy Lyman.

1192
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,699
It's around now that
you blow out the candle

1193
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:29,266
before I'm horribly
disfigured by molten wax?

1194
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:37,047
There. You're no longer a
birthday cake virgin.

1195
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,105
If you're looking for
something french and lacy,

1196
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,978
you uh... you
got the wrong girl.

1197
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,847
I uh... I don't think
I'll be talking anymore

1198
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,408
from here on out.

1199
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,393
[d...]

1200
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,618
You're perfect...

1201
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,783
Sshhhhhh...

1202
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,226
[car screeching]

1203
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,027
[dog squealing]

1204
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,968
What was that?

1205
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:06,063
They hit a goddamn dog.

1206
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,703
Stay here.

1207
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,304
[whimpering]

1208
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,085
Is it going to be okay?

1209
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,219
Lyman?

1210
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,696
What are you doing?

1211
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,063
Oh god, please no.

1212
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,601
Just stay in the truck, Fiona!

1213
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,536
Lyman, we can take
it to the vet.

1214
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,632
Lyman, please listen to me!

1215
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,644
Lyman, please!

1216
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,010
Lyman, no!

1217
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,606
[gunshot]

1218
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:54,382
[crying]

1219
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,730
Fiona, there was no saving it.

1220
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:52,174
How can you bear to do this?

1221
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:59,582
I've never had to
share it with anyone.

1222
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:05,756
I don't want to share that.

1223
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,926
[chirping]

1224
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,402
Give some to the parrot.

1225
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,506
Just you and me now, buddy.

1226
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:07,281
From now on,
thou shalt be called...

1227
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:10,221
"zane".

1228
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,351
[chirping]

1229
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:20,166
[phone ringing]

1230
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,701
Hello?

1231
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,100
MRS. WEBER: Hello?

1232
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,136
Can I speak to Mr.
Lyman please?

1233
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,365
Speaking.

1234
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,804
This is mrs. Weber.

1235
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:29,741
I'm returning your
call about the parrot.

1236
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,278
Come on in,

1237
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,608
one more won't make
a difference.

1238
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,876
WEBER: Jesus Christ,
it's him.

1239
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,918
I don't believe it,
he's still alive.

1240
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,350
Yep.

1241
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,319
That awful bird.

1242
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,255
Mr. Lyman, this is
my husband duncan.

1243
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,315
[chirping]

1244
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,383
Oh, he's a sight for sore eyes.

1245
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,863
Kids, this is old tonto.

1246
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,901
My dear friend from back
in the olden days

1247
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,459
when I was your age, henry.

1248
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,527
BILLIE: I'm Billie.

1249
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,096
Dad always talked about his
parrot like he was human.

1250
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,436
SUSIE: Sue.

1251
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,908
We didn't know what to believe.

1252
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,070
Tonto was my best friend.

1253
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:11,880
We used to listen to the lone
ranger on the radio every week.

1254
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,080
He could mimic all
of the theme music.

01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:20,889
[sings theme]

1256
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,922
Does he still say
<i>"Hi-ho silver away?"</i>

1257
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,728
Does he still say
<i>"Hi-ho silver away?"</i>

1258
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,160
No.

1259
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,167
Oh.

1260
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,396
I thought he was the smartest,
funniest thing in the world.

1261
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:33,463
That was before
he met me, of course.

1262
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,372
I was an only child.

1263
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,569
This bird got me a lot of
friends at school.

1264
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:41,240
He could do tricks, he was
like a one man circus.

1265
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:45,479
Why did you sell
him, Mr. Weber?

1266
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,488
Because I didn't want
him around the children.

1267
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,616
I thought they
carried diseases.

1268
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,717
That's not why you
wanted him out, ella.

1269
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,854
It was the green-eyed
monster, jealousy.

1270
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,921
She loves me more
than life itself.

1271
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,126
She couldn't bare to
share me with anyone.

1272
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:04,102
Well if you can find anyone
who'll take you now,

1273
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,469
they're welcome to you.

1274
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,474
He must have been pretty
rare back then,

1275
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,567
did he come from a pet store?

1276
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,169
Oh no, from a
neighbor, mrs. Hall.

1277
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,580
She had a son michael, back
then we called retarded.

1278
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,379
Dad I told you,
you can't say that.

1279
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,081
...challenged,
yes. Challenged.

1280
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:27,457
The kid learned to
speak by mimicking the bird.

1281
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,120
Do you know where
the halls got him?

1282
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,754
Oh sorry no,

1283
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,799
I never asked, and
they're long dead now.

Ma 17!

1288
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,671
It must have been hard
giving him up, Mr. Weber.

1289
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:46,680
Yeah, but look what I got in
exchange. A world of family.

1290
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:50,547
The bird got me
through my childhood,

1291
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,110
ella got me through
the rest of it.

1292
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,281
Thanks for bringing
him by, son.

1293
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,089

RADIO: 190, roger.

1308
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,511
Why'd he want you
to shoot his car?

1309
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:35,248
He was tired of it.

1310
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,723
Gee, I'm tired of my boss...

1311
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,961
why do you work
the night shift?

1312
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,693
Because my husband does too.

1313
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:51,670
It's the only way we can be
together, have a life.

1314
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,833
Aren't the people who
are out at night strange?

1315
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,671
Don't you get tired of it?

1316
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,541
I like my job.

1317
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,443
I like the people
who come in at night.

1318
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:03,278
My regulars.

1319
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:09,211

the courtesy patrol?

1320
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,348
12 years.

1321
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,450
You've been at it for so long.

1322
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,495
Cars don't break down as often,

1323
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:21,831
but, people need
me as much as ever.

1324
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:25,497
I don't know, 1t just doesn't
seem to mean much anymore.

1325
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,030
You'll find it again,
like your parrot.

1326
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:35,243
Being lost is only temporary.

1327
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:56,334
Hi.

1328
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:57,734
Well Floyd can come in too.

1329
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,034
He's fine where he is.

1330
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,097
This is for you.

1331
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:07,614
And I need the library
books, they're overdue.

1332
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,837
Sorry, I forgot.

1333
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,342
Sorry, I forgot.

1334
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,883
I'll pay the fines.

01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:16,582

1336
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,182
I call him zane now.

1337
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,090
I named him.

1338
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,651
That's good, Lyman.

1339
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,219
I'm happy for you.

1340
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,129
Well I called you,

1341
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,065
your number was disconnected
and I came by...

1342
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:32,936
yeah, I've been really busy,
getting ready to leave.

1343
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,406
I found another
library that needs me.

1344
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,374
So...

1345
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,844
you're leaving?

1346
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,711
I thought I'd spend some
time with my family.

1347
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:48,849
Fiona, you know there
wasn't anything else

1348
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,117
I could do for that dog.

1349
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,522
She was suffering...

1350
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,393
I know that, Lyman.

1351
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,260
I know that.

1352
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,062
It was all just a bit
too stark for me.

1353
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:06,162
I felt like that dog was a
part of me or something.

1354
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,469
But I can't think
of you out there,

1355
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,975
every night with all of that...

1356
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,635
so umm...

1357
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,509
I have something for you.

1358
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:17,641
A going away present.

1359
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:22,451
Ivy campbell, daughter of jack
campbell from the 1930 census.

1360
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:26,856
There's no phone number
but there's an address.

1361
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,553
If you'd just stay we...

1362
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:32,258
I've never been able to stay.

1363
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:39,328
Maybe I don't want to
believe what you believe.

1364
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,967
Maybe I don't want to
know what you know.

1365
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:50,910
I have to leave.

1366
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,851
I knew you couldn't take it.

1367
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,020
So you were trying
to sabotage us?

1368
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,585
Is that why you let
me go with you?

1369
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,861
Oh, I'm not the one
running away.

1370
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,027
You'll never get anywhere
in this piece of tin.

1371
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,536
You've got romance novels
for auto sense.

1372
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,573
Your right back-up light is out,

1373
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,507
your tire treads are shot, you
need an engine overhaul.

1374
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,443
God only knows what condition
your brakes are in.

1375
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,208
If you head out onto the highway
without knowing where the jack

1376
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,545
is, you'll end up stranded in
the middle of the desert

1377
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,346
or on top of some mountain or...

1378
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:33,407
yes Lyman, but people like you,
and they are few and far

1379
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:38,291
between, they always
seem to show up.

1380
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,999
Good-bye.

1381
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,478
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to drop by like this.

1382
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:29,003
Does ivy campbell live here?

1383
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,111
IVY: I don't want
any insurance.

1384
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,915
I'm going to die
whether I've got it or not.

1385
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,614
I'm here about this parrot.

1386
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:40,251
I believe your
father owned him?

1387
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,955
Mr. Roosevelt?

1388
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,157
But how could that be?

1389
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:49,430
I gave him away in the 50's to a
woman named emma cowen.

1390
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:53,496
She'd lost a baby, so I
gave her Mr. Roosevelt

1391
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,768
to keep her spirits up.

1392
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,310
She had him until
she had her next child,

1393
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:01,438
then she gave him
to a slow fella.

1394
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:03,312
Mike hall.

1395
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,874
Yes.

1396
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,817
And I lost track from there.

1397
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,355
He still says your phone
number from when you

1398
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,788
lived on summit drive.

1399
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,552
Ma17?

1400
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:14,753
That was our phone number?

1401
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:17,558
He's got a better
memory than I do.

1402
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,962
Who's bird was he?

1403
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,727
My father's.

1404
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:23,963
He was killed in the war.

1405
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:25,834
Was he a religious man?

1406
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,340
I don't think so.

1407
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:31,775
Mother gave him a
bible before he left.

1408
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:35,110
Father said he might not read
it, but he would keep it in his

1409
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:40,279
breast pocket to protect him
from a well-aimed bullet.

1410
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:43,117
What he worshipped
was this country.

1411
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,782
Then who taught him
the bible verse...

1412
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:47,759
'a bird of the air
shall carry the word?'

1413
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:50,057
why, he came to us saying that.

1414
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,995
Do you know where
your father got him?

1415
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,159
Mother said that he
bought Mr. Roosevelt

1416
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:59,137
from a band of gypsies that
were passing through.

1417
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:07,135
What does it
matter Mr. Lyman?

1418
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:12,709
I've gone as far as I can go.

1419
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:16,847
I don't know where to go next.

1420
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:22,327
You go forward, Mr. Lyman.

1421
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:26,490
Forward.

1422
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:36,633
We met at the beginning and
the end of long lives.

1423
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,700
Goodbye Mr. Roosevelt.

1424
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:42,475
Ooh...

1425
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,174
I woke up and the
heat had gone down.

1426
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,679
I forgot to refill
the propane tank.

1427
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,578
It's all my fault.

1428
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:16,980
He's a tropical bird.

1429
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:19,040
He couldn't stand the freeze.

1430
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:21,610
Just be prepared, Lyman.

1431
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,121
He's an old bird.

1432
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,521
This might be his time.

1433
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:28,391
[phone ringing]

1434
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:31,453
Hello?

1435
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,089
TOM ON RADIO: Lyman, I know
you're taking some time off,

1436
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,599
but there's been a black ice
pile-up on the

1437
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,135
west street bridge.

1438
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,468
Fiona was one of
the people involved.

1439
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:40,665
[horn blaring]

1440
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,036
Move!

1441
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,202
Get out of the way!

1442
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,949
No! Floyd!

1443
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,386
No Floyd!

1444
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,321
Floyd!

1445
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:34,360
Nooo!

1446
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:04,352
DR. DOUGHERTY:
And next of kin?

1447
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,653
No.

1448
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,785
None.

1449
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:12,627
I need your accident report.

1450
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:23,271
Hi daddy.

1451
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:30,146
It sucks.

1452
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:33,742
Mom, I need to come home again.

1453
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:47,325
Right there.

1454
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:50,801
And I thought he
couldn't stand Floyd.

1455
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:52,860
No, he just couldn't let
himself get too close

1456
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:57,137
to a live dog, that's all.

1457
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,008
Stay tuned!

1458
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:01,570
You are one lucky parrot.

1459
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,936
[chirping]

1460
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:32,065
Tornado!

1461
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:32,771
Tornado!

1462
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,643
Tornado!

1463
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:38,343
[grunting]

1464
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,825
What?

1465
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,803
Zane?

1466
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:11,406
FIONA VO: Lyman, I'm
taking you with me.

1467
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,850
I want to give you my family.

1468
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,115
You can't work a while
anyway and I have a few weeks

1469
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:18,248
until my next job,

1470
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,849
so I thought we could
look out for each other.

1471
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,453
And you can finally see some
of the rest of the planet.

1472
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:27,500
You were out cold for a week.

1473
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,729
Then you started telling
me about gypsies.

1474
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,671
Me and half the hospital staff.

1475
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:38,370
They finally let me
take you this morning.

1476
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,004
I'll stop, if you
want to turn around.

1477
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:43,412
Call me on channel 9.

1478
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,554
In this state, it is
against the law

1479
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:56,493
to haul a trailer with
someone in it.

1480
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:08,399
Unless, you've got a
special license.

1481
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,465
Frank and Neil and Tom helped,

1482
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:14,980
and don't worry,
it all passed inspection.

1483
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,745
Why didn't you ask me?

1484
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,846
Well you've been
on pain killers.

1485
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:27,825
Plus I didn't trust
you to make the break.

1486
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:33,127
You're unreliable when it
comes to your own interests.

1487
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,133
I still get confused.

1488
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:38,068
Tell me again...

1489
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:42,335
oh well, when you threw
him to me I caught him,

1490
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:46,310
but then I stuck my
finger in his eye.

1491
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:48,973
He'll get better too.

1492
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,915
Fiona, I've never
been outside the county line.

1493
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:53,975
Not in my whole life.

1494
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,578
Just wait till you see
the atlantic ocean.

1495
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:57,987
Fiona...

1496
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:00,218
and you know what else?

1497
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:04,127
I got a tool belt to snap onto
your wheelchair, just in case.

1498
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,359
We're prepared.

1499
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:10,265
What the heck...

1500
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,804
let's go.

1501
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,433
Surprise me.

1502
