1
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,649
Come on. Let's go.

2
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,621
Wait a minute!
You can't just return them.

3
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,295
They said I wasn't a good fit.

4
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,917
There'll be another family, Michelle.

5
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,012
Oh, come on! Wait a minute!

6
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,641
What's the matter with me?

7
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,435
Not a thing, Michelle.

8
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,694
God's children are all perfect.

9
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,149
In their own way.

10
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,081
Fuck you!

11
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,754
Never lose hope, Michelle.

12
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,545
There's a family out there for everyone.

13
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,836
Come on, Agnes. Families are for suckers.

14
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,838
Don't worry about me. I don't need anybody.

15
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,721
I'm going straight to the top.

16
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,720
Michelle. Michelle?

17
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,432
Michelle! Michelle!

18
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,644
- Michelle!
- Michelle?

19
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,483
She's the CEO
of three Fortune 500 companies

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,060
and the best-selling financial author
of Money Talks, Bullshit Walks.

21
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,228
The one, the only, Michelle Darnell!

22
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,699
Who wants to make some money?

23
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,741
I can't hear you, Chicago!

24
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,964
Get those hands up!

25
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,473
Come on! There we go!

26
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,549
MD going in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,636
And I won't stop now

28
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,812
Keep your hands up, put 'em in the sky

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,810
For the homies didn't make it
and my folks locked down

30
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,602
I never went nowhere

31
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,686
They're saying 'Chelle's back
Blame it on the conjure

32
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,322
They call it M.D.-ac

33
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,069
Can't never count me out

34
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,439
Y'all better count me in

35
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,647
Got twenty bank accounts
Accountants count me in

36
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,278
Make millions every year

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,953
The Chi's champion

38
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,993
'Cause all I do is...

39
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,084
Give it up for T-Pain!

40
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,621
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind

41
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,117
I can never get enough

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,248
And every time I step up in the building

43
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,305
Everybody hands go up

44
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,845
And they stay there

45
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,724
And they say yeah

46
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,091
And they stay there

47
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,346
Up down, up down, up down

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,390
'Cause all I do is win, win, win

49
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,404
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make them stay there

50
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
Thank you, Chicago!

51
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,624
Thank you. All right.

52
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,753
I love you!

53
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,539
Thank you. I love you, too.

54
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,293
My name is Michelle Darnell

55
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,383
and I am the 47th
wealthiest woman in America.

56
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,135
How wealthy am I?

57
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,593
I had Destiny's Child reunite

58
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,684
only to have them come over
to my personal living room

59
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,854
so I could watch them break apart again.

60
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,016
Huh?

61
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,525
How did I get to my success level?
What's my secret?

62
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,769
I worked myself silly.

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,360
Okay, number one.

64
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,703
You work your ass off to get what you want.

65
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:43,237
Number two.
You do not let other people drag you down.

66
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,705
'Cause they will.

67
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:51,205
They are an anchor in your life
that you do not want.

68
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,380
Cut 'em loose and sail off.

69
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,251
If you work this program...

70
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,378
You. Will. Get. Rich.

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,220
And I'm not talking about chump change.

72
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,224
And I'm not talking about some
loose dollar bills at the bottom of your purse.

73
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,138
I'm talking about real fucking money!

74
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,478
Life-changing money!

75
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,937
Real fucking money! Real fucking money!

76
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,396
That's how you do it.

77
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,527
Now let's go make some money!

78
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,356
Thank you, Tito. What a night!

79
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,611
That's right, MD.

80
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,743
Yeah.

81
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,450
I'm amazed that the United Center
is even still standing

82
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,071
because I crushed it tonight.

83
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,486
You crushed it like velvet.

84
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,446
Like velvet!
Send T-Pain some "thank you" flowers.

85
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,537
- Okay?
- Okay.

86
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,792
Look into getting more fire power to that bird.

87
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,504
Absolutely. More power.

88
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,794
No. The fire marshal almost shut us down

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,500
based on the pyrotechnics we used tonight.

90
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,628
I don't think that's an option.

91
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,724
Let's hire a new fire marshal.

92
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,089
I don't think you can
hire a fire marshal.

93
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,007
I think it's a city-appointed position,

94
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,135
but I'll look into it.

95
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,144
All she does is win, Claire. Toot-toot!

96
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,943
I got this, Tito.
Okay? You can sit this one out.

97
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,145
Claire?

98
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,898
Oh, teeth whitening. Sorry. Sorry, yes.

99
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,361
- My God.
- Sorry.

100
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,702
- Hmm.
- I have to remind you. That seems...

101
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,914
That seems like a little the opposite, right?

102
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,990
Yeah.

103
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay. Yeah, I think if you keep your...

104
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,412
You need to keep your tongue
inside your mouth for this to work.

105
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,247
Last week you very
specifically said, "Keep tongue out."

106
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,004
- No.
- You did say that, Claire.

107
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,134
I said, "Get your tongue out of the picture."

108
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,591
She's got to breathe, Claire.

109
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,473
Somebody must be hungry.

110
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,338
Somebody gets very crabby
when she's hungry.

111
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,178
You're a little hangry, Claire.

112
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,683
I'm not hangry, Tito.

113
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,136
Hungry and angry. You hangry, Claire.

114
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,733
Sixty seconds of no talking.

115
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,190
'Cause this has to set for 60 seconds.

116
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,691
I've been waiting. I mean, I'm in here.

117
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,269
You're the only one that's talking, Claire.

118
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,686
You're the only one talking. It's hilarious.

119
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,863
It's like that classic comedy gag,
"He's on my baseball."

120
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,195
Who's on my baseball?

121
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,623
Who's on my baseball?

122
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,913
Uh, who's on my baseball?

123
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,249
- Oh, no it's...
- Who's on my baseball?

124
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,999
I think it's, "Who's on first.
What's on second? I Don't Know is on third."

125
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,041
Right?

126
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,377
- I don't think that's...
- Uh, no.

127
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,376
I think you're on my baseball.

128
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,134
- Who's on my baseball?
- First base.

129
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,891
What's on my baseball?

130
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,260
Baseball

131
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,728
Great. So, since I have you for a second,

132
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,307
you told me to remind you
exactly a year ago today

133
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,066
that it's been three years
since my last pay increase.

134
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,608
I don't think that's true.

135
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,403
That doesn't ring...

136
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,075
Does that seem accurate to you?

137
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,197
That sounds false.

138
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,584
But you crushed it tonight!

139
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,288
It's not false, Tito.
It's entirely accurate.

140
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,620
And I wrote down what you said.

141
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,496
Oh, Claire,
I don't know why you always have to quote.

142
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,924
"Claire, exactly one year from today

143
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,423
"I'm going to give you a raise so big

144
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,466
"you'll cream your jeans
and shat your chaps."

145
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,390
Claire. That is wildly inappropriate.

146
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,431
- Wildly.
- Lowbrow, Claire.

147
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,933
I run your entire
organization, Michelle.

148
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,234
I do a great job.

149
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,598
I made myself available for you 24 hours a day

150
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,146
while being a single mom, I might add.

151
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,732
I deserve a raise and a title change.

152
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,356
I'd like "Executive Assistant."

153
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,867
Now that surprises me,
'cause I did not know that you had a child.

154
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,286
Was that through...
Was that through intercourse?

155
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,576
Yes.

156
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,950
You know what? Good for you.

157
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,077
Michelle, if you can't give me a raise,

158
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,634
I can't continue to work here.

159
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,554
Well, look who
finally showed up to my seminar.

160
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,886
'Bout time, Claire. I love it.

161
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,799
I didn't know if you were listening
all these years.

162
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,967
What am I always saying?

163
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,257
"Don't go in that room."

164
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,926
True. I do say that. But I also say,

165
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,984
"If you want something, you gotta take it."

166
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,060
Claire, you just took it.

167
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,977
And you grew a pair in the process.

168
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,436
I'm holding your earrings.

169
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,654
You're holding a pair of earrings

170
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,205
that in 2001, I paid $62,000 for.

171
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,621
And that's your raise, now.
That's a good raise.

172
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,790
And you earned it.

173
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,201
Thank you.

174
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,618
Congratulations on your balls, Claire.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,670
Isn't Tito the greatest?

176
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,091
I love Tito.

177
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,588
What are you doing up here?

178
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,341
Miss Darnell, this just came for you.
They said it was urgent.

179
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,183
Oh, it's ringing.

180
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,892
Oh, boy.

181
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,017
Go for Darnell.

182
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,904
I will not be ignored.

183
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,148
Ah.

184
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,529
Hi there, Ronald.

185
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,282
It's "Renault."

186
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,607
Why are you muscling in on my Takoro deal?

187
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,200
You know what? A little birdie told me

188
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,044
that Takoro was merging
with Samson International.

189
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,078
So I acquired the majority of the stock.

190
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,674
That's called insider trading, Michelle.

191
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,538
Which makes you a criminal.

192
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,047
You're going to be sorry
you ever dishonored me.

193
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,717
God, for the last time,
you're not a samurai, Ronald.

194
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,798
It's "Renault"!

195
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,143
No, it's not.
It's "Ron," and you're from Jersey.

196
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,154
Phil. Take off that ridiculous top.

197
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,984
You should never cover that up.

198
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,114
Okay.

199
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,150
Please don't forget
you have an interview first thing Monday.

200
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,325
We'll see.

201
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,075
Let me just... Let me just help you out there.

202
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,253
You'll regret this, Michelle!

203
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,002
Get me the SEC.

204
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,087
Okay.

205
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,427
We are back with
the one and only, Michelle Darnell.

206
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,717
Let's talk about
your relationship with your mentor,

207
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,101
that mega mogul, Ida Marquette.

208
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,391
Well, Gayle, we've got a terrific relationship.

209
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,103
Really? I'm so surprised to hear that,

210
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,523
only because we came across this tape
the other day. Take a look.

211
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,857
- Oh.
- I was Michelle's mentor.

212
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,611
It's so hard to describe her.

213
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,743
She's a business woman,
a visionary, a leader,

214
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,320
a natural born
cocksucker, a motherfucker,

215
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,618
an ass-wipe, a shit stain,

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,460
and sewer rat, fuck-face, professional.

217
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,630
Doesn't sound so chummy.

218
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,630
Oh, I think a couple of those beeps
were actually compliments.

219
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,250
That's one way to look at it.

220
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,957
Michelle, I want to talk about you.

221
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,008
That you were, basically,
abandoned as a child,

222
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,643
bounced around
from foster home to foster home,

223
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,601
and that, really,
you were raised in an orphanage.

224
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,930
No, no, no.

225
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:10,315
I was lucky enough to attend
a beautiful, lovely elite boarding school,

226
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,977
very much like Hogwarts, to give you a visual.

227
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,436
And almost as magical. I feel very lucky.

228
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,990
Where'd you get that?

229
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,665
We've got
a really good research team,

230
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,583
and when I look at that picture,
I don't think "elite."

231
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,333
Can we talk about this for a second?

232
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,631
- This interview is over.
- Where are you going?

233
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,208
I was not trying to upset you, Michelle.

234
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,755
- Why are you leaving?
- You know what, Gayle?

235
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,668
Nobody spells "Gayle" with a "Y."
It's pretentious.

236
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,550
You've got a great story to tell.

237
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:40,975
Keeping the mic!

238
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,507
Gayle King ambushed me.
You get that segment pulled before it airs.

239
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,678
Miss Darnell, you're under arrest

240
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,176
for insider trading and defrauding
the Securities Exchange Commission.

241
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,231
Are you kidding me?

242
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,522
Would I kid you?

243
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,023
- Claire, call my lawyer.
- Okay.

244
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,186
Stay back.

245
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,193
What do you make a year? I'll double it.

246
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,486
Did you just try to bribe me?

247
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,948
No. I mean, unless you're tempted...

248
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,407
Hey! This is...

249
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,741
This is not reasonable. Claire!

250
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,156
- Don't fight it, Michelle!
- Let me go!

251
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,868
Ooh. Don't struggle, baby!

252
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,121
Renault ratted me out!

253
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,168
It's just insider trading! Everybody does it!

254
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,051
You are fighting with the wrong redhead!

255
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,382
Yeah. I'm out.

256
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,965
I'mma get my job back at Best Buy. Boom!

257
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,182
God, you're the worst.

258
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,679
In breaking news...

259
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,225
Michelle Darnell was sentenced
to five months in federal prison

260
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,730
for insider trading.

261
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,900
Currently, Darnell Enterprise stocks...

262
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,231
I told you you'd regret it.

263
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,606
You can really hold onto a grudge.

264
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,404
I can't believe you two used to date.

265
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,735
Ah. It was the Go-Go Nineties.

266
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,032
She was my yin, I was her yang.

267
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,748
Our bodies were intertwined,
but our spirits were in constant opposition.

268
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,909
Dynamic.

269
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,842
I got this promotion locked!

270
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,092
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

271
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,422
Don't worry. Once I become senior VP,

272
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,876
nothing's gonna change between us.

273
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,894
It better not.
You look so fucking rad when you do coke.

274
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,716
Hey, guys! Guys!

275
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,893
What?

276
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,851
They're about to announce
who gets the promotion.

277
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,103
Pretty exciting, huh?

278
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,563
Fuck off, Bryce!

279
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,773
All right, listen up, everybody.

280
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,113
I'd like you all to join me

281
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,610
in offering a hearty congratulations
to our newest senior VP.

282
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,029
Michelle Darnell!

283
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,911
Oh, my...

284
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,579
- What?
- Oh, my God.

285
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,333
I totally...

286
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,754
Fuck off if you think that you can take

287
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,459
my client list and I wasn't gonna notice.

288
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,539
You bitch.

289
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,416
Oh, thank you! That's so supportive, Ron.

290
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,212
I couldn't have done it without you.

291
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,131
Ron! Coffee!

292
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,934
"Ron" is gone.

293
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,387
End of broadcast.

294
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,310
It's bullshit, Marty.

295
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,853
I take one little tip from an insider

296
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,268
and I find myself in an absolute hellhole.

297
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,655
I mean, look at me,
fighting for my life in the yard.

298
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,185
Well, the news gets worse.

299
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,658
- All your accounts have been frozen.
- What?

300
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,988
Your shareholders have all sold off.

301
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,955
Renault is orchestrating a hostile takeover
of your entire holding company.

302
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,955
- No.
- Darnell Enterprises is bankrupt.

303
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,667
- Can he do that?
- Turn off the machine, Don.

304
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,918
No, he cannot.

305
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,671
Yes, he can. He actually did it beautifully.

306
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,839
That's my Adam's apple, you bitch!

307
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,798
Claire, get me a new lawyer.

308
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:30,887
There's not gonna be another lawyer

309
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,103
if you don't have any money,

310
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,482
you stupid ginger!

311
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,978
You know what?
I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.

312
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,520
Not that you're ever gonna find out.

313
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,265
Because you will
never be invited into my basement.

314
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,028
I don't wanna see your basement!

315
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Yes, you do!

316
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,034
And by the way, Claire works for me.

317
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,203
Actually, Michelle,

318
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,198
I can't work for you anymore. I got a new job.

319
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,044
I just came to tell you as a courtesy.

320
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,201
I would think a courtesy would be

321
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,538
you sticking with me
through my tough times, Claire.

322
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,713
I would. You know
I have a kid to think about, so...

323
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,172
You have a kid?

324
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,015
I can't tell if
you're joking because I did tell you

325
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,047
- that I do have a kid. And I...
- I am.

326
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,091
- Remember?
- Yes.

327
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,546
- You do?
- I am. I'm joking. I gotcha.

328
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,886
- Okay.
- Zinger.

329
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,391
Hello, gal.
I wasn't into you but I was flattered.

330
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,560
Okay, here we go.
Tom, do you mind grabbing that bag for me?

331
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,982
Kimberly, I thought you had today off.

332
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,107
Yeah, I knew you were leaving.

333
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,404
You're sweet, Kimberly.

334
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,146
Now, you're gonna remember what I told you?

335
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,238
- Yes.
- Okay?

336
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,701
Stocks are gonna go up and down.

337
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,451
The big money's in the long game.

338
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,914
- Thank you so much, Michelle.
- Thank you, Tom. You're so sweet.

339
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,413
We're actually gonna miss you around here.

340
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,247
Well, I would hope so! It sounds right to me.

341
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,504
All right, give me my freedom.

342
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,433
Yep, the air is sweeter out here.

343
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,637
Did you set up a ride?

344
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,845
No, I was assuming that a town car
or something would be provided.

345
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,557
Lock it up, Danny.

346
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,943
You know,
she thought a town car was coming!

347
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,571
Well, could you call a cab?

348
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,782
I'll get one myself.

349
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,167
Okay, this is
my house right up here. This is good.

350
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,638
Oh, come on!

351
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,598
Hey!

352
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,429
Can you please stop ringing the door?

353
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,228
Hi. Does Claire Rawlings live here?

354
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,363
I don't know.

355
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,071
You don't know
because you're not very bright, or...

356
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,488
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

357
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,605
You know what? Are you Claire's daughter?

358
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,487
I thought you were in jail.

359
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,505
Aren't you charming
for yelling that out on the street like that.

360
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,540
May I?

361
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,713
No way.

362
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,376
Why not?

363
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,379
Because Mom's at work
and you're fresh out of prison.

364
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,049
Okay, white-collar crime doesn't count!

365
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,512
Yes, it does!

366
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,720
No, it does not. It does not.

367
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

368
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,570
Whoa.

369
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,988
Claire. Wow.

370
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,196
Hi, Dana.

371
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,279
My goodness, you are so late.

372
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,367
I am?

373
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,657
You're right. You're absolutely right, Dana.

374
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,456
I'm three minutes late.

375
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,250
Hey, do you work at the excuse factory?

376
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,418
I wasn't making an excuse.
I was just agreeing that I was a little...

377
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,924
Well, I think that you're saying

378
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,094
this is an excuse factory, right?

379
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,592
Hey! Yo, Dana! Hey, hey, hey.

380
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,224
So, hey, I wanted to tell you.

381
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,141
There is a bunch of people
gathered in the break room...

382
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,221
What, why?

383
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,024
...just raving about
your fourth-quarter review.

384
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,309
Who is? What?

385
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,770
That's why I was late.

386
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,610
Because we were all up there, you know,
trading our favorite Dana stories.

387
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,479
So it was... It's positive...

388
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,936
It's good buzz?
There's a lot of good buzz?

389
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,775
Buzzworthy. Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, they're raving.

390
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,949
- I have to go get coffee.
- Yeah, you do.

391
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,106
She's a nightmare. She's a tool.

392
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,618
She's so many things.

393
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,618
She is definitely a lot of things.

394
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,912
Uh...

395
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,578
Look at this, look at this!
We have so much in common, me and you.

396
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,962
We have a good banter here, right?

397
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
A little back and forth.

398
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,585
I think maybe we should

399
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,536
try and keep this
little banter wagon going, right?

400
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,798
Maybe we can go hang out...

401
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,338
We can dish about the boss,
and gossip about stuff and...

402
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,764
You know, probably do it
over dinner or something,

403
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,802
'cause all that dishing can be exhausting.

404
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,348
Work up an appetite.

405
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,311
Yeah, well, I'm... First of all, I'm flattered.

406
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,976
It's a little complicated for me.

407
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,060
I'm a single mom and I really try to, you know,

408
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,147
devote a ton of energy to my kid,

409
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,321
and see her as much as possible.

410
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I just don't think that it's a good time.

411
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,026
Yeah, cool.

412
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,663
I was hoping you would say that

413
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,828
because I love rejection, so...

414
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,412
- Cool.
- Cool.

415
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,543
Sorry.

416
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,681
Michelle.

417
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,597
Michelle.

418
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,229
- Hello.
- Hi!

419
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,016
Hi. Hello, Claire.

420
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,531
Surprise!

421
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,189
What are you doing here?

422
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,321
Oh, well, I had stopped at our old office

423
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,034
and the security gentlemen did mention

424
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,366
that you were now the curator of my estate.

425
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,003
So, I just thought I should pop over

426
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,830
and maybe pick up my things.

427
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,749
Okay, I guess you wanna come up and grab it.

428
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,878
- Yes, absolutely.
- Do you need...

429
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,879
If you'd like, you can grab that trunk.

430
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:41,968
Oh, no.

431
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,268
Well, this is just...

432
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,519
This is...

433
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,771
This can't be all of it.

434
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,686
I mean, this isn't all of it. This is...

435
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,073
Where are my things?

436
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:02,319
My paintings, or, I mean,
my Degas, my rugs, my...

437
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,583
- Where are my things?
- I'm really sorry, Michelle.

438
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,367
They seized everything.

439
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,701
This is what's left.

440
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,925
Martha Stewart got everything back.

441
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,588
I mean, they rallied around her.
They loved her more.

442
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,427
Well, Michelle,
know that Rachel and I are rooting for you,

443
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,564
and, if you need us, you can always call

444
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,734
or send a letter here, or just a quick text.

445
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,774
Um, do you want me
to help you out with this?

446
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,149
If she doesn't have anywhere to go,
she should stay here.

447
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,775
Honey, she knows plenty of people.
She has plenty of places to stay.

448
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,493
Tito won't return any of my calls.

449
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,454
My sweet Tito.

450
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,909
Fucking Tito.

451
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,617
Mom, we can't let her sleep on the street.

452
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,918
Do you really not have anywhere to go?

453
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,999
No. I don't.

454
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,957
Okay, you can stay here.

455
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,800
But for a very limited amount of time. Okay?

456
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,302
- Yes.
- Just until you get back on your feet.

457
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,385
- All right?
- Yes.

458
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,890
It's a small space. You know.

459
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,891
It's tight sometimes for Rachel and I, so...

460
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,893
It is really small, it's like...
It's freaky small.

461
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,186
Well, but you're welcome, here.

462
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,980
If you need to crash, you can have the couch.

463
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,985
- Yes. We'll draw straws.
- Okay.

464
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,147
It'll be a fun kind of roommate...

465
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,276
It's not a negotiation.

466
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,493
...stuff. Okay.

467
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,406
Ha.

468
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,788
A bed inside a sofa. That's neat.

469
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,327
Well, it's old, but it's comfortable, so...

470
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,117
Thank you, Claire.

471
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,712
Good night, Michelle.

472
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,795
It's...

473
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,683
Well...

474
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,178
This isn't so...

475
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,104
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

476
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,227
Claire!

477
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,031
I think I've shattered my pelvis.

478
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,673
Oh, Michelle! Oh, my God.

479
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:19,789
Claire!

480
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:22,667
Michelle, why are you in my bed?

481
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,883
Because your sofa threw me against a wall,

482
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,177
and I've had a cellie for the last six months.

483
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,047
I find it very difficult to sleep on my own.

484
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,392
Wow. Okay. You're kicking up a lot of...

485
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,061
Is that from... Is that me?

486
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,141
I think...

487
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,805
Yeah, that's me.

488
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,404
You know what? I got into

489
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,148
a wee bit of your Scotch last night.

490
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,230
And, you know what else I tried

491
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,397
that I thought was terrific, was a Dorito.

492
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,028
I think it was the cheese.

493
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,659
I mean not a cheese found in nature,
but cheese-adjacent.

494
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,240
I just thought it was wonderful.

495
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,704
What a wonderful chip.

496
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,910
Michelle, you can't sleep in my bed.
I don't want you in here.

497
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,458
You gotta get it together, Michelle.

498
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,251
I am together, okay?

499
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:04,135
This morning, I'm meeting
with a bunch of old colleagues.

500
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:07,303
I'm gonna pour this into something
creamy and delicious,

501
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,052
and see who takes a big sip.

502
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,472
Get out, out of my bed.

503
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,892
God. I see why this half of the bed
maybe is empty.

504
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,732
Okay? You're a real
B-I-T-C-U-N-T in the morning.

505
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,558
You think about that.

506
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,482
Michelle, you gotta get out of the bathroom.

507
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,605
I'm already late for work
and Rachel's gonna be late for school.

508
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,192
Well, I'm going as fast as I can.

509
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,608
You're welcome to come in.

510
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,737
Fine, but we gotta get on a schedule
if you're gonna be here...

511
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:33,993
Oh, my God!

512
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:35,833
Close your robe.

513
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,083
No, absolutely not!

514
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,212
I'm self-tanning and my legs are still wet.

515
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,384
I can see your vagina.

516
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,999
Well, congratulations and you're welcome!

517
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,457
You know, I had it rejuvenated in 2010.

518
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,418
They call it a vaguvenation!

519
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,637
You know, it's like a soft silk coin purse.

520
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,299
I can barely urinate.

521
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,468
Oh, my God!

522
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:56,636
Now, do me a favor

523
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,983
and tell me if I have
any streaks on my hamstrings.

524
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,187
Oh, God! Put it away!

525
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,524
- Whoa.
- Put it away.

526
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,772
Hi, Raquel!

527
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:04,944
It's Rachel!

528
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,072
Go grab your backpack, honey.

529
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,529
We don't need to brush our teeth today.
Our teeth are fine.

530
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,319
You need to wipe some of that off your face.
You know it dries darker?

531
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,986
- No, does it?
- Yes.

532
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,914
But that's not what the bottle says.

533
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:20,656
Oh, it's okay.
It's coming off like a dream on your towel.

534
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:21,866
You need to clean up the bathroom.

535
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,924
And consider staying away
from self-tanner altogether.

536
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,883
Your pelvic region is the color of curry.

537
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,094
Namaste, Claire. Thank you.

538
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,336
It's not a compliment.

539
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:34,468
Oh.

540
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,394
All right,
here's a little joke for everybody.

541
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,436
What do golfers do on their day off?

542
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,189
Putter around.

543
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:53,607
Tom, I'm gonna crunch
those numbers for you,

544
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,567
but I'm going to
make you pay through the teeth.

545
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,451
Oh.

546
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,744
Bryce Crean!

547
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,867
Oh, my God! How long has it been?

548
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,866
You old son of a bitch!
It has been too long!

549
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,127
Terri. Hello, gentlemen. Hi...

550
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,751
Carl.

551
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,462
Oh. Look at that beard.

552
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,967
How's that old ball-and-chain Pam
treatin' ya?

553
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,719
Pam passed away four months ago.

554
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,894
That's tough. That's tough.

555
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,733
We're kind of in the middle
of something here, Michelle.

556
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,058
So, thank you very much.

557
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,555
Word on the street, Bryce, is that
you're just about to close on that Kraft deal.

558
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,188
So if you want me to head up that division...

559
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:34,244
I think I could be a pretty big asset
to you on that account.

560
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,573
You've got no capital and nobody likes you.

561
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,406
Nobody here at this table likes you.

562
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,083
- Nobody at this entire club likes you.
- That's not true.

563
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,160
Horrible, horrible feedback from everybody.

564
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,748
So, thank you for the groveling. Good bye!

565
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,170
Fuck off, Bryce.

566
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:53,015
Yeah. You know what?

567
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,922
You wouldn't even be here

568
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,218
if I hadn't brought you in
as a junior executive.

569
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,931
And, Terri, you think anybody else
would've hired you right out of college?

570
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:01,852
No! I don't who the fuck you three are.

571
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:02,932
But I'll guess this.

572
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,096
I bet you got here
climbing on my back somehow.

573
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,103
Carl, I gave you that Landis account.

574
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:11,437
I handed you your career
and I'm the one that made Pam a sales rep!

575
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,613
Pam is dead.

576
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,113
Pam was a whore!

577
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,784
She fucked her way
through the whole IT department.

578
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,994
And Terri knows it,
'cause you were in on it, too!

579
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,784
- Yeah!
- The tech guys?

580
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,408
You think Pam did all the tech guys?

581
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,082
The lowest, weirdest, saddest guys!

582
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,464
That's who Pam fucked!

583
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,041
Go to hell, Michelle! Go to hell!

584
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,956
When I get to hell,
I'll tell Pam that you said hello,

585
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,134
'cause she's probably down there
fucking IT guys.

586
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:38,473
Weird little guys,
carrying wires around in weird hats.

587
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,050
That's who she's fucking in hell.

588
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,137
Yeah.

589
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,598
I don't need you.

590
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,309
I don't need you and you're gonna be sorry.

591
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,400
'Cause I got a sweet deal for you
and you're letting it walk out.

592
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,978
You know, you want
to be dumbasses? Be my guest.

593
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,193
I'll tell you what, you're gonna regret this.

594
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,864
Yow!

595
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,703
Yow! Son of a bitch!

596
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,327
- Holy shit!
- Son of a bitch!

597
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,829
How'd she survive that?

598
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,581
'Cause she's horrible.

599
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,752
Let's go.

600
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,330
Mother of shite!

601
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,293
I dinged my pelvis again.

602
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,467
Ah.

603
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,598
- Tell me everything.
- Okay.

604
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,929
So, right off the top,
Bryce ordered a Nicoise salad

605
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,437
but he asked for
the tuna to be really well done.

606
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,860
But if it's a quality piece of tuna,
you don't wanna have it...

607
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,857
- Not relevant.
- Okay, right.

608
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,403
Bryce did everything you asked him to do.

609
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,606
Michelle came in. She was like,

610
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:39,815
"I wanna be in a business."

611
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,493
And he was like, "No dice."

612
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,202
And then, she fell down a flight of stairs.

613
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,333
Did she hurt her wonderful body?

614
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,250
I have a video of it. Do you wanna see?

615
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,541
I'll tell you what.

616
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,129
- Oh, look at her.
- Mmm-hmm.

617
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,091
Oh.

618
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,299
Oh.

619
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,006
So you see the normal intestine.

620
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,518
Now, notice the difference
between that intestine and this intestine.

621
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,728
I'm getting light-headed.
Is there any of that brownie left?

622
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,649
- Yeah.
- I feel like my blood sugar's dropping.

623
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,689
I should probably pop it with a little sugar.

624
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,742
Holy shit! That is a good brownie.

625
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:21,779
Language.

626
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,744
Well, I'm sorry,
you give me a holy-shit brownie.

627
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,992
I'm gonna say, "Holy shit!"

628
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,995
'Cause holy shit, this is a good brownie.

629
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,409
I can't believe...
Your mom makes these, right?

630
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,376
Yeah, it's a family recipe.

631
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,830
Hi!

632
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,508
I'm pretty sure Michelle has diverticulitis.

633
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,920
- What?
- I got it.

634
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,588
I think it's pretty advanced, Claire.

635
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,925
Who said that?

636
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,010
Doctor Oz.

637
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,256
Look.

638
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,559
Oh, my God!

639
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,229
There's my colon again.

640
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,097
Okay, you need to get off the couch

641
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,525
because you've been laying down
for about three weeks.

642
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,066
And, also, you have to
start pulling your weight around here.

643
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,278
We can start tonight.

644
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,438
You can take Rachel
to her Dandelions meeting.

645
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,448
- What?
- Why aren't you taking me?

646
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,530
Sweetie, I can't.

647
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,875
My boss, who is
a massive fan of yours, by the way,

648
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,202
has decided I need
to go back in for the evening.

649
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,288
Okay?

650
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:16,292
Let's go! The most important part of the plan
being "get off the couch."

651
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,459
I don't think I like sassy Claire.

652
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:26,394
All right. I want you to give me
the lowdown on this meeting.

653
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,560
What are my opportunities?
What are my pitfalls?

654
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,929
What do you mean?

655
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,225
Well,
I want to know what I'm walking into.

656
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,352
Oh, everyone's pretty nice.

657
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:40,281
I forgot how many people ride the "L."
It's kind of fascinating.

658
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:44,237
Some people depend on this.
Like, they don't have a car.

659
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,955
Well, I know that.

660
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,326
Roller-skating or roller-blading?

661
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,334
Roller-blading.

662
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,080
Honey or agave nectar?

663
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,833
- Agave.
- No, they're both terrible.

664
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,169
Cell phone, landline?

665
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,419
- What?
- Oh, God.

666
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,588
Do you not know what that means?

667
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,632
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.

668
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,508
Okay, this should be interesting.

669
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:11,225
Ladies, big news. Great news.

670
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:16,225
Marsha Swan's tabby cat, Spaghetti,
is on the mend

671
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,521
and expected to make a full recovery.

672
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,825
Yay, Spaghetti!

673
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,532
Yay!

674
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,776
My daughter, Beth,
was so worried about Spaghetti.

675
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,826
Thank goodness she's back on her feet.

676
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,868
Funny fact about Spaghetti,
she hates spaghetti.

677
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,211
You seem fucking crazy to me.

678
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,290
Excuse me?

679
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:38,964
Cute as a daisy to me.

680
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,003
Okay, now, not to sound too kookie,

681
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,875
but let's talk "cookie" sales, that is.

682
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:52,468
Okay, so this year, we came in with $21,000.

683
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,563
Pretty good job, big bucks.

684
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,400
But Detroit is still in the lead for the year
with $189,000.

685
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,516
Can I just ask you, are these numbers

686
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,319
you're talking about just cookie sales?

687
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,361
And, if so, how many troupes
are we talking about here?

688
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:13,081
There are 3.2 million Dandelions
all over the world

689
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,198
blown across the earth, making a difference.

690
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,406
Is this global?

691
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:21,213
Wait, I recognize you.
You're Michelle Darnell.

692
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,041
Please, don't make a fuss.

693
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,586
Oh, I'm gonna make a fuss.

694
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,470
You're a convicted felon
sitting in a room full of children.

695
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,759
You're a criminal.

696
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,222
It was white-collar crime.

697
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,930
Okay, you don't have to defend me.

698
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,260
You're such a loser.

699
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,352
I'm sorry, what did he say?

700
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,774
What?

701
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,058
- Well, I would...
- Yeah.

702
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,691
Excuse me. Hi.

703
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,900
I gotta ask you.

704
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:44,688
Now are we talking part-time
or full-time employees here?

705
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:47,695
Nope, just happy volunteers.

706
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,778
What?

707
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,702
For your information, jailbird...

708
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,528
She seems great.

709
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,946
The Dandelions helps girls
build leadership skills.

710
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,833
It looks good on their high-school transcript

711
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:58,462
and they are bettering their community,

712
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,080
which is more than I can say for you.

713
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,245
A-ha. What is your name?

714
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,542
Helen Kreagan.

715
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,297
Oh, you know what?
I think you dropped something right here.

716
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,958
- You go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck yourself.

717
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,585
Go fuck yourself.

718
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,627
I don't think you know who you're talking to.

719
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,217
I think I do.
And I think I want you to fuck off.

720
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,354
I don't think you do.

721
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,391
Oh, my gosh!

722
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:22,985
Can we just take a minute
and give congrats to Sarah, here?

723
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:27,606
Thank you. It's Sandy. It's Sandy.

724
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,321
- Or Sandy.
- I like Sarah.

725
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,741
Whatever, either one.

726
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,991
I gotta know how much
are you selling these boxes for?

727
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,789
- Girls.
- $7.

728
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:37,987
$7?

729
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,785
Ka-ching, right?

730
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,830
I got a guy in Shanghai who can make this
same box of cookies, 19 cents.

731
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,247
This is an official meeting
and you're interrupting it.

732
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,956
Let's take a poll, show of hands.

733
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,708
Who finds Helen to be a bummer?

734
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,683
Lots of hands. Oh, Helen.

735
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,467
Toot.

736
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,684
Do something, Mom.

737
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,886
I object to parolees attending our meetings

738
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,397
and I'd like to put that in the minutes.

739
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,024
May I?

740
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:06,605
Let me just handle this.

741
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,690
Another great point by Helen.

742
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:09,935
You know what, Helen?

743
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,527
If you don't get off my fucking back,

744
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,822
I'm gonna shove a box of chocolate clusters
up that tight ass of yours.

745
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:17,283
Oh.

746
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,373
I would love to go to lunch.

747
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:23,501
You're on. You got yourself a date.
That sounds terrific, okay?

748
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,577
Sandy, I love that kerchief.

749
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,667
Was that necessary?

750
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,252
- Super necessary.
- Yeah.

751
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,733
Michelle?

752
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,233
- Hi!
- What are you doing?

753
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,563
What is all this?

754
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,146
This is my way back, m'kay?

755
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,613
You are looking at Darnell 2.0.

756
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,363
I wondered when you were getting up.

757
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,240
Have you not gone to bed yet?

758
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,072
No, I have been up and percolating

759
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,987
since 11:00 p.m. last night.

760
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:01,036
- Just great stuff, Claire!
- Okay.

761
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,248
You're having a breakdown.

762
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,787
No, no, no!
I'm having a breakthrough, because of you.

763
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,674
Sit down, I gotta show you this.

764
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:12,261
Let me introduce you
to my new golden goose...

765
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,431
Darnell's Darlings.

766
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,680
Rough sketches.

767
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,301
So, I know. Those will be perfected.

768
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,928
But, really, tell me,
what's your initial thoughts?

769
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,193
- Stalin.
- Okay.

770
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,019
- Communist youth.
- All right!

771
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,107
Japanese-y black power?

772
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,730
My takeaway from that is "powerful."

773
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,740
Powerful imagery
and I'll take that any day of the week.

774
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:37,987
Why are you up?

775
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,415
Sit down, sleepyhead. Let's wake it up.

776
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,912
Claire, we're gonna start a brownie company.

777
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,754
No, we're gonna start a brownie empire.

778
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,330
Okay? And we're gonna call it
Darnell's Darlings.

779
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,843
Illinois alone has 25,000 Dandelions.

780
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,801
They're pulling in, in one year, $32,500,000.

781
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:00,015
This is a global company.

782
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,635
The Dandelions are making
a billion dollars a year.

783
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,145
Is that going in your pocket?
Helen's probably pocketing it.

784
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:10,056
I mean, that horrible bitch would
take teeth right out of a kid. Am I wrong?

785
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,654
If she could sell teeth,
she'd rip kids' teeth out.

786
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,744
I'm gonna let it go, but Helen's horrible.

787
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,700
The Dandelions are a non-profit, Michelle.

788
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,910
That money goes back
into great programs for the girls.

789
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,831
Oh, great programs?
That's interesting.

790
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,990
Rachel, do me a favor.

791
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,537
Tell your mom what was
the last "great program" you completed.

792
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,329
Go ahead, go ahead.

793
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,497
Scout leader Sandy
gave me a "Social Butterfly" badge.

794
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,745
That's great!

795
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,298
Tell her what a "Social Butterfly" badge is.

796
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:41,851
I had to hold a conversation
with a new person for 30 minutes...

797
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,514
- Okay.
- ...and demonstrate

798
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:45,095
how to be a good hostess.

799
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:48,729
Next week, I'm thinking
maybe they'll arrange marriages.

800
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:50,979
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna design

801
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,064
a special new badge for the Dandelions.

802
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:56,028
It's gonna be a real big one,
so no one misses it.

803
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,858
And I'm gonna make it a picture of a woman.

804
00:37:57,903 --> 00:38:01,873
A real sad woman with apron strings on,
bent over in front of an oven.

805
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:05,289
And it's gonna say, "You know why
we like vaginas better than your mouth?

806
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,539
"Because they don't have teeth
and they don't talk."

807
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,168
And you could turn that badge over
and you're gonna realize

808
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,627
that there's a man in the oven
and she's giving him a blowjob.

809
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,175
Good luck earning that!

810
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,381
Michelle!

811
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,339
I heard everything anyways.

812
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,764
These girls are gonna earn some real money

813
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,682
that can go towards a college fund,

814
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:25,722
give them empowerment,
give them a good sense of self.

815
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,684
I find that exciting, Claire.

816
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,061
It's a nice idea, Michelle,

817
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,063
but it's also a crazy one.

818
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,075
Claire, I want you to listen to me.

819
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,651
You have an amazing product.

820
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,486
- You make a mind-blowing brownie.
- Okay.

821
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:46,703
And I can sell anything I believe in,
and I believe in your product.

822
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,457
We can be partners.
Not my assistant. Fifty-fifty.

823
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,419
That's how much I believe in this.
What do you say?

824
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,877
I have to keep my job, Michelle.

825
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,764
This is... It's just too risky.

826
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,048
Come on.

827
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,592
You don't even like your job, Mom.

828
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,429
Oh, that was beautiful timing.

829
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,641
I didn't even set that up.

830
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,602
You know what, Claire?
Keep your terrible job.

831
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,442
Do this on the side.

832
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,813
Okay? Plus, it's gonna get me off your couch.

833
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:16,938
I'm in.

834
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,441
- You're in?
- Mmm-hmm.

835
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,032
Let's do it, people!

836
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,110
Okay, Rachel, you go get dressed.

837
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,454
I'm gonna take you to school.
We're gonna get some new recruits!

838
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,951
It's 4:00 a.m.
I'm going back to bed.

839
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,122
Night, sweetie.

840
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,452
What? Okay, you know what?

841
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,616
You get your rest, you're gonna need it!

842
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:34,253
We gotta recruit some Darnell Darlings today!

843
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,131
Claire, my quarterback,

844
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,960
I need you to bust ass into that kitchen

845
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,635
and start making pan
after pan after pan of brownies,

846
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,924
'cause that's how fast
I'm gonna sell 'em, okay?

847
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,796
- Right now?
- Right now! All right?

848
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,895
I may have tried to preheat that oven,

849
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,012
so I think there's a little bit of a gas leak.

850
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,467
- Huh?
- If you think about it, it may be

851
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,021
why you guys are feeling a little logy.

852
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:55,312
Hey, Rach, you know what?
Don't go to sleep! Don't go to sleep!

853
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,395
Oh, my God!

854
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,404
Okay. We may have to walk her.

855
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,245
Ah. You know what?

856
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,321
It feels good to kind of
put the shine and polish back on again.

857
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,331
People say it doesn't matter, but it does.

858
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,159
Puts a little kick in your step.

859
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,082
Who is that beast?

860
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,593
That's Chrystal Delveccio.

861
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,840
She's always getting into fist fights.

862
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,341
- Later, Dad.
- That's perfect.

863
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,685
That is exactly the kind of gal
we want to recruit.

864
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,300
You know what? Another little tip.

865
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,965
Look for girls that
are named after precious stones.

866
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,774
Topaz, Sapphire, Opal, Amber.

867
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,229
They're all gonna spiral down.

868
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,020
We want to get 'em
when they're angry and fresh going in.

869
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,405
Why don't you check out
Chrystal's availability?

870
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:41,732
Got it.

871
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,030
My mom never lets me drink coffee.

872
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,124
Really, why?

873
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,165
She says it'll stunt your growth.

874
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,911
That's not true. That's crazy.

875
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,335
What, do you wanna be freakishly tall?

876
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,174
All right. Get in there,
drum up some good recruits.

877
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,878
I feel kind of sweaty and scared.

878
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,843
That's just the coffee kickin' in.
It's good for...

879
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,722
Oh, you know what?
Wait a minute, let me see something.

880
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:10,886
Oh, I may have switched them.

881
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,389
This one's yours.
I put a little splash of bourbon in mine.

882
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,643
That's okay.

883
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:16,725
It's kind of a secret weapon.

884
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,899
It's what makes the Irish so mean.

885
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,611
And I can say that 'cause I'm Scottish!

886
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:22,568
Go get 'em!

887
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:27,649
And so, due to some
unforeseen complications,

888
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,568
and just, um...

889
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:31,242
Giving up...

890
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,415
Spaghetti passed away last night.

891
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,083
Listen up, motherfuckers!

892
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,160
Michelle, language!

893
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,656
Who here wants to hear about

894
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,828
an un-freaking-believably
exciting opportunity?

895
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,083
Huh?

896
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,385
All right! Woo! Look at this group!

897
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:46,126
All right. What's with all the long faces?

898
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,515
Did somebody die?

899
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:50,431
Yeah. Spaghetti died last night.

900
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,761
Who is Spaghetti?

901
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,005
The cat.

902
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,096
The cat? Oh. Can I be honest?

903
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,642
That cat probably killed himself
because his name was "Spaghetti."

904
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:58,768
Right? Hey-oh!

905
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,940
- Michelle.
- Oh...

906
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,231
All right, okay.
Why don't you take off, Sandy?

907
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,483
It's my meeting and I'm...

908
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,858
Okay.

909
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,443
Go catch it. Go catch it.

910
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,818
Really sorry about your loss.

911
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,534
As you already know,
my name is Michelle Darnell

912
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:12,625
and this is my partner.

913
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,911
And by "partner,"
I don't mean like girl-on-girl kind of stuff.

914
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,286
- Whoa!
- What's "girl-on-girl stuff"?

915
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:21,166
Uh, well, great question.
I love an inquisitive mind.

916
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,290
Girl-on-girl stuff is really just referring to

917
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,917
something you're
probably gonna dabble with in college,

918
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,094
but not stick with, you know?

919
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,170
Let's not... Don't tell her that.

920
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,337
Unless you're Hannah.

921
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:30,764
Hannah, you're gonna stick with it.

922
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:31,843
Don't... You know what? Let's...

923
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,467
And I got a hunch
that your mom should've stuck with it.

924
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:36,143
She wouldn't be so pent-up and angry.

925
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,473
That's my hunch.

926
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,638
Let's change the subject.

927
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,645
We brought you guys
some delicious homemade brownie treats.

928
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,648
Ooh. Look at this!
We brought treats, everybody! Treats!

929
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,442
Let me ask you one question.

930
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,864
When you sell a box of cookies,
what do you get?

931
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,825
You get points
that can apply to your canoe trip.

932
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:55,375
Wrong, you get a big plate of bullshit!

933
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:58,698
That is 100% right, you beautiful giant!

934
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,327
Now, at Darnell's Darlings,
we don't think that's right.

935
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,833
We think if you go out
and sell a box of cookies,

936
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,376
we should give you 5% commission.

937
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,709
5% commission, every box you sell.

938
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,376
It was supposed to be 10%, I think.

939
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:11,385
- That's right, we did say that.
- Yeah.

940
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:13,756
So far, you suck at this.
Just letting you know that.

941
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,514
Okay, it's 10%.

942
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:18,136
You come work with us,
you get a share of the profits.

943
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:19,972
Okay. Or you can stay here!

944
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,597
Be my guest and, I don't know, build some

945
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,975
dirty badger nests in some kind of tree.

946
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,862
Or what did you have planned, Sandy?

947
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,776
Well, actually, we were gonna build
a dirty badger nest in a tree.

948
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,447
My God.

949
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,529
My God! And I was making that up.

950
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,665
I was trying to think
of the worst possible scenario on Earth.

951
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,412
What the hell is going on in here?

952
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,044
I leave the room for one minute
to talk to my landscaper

953
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,623
and the meeting goes into the toilet?

954
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,295
Sorry, Helen, we're almost done.

955
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,206
Okay, you guys,
the best part about Darnell's Darlings

956
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,216
is that, for each box sold, an extra 10%

957
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,429
will go into a college fund for you. Okay?

958
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,471
We are gonna help you
save for your college education.

959
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:01,524
Wait, are you trying to poach girls
from a Dandelions meeting?

960
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,307
No!

961
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:06,353
Helen, we are not trying to poach girls.

962
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:10,476
We are actively and definitely poaching girls
from this meeting.

963
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,567
Get your hands off me.

964
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,112
- Fuck you, Helen!
- You fuck you!

965
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:15,406
Tell your little shitty daughter,

966
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,779
never talk to Rachel like that again.

967
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,906
- Let's um, go, girls.
- Okay, girls!

968
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,830
Whoever wants to go to the fun room,
come on with me!

969
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:26,583
Just down the hall.
The bigger, the better room. We got foosball!

970
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,959
Okay. And I promise, no Helen!

971
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,631
- Bye, Helen!
- Good luck with your product!

972
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:33,416
Oh, man.

973
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:34,587
I mean, what is it, anyway?

974
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:39,603
It looks like just a bunch of
homemade, gluten-filled, sugar-filled,

975
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,347
diabetes cake.

976
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,113
With chocolate!

977
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,113
Oh, my God.

978
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:55,858
It's good.

979
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:24,427
Now, what are we doing?

980
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,644
Selling brownies!

981
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,767
Okay, what do we say
if somebody doesn't want to buy?

982
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,402
"Buy my brownies or I'll kill you."

983
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:32,073
Don't say that, Chrystal.

984
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:33,189
Say that. That's perfect.

985
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,237
All right, now go make some money!

986
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:37,196
Woo!

987
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,031
The van leaves at 7:00!

988
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,324
If you're not back, we will leave without you!

989
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,736
No, we're not gonna leave.
Nobody's leaving you.

990
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,617
We're leaving at 7:00 sharp.

991
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,829
- 7:00!
- The van'll be here.

992
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,245
I didn't count how many there were.

993
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,635
- I did. Whew.
- Oh, good.

994
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:04,135
Okay, these are cut and cooled. Bag 'em.

995
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,101
Michelle, are you helping?

996
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:07,563
Yes, of course, I'm helping.

997
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:15,359
By the way,
don't give him anymore freebies, okay?

998
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,692
He's gotta pay for them,
just like everybody else.

999
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,106
Oh, they're so good!

1000
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:21,696
There you are. All set.

1001
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:24,083
Don't forget the tip.

1002
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,291
Now, how could I? You're so big.

1003
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,539
You've said it so many times.
And, there, you got it.

1004
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:33,956
Hi, do you have money?

1005
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,711
Hey!

1006
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,127
There ain't gonna be
any brownies left in the world.

1007
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,086
Get outta here. Go sell brownies!

1008
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,546
- Okay.
- Hello, Bonnie!

1009
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:48,216
Look at this. Patrice, take that.

1010
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,727
Take that and buy me something!

1011
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,478
I'm just kidding, but if you want to...

1012
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:01,318
Remember, girls, when the houses are nice,
we double the price.

1013
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,915
Rich people don't trust affordable snacks.

1014
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,581
- You know what? Let's go up to $10 a box.
- Hey!

1015
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:09,827
What do you think you're doing?

1016
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,413
Hi, Helen!

1017
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,418
We're participating in the American Dream.

1018
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,001
Not on this street, you're not.

1019
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:17,916
This is Dandelion territory.

1020
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,175
It's okay, Helen, we'll just...

1021
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,756
- Shut up, Sandy!
- Okay.

1022
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:21,931
You guys are losers!

1023
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:24,177
Hey, suck my dick, Gigantor!

1024
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,261
You're fucking dead!

1025
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,385
Hannah, stop it!

1026
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,558
We are not gonna behave like this!

1027
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:29,769
Michelle.

1028
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,232
A word?

1029
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:32,438
I'd be delighted.

1030
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:36,613
First rule of business, pretend to negotiate
and then take what you want.

1031
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:43,115
Listen, jailbird.

1032
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:45,123
You think because you used to be someone

1033
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,569
that the rules don't apply to you

1034
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:48,868
and your pathetic band of rejects?

1035
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,123
Well, you're wrong, bitch.

1036
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,866
Ugh. Helen!

1037
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,290
You got a case of the old trench-mouth.

1038
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,296
Did you let a corpse curl up and die in there?

1039
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,635
Forget it, Michelle.

1040
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:03,554
- Let's just start on the next block.
- No, no, no.

1041
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:08,637
Second rule of business
is when a stanky, hummus-eating bitch

1042
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:12,312
and her yeti of a daughter gets in your face,

1043
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:13,983
you gotta regulate.

1044
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,647
Hannah, give me some space.

1045
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:23,986
Oh.

1046
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,821
- How'd that taste?
- Nice.

1047
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:31,659
Chomp on that!

1048
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,251
Let's get 'em!

1049
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,940
They're animals! They're animals!

1050
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,701
Rachel's not done!

1051
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,994
Rachel's thirsty for more!

1052
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,038
Yeah!

1053
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:24,342
Hey, Chrystal! I'm coming for you!

1054
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,048
Bring it on!

1055
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,729
Oh, no, you don't!
You're not going anywhere!

1056
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,021
Do you understand me?
Dandelions never leave a street fight!

1057
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,403
God damn it, Helen!

1058
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,690
We're gonna wipe the floor!

1059
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,236
Sandy, why?

1060
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,241
'Cause I'm the leader, dang it!

1061
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:50,784
- You're a traitor!
- No.

1062
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:54,335
Move! That bitch is mine!

1063
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,541
Wait. No!

1064
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,999
Hey, time to put the cookies
back in the cookie jar, Helen!

1065
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,382
- Ooh.
- I warned you, Helen! I warned you!

1066
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,255
Those clusters are scratching me!

1067
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,417
Good! Darlings!

1068
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,094
Let's go!

1069
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,592
Stay down!

1070
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:11,296
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

1071
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,428
This was great.

1072
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:21,312
Ooh!

1073
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,058
That batch is burnt!

1074
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,324
Bye.

1075
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,316
One of 'em's in me.

1076
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:35,623
Hi, is there a Claire here?

1077
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,036
Is Claire...

1078
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:41,116
Hi! Where is Claire?

1079
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,668
Section 509, but return on investment...

1080
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:44,752
Ugh, ugh.

1081
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:46,464
Oh.

1082
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,670
- Look at you, in the middle of everything...
- I'll call you back.

1083
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:49,797
In a bullpen.

1084
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:50,972
What are you doing here?

1085
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,800
We're out of brownies.
We need you to make more.

1086
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,507
Well, I'm at work!

1087
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,563
Uh, hi, there! Hey!
You're Michelle Darnell.

1088
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:00,516
- Of course I am.
- Yes, you are.

1089
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:02,522
Mike, this is Michelle. Michelle, Mike.

1090
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:04,981
Ah...

1091
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:06,822
"Mike" Mike.

1092
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,188
Oh. Rejected Mike.

1093
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:10,988
- The rejected Mike?
- Don't...

1094
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,161
You know, he is kind of cute.
I think you should toss him a pity date.

1095
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,529
I don't need the pity,

1096
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,737
but I will take the date if that's out there.

1097
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:18,948
If that's an option.

1098
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,366
Pity's all you've got.
Pity's your best friend.

1099
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:23,335
- Okay. Good to know.
- Okay.

1100
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,207
Just stop talking to him, okay?
Leave him alone.

1101
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:26,844
What is going on here?

1102
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,381
Oh, my... Greatest. Okay.

1103
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,590
You are Michelle Darnell.

1104
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:32,875
Guilty as charged.

1105
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:36,010
Oh, wow. I have
two personal heroes in my life,

1106
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:38,184
and I am staring at one of them right now.

1107
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,770
- Oh, no. No touching.
- No.

1108
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,058
Curious to know who the other one is.

1109
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:45,485
It's Benedict Cumberbatch, and you.

1110
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:49,403
Huh. I did not peg you for a "Cumbersnatch."

1111
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,403
That's me. Cumbersnatch.

1112
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:52,856
You seem like a real Cumbersnatch.

1113
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,705
Well, thank you so, so much.

1114
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,871
You're welcome. Oh...

1115
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,031
Thank you. Great encounter.

1116
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,538
It's always fun.
And I think I'm done with you.

1117
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:05,418
Absolutely. And, madam, it was an honor.

1118
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,591
- Off you go!
- And here I am, okay.

1119
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:10,713
Strange girl.

1120
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,377
Okay.

1121
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:18,006
Claire, if this company is going to work,
I need you full time.

1122
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:19,605
I can't have you here.

1123
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:21,975
Are you in or are you out?

1124
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,979
I can't just leave my job!

1125
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,101
I mean, I have to have a steady income.

1126
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:27,558
I have Rachel to think about.

1127
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:30,068
No, no, no. This is for Rachel. Okay?

1128
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,738
If this works out the way I know
it's going to work out,

1129
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,398
it's gonna set you two up for life.

1130
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,075
We're already making enough money

1131
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,816
to pay your rent and all your bills,

1132
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:41,538
and I'm just about to put
a very big fish on the hook as our investor.

1133
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,790
This is what I do.

1134
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,411
Okay? You know that.

1135
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,785
You have to trust me.

1136
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,838
I do hate this job.

1137
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:52,302
I mean, it's a terrible job.

1138
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,090
My God. I mean, look at him.

1139
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,091
He's slumped over, asleep.
I hope he's asleep.

1140
00:52:58,136 --> 00:52:59,846
You don't want to be that guy.

1141
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,807
What do you say?

1142
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:04,597
Okay.

1143
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,565
Yes. I'm all in.

1144
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,193
Dana, I quit.

1145
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,437
I'm gonna start my own business, okay?

1146
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,652
- I have my own business.
- Yes, she does.

1147
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,614
Guys, it was lovely here.

1148
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:17,163
Not really,
but I hope you all have a wonderful day.

1149
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,449
Mike, would you still like to go on that date?

1150
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,623
Uh, yes, I would.

1151
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,121
I'm free tomorrow at 7:30.
Bring your A-game.

1152
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:26,459
Tracy? Wake up! I'm out!

1153
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,208
Wake it up, Tracy!

1154
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,292
- No.
- No.

1155
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:30,586
- No, thank you.
- I'm so...

1156
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,924
- Ooh. No.
- I'm very flattered.

1157
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:37,761
Seems like a good night
for sexual activity, Claire.

1158
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:42,102
How long has it been
since you've had sexual activity?

1159
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:46,978
Stop yelling "sexual activity."
'Cause Rachel might hear you.

1160
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:52,015
You know, you're the one that's yelling
"sexual activity" out in the hallway.

1161
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,066
Just answer the question, Claire.

1162
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:55,321
I don't know.

1163
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,152
If I had to guess,

1164
00:53:57,487 --> 00:54:00,407
maybe four, five, six years?

1165
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,656
What? Oh, my God.
Did you take a vow?

1166
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,004
It's very hard to find a good sitter.

1167
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:08,576
Okay. We'll go with that. I just...

1168
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,495
I'm gonna say, it probably doesn't help

1169
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:13,252
that you're dressed like
you grocery-shop at a CVS.

1170
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:14,961
What?

1171
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,335
I love this sweater.

1172
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,053
I don't know why you would.

1173
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,183
This sweater goes with everything.
It's a neutral.

1174
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:23,682
It doesn't go with you or your skin,
or your face.

1175
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:26,601
That sweater is the equivalent
of a sandwich board

1176
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,443
that just says, "I give up."

1177
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,099
And then in the back, it says,
"I never started tryin'."

1178
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,517
It somewhat looks like you have

1179
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:38,397
sewn together two very long, sad tube socks
and then filled each end

1180
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,739
with wet sand and rocks.

1181
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:43,243
What are you talking about?

1182
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:44,955
It just looks like two basset hounds

1183
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:46,697
may have cried themselves to death

1184
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,247
in your sweater.

1185
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,710
I like it. I think this looks great.

1186
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,505
Can I...

1187
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:53,883
- Michelle!
- Well...

1188
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,091
- You are...
- I had to check.

1189
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,380
I didn't know what was in there.

1190
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,593
You're making me feel very insecure
right before my date.

1191
00:54:58,674 --> 00:54:59,764
Don't!

1192
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,092
If your breasts could speak right now,

1193
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:04,387
I think they'd be saying, "Claire,

1194
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,725
"please don't zip me up in your jeans."

1195
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,097
- That is...
- You're gonna zip a nipple.

1196
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:09,393
That's not what they'd say.

1197
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:11,436
May I adjust your strap?

1198
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,480
'Cause I'm trying to help you, Claire.

1199
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,444
You say, "Be more helpful."
And I'm trying to be helpful.

1200
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:16,646
You can tighten the strap.

1201
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,443
Okay. What...

1202
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,197
Just a little, 'cause I want it...

1203
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,447
What is that toggle?

1204
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,696
Oh, it's a nursing bra.

1205
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,576
Oh, my God.
Are you still nursing Rachel?

1206
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:30,038
No, it's from when she was a baby.
But it's very comfortable.

1207
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:32,247
That's not comfortable to see.

1208
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:33,752
Now, let me see this.

1209
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:34,922
It's very often a fit issue.

1210
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,170
Why do these have so much pull?

1211
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,547
All right, well...

1212
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,340
Claire! It's like Geppetto!

1213
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,676
Look at that. Look at this.
It's like, "Horses, horses."

1214
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:45,891
- It's like I'm...
- Oh, my God.

1215
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,509
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1216
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,218
It feels good. I need to be comfortable.

1217
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,226
It doesn't feel good to my eyes.

1218
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:52,938
Can I just put 'em
where they're supposed to be?

1219
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,228
And I want you to be able
to see the difference.

1220
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:58,532
You got "Happy girl", and then, uh-oh.

1221
00:55:58,817 --> 00:55:59,937
They just drop out.

1222
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,777
And I should not be able to separate...

1223
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:03,951
- Okay. All right.
- They're heavier, but...

1224
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,989
So how do you like it
when I just get in there and bang around?

1225
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,616
- I love it.
- Why is there not...

1226
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:08,990
Oh, there's no give.

1227
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,287
Look at that. I can't even feel that.

1228
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,411
That's when you know...

1229
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,335
I don't feel it, okay? 100% silicone.

1230
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:20,299
And not the kind that's supposed to ever
be inside the body.

1231
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,010
I know. They're fantastic.

1232
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,130
That's something else.

1233
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,297
Might feel that.

1234
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:25,513
That's my nipple.

1235
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,300
- Yeah, they're up here, where they should be.
- Oh, my God.

1236
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,888
No, see, you need to bring 'em down.

1237
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,603
No! They can't, anyway, no.

1238
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,772
That's what you need to do.
They're too high, Michelle.

1239
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,150
- There's a structure. Stop.
- No.

1240
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:36,307
If we were... You need to...

1241
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,235
- Look, just take 'em a little bit lower.
- Oh, my God.

1242
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,485
- How about that?
- I paid a fortune for these.

1243
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:40,776
- No, I'm gonna bring 'em...
- I'm keepin' 'em up!

1244
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:41,817
Just gonna push 'em right down.

1245
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:42,902
I'm trying to help you not...

1246
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:44,566
What're you guys doing?

1247
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,028
Hey, there!

1248
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:49,374
We're just... There was a... Probably a...

1249
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,491
- I was...
- Bugs.

1250
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:54,617
We were jostling each other's bosoms like...

1251
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,005
Gals do.

1252
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,583
No, we weren't.

1253
00:56:57,668 --> 00:57:00,708
I was just trying to help your mom here
get ready for her big date.

1254
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:03,296
- I'm a little nervous.
- She's a little bit nervous.

1255
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,180
Always gotta stretch your boobs
when you're nervous.

1256
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:08,467
You should change.

1257
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,966
That's your TV-watching sweater.

1258
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:12,808
Thank you.

1259
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,595
Okay. Thank you for that.

1260
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,396
Okay, well, we're gonna leave you to it.

1261
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:18,859
You can treat yourself to a little underwire

1262
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,019
and something that
doesn't look like you sell ceramics.

1263
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:23,068
Let's go watch a movie. I'm babysitting.

1264
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:25,201
- Have you seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
- No.

1265
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,030
I'm kidding! I'm not kidding.

1266
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,045
Hi.

1267
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:44,421
Hi. Oh, my God. You look gorgeous.

1268
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,676
I'm wearing a bra, a new bra. It's not new.

1269
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:48,637
It's old. I just haven't worn it in a while.

1270
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,719
Hey, you know what,
I went with an old bra tonight, too, so...

1271
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:53,771
Let's get a table.

1272
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,021
Absolutely.

1273
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,850
I wanted to tell you earlier actually,
on a serious note.

1274
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,902
When you walked out
the other day from work,

1275
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,781
quite dramatically, I might add,

1276
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,240
six other people quit.

1277
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,493
- What?
- Mmm-hmm. They just walked out.

1278
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,282
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

1279
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,567
I started a chain reaction.

1280
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,948
You started a huge chain reaction.

1281
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,245
Six people walked out

1282
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:15,908
and then immediately
three people walked back inside.

1283
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:17,254
I think they were outside smoking.

1284
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,119
But it was like you were a cult leader.

1285
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,829
It was like a tremendous show of support.

1286
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,418
It was, like, very inspiring.

1287
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,837
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1288
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:27,666
Do you find that hard to believe?

1289
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:30,468
- That I'm tremendously inspiring?
- Yeah.

1290
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:32,012
- Yeah, a bit.
- Really?

1291
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,675
Well, let me tell you something, lady.

1292
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:36,104
You are more than a little inspiring.

1293
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:40,854
I have been talking ad nauseam here.

1294
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,189
Can you, uh, grab the mic for a sec?

1295
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:46,111
Well, I, um...

1296
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,781
I got knocked up in grad school by my TA.

1297
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,072
When he found out I was pregnant,

1298
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:51,905
he pretended like we didn't know each other.

1299
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,779
- What?
- Then gave me a "D."

1300
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:55,235
- What?
- Yeah, nice surprise.

1301
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,325
Yeah.

1302
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,201
But I got a great kid out of it.

1303
00:58:58,539 --> 00:58:59,709
I bet you're a great mom.

1304
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:01,001
I try.

1305
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,753
I mean, unless she is currently unsupervised.
Then you're a horrible mom.

1306
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:05,554
No, she's with Michelle.

1307
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,209
- She's with Michelle?
- Yes.

1308
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,917
She's your felon babysitter.

1309
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:12,142
Oh! Oh, my God!

1310
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,299
Rachel, it's the goriest part!

1311
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,638
It's the goriest part. You're missing it!

1312
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:19,982
Oh, my God.
He's killing her with a chainsaw.

1313
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,190
Oh.

1314
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,775
I have a felon watching my child.

1315
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:24,984
That just occurred to you, didn't it?

1316
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:26,315
- Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

1317
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,280
- It's good thing I'm here.
- Let's have some more wine.

1318
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,862
Absolutely, yeah. Hey, excuse me.

1319
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,994
Hi. Do you think maybe we could get
two more glasses of the...

1320
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,333
No. Hold on.

1321
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,079
Bring us a bottle of
whatever the lady would like

1322
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,922
in the twenty-five to twenty-eight dollar range.

1323
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:45,249
Sure, I'll send somebody to Walgreens
to get you something nice.

1324
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:47,745
Cool. You guys do that? What's with that?

1325
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,128
Oh, my God!

1326
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,007
Is that like a really cheap bottle of wine?

1327
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:57,967
You got a lot of balls
showing up here, Darnell.

1328
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:01,892
Listen, Ida, I know you're still mad at me,
and I don't blame you.

1329
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,019
I shouldn't have cut you out
of that Emerson deal.

1330
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,942
But if it makes it any better,

1331
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,273
I made a blinding amount of money
on that deal.

1332
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:14,235
You know the first time I saw you?
Twenty-three years old.

1333
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:16,323
Yeah. I knew right away,

1334
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,578
you were a tough, money-hungry,

1335
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,710
self-serving, see-you-next-Tuesday gal

1336
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:23,117
just like me.

1337
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:27,377
And that's why I decided to mentor you.
Just let you get too close.

1338
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,508
I started to think of you as family.

1339
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,546
Well, families are for suckers, right?

1340
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,550
That's for sure.

1341
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,468
What do you want, Michelle?

1342
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,136
I need an investor.

1343
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,515
Oh, for your little brownie venture?

1344
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:46,098
How do you even know about that?

1345
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,730
Because I'm Ida Marquette.
I know everything.

1346
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
Here.

1347
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:53,736
Come on, Ida.

1348
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,030
I'm sure you got quite an overhead
on this glue factory here.

1349
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:58,243
- Do you want in or not?
- You know,

1350
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,163
I once made love on a pool table

1351
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,246
in Hot Coffee, Mississippi

1352
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:07,253
with six members
of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1353
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:09,754
Are you stroking out?

1354
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:13,135
What does this have to do with
what we're talking about right now?

1355
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:16,508
The point is, Darnell,
I have very few regrets in my life.

1356
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:20,394
But you... You were my best protégée.

1357
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:22,473
Tell you what.

1358
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:26,688
I'll back you, if this checks out.
Just for old times' sake.

1359
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:27,977
Okay.

1360
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,613
If you'll excuse me, Shawshank,

1361
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,982
I'm late for my morning ride.

1362
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,227
Yes!

1363
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:35,358
Okay.

1364
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,105
You better make me a shitload of money.

1365
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:38,657
Away, Butters!

1366
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:46,248
Come on! Eat up, ladies.

1367
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,670
This is a celebratory dinner.

1368
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,379
We got our investor.

1369
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,209
Okay. Here we go.

1370
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,628
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

1371
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:55,836
Look at this!

1372
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:57,296
What is this?

1373
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,474
Well, I feel it's time
you become more adventurous.

1374
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:06,975
Thank God! Pizza!

1375
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:08,977
I know you don't like sushi.

1376
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:10,942
Thank you, Michelle! I'm starving.

1377
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:13,356
And fugu for the lady.

1378
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,744
- Thank you, Ping.
- Fugu?

1379
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,528
The infamous pufferfish.

1380
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:24,696
When prepared incorrectly,
it can lead to paralysis or even death.

1381
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:29,036
But when it is prepared correctly,
it is like a volcano erupting in my mouth.

1382
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,714
Let's hope for the second.

1383
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:37,972
Oh, this is nice. Get in here, guys.

1384
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,378
I don't wanna hog it all.

1385
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,257
Michelle, are you all right?

1386
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:47,599
When it's this perfect,
it takes you to the brink of paralysis.

1387
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:50,524
And then, at the last minute,
it just lets you go.

1388
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:53,148
Three, two...

1389
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:54,977
Uh-oh.

1390
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,245
Michelle?

1391
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,332
- Whoo.
- That's a very risky dish.

1392
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,253
Oh, God. How long was I out?

1393
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,923
Are you serious? Like 10 seconds.

1394
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:14,417
Yeah.

1395
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:16,297
It's a personal best.

1396
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:18,053
I was thinking about having more.

1397
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,181
All right,
I think everybody's done with the fugu.

1398
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:22,337
- I'm gonna tea it out, just for a second.
- Yeah.

1399
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:23,756
I made you something.

1400
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:24,886
What?

1401
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,392
I mean, I thought I should give it to you now

1402
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:31,232
'cause you keep eating things
that almost kill you.

1403
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:34,735
I made the frame at school.

1404
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:43,567
It's a nice frame, Rachel.
You did a good job.

1405
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,027
Thanks.

1406
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:48,945
When I look at the picture,
I just think we're like a weird family.

1407
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:53,748
Okay. Ah.

1408
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,090
Family? That's a little heavy-handed.

1409
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:01,881
I think, you know, I'm not much into labeling.

1410
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,587
You say "family," and we don't look alike.

1411
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:08,308
I mean, I'm not even sure
that you two look alike.

1412
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,310
We'll have to do a blood test on you for that.

1413
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:15,735
You know, it's funny, looking at this,
I think what day is this?

1414
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:19,902
'Cause I'm pretty sure I have a...

1415
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,282
I have a previously scheduled thing.

1416
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,283
I don't know what I was... You know.

1417
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,947
Do what you do. I'm gonna do what I do.

1418
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,446
I'll take care of the check.

1419
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:31,913
I just...

1420
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:35,916
What was that about?

1421
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:40,339
I don't know, sweetie. I don't know.

1422
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:50,274
Hi! Sorry, baby.
Michelle was supposed to pick you up.

1423
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:54,187
I know. I texted her like 500,000 times.

1424
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,032
All of her stuff is gone.

1425
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:14,831
"Thank you for letting me stay in your home.
Sincerely, MD.

1426
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,335
"P.S. I won't miss your couch."

1427
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:18,746
That's impersonal.

1428
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:20,671
A bit.

1429
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,548
I shouldn't have given her that picture of us.

1430
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:25,512
Sweetie, she loved your picture.

1431
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:30,011
No, come on.
She left because it was her time to leave.

1432
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,017
Michelle is a redhead and a Scorpio.

1433
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,429
It's a very impulsive combo.

1434
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:40,359
These little bites of goodness
are puttin' kids in college...

1435
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
Yes.

1436
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:44,155
...are giving young women in this country
a business plan

1437
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,654
and the thought in their head of like,
"Yes, I can."

1438
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:47,857
Is she picking up?

1439
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,076
And if you buy four sets,
you get this adorable wagon.

1440
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,754
No. It's her voicemail.

1441
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,759
I got 'em! I got 'em!

1442
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:18,899
These are going to be huge.

1443
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:27,237
How does she do it? I want in.

1444
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:28,949
More milk.

1445
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,741
No, I'm feeling reckless.
I want to do it myself this time.

1446
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:36,045
Ah.

1447
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,329
Good job.

1448
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,996
It's just, a little common courtesy
would be nice, you know?

1449
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,585
If she ever returned my calls,

1450
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,260
I would know about these press days
in the middle of nowhere.

1451
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:47,378
Mom, look!

1452
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:50,143
Congratulations, Claire.

1453
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,772
Honey, why don't you, um, go on inside,

1454
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,931
just look both ways before you cross, okay?

1455
01:06:58,018 --> 01:06:59,018
Okay.

1456
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:02,985
What're you doing here?

1457
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,655
Looks like you and Michelle
have built yourself quite a little empire.

1458
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:10,446
What do you want?

1459
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,951
I want to take what Michelle Darnell has built.

1460
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,624
I want her to realize that I have taken it away.

1461
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:20,293
And when she realizes it, when that moment
of realization crosses her face,

1462
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:22,334
and she realizes
that I have realized it as well...

1463
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:23,417
I've lost my train of thought.

1464
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,500
Yeah, I'm not following.

1465
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,166
I want the fucking company, Claire.

1466
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:29,008
It's only a matter of time

1467
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:31,221
before Michelle Darnell screws you over.

1468
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,395
So get in there.

1469
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,469
I see you eyein' those brownies.

1470
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:35,815
Let's have some bites. Go ahead.

1471
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:36,889
They're not gonna bite you.

1472
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,354
You're gonna bite them.

1473
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,643
Let's get a shot of those.

1474
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,832
Huh, pretty good stuff, right?

1475
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,996
Oh, my God.

1476
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,335
Oh, amazing!

1477
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,513
This is Chrystal.
It's one of the Darnell originals.

1478
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,218
She's a giant. Huh?

1479
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,180
I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I have eyes.

1480
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,048
Isn't that fun? Come on with me.

1481
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,007
I got a surprise for all of you guys...

1482
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:19,019
I think you're gonna be very excited about.

1483
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:22,189
I'd like to present
the new Darnell Darlings' mascot!

1484
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:23,309
Hit it!

1485
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:26,859
Take some snaps of this. I know you want to.

1486
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,230
It's a phoenix.

1487
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:29,317
Michelle.

1488
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,149
You get in there. I know you're not shy.

1489
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:32,276
What is this?

1490
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:35,657
It's a phoenix, Claire. It's my totem animal.

1491
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:39,909
Okay. So you leased
a commercial kitchen without telling me?

1492
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:42,625
Yes. I'm kind of waiting for a,
"Thank you, Michelle!"

1493
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,956
Wow, um. I'm having a hard time
with the "thank you"

1494
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:48,712
because you also hired all of these people
without consulting me.

1495
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:52,045
I do know that
you've been complaining pretty consistently

1496
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:54,552
about having to do all the baking
and doing it at your house.

1497
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:55,725
I fixed all that for ya.

1498
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:56,891
And you're more mad than ever.

1499
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,260
- I don't get it, Claire.
- You didn't...

1500
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:00,887
Michelle, you didn't consult me
on any of this, okay?

1501
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,234
I see a bunch of press.

1502
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:04,769
One of us, not you, got the press here.

1503
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:05,853
Right. Okay.

1504
01:09:05,896 --> 01:09:07,396
Well, maybe they should know that

1505
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,023
the new and improved Michelle Darnell

1506
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:12,236
is just as self-centered and egotistical
as the old Michelle Darnell.

1507
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,239
- Really? Do you wanna do this?
- Sure!

1508
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,529
- 'Cause I would love to do this.
- Great.

1509
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:16,572
You follow me.

1510
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,237
I will follow you, from the front.

1511
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,413
- No, not from the front. From the back!
- Yes!

1512
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,751
Don't put your arm in front of me!

1513
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:24,078
You can't tell me what to do!

1514
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:25,752
You're not my boss anymore!

1515
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,542
We are partners, 50-50,

1516
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:29,594
and you can't make decisions
without telling me!

1517
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,675
We are not partners, Claire!

1518
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,085
I am a successful businesswoman.

1519
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:36,473
You are a lonely woman who can
make a halfway decent brownie!

1520
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:38,602
And we all have
our little secrets, Claire. Right?

1521
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:41,427
You double-crossing,
hand-holding, sneaky little rat!

1522
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,723
What are you talking about?

1523
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:44,386
God, I can't believe I helped you!

1524
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,644
I took you in off the street, okay?

1525
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,938
When no one else would.

1526
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:49,811
You are such a cliché.

1527
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:52,938
Okay? You're getting close to people
so now you have to push them away.

1528
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:55,205
Okay, don't analyze me, Dr. Phil!

1529
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:56,989
Why're you guys doing this?

1530
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,284
Rachel, you know what,
just go inside, honey.

1531
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:02,036
No! No! You do not tell my daughter
what to do.

1532
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:03,999
And you know what?
Don't ever speak to her again.

1533
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,869
Mom, why would you say that?

1534
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:12,798
It's fine, Rachel, just...
Girls, go inside! Now!

1535
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,592
You know what? I don't need this.

1536
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:17,933
I don't need that.

1537
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:19,468
I don't need any of it.

1538
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:22,183
Let's see how far
your brownie recipe takes you.

1539
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,596
I'm cutting you loose and sailin' off!

1540
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,813
I don't need you two weighing me down!

1541
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:30,306
Rachel!

1542
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:31,439
Rachel?

1543
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,082
You're the only one
that's gonna take care of you.

1544
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:52,592
The only one.

1545
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:56,838
Excuse me,
you can't just go in there!

1546
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,012
Watch me.

1547
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:00,222
Hi, Ronald!

1548
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:03,182
Ooh, I like your new bitches.

1549
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:05,312
I saw you sniffing around my bakery.

1550
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:07,519
You looking to get into
the brownie business?

1551
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:10,309
Why? Are you looking to sell your business?

1552
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,354
Why not?

1553
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:15,153
I have no personal stakes in it.
It's just business to me.

1554
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:17,322
And you've always liked collecting my things.

1555
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,159
Okay. And since this one's
coconut macadamia,

1556
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:30,085
if you have a nut allergy,
I don't want you anywhere near...

1557
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:31,665
When's Michelle coming back?

1558
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:32,958
I don't know, Chrystal.

1559
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:34,343
She's like our leader.

1560
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:36,168
My mom's gonna run this place.

1561
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,593
Yes, I will be running the business

1562
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,892
until Michelle comes back, or...

1563
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,887
Knock, knock. Hi, it's Stephan!

1564
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:48,893
Hi! I have a message from
the new owner of Darnell's Darlings,

1565
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:50,387
Mr. Renault.

1566
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,056
Uh, sorry, I think there's a mistake.

1567
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:53,685
I'm one of the owners here.

1568
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,319
This is an eviction notice.

1569
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:00,654
She sold us out?

1570
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:02,740
How could she do that?

1571
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,243
Oh, she just did it.

1572
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:05,874
Okay, let's kick this guy's ass!

1573
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:07,039
Hey, shit brains!

1574
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:08,197
Chrystal!

1575
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:09,705
Protect me. Protect me.

1576
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,996
This is not cowardice. She's very tall!

1577
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:17,922
Really wish you'd let me kick his ass.

1578
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:32,808
You know what?
It was a good business decision.

1579
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:36,904
Don't start feelin' bad about good...

1580
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,110
Good decisions.

1581
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:44,864
Why would Michelle do that to us?

1582
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:47,159
I just don't get it.

1583
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:56,166
Well, you know, sweetie,
Michelle has got a lot of baggage.

1584
01:12:58,378 --> 01:13:00,008
She's an asshole.

1585
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,217
Language.

1586
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:03,299
Sorry.

1587
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:08,355
But you're right. She is an asshole.

1588
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,390
Darnell, you are a real asshole.

1589
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,200
Piece of shit.

1590
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:00,523
I know what I'm gonna do.

1591
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:02,694
- I'm gonna sue the pants off her.
- Oh...

1592
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:05,494
No, I'm not because
she'll throw too many lawyers at me

1593
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,659
and she's a shark in court.

1594
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:09,948
Yeah. This is a test.

1595
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,244
You want me to kill her with this bagel knife.

1596
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:13,617
And I'll do it.

1597
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:16,214
To pledge my allegiance to you, milady,
I'll do it.

1598
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:17,748
No. Thank you.

1599
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:20,381
Ooh, you guys are kissing.

1600
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,206
- Heya, Rachel! Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

1601
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,265
- Did you sleep over?
- Oh, God, no.

1602
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:26,842
What, have a sleepover here? Ew.

1603
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:28,054
- No, he didn't.
- Yuck!

1604
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,185
- No, that would be terrible.
- I don't know about "yuck".

1605
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:31,354
I don't mean "yuck." I meant...

1606
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,220
- Don't know if it'll...
- I mean...

1607
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:35,145
- It could be nice.
- Might be nice.

1608
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:37,265
- It's nice for people to spend the night.
- We don't know yet.

1609
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:39,232
- We don't know yet.
- We don't know yet.

1610
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:42,070
Would you please grab
some more garbage bags?

1611
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:43,649
We have a lot of trash.

1612
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:44,864
Yeah.

1613
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:46,698
Why did I make that so weird?

1614
01:14:46,737 --> 01:14:47,897
- It's fine.
- Didn't have to.

1615
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,406
Didn't have to make it that weird.

1616
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:52,447
- Holy shit!
- Language!

1617
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:55,414
Holy shit!

1618
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:56,789
Uh...

1619
01:14:57,414 --> 01:15:00,334
This is all seeming probably so much

1620
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:03,379
stranger than what I had intended.

1621
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,260
I'm sorry to startle you, Rachel.

1622
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,430
What are you doing in my closet?

1623
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:11,089
Well, uh, to give you the whole...

1624
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,846
I thought I have a great idea

1625
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:17,021
to surprise you with an apology,

1626
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,560
and my sincere "I'm sorry."

1627
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:22,983
So I let myself in, in the middle of the night.

1628
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:25,445
So once I was actually
waiting here in the dark,

1629
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:28,114
and you were getting up for the morning,
I thought, "Uh-oh.

1630
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:30,783
"This could seem
kind of threatening and menacing."

1631
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:32,624
And I panicked a little bit

1632
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,618
and just darted into the closet.

1633
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:40,293
So, surprise! I'm sorry.

1634
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,844
And, dang it,
I shouldn't have sold that company.

1635
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:46,883
I think we're done. Okay, well...

1636
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:50,434
You know... So thank you, I guess,
for breaking into my home.

1637
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,927
I said I was sorry.

1638
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:54,009
Great. We heard you. Okay.

1639
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:55,926
- I apologized.
- I heard you.

1640
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:57,636
There's the door.

1641
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,475
You sold us out.

1642
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:05,611
Yeah, I did.

1643
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:10,203
I sold you out.
And I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1644
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:14,949
And I'm hoping, somehow,
you can forgive me.

1645
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:20,122
And I just wanna throw it out there
that I have completely forgiven you, Claire,

1646
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:23,923
for trying to sell me out first with Renault so...

1647
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:26,668
What are you talking about?

1648
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:27,752
I saw you.

1649
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:32,095
Okay? I saw you and Ronald
outside the bakery.

1650
01:16:32,176 --> 01:16:33,506
He was smelling your hand

1651
01:16:33,552 --> 01:16:35,972
and I know what that means, okay?

1652
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:39,136
I mean, he has smelled many of my parts,

1653
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:43,477
and I have smelled many of his parts.

1654
01:16:43,854 --> 01:16:46,694
I was telling Renault that I'm not willing

1655
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:49,687
to sell him a single, solitary brownie,

1656
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:51,705
let alone my entire company.

1657
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:55,782
That's a mix-up, huh?

1658
01:16:56,074 --> 01:17:00,704
Michelle, I would never in a million years
do that to you, okay?

1659
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:03,866
You know... I mean, God.
What goes on in your brain?

1660
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,036
I don't know.

1661
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:08,745
I mean, I don't have a lot of,

1662
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,760
you know, experience
or a reference point for...

1663
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,973
I didn't have a family, or a mom, or a dad.

1664
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:22,275
And I totally get it
if you never talk to me again.

1665
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:25,404
So I don't want you to feel bad about that.

1666
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:28,569
I just wanted you to know
that I think you're very nice people.

1667
01:17:29,066 --> 01:17:31,226
Great people, actually.

1668
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:35,358
You're the closest thing to a family
I've ever had.

1669
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:40,195
And I'm real sorry I screwed that up.

1670
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,536
I'm gonna miss you, Michelle.

1671
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:47,792
Should I go?

1672
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:51,336
I think I should go.

1673
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:52,711
- Oh, my God.
- It's an awkward time for me

1674
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:54,416
to just be, like,
creeping around in the background.

1675
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:56,428
I had no idea you were still here.

1676
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,140
- Should I go, or should I...
- No, you're fine.

1677
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,640
I do not like what you did.

1678
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:04,177
I do not like it! And I do not like it.

1679
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,980
She really doesn't like it, guys.

1680
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:09,856
You know, I...

1681
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:15,106
If anyone's curious,
I do think I know how to fix this.

1682
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,869
I signed that contract with Renault
late Friday night.

1683
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:21,949
I wanna remind you I was wounded,
I was a little tipsy.

1684
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,615
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

1685
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,329
And it's Sunday.
No one will be in his offices.

1686
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,786
Plus, he can't file
for a corporate change of ownership

1687
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:31,747
until tomorrow morning.

1688
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,254
I can get in there tonight,

1689
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:36,377
I can get that contract,
and I can take our company back.

1690
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:38,133
Wait, what do you mean "get the contract"?

1691
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:40,507
He must have scanned and emailed it
a hundred times by now.

1692
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:43,216
No, no, no. Anybody else, yes, but not him.

1693
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:46,517
Ronald is completely paranoid
about being hacked. Okay?

1694
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:51,152
He has no cell phones, no emails.
He leaves no digital trail.

1695
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,480
Claire knows this.
He's all old-school pen and paper.

1696
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:54,937
It's the samurai way.

1697
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,284
Okay, I'm in. Let's do this. I'm in.

1698
01:18:58,322 --> 01:18:59,572
Why would you be in?

1699
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,066
What do you mean why would I be in?

1700
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:02,158
You've been talking all morning about

1701
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:03,992
how you wanted to get your company back.

1702
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,827
And you guys are gonna need help,
and I'm a helpful guy.

1703
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,254
How's that for a reason?

1704
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,170
You're gonna get rewarded for that.

1705
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:12,339
Well, that's not why I did it.

1706
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,844
- I'm in, too.
- No, Claire.

1707
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:17,012
This is my fault and I'm gonna fix it.

1708
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,970
Michelle, this is my decision.

1709
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:20,429
And I want our company back.

1710
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,011
Yes, Claire.

1711
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:23,965
All right, let's fuck this shit up.

1712
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:26,176
- Language.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1713
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,475
I need to get a sitter.

1714
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:30,404
Yeah, you do.

1715
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:34,941
As soon as we get out
I want you to grab the gasoline,

1716
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,395
some rags, and torch the van.

1717
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:37,575
What are you talking about?

1718
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,073
I rented the van. It's on my credit card.

1719
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:40,414
You go down, you go down alone.

1720
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,119
How would we even get home?

1721
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,989
That's a good point. MVP, Claire.

1722
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,536
Uh-oh. There's no door handle back here.
There's absolutely... Oh.

1723
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,583
Thank you, Claire.

1724
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:52,293
Okay. I still don't think you should be here.

1725
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:53,376
But if we get caught,

1726
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,752
I want you to tell the police
that I forced you here by gun.

1727
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,008
You gotta watch out for Rachel.

1728
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,917
Okay. You don't have a gun, though, right?

1729
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,877
- What am I, a thug?
- Okay.

1730
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,506
I'm such a badass!
This is gonna be amazing!

1731
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,885
Also, by the way, guys,
I was googling jail sentences.

1732
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:08,183
Since none of us are actually armed,
minimal jail time.

1733
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:12,806
Oops. Just excuse me for one minute.

1734
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:13,936
Michelle!

1735
01:20:14,064 --> 01:20:15,194
Well, it's a collector's item.

1736
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:16,899
Ditch it.

1737
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:19,777
Chuckin' a gun in a garbage can. That's smart.

1738
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:20,862
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1739
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:23,114
Okay! I know it was wrong. I self-corrected.

1740
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,078
No, you didn't. I just asked you to throw...

1741
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:27,448
Well, you made me throw it away. Okay.

1742
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,332
Okay, there it is. Renault Enterprises.

1743
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:35,382
The contract is probably in his private office,
which is at the top of the building.

1744
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:37,499
I'm guessing there's a safe,
could be in the wall.

1745
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:39,798
Could be behind
one of those creepy paintings.

1746
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,762
There's one guard on duty tonight.

1747
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:43,465
Mike, I need you to distract the guard

1748
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:46,302
while Claire lumbers in,
and I follow behind like a cougar.

1749
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:48,555
Okay, next, we head upstairs.

1750
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:50,099
Claire, I'm gonna give you a head start

1751
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:52,484
'cause I'm gonna take
those motherfuckers 10 at a time.

1752
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:55,151
You stand there
with your mouth hangin' open, and pointin',

1753
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,940
and I'll slide into home base.

1754
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:00,035
Mike, I need you to distract the guard

1755
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:02,152
by coming from the east, turning him around,

1756
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,317
so when we approach,
while you're sucking his dick,

1757
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,816
we can get right past him.

1758
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:07,278
So under no circumstances...

1759
01:21:07,326 --> 01:21:08,906
I'm sucking his what?

1760
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:10,291
You're sucking his dick.

1761
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,960
- I'm sucking his dick?
- Oh.

1762
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:13,334
Well, I'm not gonna suck his dick.

1763
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:16,245
I'm the brains behind it.
The brains never sucks the dick.

1764
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,385
- Why am I sucking his dick?
- I don't wanna suck his dick!

1765
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:20,462
Claire doesn't wanna suck his dick!

1766
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,757
How 'bout none of us suck that man's penis?

1767
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:24,299
Yeah, what if nobody sucks his dick?

1768
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:25,514
No dick suckin'.

1769
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,600
Well, I worked on that plan a long time.

1770
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,639
Fine. Fine, let's go to plan B.

1771
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,144
Yeah, that sounds good.

1772
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,944
If you're gonna be a baby and not suck dick,
that's fine with me.

1773
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,449
- Hey, there.
- Hey! How you doing?

1774
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:54,334
Is this 9800 Michigan?
I'm late for a birthday party.

1775
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:56,044
No, this is 9900.

1776
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,714
- This is 9900?
- Yeah.

1777
01:21:57,793 --> 01:21:58,963
- Well, wouldn't you know it?
- Yeah.

1778
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:00,172
Why are you dressed like that?

1779
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:01,424
What are you dressed as?

1780
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:02,515
I'm glad you asked me.

1781
01:22:02,589 --> 01:22:05,469
I am actually a demon. I'm a phoenix.

1782
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:08,604
Pretty cool, right?

1783
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:10,177
Are you into demons?

1784
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:13,063
Yeah. I know a fair amount.

1785
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,231
That is very cool.

1786
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:15,809
You can touch the feathers if you want.

1787
01:22:15,853 --> 01:22:18,193
Yeah, a lot of people don't know that.
It was a demon.

1788
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:21,522
It's actually pronounced Quetzalcóatl.

1789
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:22,897
He's talking too much.

1790
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,405
He'd be a lot quieter
with a penis in his mouth.

1791
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:27,156
- I'm into demons.
- You are?

1792
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:28,367
- Yeah.
- I think you said that.

1793
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:30,157
I really am. I do a lot of fantasy role-play.

1794
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,660
That's so weird.

1795
01:22:31,702 --> 01:22:33,542
Yeah, gets a little boring in here sometimes.

1796
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,249
- I bet.
- I whistle.

1797
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,960
- You whistle?
- I whistle a lot in here.

1798
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,120
- Let's hear some.
- Yeah.

1799
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:45,257
Why is that one whistling?

1800
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:48,724
Just kind of holding that one note.

1801
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:51,972
Yeah, I like to do that. I like to play
with bars and structures, things like that.

1802
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:53,885
You got a real hefty
lung capacity there.

1803
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:55,432
I never got your name.

1804
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:58,807
- Yeah, it's... It's Jim. Jimberly.
- Jim?

1805
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:00,938
- Jimberly?
- Jimberly Stevenson.

1806
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,321
What's going on?

1807
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:06,991
It's a cramp! God, I got a cramp!

1808
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,950
- Kenny!
- All right. I can help you. I can help you.

1809
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:12,333
- It's in the quad! No, it's in the quad.
- Right here? Right here?

1810
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:13,909
That's the top. That's the top.

1811
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:15,082
Okay? Right there?

1812
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,500
That's a little too close
to the groin, Kenny.

1813
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,580
That's a no-fly zone.

1814
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:19,253
- All right? How's that?
- Jelly. Back to square one.

1815
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,751
- We're good?
- Yup! Yup, yup.

1816
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,294
- I don't wanna overdo it.
- Phew.

1817
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:24,885
Okay. Well, hey.

1818
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:26,592
- Kenny, you're one of the good ones, man.
- Yeah.

1819
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:28,222
Yeah, not a lot of guys
would do that for another guy.

1820
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,048
- I'll do it for you.
- Thanks, man.

1821
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:31,933
- But we'll hang. We'll do it.
- Yeah, we'll totally hang.

1822
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,430
No big deal, buddy.
All right, have a good one.

1823
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:34,684
Bye, Jimberly.

1824
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,600
That's an odd choice for a lobby sculpture.

1825
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:39,685
He's an odd guy.

1826
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,940
You know, they say
he killed a man in Costa Rica.

1827
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:43,606
What?

1828
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:49,278
Oh, Jesus.

1829
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:54,080
Jimberly. "J", "J".

1830
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:56,455
Maybe it's "J-Y-M."

1831
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,624
What the fuck? There's no Jimberlys.

1832
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:01,246
Okay, well, where is it?

1833
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:04,381
I'm sorry,
I was a little tipsy last time I was here.

1834
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:07,513
Oh.

1835
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:09,469
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God. Guys, check us out!

1836
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,800
We're total burglars.
We burgle. We're burgling!

1837
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,274
I feel like this is going great.

1838
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:22,809
Michelle, you brought trash bags,
baby wipes, shower gel.

1839
01:24:22,855 --> 01:24:25,155
Do you actually think we're gonna need rope?

1840
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:30,489
Come on! Every story
about a burglar always involves rope.

1841
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:31,911
- That's true.
- It's in all the movies.

1842
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:34,159
I am a mogul, not a cat burglar.

1843
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,281
I'm also the only one
that thought to bring provisions.

1844
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,750
Michelle, stop! I forgot, I'm sorry.

1845
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:41,958
I stole the guard's keycard
while he was massaging me.

1846
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:43,249
You stole his key?

1847
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,625
Yeah. Okay.

1848
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:49,555
Somebody loves Mortal Kombat.

1849
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,171
Let's just find the contract
and get outta here.

1850
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,678
- Okay.
- I bet you he put it in his panic room.

1851
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:54,259
That's what I'd do if I had a panic room.

1852
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:56,354
It's probably voice-activated,
high-tech stuff in here.

1853
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:57,468
Open desk.

1854
01:24:57,514 --> 01:24:59,184
- Yeah. Open desk!
- Open...

1855
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,734
No, it was just manual.

1856
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:04,519
I got it! In his desk drawer,

1857
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,445
in a file marked "Darnell."

1858
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:08,783
Probably overthought that one.
It's classic Mike.

1859
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,859
- I do that a lot.
- Let's go!

1860
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:13,074
Son of a bitch, Stephan!
You left the door open!

1861
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:15,698
Oh.

1862
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:17,618
Well, who do we have here?

1863
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:22,407
Michelle Darnell, the baker and Quetzalcóatl.

1864
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,707
That is impressive.
I mean, you gotta give him that.

1865
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,380
I'm not even wearing the mask.

1866
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,054
That wouldn't be our contract
you're holding, would it, Michelle?

1867
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:33,126
You wouldn't be foolish enough
to back out of our plan, would you?

1868
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:35,887
You know what?
It was never her company to sell.

1869
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:39,009
- I own 50% of it, so...
- Yeah.

1870
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:41,726
- I may have fudged the initial paperwork.
- You what?

1871
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,137
- But I am sorry.
- So, I'm not...

1872
01:25:43,227 --> 01:25:44,227
- And I will rectify...
- Michelle!

1873
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:46,149
You will be. You will be. I'm sorry.

1874
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,650
I wonder, how should I approach this?

1875
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,533
Call the proper authorities and turn you in?

1876
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,914
Or we could just
talk it out amongst ourselves.

1877
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:02,794
Do you know what the fascinating thing is

1878
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,963
about the Japanese martial arts?

1879
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,503
The discipline.

1880
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:08,998
Ya!

1881
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:11,375
The integrity.

1882
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,427
The loyalty.

1883
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:20,099
Okay, okay, stop!

1884
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:21,348
I'll do it.

1885
01:26:22,432 --> 01:26:24,102
- I'll suck your dick.
- What?

1886
01:26:24,142 --> 01:26:25,442
I don't wanna do it,

1887
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,899
but if you promise
not to hurt anybody in this room,

1888
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:29,148
I'll suck your dick.

1889
01:26:29,231 --> 01:26:30,271
Mike, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1890
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:32,364
- Oh, my God. Mike, no.
- What?

1891
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:34,112
- You don't want me to suck his dick?
- No.

1892
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:36,282
Wrong dick, wrong time, Mike.

1893
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,321
- Wrong dick.
- Wrong dick.

1894
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:38,776
It was supposed to be the security guy's dick.

1895
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:40,196
I was trying to be a team player.

1896
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:42,454
Real eager, Claire. It's a red flag.

1897
01:26:42,536 --> 01:26:43,616
I don't like sucking dicks.

1898
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:44,914
It's not my business.

1899
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,295
Nobody's sucking my dick.

1900
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:47,503
Fair enough.

1901
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:50,423
Well, that's the first time
I've heard you say that, but...

1902
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,460
I'm going to plan B,

1903
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,135
my tongue has always been my sword.

1904
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,213
Okay.

1905
01:26:55,799 --> 01:26:57,799
Put the knife away, Ronald.

1906
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:00,803
It's not a knife. It's a katana.

1907
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:01,966
Katana.

1908
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,481
You're not gonna cut anyone
with that knife and we all know it.

1909
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:08,314
Oh, shit!

1910
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:10,813
Big bird, blondie, over there! Go! Scoot!

1911
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:12,266
Okay. All right, easy!

1912
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:15,858
Oh, shit.

1913
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:19,407
Are you crazy, Ron? I'm bleeding!

1914
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:21,116
Give me back what's mine.

1915
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:23,702
Michelle!

1916
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:26,655
- Oh, hello, old friend!
- Get off!

1917
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:28,754
Oh, God, I've missed this.

1918
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:31,252
God, you keep that shit tight. No!

1919
01:27:33,504 --> 01:27:34,634
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1920
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:35,925
Michelle, get up! Get up!

1921
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:39,512
Just get up.

1922
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:41,585
Okay, let's be reasonable.

1923
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:43,928
You know, I'm sure we can come to
some kind of an agreement.

1924
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:45,518
Oh, we're past that point.

1925
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,807
For the first time in my life,
I'm trying to do the right thing!

1926
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:49,601
This is not about me and you!

1927
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,346
You don't even want our company!

1928
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:54,936
That's true, but you screwed me over
25 years ago, you bitch.

1929
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:57,532
I thought sending you to prison would help,

1930
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:00,661
but cutting you to ribbons
is the only way I'll get satisfaction!

1931
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:03,869
Had enough?

1932
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:05,868
Shit.

1933
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:08,255
- Oh, check this out.
- Fucking psycho!

1934
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:13,042
Back up.

1935
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:16,212
Look at that!

1936
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,417
Just a figure eight. It's like double Dutch!

1937
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:19,547
That's not how you do it.

1938
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:20,756
Yeah, looks like I'm doing it.

1939
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:23,093
Look at that.
I can bob, somebody can weave.

1940
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:24,218
You see this shit.

1941
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,886
Ow! God!

1942
01:28:28,892 --> 01:28:30,392
Huh? Twelve years of baton.

1943
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:32,185
Everybody likes to make fun
of the baton girls.

1944
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:34,649
Seven, eight, one, two, three, four...

1945
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:40,282
Just give him the contract!

1946
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:42,862
No! I'm getting our company back!

1947
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:56,799
I will cut you in your white meat!

1948
01:28:56,879 --> 01:28:58,089
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1949
01:28:58,797 --> 01:28:59,837
Ha!

1950
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:01,423
Now we both have swords, huh?

1951
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:02,968
What is happening?

1952
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:04,181
Pretty fucking literal, Claire!

1953
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:07,511
We're having a sword fight.
We're both fighting with swords.

1954
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:09,928
I haven't been with another woman
since I've been with you.

1955
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:13,437
Really? I've been with hundreds of men.

1956
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,900
You whore!

1957
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:21,649
Oh, shit!

1958
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:25,281
Claire!

1959
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:29,371
- Michelle, let's go!
- Michelle, come on!

1960
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:32,161
It's been so long.

1961
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,630
That's enough! It's too hot.

1962
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,006
Wait a minute! Why are we running up?

1963
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:48,296
I don't know, it was the only door.
I'm doing the best I can!

1964
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,267
I should not be running with a sword!

1965
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:53,141
Okay, all right! Okay. All right.
There's gotta be a way down!

1966
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:54,605
Get away from there. Come here.

1967
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:56,096
Michelle, I'm not
so good with heights, you know.

1968
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:57,306
I'm feeling kind of tingly.

1969
01:29:57,356 --> 01:30:00,526
Claire, look at me. You have been on
a helipad before and it's gonna be fine.

1970
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:02,939
Right. Right, but then
they weren't chasing us with swords!

1971
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:06,914
You make a good point.
Claire, I'm sorry I got you into this.

1972
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,320
Michelle!

1973
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:09,947
God, I need to do more cardio.

1974
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:12,163
Go over there. Go over there! Be careful.

1975
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:14,663
You left so suddenly.

1976
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:17,668
Okay, let them go. I'm the one you want.

1977
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:21,802
You know, I killed a man
in Costa Rica with this sword.

1978
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:25,879
I guess you would call it my killing sword.

1979
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:39,063
You're terrible in bed!

1980
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:40,606
I know.

1981
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:42,979
Oh, my God! Michelle!

1982
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:44,937
Whoa. Honey! Let her go, Claire!

1983
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:46,698
She's making a fortune in heaven.

1984
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:50,035
Hey, hey. Hey, smile!

1985
01:30:50,075 --> 01:30:52,535
Okay, everyone take it easy.

1986
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:54,078
I've been filming this the whole time.

1987
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:56,870
Take the sword away from her
or I swear to God I'm gonna hit "send."

1988
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:59,537
Yeah, you're not gonna hit "send"

1989
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:01,800
because I'm gonna chop your hand off.

1990
01:31:01,879 --> 01:31:02,999
No!

1991
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:04,336
Oh, my God.

1992
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,131
- Brother!
- No!

1993
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:09,506
Son of a... Samurai!

1994
01:31:09,553 --> 01:31:10,683
Shut up!

1995
01:31:10,762 --> 01:31:13,642
Oh, thank goodness!
Michelle, are you all right?

1996
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:14,774
I'm fine!

1997
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:16,978
I'm about to feel much better.

1998
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:19,557
- No.
- Yes!

1999
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,400
Be wrong to ask for your forgiveness?

2000
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:25,739
It's Ron talking.

2001
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:28,664
- Oh, Ron!
- I'm sorry.

2002
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:32,237
Renault, do you
still need me to hold them at bay?

2003
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:35,411
Oh, my God.

2004
01:31:35,454 --> 01:31:36,504
Come here.

2005
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:38,456
Ow.

2006
01:31:38,832 --> 01:31:39,832
Ow.

2007
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:44,881
Michelle, don't make out with the sociopath!

2008
01:31:45,088 --> 01:31:47,718
I know. You make a good point.

2009
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,930
But this is really good stuff.

2010
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:51,178
Victim here.

2011
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:52,601
Michelle!

2012
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:58,355
Michelle! He literally tried to kill you!

2013
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:00,595
I know. But his mouth didn't!

2014
01:32:08,237 --> 01:32:12,067
Okay! Attention, everyone!

2015
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:15,945
I just wanna say what a great first year
for the Darnell's Darlings.

2016
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:19,254
And what a great first house
for Rachel and Claire.

2017
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:21,787
Cheers!

2018
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:25,884
Finally, they have a decent guestroom
so I can stay over when I get blasted.

2019
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:27,633
- Michelle.
- What's "blasted"?

2020
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:29,923
I'll show you in about
three drinks.

2021
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:31,840
- No, she won't.
- I'm kidding.

2022
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:33,137
But if I can,

2023
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,220
can I take a serious note for a minute,

2024
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:37,925
and I just wanna say I'm proud of you.

2025
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:40,645
You've built a great family home here
for you and Rachel.

2026
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:43,976
And I'm awfully glad
that I get to be a part of that. So.

2027
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:45,901
Thank you, Michelle.

2028
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:47,113
Thank you.

2029
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:50,490
Oh, and thank you for the new sofa!
You really shouldn't have done that.

2030
01:32:51,113 --> 01:32:52,823
Oh, well, I should have, though.

2031
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:56,455
I mean, the old one was
very uncomfortable and very dangerous.

2032
01:32:56,493 --> 01:32:58,333
But don't worry. I don't wanna hear it.

2033
01:32:58,412 --> 01:33:01,122
I did donate it to just the right person.

2034
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:09,342
Hannah!

2035
01:33:10,299 --> 01:33:12,679
Michelle Darnell just sent us a sofa bed.

2036
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:15,759
You know what I call that? A victory. I win.

2037
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:17,725
Whatever.

2038
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:20,846
Oh, it is comfortable.

2039
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:25,107
Ah.

2040
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:27,186
It's comfortable...

2041
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:31,106
Darnell!

2042
01:35:37,863 --> 01:35:39,863
I may have had
a little bit of your Scotch last night

2043
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,988
and I got into the most wonderful chip.

2044
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:45,246
It was called a Dorito.

2045
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:52,336
I've had wonderful Vermont ched...

2046
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:56,513
I'm so sorry. God, I'm a hack.

2047
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:58,167
Hi, Rachel.

2048
01:35:58,217 --> 01:35:59,467
It's Rachel!

2049
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:00,970
That's what I said.

2050
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:02,637
One more time.

2051
01:36:04,556 --> 01:36:07,056
I'm an icon.
I am not a professional burger.

2052
01:36:10,687 --> 01:36:12,607
But I like burgers.

2053
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:15,153
I took the guard's keycard. Oh, fuck me.

2054
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:17,442
I took the card from the geek.
What the fuck is it?

2055
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:18,948
I took the guard's keycard.

2056
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:20,199
I took the card from the geek.

2057
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,819
Oh, my God. Again.

2058
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:22,865
Katana.

2059
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,987
Oh, gosh. Sorry.

2060
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:28,866
Stop picking up wood! Michelle!

2061
01:36:33,544 --> 01:36:34,674
Here we go.

2062
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:35,961
Oh, God. I'm gonna pee my pants.

2063
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:40,759
Oh, my God. No.
Please give me one more shot.

2064
01:36:42,052 --> 01:36:43,052
You pop...

2065
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:46,387
When you left my life...
Shit. Fuck.

2066
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:49,313
What was that? I should've been so...

2067
01:36:49,393 --> 01:36:51,733
Meryl Streep would've just kept going.

2068
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:54,560
I stand corrected.
Do you want some nuts?

2069
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:57,571
So we can get to the elevators

2070
01:36:57,609 --> 01:36:59,109
while you're sucking his dick.

2071
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:00,863
Wait. I'm sorry.

2072
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:05,784
I'm so sorry. I saw it coming
from a mile away. I'm so sorry.

2073
01:37:06,451 --> 01:37:07,991
Okay. I can get in there.

2074
01:37:08,078 --> 01:37:10,868
I can get the contract
and I can take back our country.

2075
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:12,044
What do you mean "take..."

2076
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:13,245
God damn it.

2077
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:17,418
I object to parolees attending our meetings

2078
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:19,592
and I'd like to put that
in the official transcreept...

2079
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:23,049
I made a good business...

2080
01:37:24,678 --> 01:37:27,598
You know what?
You made a good business...

2081
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,689
Really? You fucking kidding me?
I can't say "decision."

2082
01:37:31,935 --> 01:37:33,225
- Language, Michelle.
- Yeah.

2083
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:34,805
Good night!

2084
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,110
You think they'll ever yell "cut"?

2085
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:42,018
No.
