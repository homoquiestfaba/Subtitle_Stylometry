00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,983
"Sedsos"?

343
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,952
One's Emily's,
the other's Mom's.

344
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,885
Vessels of our souls.

345
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,191
Aha.

346
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,194
We keep them
next to our bed at night.

347
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,197
We believe that our souls
wander while we sleep.

348
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,565
At dawn, our souls return to us
through the serdso.

349
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,570
Good.

350
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,199
Okay. Better get this stuff
to the hospital.

[Vessna Cooing]

352
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,380
Uh, May, do you have
any liver chips?

353
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,254
- Morning, May.
- Right here.

354
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,834
May, has anyone ever told you
you have beautiful knuckles?

355
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,704
[Giggles]
Thanks. So do you.

356
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,373
May, if anything
should happen to usm-

357
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,939
- I mean, you know, this virusm-
- Nothing's going to happen.

358
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,851
But if it does,
I want you to know lm- Im-

359
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,889
I love you.

360
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,891
Albert!

361
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,427
There's no toilet paper
in the men's room.

362
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,520
I knew I forgot something.

363
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,531
If you can't
do anything else right...

364
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,692
at least keep the john
properly stocked.

365
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,899
Captain Grazer's
under a lot of pressure.

366
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,408
He shouldn't speak to you
like that.

367
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,376
Yeah, I, uhm- I should probably
get back to work.

369
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,217
I love you too.

370
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,665
- Hey, Albert.
- Hi.

00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,394
George,
what are you doing here?

372
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,405
- I'm a police officer, aren't I?
- Yeah, butm-

373
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,408
I can't just sit around that hospital
with Moby Dick in my hand.

374
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,542
- Well, whatever.
- [Beeps]

375
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,844
[Sighs]
Matt, I need to do something.

376
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,112
Sure, George.

377
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,120
[Beeps]

378
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,988
It would take very expensive, sophisticated
equipment to synthesize a viral agent.

379
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,619
I'm tracing invoices from laboratory supply
houses over the last year and a half.

380
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,290
Sounds good. I was talking to Sgt. Tran
at the Purist unit.

381
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,959
He sent over
some surveillance photos.

382
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,028
All the usual suspects,
except this guy.

383
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,868
I've never seen him before.

384
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,172
Hey, Zap, you recognize this guy
with Bryant?

385
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,183
Mm-mmm.

386
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,151
Run a make, will ya?

387
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,156
Cross-reference it with the F.B.I.

Hi.
Any luck?

391
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,210
I've tried
Zynomine, Plaetine...

392
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,542
a whole range
of antiviral drugs.

393
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,048
Nothing seems to work.

394
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:30,053
Cathy, uh, I know what you must have thought
when you saw me with Lorraine.

395
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,555
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

396
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,819
I have to find
a monoclonal antibody.

397
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,886
I know we've been,
well, kinda seeing each other...

398
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,557
but still,
we keep having problems.

399
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,397
I just thought,
I don't know...

400
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,870
it might be better if I started going out
with a human woman.

401
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,669
Matt...

402
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,733
does any of that
matter now?

[Tenctonese]

404
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,644
Hey!

405
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,551
- What'd he say?
- He was afraid I was an Overseer.

406
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,623
Ah, my English
is not good.

407
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,395
But I want
to help youm-

408
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,097
I am doctor.

409
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,439
He says he worked
in the ship's infirmary.

410
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,639
Thanks for the offer,
but this isn't the candy stripers.

411
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,878
- You don't just walk in here and volunteer, pal.
- Wait.

412
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,325
He knows
his physiology.

413
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,090
Well, then, he should know where his butt is,
which I'm kicking out of here.

414
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,325
- [Phone Rings]
- Dr. Frankel.

415
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,268
I'll be right there.

416
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,770
- Emily's condition has deteriorated.
- Let me see her.

417
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,772
- No!
- Doctorm-

418
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,832
You're not going onto that ward!
We don't know this guy.

419
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,119
- What is it?
- Her temperature's still rising.

420
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,486
I've given her holodka,
but it hasn't helped...

421
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,991
so I'm putting
an ice wrap on her.

422
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,289
Let's double it up.

423
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,766
Uh, George,
I don't know how to say this...

424
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,770
but if Emily
was my daughter...

425
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,272
I'd sorta want to
bring in a priest.

426
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,274
- So she can go to heaven?
- Wellm-

427
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,276
Matt, I appreciate
the thought...

428
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,780
but we don't believe priests have anything
to do with where we go after death.

429
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,839
Oh, uh, Mattm-

430
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,079
George. Matt.

431
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,588
I need to get a vase
for these.

432
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,590
Look,
I made the same mistake.

433
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,149
See, flowers are pretty,
but they're, uh, dying.

434
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,863
It's a Newcomer thing.

435
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,866
I'm afraid this isn't
a very good time for visitors.

436

- Why don't you two go get something to eat?
- Okay. Come with us.

00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,201
No, I'm not hungry.

for her feet.

You're Catholic.
You understand.

00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,865
No.

447
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,930
Are you worried
about her soul?

448
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,405
Matt, we don't even know
if they have souls.

449
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,914
What are you talking about?

450
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,007
There's nothing in the Bible
about Newcomers.

451
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,053
Christ came to us
as a man.

452
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,088
He died for human beings.

453
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,090
- What are you saying? They're not in the club?
- No, lm-

454
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,093
I'm sure God has a plan
for the Newcomers.

455
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,356
But it isn't
the same as ours.

456
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,227

What is it?

464
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,396

Emily.

472

[Kitten Meowing]

474
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,035
If Emily's getting better,
why hasn't Susan?

475
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,945
[Cathy]
I'm going back to the lab.

476
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,945
Oh.

477
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,953
- [Repeats Word In Tenctonese]
- I brought you these.

478
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:42,796
- Where did you get all this?
- I keep it from the sh-ship since the crash.

479
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,171
I... stole it...

480
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,174
from the ship.

481
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,642
Will it help you?

482
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,645
Yes. Oh, yes.

483
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,977
Now we can
together work.

484
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,520
- Uhm-
- You do not trust me.

485
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,182
I am different.

00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,590
- Yes.
- Because I am alone...

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,857
in the desert
since the crash.

488
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,899
Five years
you were in the desert?

489
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,232
I hide from Overseers.

490
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,999
I... am afraid.

491
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,540
All that time, you never knew
we were free.

492
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,175
What's this?

493
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,687
That's odd.

494
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,452
Many of us developed a rash like this
when we landed on Earth...

495
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,459
from the salt air.

496
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,826
Why would you get it
after five years?

497
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,901
I know. The air in Los Angeles is more saline
than the desert. We're closer to the ocean.

498
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,703
You must be
reacting to it.

- My back's sore.
- Mmm.

- Her mata gland.
- It is a little swollen.

510
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,252
It's probably
from the fever.

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,311
To your room
I'll take you.

00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,992
I wanna see Mom.
I'm really worried about her.

513
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,995

00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,219
- George, Susan, thank God!
- Penny!

684
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,489
Oh!
I was so worried.

685
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,497
Oh, we're fine, really.

686
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,726
If there's anything I can do,
anything at allm-

687
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,326
Thank you.
Um, I'll call you later.

688
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,066
Please.

689
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,533
- Nice, isn't it?
- Mmm.

690
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,038
[Door Opens]

691
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,742
[Sighs]

692
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,513
This is yours?

693
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,026
Like they say, the bank owns most of it,
but, uh, yes.

694
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,029
- [Horn Honks]
- Matt's waiting. I have to get to work.

695
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:11,295
Show him the trash compactor.
I bet he's never seen anything like that.

696
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:15,634
Friend, our home
is your home.

697
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,640
- [Horn Honks]
- Oh.

698
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,699
[Mutters]

699
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,610
You don't like it much,
do you?

700
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:31,382
I suppose it's very human.

701
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,257
Yes, I suppose it is.

702
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,600
Here, lady.
This way.

703
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:47,228
I wouldn't let Ahpossno
in my house, George.

704
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,273
Well, look who's checkin'
into Heartbreak Hotel.

705
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,174
Give her the Lizzie Borden suite.
A lovely view of the cinder block wall.

706
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,236
You know, Detective,
it's a finite world.

707
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,273
Whatever they takem-water, food, jobsm-
there's that much less for us.

708
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,410
Yeah, Phyllis,
sing me the blues.

709
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,921
It's your children
and your grandchildren...

710
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,923
who will pay
for what you've done!

711
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:12,291
- Say good night, Phyllis.
- George. Detective Sikes.

712
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,296
Congratulate me.

713
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,332
May just asked me
to marry her.

714
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,926
Congratulations, Albert!
[Laughing]

715
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,267
He'll make you
a wonderful husband.

716
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,604
And he's a handsome fellow.
A hot tamale. A real creamboat.

717
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,371
Albert, my shirts!

718
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,640
You brought them
from the cleaners on a hanger.

719
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,182
I like them folded in a box.
What goes on up there?

720
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,241
I'll get right on it. Oh.

721
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,309
There's toilet paper
in the bathroom, Captain.

722
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,447
And I wrote your name on it
so that no one else can use it.

723
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:44,016
- Gonna be very hard for me to resist.
- Shut up, Sikes.

724
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,858
- You, back to the hospital.
- Captain, I feel fine.

725
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,160
- Top-tip. In the red.
- Pink.

726
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,429
- However.
- [Scoffs] It's not a checkup.

727
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,369
- You got a homicide.
- [George] Homicide?

728
00:52:55,438 --> 00:53:00,205
"Newcomer victim found in his car...
in the hospital parking lot."

729
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,474
George, what about
that gizmo he had?

730
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,578
That thing he brought the chopper
down with? Where did he get that?

731
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,624
You're obsessing on Ahpossno.
Once you know him better, you'll like him.

732
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,716
- Come over tonight. Have dinner with us.
- Pass.

733
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,727
- Cathy's coming.
- I'll be there.

734
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,730
Lois! Whoo!

735
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,789
Take that one out of the oven.
It's done.

736
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,358
Sikes. George,
glad to see you up and about.

737
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,495
Thank you.
What do we have?

738
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:32,633
Newcomer, male.
His name's Kenny Bunkport, 35 years old.

739
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,577
He's been dead about three days.
Killed by a single axillary blow.

740
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:40,412
- To the armpit.
- I know what "axillary" is.

741
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,077
What was the murder weapon,
a can of Right Guard? [Laughs]

742
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:47,351
Somebody's fist,
and that somebody was strong.

743
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:52,794
Yeah, I know it hurts you guys like getting
whacked in the gooneys, but fatal?

744
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,797
The Tenctonese axilla is
comparable to the human temple.

745
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,595
Theoretically, a blow could be lethal.
Althoughm-

746
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:02,604
- What?
- It would take uncommon precision.

747
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,508
- [Cooing]
- Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

748
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,579
- I don't know why I didn't redecorate sooner.
- ##[Tenctonese]

749
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,812
We surround ourselves
with everything human...

750
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:20,014
and yet we have such
a rich culture of our own.

751
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,217
Oh, Buck, you'd better
give Vessna her bath.

752
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,455
- It's getting late.
- Let me.
- [Crying]

753
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,723
She's probably scared
from everything.

754
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:30,027
I'll take her.

755
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,568
[Crying Stops]

756
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,104
Maybe after dinner
you can tell me more about Yderon.

757
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,663
He killed four Overseers
with his bare hands.

758
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,972
Really?

759
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,274
Susan, look who's
joining us for dinner.

760
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,906
Oh, Matt, hi.

761
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,916
Susan, what have you done?

762
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:52,580
I'm making this a Tenctonese home, George.
Ahpossno inspired me.

763
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:56,558
Doctor, ninja
and interior decorator.

764
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,651
Excuse me.

765
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,993
What we've been throughm-
almost dyingm-

766
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,000
George, it's made me
reevaluate my life.

767
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,629
It's time for some changes
in my home, in my job.

768
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,674
- What?
- I gave notice.

769
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,971
You know, Ahpossno was right
about advertising.

770
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:17,741
- That Ahpossno.
- Susan, don't I have a say in all this?

771
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,805
You know,
that's another thing.

772
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:24,343
We've fallen into this human habit
of you making too many decisions...

773
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,618
when you know perfectly well
that in traditional Tenctonese society...

774
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,319
- women made all of them.
- [Chuckles]

775
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,327
- Susanm-
- Ahpossno said...

776
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,863
that in Tundash villages,
men did nothing...

777
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,264
but bear children
and gather roots, George.

778
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,327
Is there something in the kitchen I can do?
Rinse some membranes?

779
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,929
Susan, we've made plans
based on two incomes.

780
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,033
The U.V. Room, the trampoline,
the Winnebago.

781
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,601
George,
we don't need things.

782
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,613
We need identity.

783
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,874
- [Doorbell Rings]
- I'll get it.

784
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,318
- [Computer Voice] Visitor at the front door.
- ##[Flute]

785
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,755
- Cathy, what a surprise.
- Hello, Matt.

786
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,658
- Susan, George.
- Cathy.

787
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,561
- Is Ahpossno here?
- That's him playing.

788
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,622
- Oh.
- ##[Continues]

789
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,668
I think she was
glad to see me.

790
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:31,084
- That was beautiful.
- [Tenctonese]

791
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,983
- How is it hanging?
- [Chuckles]

792
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,527
- It's hanging fine.
- I've been practicing my English.

793
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,258
- Thank you for these books.
- I brought you something else.

794
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,467
Your N.R.C. M-
Newcomer Registration Card.

795
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,027
They named you
Norman Conquest.

796
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,039
[Chuckles]

797
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,041
You now have all the rights
of a citizen.

798
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:57,569
You're free.
No one can ever enslave you again.

799
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,774
Thank you.

800
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,181
You are kind.

801
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,021
You are beautiful.

802
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,984
[Footsteps]

803
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,175
- [Grunts]
- Don't you look like what the cat-dragon ate.

804
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,484
You left in a hurry last night.
Shame you missed dinner.

805
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,216
We had some wonderful liver
filled with whipped cream.

806
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,158
- Nu-Twinks.
- [Grunts]

807
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,161
Was it something
anyone said?

808
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,561
Can we just
get to work here?

809
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,395
Or is that the kind of decision
Susan has to make?

810
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,527
Are you implying
I'm kitty-whipped?

811
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,537
No, George, I never
for a moment...

812
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,539
thought that you
were kitty-whipped.

813
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,541
We have a missing person.
A human.

814
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,442
A rancher
named Raymond Taylor.

815
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,707
Put a hold on that till
we finish the Bunkport case.

816
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,249
- Why?
- I think it might be of major significance.

817
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,912
Major significance?
Bunkport probably just stiffed a loan shark.

818
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,320
Whoever the murderer was
clearly has uncommon martial skills.

819
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,620
- Alsom-
- What?

820
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,355
- Well, I just have a feeling.
- A feeling?

821
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,193
You mean, like booga-booga,
sixth sense, E.S. P?

822
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,028
Humor me.

823
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,364
Fabric fibers were found under
Bunkport's fingernails.

824
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,768
It's possible they came from
the murderer's clothing.

825
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,931
S.I.D. Is
running an analysis.

826
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,875
- [Grunts]
- Hello.

827
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:39,176
- We missed you at dinner last night.
- I... suddenly took ill.

828
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:43,151
- I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
- What's going on?

829
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,153
Ahpossno wanted to know
where I worked.

830
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,655
I said I'd give him
a tour of the precinct.

831
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,353
Oh, sure! Why not?
We got nothing better to do today.

832
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,658
I'm going to the morgue...
to get some fresh air.

833
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,091
He doesn't like me.

834
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:02,399
No. No, i-it's just that
Matt's interpersonal skills...

835
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:06,238
are a little... weak.

836
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,836
I've gotta get to the lab.

837
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,323
Bye.

838
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,628
- You have much work here.
- I'm afraid so.

839
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,364
- How do you remember everything?
- With computers. Like this.

840
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:40,034
I can bring up any case, review files
on any suspects, any former convicts.

841
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:44,011
It's linked to my computer at home
so I can access the files there too.

842
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,108
Now, uh, humans are identified
by markings on their, uh, fingertips.

843
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,119
[Both Chuckle]

844
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:54,714
- And, uh, Tenctonese?
- We were all tissue-typed in quarantine.

845
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,192
George, at the weddingm-
Hellom-

846
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,252
May wants me
to wear a blue gown.

847
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,231
- What color did you wear at yours?
- I was married aboard the ship.

848
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,767
- There were no gowns.
- Oh, forgot. Of course.

849
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,201
- You let them marry?
- What do you mean?

850
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,104
He is a Number Four, a Zabeet.

851
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,404
Albert is as smart
as any of us.

852
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,573
Those slave classifications
are meaningless.

853
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:24,052
You must forgive Ahpossno.
He's been alone in the desert since the crash.

854
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,214
Here, everyone
is allowed to marry.

855
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:32,557
Oh. Equality.
That'sm-That's good. Congratulations.

856
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,228
Excuse me.

857
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,093

- What were you doing?
- Just studying history.

Abraham Lincoln.
What a great man.

863
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:13,092
Yes. But that computer
requires an access code.

864
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,866
Oh, I, uhm- I asked Susan.
I didn't want to bother you.

865
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,305
It also contains
classified information.

866
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,003
If you wish to use the encyclopedia,
use Buck's computer.

867
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:26,845
All right.
Well, I'm tired now.

868
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,850

you know what I'm gonna do?

I'm gonna drink

- Matt!
- I mean it.

887
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,289
I will. I'll drink it
down to the last curd.

888

Matt, lm- I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

894
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,814
But I think it's better
if we just stay good friends.

01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,726
It's Ahpossno, isn't it?

I'm missing my backgammon club.

I tried to push this till next weekend,
but he insisted.

900
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:02,194
Your long wait is over. In a week's time,
you'll leave this planet.

901
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:06,435
- What?
- I've been sent to facilitate
the recovery of our slaves.

902
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,103
Recovery of the slaves?
[Chuckling]

903
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,271
It's been five years.
This is ridiculous.

904
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:16,011
I mean, the slaves would have
to be retrained, reconditioned.

905
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:20,215
Sir, I'm sure he didn't mean
to question your authority.

906
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,385
It's just that, well, we're all
just a little surprised.

907
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,724
I didn't save them from
the virus to leave them here.

908
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,197
The expense will be enormous!
Has anyone done a cost analysis?

909
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,826
It's not your place to worry
about the economics.

910
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,328
I also plan to take the humans.

911
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,236
Oh, my Gm-

912
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,798
Well, that's
an excellent idea, sir.

01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,970
- Only-
- Only what?

914
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,738
Well,
they're not very strong.

915
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,479
- They could still do domestic work.
- But they're very ugly.

- Hello, Susan.

- Oh, goodness.
- I've redecorated.

920
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,533

01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,777
Oh, thank you.
That's lovely.

924
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,939
- Oh, sit down.
- Oh, I really can't stay.

925
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,074
The house is for sale,
and we're showing it today.

926
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:25,382
- You're moving.
- I know. We'll miss you too.

927
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:29,220
We're just fed up with the city.
We were in Coeur d'Alene last summer.

928
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,658
You wouldn't believe
how beautiful Idaho is.

929
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,390
So clean.

930
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:40,902
Anyhow, Susanm- [Sighs]
This is really difficult for me.

931
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,064
You know, some people have
this stupid prejudice.

932
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,440
I think it's terrible.
But... we do have to sell our house.

933
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,776
- Yes?
- Please don't take this the wrong way.

934
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:56,614
But could you keep Buck and Emily
inside this afternoon?

935
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:01,623
- Inside?
- Oh, God, this is so hard for me.

936
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,457
You see, some people come into
a neighborhood, they see Newcomersm-

937
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,895
You understand?

938
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,593
Yes, I understand.

939
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,296
Get out of my house, Penny.
And take this.

940
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,270
You know this has nothing
to do with how I feel.

941
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,334
Just get out.
Get out!

942
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,812
- I'm starved.
- There's cookies for you.

943
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,816
- I'm gonna get some ivy.
- Okay.

944
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:31,682
- Hey, Mrs. Francisco.
- Emily.

945
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:36,248
- What?
- Take the ivy from the backyard.

946
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,852
I hate the ivy in the backyard.
There's no snails.

947
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,626
- Emily, please!
- God, Mom, what's your problem?

948

[Grunting]

949
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:02,484
- Have you read Darwin?
- He's on my list.

950
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,520
Darwinian theory states
that Homo sapiens evolved...

951
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,852
from them.

952
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:10,756
I can see that.

953
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,929
I don't like zoos very much,
to tell you the truth.

954
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:19,195
Well, captivitym-
it's a little too close to home.

955
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,202
I still think about
being a slave every day.

956
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,204
But I suppose
that's not a bad thing.

957
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,036
It helps me appreciate
my freedom all the more.

958
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:29,475
There's so much I wanna do,
so much I wanna learn.

959
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,311
This new world is so full
of possibilities.

960
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,816
We can have
our dreams now.

961
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,857
I'm sure it's a healthy thing-
Susan reexamining her roots.

962
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:47,054
- It's just sometimes I feel
Ahpossno manipulates her.
- Aha!

963
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,597
- You still think he's the Second Coming?
- "Second"?

964
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:53,431
Matt, I have never
met him before in my life.

965
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,835
Albert, have you decided on
the color of your wedding gown?

966
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,306
- I called the wedding off.
- How come?

967
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,970
'Cause May deserves better
than a Number Four, an idiot.

968
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,479
- Oh, Albert.
- Heym-

969
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,052
[George]
It's Ahpossno's fault.

970
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,145
He reminded Albert
that he's different.

971
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:16,350
- Oh. It's your fault too!
- What?

972
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,950
- Albert called off his wedding.
- Why is that my fault?

973
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:22,225
"Albert, you call this a clean ashtray?
The doorknobs are sticky.

974
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,323
- Albert, brush my teeth."
- Hey, look.

975
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,858
I only expect him to perform
the basic duties of his job description.

976
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,667
Yeah, yeah.
I got your job description.

977
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:35,699
Matt, S.I.D.'s analysis of the fibers found

##[Continues]

983
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,404
I heard that back on Tencton, a warrior
would have to fight for his serdso.

984
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,373
That was
the ultimate challenge, yes.

985
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:15,406
In a duel... to take another's life
and soul.

986
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,248
Did you ever do that?

987
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:25,689
I've killed,
but never so nobly.

988
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,805
Mom wants us to move away!

989
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,537
- What?
- She's in the kitchen.

990
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:48,174
I'm not leaving my friends,
my school, my mall!

991
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,777
- I'll go live with Jill!
- Susanm-

992
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,620
Penny came by today.
She asked if we could stay inside...

993
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,921
so we wouldn't scare off people
who might buy her house.

994
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,690
- Penny's a fool. She always has been.
- It's not just Penny, George.

995
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:05,393
They want to exterminate us.
We don't belong here.

996
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:09,130
We can paint the walls all we want,
but we're never gonna make this our home.

997
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:13,574
- Where do you suggest we go?
- There are communities in
the mountains just for Tenctonese.

998
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,974
You want us
to segregate ourselves?

999
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,104
We'd be safe, George.

1000
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,616
- And we wouldn't have to depend on humans.
- The world is too small.

1001
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,710
- Everyone on this planet
depends on everyone else!
- We tried living with Terts.

1002
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,348
It just doesn't work.
We should live with our own, right?

1003
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:31,325
He's been in the desert for five years.
What does he know?

1004
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,022
He hasn't been polluted by them.
He is still Tenctonese.

1005
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,088
I see.

1006
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,997
When you were on Yderon mining oxmer,
didn't you depend on other species?

1007
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,337
- That was Yderon.
- [Susan] What does that have to do with this?

1008
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,070
There were no oxmer mines
on Yderon.

1009
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:52,238
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

1010
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,339
but I want you out
of my house by tomorrow.

1011
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,385
- [Buck] Dadl
- Tomorrow!

1012
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,782
Throwing Ahpossno out
won't change anything.

1013
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:14,393
Look, it'll be okay.
Every marriage has its ups and downs.

1014
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,928
- You're divorced.
- Yeah, well, so I know about the downs.

1015
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,636
- Here's your breakfast.
- Thank you, May.

1016
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,043
- Here's yours.
- Thanks. Hey, I got something, George.

1017
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,880
That silicate gaminite-
it's used in making ceramics.

1018
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,478
Closest ceramics factory
is in the Mojave.

1019
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,148
A small town called Cantil.

1020
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:39,761
[Spits]
What is this?

1021
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,229
Oh, uh, marmot entrail.
[Shouts In Tenctonese]

1022
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,665
Scrambled eggs.
She's mixed up our orders again.

1023
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,794
Francisco,
is this your pancreas?

1024
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,272
Probably Sergeant Gosling's.
She always eats pancreas in the morning.

1025
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,674
May has fallen apart ever since Albert
called off the wedding.

1026
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,304
- You gotta do something about this.
- Me?

1027
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,942
All right, all right.
I'll think of something.

1028
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:06,351
- Matt, what was the name
of that town in the Mojave?
- Cantil.

1029
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,515
A truck was found abandoned
in Little Tencton.

1030
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,855
Registered to that
missing rancher, Raymond Taylor.

1031
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,521
He lives in Cantil.

1032
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:19,056
- [Birds Cawing]
- The last anyone saw Raymond was five days ago.

1033
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:22,467
Fred Nader over at the filling station
sold him a tank of gas.

1034
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:26,201
He remembers, 'cause just a few minutes later,
he saw that shootin' star.

1035
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,800
You know ifTaylor knew
a Kenny Bunkport?

1036
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,744
- Did he often go into L. A?
- Beats me.

1037
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,476
- Matt, I wanna check that out.
- What?

1038
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,711
- I don't see anything.
- Vultures.

1039

[Vultures Cawing]

1040
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:50,196
Tire marks.
Twelve inches.

1041
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,063
Same as Taylor's.

1042
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,994
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

1043
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,466
It's Taylor.

1044
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,470
[Coughs]

1045
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:10,345
That's odd.
Look at the broken ribs.

1046
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,081
- Taylor was hit repeatedly under the arm.
- In the axilla.

1047
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:16,318
- What's that mean?
- He was attacked as if he were a Newcomer.

1048
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,089
Why? Sure as hell don't look like one.
No offense, partner.

1049
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,721
The murderer finally broke
Taylor's neck.

1050
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:29,704
He could've used Taylor's truck to drive to L.A.,
where he killed Bunkport.

1051
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:33,003
- I got a suspect for you, George.
- Ahpossno.

1052
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,841
Comes out of the desert after five years,
the same day Taylor's murdered.

1053
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,244
He would've needed clothing,
transportation.

1054
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:43,717
Tries to kill Taylor, but he doesn't know about
humans, so he finally breaks Taylor's neck.

1055
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,016
- That's so circumstantial.
- Come on, Detective Two.

1056
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,886
He's a whatchamacallitm-
am- a Tenctonese samurai.

1057
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,084
He kills with his hands.

1058
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,526
And where did we find
that dead Newcomer Bunkport?

1059
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:58,032
At the hospital,
the first place we met Ahpossno.

1060
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,762
I'm gettin' S.I.D. Out here.

1061
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,375
In addition to that, human defenses
will be easy to overcome.

1062
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,434
They have only primitive
nuclear weapons...

1063
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:12,036
and chemical agents
that don't affect us.

1064
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,810
While we're picking up the Tenctonese
in Southern California...

1065
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,545
a second ship will begin
human deportation...

1066
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,213
in these densely populated areas
in India.

1067
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,223
This is a big mistake.

1068
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,953
The Tenctonese will never
make good slaves again.

1069
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,996
Your humansm- [Laughs]
Your humans are worthless.

1070
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:31,590
- You've argued against this from the beginning.
- Because we're settled.

1071
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,431
We have our families.
We have our businesses.

1072
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:39,463
And I, for one, have no desire to climb
back aboard a slave ship.

1073
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,009
You're an Overseer.
You have your duty.

1074
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,979
As far as I'm concerned,
those days are over.

is Ahpossno still here?

1082
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,426
He left.

1083
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,871
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

1084
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,172
Isn't it enough
that he's gone?

01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:56,507

but still I remember.

I just can't seem to get it.

1088
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:07,155
Susan, we can't go back.

1089
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,857
We're here now.

1090
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,594
That's gone.
And you're not going to recreate it...

1091
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:17,037
be segregating yourself
in a phony Tenctonese village.

1092
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,632
That's death, Susan.
It's the loss of hope.

I can't stop you
if you decide to leave.

1094
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,446
But I won't go with you.

1095
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,453

I believe.

- Matt, nothing's changed.
- This is police business.

1100
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:03,041
- Do you know where Ahpossno is?
- Isn't he at the Franciscos'?

1101
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,916
Not anymore.
Do you have plans to see him?

1102
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,621
He's coming here tomorrow.
I'm taking him to Edwards.

1103
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,159
He wants to see where
the space shuttle lands.

1104
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,093
- Did he leave any possessions here?
- Nol

1105
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:21,693
I'm not gonna answer any more questions
until you tell me what this is all about.

1106
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,830
- Ahpossno is a suspect in a murder investigation.
- What?

1107
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:28,171
We think he's killed two peoplem-
a human and a Newcomer.

1108
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,336
How can you stoop
so low?

talking about?

1110

that you want a relationship with me.

1111
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,053
- Cathym-
- You're jealous of Ahpossno.

1112
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,919
You know he has feelings
for me and that I have feelings for him.

1113
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,426
- So you turn him into a murder suspect.
- You think I'd do that?

It wasn't in the computer.

1142
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,292

never went through quarantine.

- Yeah.

There were no members
of the Chekkah aboard our ship.

- How can that be?
- They're military personnel.

They're never stationed
aboard slave transport ships.

- What are you talkin'-

He must've landed in the desert.
