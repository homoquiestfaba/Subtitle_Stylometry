1
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,480
Ernie, where you look at? 
-- Nothing. 

2
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,088
Nothing? You have somewhere to look. 
-- Photos 

3
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:43,154
Hugs? 
-- No. 

4
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,653
Overlevingsfoto's. 
-- Why? 

5
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:47,904
When farmer Joe us 
Leaves in the forest. 

6
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,320
Do you really think Joe 
Dumb games to play. 

7
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,607
You are not a little kid anymore. 
And your dumb friends as Lou either. 

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,035
Watch out. 

9
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:06,072
That is a overlevingsboek jackass. 
-- Let your language. 

10
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:10,523
You survive even in the city. 
What would you do in the woods? 

11
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,273
Everything okay, Carmine? 
-- It is, right? 

12
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,274
That scheelde not much. 

13
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:12,347
Attention, have you? 
-- Yes. 

14
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,469
Tommy, do you want to please eat fruit? 
Pa. 

15
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,208
Make place. 
Bring the other slightly. 

16
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,972
He Dannie, how are? 
-- Marie Good, thanks. 

17
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:31,617
I saw Carmine yet? Is he here? 
-- No, it is too late. 

18
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:35,896
Come on, Dannie. 
-- Take a suit, we go swimming. 

19
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,829
I must go. Bye 
-- Day. Amuse you. 

20
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:50,355
Since he came. 
-- They are. 

21
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:59,699
Welcome. 
Come Lou, get off. 

22
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,206
I never saw so many trees. 
It is really fine. 

23
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,008
I said that it was fine. 

24
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,287
Can you a helping hand. 

25
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,604
Bardus donkey. 

26
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,132
Mam. 

27
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,006
Dad, everything kits? 
It is beautiful. 

28
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:31,039
Why are you late, Carmine? 

29
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:37,971
Ernie had to pack up his toys. 
-- Obligation, it's overlevingsmateriaal. 

30
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:41,719
Wait. 
Ask him to the fireworks. 

31
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,565
Fireworks. 
What I said about fireworks? 

32
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:51,012
Leave him alone, Marie. 
Come on, we go. 

33
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,269
Carry the luggage. 

34
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:59,768
Remember what I said, okay. 
I want to see you run them. 

35
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,794
Do not leave them in the boxes. 
Since they are doing nothing. 

36
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,886
You are a man now. 

37
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:12,594
What's it like there. 
-- You look stunning. How is it going? 

38
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:16,437
Going into the lake? 

39
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,372
Yes. 
You see there ... 

40
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:26,418
You can see myself not bad. 
-- Thank you. 

41
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,686
Come on, hurry you. 

42
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,976
It was good. 
I was late but ... 

43
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:42,931
All kits, boys. 
He Ernie, how are you? 

44
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:47,365
What are you doing? 
-- We are waiting for the girls. 

45
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:51,774
Why is that? 
Afterwards they take their shower. 

46
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,134
Let them watch you? 
-- Sorry, it is a bit behind. 

47
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,475
There is a hole in the douchescherm 
So you can see. 

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,805
You can see them and they know not? 
-- Yes. 

49
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:05,736
This is great. 
Thanks for me inviteren. 

50
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,014
Who's that idiot? 
-- I do not know. 

51
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:15,363
I dare him. 
I am Mikey, this is Tommy. 

52
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,721
Pleasant acquaintance. 
Once bite my vleesbal? 

53
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,124
Thank you, I have no hunger. 
-- As you like. 

54
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:31,378
It is time that we go out of our clothes, 
In the water and go swimming. What do you think? 

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,496
He hated me always. 

56
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:47,589
Oh, no. 
-- My God. 

57
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,467
Are you still with that rope? 
-- What? 

58
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,758
You missed the whole pond. 
You flew over there. 

59
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,374
This was entirely your fault. 
You pushed me too hard. 

60
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,080
Then I had to jump you. 

61
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:09,433
And then you are surprised 
That my father hates you. 

62
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,522
The truth will store everything. 
I knew it. I knew it. 

63
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,933
Now it. 
I knew he hated me. 

64
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,288
What? 
-- How can you hate an eight? 

65
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:24,529
That was because you always plaagde me. 
Can you take him bad? 

66
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:31,368
Do you think he hates me? 
-- Yes, but for a different reason. 

67
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:55,117
Come on girls. 
We are showering. 

68
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,450
That was not fair. 

69
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,496
Do you see anything interesting? 
-- No, we do not. I swear it. 

70
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,026
I saw nothing. I swear it. 
I wanted to try, but I could not. 

71
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:28,810
We saw the tits of Dannie. 
What a pair. 

72
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:29,811
Do you get away! 

73
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:52,549
Harlow! All kits? 
-- How does it. 

74
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,976
You know it. 

75
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,560
How is it going? 
-- Not bad. Not bad. 

76
00:07:57,683 --> 00:08:02,080
And your father? 
-- Good. Very busy. 

77
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:05,326
This city is ready to make 
To the hand. 

78
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:09,711
You know. Incredibly. 
Another son. 

79
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:14,906
Exciting. But the mess. 
That really does not. 

80
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,493
In addition, I have something special 
For the idiots to be taken to graze. 

81
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:27,820
What idiots? 
-- Mietjes of Ernie and his friends. 

82
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:31,334
I knew Ernie was a mietje. 
Does he now even though friends? 

83
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,317
I believe it. 

84
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,560
What do you think is so special? 

85
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:46,401
We Cappy visits. 

86
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:50,030
Come on. You know that they 
Not cope. 

87
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:56,457
Ernie, Michael, Tommy thick. 
You know, maybe Louis. He ... 

88
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,774
He may just. 
-- Think you know? 

89
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,468
Yes. This is nonsense. 

90
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:05,705
We will see what they can 
If they Cappy's cabin. 

91
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,607
If they Cappy's cabin. 
You speak against me. 

92
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,476
It is Carmine here. 
You know that I know that she does not exist. 

93
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:13,894
I found the cabin. 
-- Found? 

94
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,556
I found the cabin. 
-- You have found nothing. 

95
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,530
I am here only. 
-- I know. 

96
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,273
Have you seen the girls? 
-- I saw them. 

97
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:23,402
What do you think? They look good. 
They want only what hanging. 

98
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,365
Are you afraid? You are afraid. 
-- I am afraid for nothing. 

99
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,929
It's just waste of time. 
More. 

100
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:34,205
What happens? Wait? 

101
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:43,420
I am not a chicken. 
I am the rooster. 

102
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:52,147
Come tomorrow asked me wake him up, then go 
I am with you. But we must act quickly. 

103
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,252
I see you do. 
Okay. 

104
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:05,633
What form these hamburgers? 

105
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:10,425
What's that? 
A piece of mouse? 

106
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:19,459
I said raw not rot. 

107
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:24,221
Cappy was a zeekapitein. 
A long time ago. 

108
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:32,096
After a terrible accident he came to 
These forests for everyone away. 

109
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:36,923
Come on, Joe. 
-- We heard this story each year. 

110
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,278
Do yourself a favour and 
Make a new story. 

111
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:50,516
Now it's happened. 
Ga retrieve that bottle, idiot. 

112
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:55,253
Remember that you wait at Cappy. 
-- Yes, it will do. 

113
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,424
You know what did Cappy? 

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,994
Cappy formed a circle with dead deer 
Around the camp. 

115
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,484
Rottend, dirt, dirty 

116
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:18,423
I walked through the woods and I fell about it, 
Their heads, their heads were chopped off 

117
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:29,036
And hung in the trees. 
Their spine was separate from their body. 

118
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:35,816
I almost did it in my pants. 
I swear it. 

119
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:45,362
Even my father is not there. 
He bears his gun under the shower. 

120
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:50,816
That you do not, you idiot. 
-- This is so stupid. Come on, we go. 

121
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:54,855
Do you know where you are now? 

122
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:59,886
The camp stops to 
Cappy the backyard. 

123
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:09,683
We sit here all on the border. 
He notes its territory with death. 

124
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:18,672
He is chasing them, then felt they live. 
-- My God. That is repugnant. 

125
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:24,711
He is sick in his head. 
A dangerous fool. 

126
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:29,485
And now is that beer bottle 
On his property. 

127
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,560
He Tommy. 

128
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,581
Why will you not get friend. 

129
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:44,110
Oh no. Mikey That it does. 
He must get going. 

130
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,374
Nothing. 
Let Cappy the achievement. 

131
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:58,295
And now listen to those idiots 
Joe Harlow's kampvuurverhalen. 

132
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:08,075
Oh no. If your father knew this. 
-- Obligation to kiss me. 

133
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,788
Let everyone lifting his glass. 
-- Hopefully there will be something else this year. 

134
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,178
Actually, yes. It is new. 
Because this is our last year here. 

135
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:22,682
At the beginning of 
A new summer season. 

136
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,736
I would not deprive you of it. 

137
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,493
You guys are my family. 

138
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,984
I consider your children and mine. 

139
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:41,816
I see you women as mine. 
Hence those children. 

140
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,581
Since my Molly died are you the 
Most important people in my 

141
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,968
And Tommy's life. 
I love you all. 

142
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:59,350
I will never forget you. 
On women and lovers. 

143
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,356
That they never meet each other. 

144
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:09,906
Will I see you tomorrow? 
Maybe, but I am going to walk. 

145
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:13,617
That is what I told. 
-- Go you boys again bullying? 

146
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,604
I have to arrange something with Joe. 
That's it. Vlug. Dom. 

147
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,607
Something? 
It does not agree. But ... 

148
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:25,976
Have you already chosen school? 
-- Yes. 

149
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:29,909
Where? 
-- I think Agnes Scott 

150
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:37,141
You do not know where that is, right? 
It is in Athens Georgia. 

151
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,873
It is ... What? 
-- That is far away. 

152
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:41,825
Nietwaar. 
-- Far from New York City. Yes. 

153
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:46,113
I probably go to there. 
-- Am I not see you then? 

154
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:52,183
They seem to have fun. 
They are just children ... 

155
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,866
Going my question 
Even answer? 

156
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,498
Pa, I was shocked me a monkey. 
-- Go home, young. 

157
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:06,535
Why? I did nothing wrong. 
-- What happens here on? 

158
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,465
Why guild you, Dannie? 
He drove me fits like a glove. 

159
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:14,940
They were on the cushion and 
I took them apart. 

160
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:18,740
You always dastardly deed. 
What are you looking for anyway. 

161
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:23,911
You are like a hesitant fate. 

162
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:31,396
Okay. Back to the bungalow. 
We speak each other later. 

163
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:38,740
Will I see you tomorrow? Then move on. 
-- Continue? Continue with what? 

164
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:41,468
Dave, come. 
-- I love you in the eye. 

165
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:47,219
I am really glad that I have a son. 

166
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:54,095
Excuse? 
What are you doing on my bed? 

167
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,155
Silence. Lou sleeping. 
-- Since I do not at times. 

168
00:15:57,474 --> 00:16:02,315
What is all this? 
-- Goods for walking. Why? 

169
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:06,238
What you try to do? 
The burning forests? 

170
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:10,795
Ernie. We make only 
A small hike in the forest. 

171
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,834
They are not legeroefeningen. 

172
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,269
Stop it. 

173
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:39,227
Carmine. Waking up. 
We are going to trek. 

174
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,994
Everyone already waiting outside. 
Okay, I am awake. Ga. 

175
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,374
Dannie is outside. They want to talk. 
-- Say that I arrive there. 

176
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,493
Do you think we are going to a picnic? 
-- You know that I have quickly hunger. 

177
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,918
Here it is. 

178
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,984
Back home for the dark. 
-- Well, Mom. 

179
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:46,266
How is it going? Good sleep? 
You know that I have slept well. 

180
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,189
Come Loverboy 

181
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:53,501
Do you really? 
-- I have to go. 

182
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,298
Come on, brother. 

183
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,031
Why wear your geurtje that? 
Go bespringen her in the woods 

184
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:56,317
Hello therein. Mr. Cole. 
Billie Jo. Someone? 

185
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:10,431
Billie Jo. 

186
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:33,606
Clemmy. I was shocked me a monkey. 
What do you do. 

187
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:37,101
I came early to help your father. 

188
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,602
I am sorry, Clemmy. 
Mom had to go to town. 

189
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:46,137
Tonight they are back home. 
Come back tomorrow but. 

190
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:50,381
But I came early to your Dad to help. 
I came early. 

191
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,424
That, I know, Clemmy. 

192
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:58,943
Dad wants me in the store 
If he is not here. It is not now. 

193
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,066
But, I ... I ... 
-- Clemmy, not now. 

194
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:08,072
Okay, not now. And now? 

195
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,147
No Clemmy. Come back tomorrow. 

196
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:24,432
Come back tomorrow. 

197
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:30,991
No, no, Clemmy. 
-- No, no, not squeal. 

198
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:41,652
Billie Jo. Waking up. 
Do not sleep. 

199
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:56,192
Ladies, say goodbye to 
The yellow stone away. 

200
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:05,474
I believe it. Say it. 
-- I think the best you say. 

201
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:11,874
Goodbye. Bye 
-- That was good. 

202
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:35,557
My shoes are already quite dirty. 
-- Shoes? I told you to wear boots. 

203
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,416
Boots? Who is that? 
-- I wear boots. 

204
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:42,104
Reverse. 
-- Obligation. 

205
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:47,890
We walk for a while. 

206
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,525
What is this? 
Haarlak on a hike? 

207
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:03,094
Bemoei you with your own affairs. 
I want my hair well soon. 

208
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,397
So good, huh? 
-- Jaja. 

209
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,018
Keep my stuff. 

210
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,091
Now. 

211
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:27,263
Here we go again. 
-- What does that mean? 

212
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:31,841
This is done every summer. 
-- I would no longer play the game. 

213
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:35,768
Will someone tell me 
What is happening? 

214
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,669
Tommy. Put the sandwich route 
And to come here. 

215
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,092
You know that I am always tired word. 

216
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:50,831
Did I do not think they would do? 
-- Yes. What do? 

217
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,972
Come on boys. Let me back. 

218
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:58,190
Damn Tommy. 
If you are afraid than just go back. 

219
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,337
Come on. We are looking for them. 

220
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:08,999
Good. I will only be back. 

221
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,050
Wait for me. 

222
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:23,324
Is it, Billie Jo? 

223
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:28,352
You are not tired, huh? 
Are you tired? 

224
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,307
Clemmy provides for you. 

225
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,876
Do you love forests? 
Do you love trees? 

226
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:44,071
Wait until Luke AR and see what I 
Brought as a partygirl. 

227
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,205
Where are they? 

228
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,066
Vertraag. Tommy, well ... 

229
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,557
My sandwich. 

230
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,336
How funny is this? 
-- I am sorry, Mikey. 

231
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,841
Where are they headed? 

232
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,735
How did you change the river crossing? 
-- Look to the right. 

233
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:24,643
Come on girls. Are you? 

234
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,439
Come boys. We go back. 
You had to the bungalow should continue. 

235
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:37,482
Are you ready? Yes or no. 
-- Yes, let's do this. Come on. 

236
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,379
Come boys. We go back. 

237
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,640
If you do not 
We do not. 

238
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,149
I would not do this. 
-- And then? 

239
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,572
Come Louis. 

240
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:12,949
Come Tommy. Come vetzak. 
It is doing well. 

241
00:25:14,718 --> 00:25:15,718
You are there, man. 
-- Yes. 

242
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:23,187
What? He threw his sandwich away. 

243
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:31,000
You are concerned. 
I am proud of you. 

244
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,776
Boasting me? 
-- I am proud of you. Come here. 

245
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,963
Let us take a path. 
-- Obligation of the same and let's go for a walk. 

246
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:50,773
Where to go? Which way? 

247
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:53,985
Along here? 
-- Along here. Does not matter. 

248
00:25:58,395 --> 00:26:00,955
What do you mean? 
If you play with us? 

249
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,212
Here it is. 

250
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,153
Where do we go? 

251
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,547
Where are we? 
-- I do not know. 

252
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,344
On the other side of the river. 

253
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:24,355
There is no path. 
How do we get back? 

254
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:31,366
What's that? 
-- A compass. 

255
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:34,256
Points to the north, east, 
South and the west. 

256
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:35,523
For if you lost. 

257
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,546
That does not help you, idiot. 
It is true, Joe. 

258
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:42,155
Where is the camp, Einstein? 

259
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,593
Sorry, in the other direction. 

260
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:54,375
See you next time for compass 
You leave so you teruggeraakt. 

261
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:12,764
It's creepy. 
-- So it is not on the other side. 

262
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,720
Where farmer who leads us go? 

263
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:34,816
Wake up, please. 
Sleep. Wake up, Billie Jo. 

264
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,282
Waking up. 

265
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:00,315
What do you think here? 

266
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,100
Who lives in that cabin? 

267
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,660
Cappy. 

268
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:13,606
What? 

269
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,212
Cappy. 

270
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:35,980
Beat, beat, beat. 

271
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:43,691
Where is he going? 

272
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,400
What was that? 

273
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:55,358
Someone pulled Joe inside. 
He stood before the window. 

274
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,313
There will be somebody. 

275
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:24,055
Let us do away with that. 
I am afraid. 

276
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,874
Buk you. 
My brother is there. 

277
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:37,783
Billie Jo, wake up. 
Do not sleep. Wake up. 

278
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:56,062
What did you do, boy? 
-- I do not know, Dad. 

279
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:04,989
Everything is good, Clemmy. 
Everything works out. 

280
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:32,498
Walking! 
Wegwezen! 

281
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,983
To where should we? 
-- What should we do? 

282
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:52,166
Damn! Since he is. 
-- To where? 

283
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:15,482
I am concerned. 
-- Show. Where? 

284
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,918
In my face. 
-- Okay. Kalmeer now. 

285
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:12,839
We go. 

286
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:22,628
I am afraid. 
-- Obligation, Tommy. 

287
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,637
Maybe we need to rest. 
-- Yes, maybe he is right. 

288
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:39,700
To where do we? 
-- How should I know now? 

289
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,876
Perhaps old who wanted only waylay us. 
Maybe he does us nothing. 

290
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:51,090
He almost shot my head off. 
He almost killed Mikey. 

291
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:53,492
And you still think 
That he is not believed. 

292
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:57,993
Are you here. You will then see. 
-- Let him rest assured. 

293
00:32:58,153 --> 00:33:00,917
Obligation! 
-- Boys. Joe is still there. 

294
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,824
I need to know where we are. 

295
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:18,093
Luke, that you make here. 
-- I come, Dad. 

296
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:21,040
Do you sometimes they fall your brother. 
-- Certainly not. 

297
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:23,353
Get in the truck. 

298
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,041
Do not worry. 
We leave you no one decline. 

299
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,432
Five-minute breaks. 

300
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:06,833
Ernie. Not moving. 

301
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:24,673
I want you right move. 
-- So? 

302
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,475
Ready? 

303
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:41,561
Jump from the road. 
Wegwezen. 

304
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:05,614
I have an idea. 
Ernie, give me your knife. 

305
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,054
I hear a truck. 

306
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,535
Take that away with you. Now. 
I follow you very much. 

307
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:30,617
Ga. Ga. 

308
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,846
Behind them. Vlug. 

309
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:11,270
They are escapes. 
-- Obligation. 

310
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:17,725
Yes. But they are in the vicinity. 
I can smell them. 

311
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:02,600
It's okay. 
Sta. 

312
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:09,233
Wait. I have an idea. 

313
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:16,332
If we work ignited 
See the whole camp us. 

314
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:20,568
And Cappy. 
-- I know. That must be true. 

315
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:25,473
Are you crazy? 
-- No. If Cappy comes out of his cab 

316
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,651
The cabin is empty. Yes? 
-- Okay. And then? 

317
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:32,622
There will still be a phone, 
A radio or something else? 

318
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:35,552
You are right. 
Then, we can also find Joe. 

319
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:39,380
We would have them 
Be able to slow down. 

320
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,843
I know how we doing? 
Come on. 

321
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,573
I am a bit worried 
On the boys. 

322
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:25,875
It is already late and 
They are not yet back. 

323
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:30,162
You have to be worried. 
-- They are right. They are long gone. 

324
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:33,755
This is work 

325
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,521
You know what you should do. 
You have only one chance. 

326
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:39,301
Notice that he flies straight up. 
-- Good. 

327
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,787
They send a signal. 

328
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:08,459
That can only open on the spot. 
Come we go. 

329
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:15,176
There is something wrong. 
-- That was great. 

330
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:17,903
This should anyone seen to be believed. 

331
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,465
Bend. 

332
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,735
I hear no ... 
-- Tommy. Obligation still.

333
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:31,885
Wegwezen.

334
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:56,420
There they are. 

335
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:17,440
Come boy. You should also help. 
These boys are smarter than I thought. 

336
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,940
How do you mean? 
-- They hunt now on us. 

337
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,372
Deputy Jefferson. 
How can I help you? 

338
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:28,927
I think that my sons 
And their friends at risk. 

339
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:31,695
Why? What danger? 
They are in the woods. 

340
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:35,249
She shot a vuurpijl. 
You have probably seen it. 

341
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,749
I want someone there. 
My husband and the other fathers 

342
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,577
, The boys search. 
-- I want you calms. 

343
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:48,886
The police should be here. 
We stay in the bungalows. 

344
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:52,942
Wait. 
Sandy, please do so even. 

345
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,531
How can I help. 
-- I would like to speak sheriff. 

346
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,930
It is urgent. 
I stay in the bungalows Mayfield. 

347
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:07,863
My sons and their friends 
In danger. They are in the woods. 

348
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,993
Find the sheriff and go to 
Mayfield bungalows. 

349
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,300
Why? 
-- There are children missing in the woods. 

350
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:23,883
Kalmeer. We are dealing with it. 
Begin at the beginning. I want all the details. 

351
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,780
This can only better be important. 
I think so. 

352
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:07,053
I am sheriff Demarco. 
What is the problem? 

353
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:11,944
Our children are in the woods. 
It is dark and late. We are worried. 

354
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:14,633
I want everyone calms. 

355
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:20,654
It is not because they are for a while 
Missing that they are at risk. 

356
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:28,354
You remain here. I go inside 
And will sign it. 

357
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,355
Caution. 
-- Success. 

358
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:24,339
You look out for Cappy. 
I stand here not to be murdered. 

359
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:30,478
That will not happen. 
You see the best of all of us. 

360
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,419
Do you really see that I do best? 
-- Yes, I think. 

361
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,700
Calm boys. 

362
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:51,772
Do it light. 

363
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:58,310
It stinks here. 
-- Look at the door. 

364
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:05,947
What's wrong with that light? 

365
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,439
Joe is not here. 
Where can he have left? 

366
00:44:10,575 --> 00:44:11,561
I do not know. 

367
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:14,681
What's that stench? 
-- I do not know. 

368
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:17,927
I think we should leave. 
-- Learn. 

369
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,243
Look in the other room. 
-- Okay. 

370
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:29,931
They are urban children. 
-- They can not survive in the woods. 

371
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:34,360
Is Joe Harlow to them? 
-- Yes. And then? 

372
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:39,345
Then there is not a problem. 
He knows the region as his pocket. 

373
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,204
What's going on inside? 

374
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:03,430
A twin of five years, 
Sons of master Edwin Smith 

375
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:07,123
Be found alive behind 
A wreck of a car. 

376
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:12,347
Their mother, Margareth Smith was signed on 
Three yards from the car. 

377
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:14,210
She has not survived the accident. 

378
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:19,191
One child had severe brain damage. 
The other was found safe and sound. 

379
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,339
What? 
-- Come here. 

380
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:25,475
Is that blood? 
-- I do not know. 

381
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:29,883
What's happened here. 
-- I do not know. 

382
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:44,756
Boys. Cappy is there. He does. 
-- What? 

383
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:50,454
Everyone! 

384
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:00,299
We must find those children. 

385
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:06,311
You have to kill and leave 
For the buzzards and coyotes. 

386
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:12,156
Luke, you are along there. We follow it. 
-- Okay. I collect those bastards did. 

387
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:32,199
There is not yet a problem. 
-- Still no? What does that mean? 

388
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:38,062
To where do we? 
-- I do not know. 

389
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:47,089
As this. We have heard these shots. 
This we have heard. Geweerschoten. 

390
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:52,288
Come Lou. Almost you. 

391
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:00,633
I think my leg is broken. 

392
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,646
I bowl. 
-- No. 

393
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:37,324
Who said that their son had fireworks? 
-- My son Ernie. Why? 

394
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:41,882
Because that sounds like fireworks. 
Do you think not? 

395
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:45,141
I think so. 
-- How do you know the difference? 

396
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:52,397
I lost my whole life all around weapons. 
I know the difference now is. 

397
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,752
You could see a little more 
Meevoelend. 

398
00:47:57,996 --> 00:48:03,092
You know that the geweerschoten. 
-- Do you think that I do not know. 

399
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:10,257
Call Freddy. Say that he is preparing. 
Say that we have a major problem. 

400
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:19,164
I am waiting here on my men. 
Okay? Come on. 

401
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,675
Is it? Is it? 

402
00:48:52,254 --> 00:48:55,165
Goes with him? 
-- They did. 

403
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:00,127
Will someone water? 
-- I want to say something. 

404
00:49:10,064 --> 00:49:13,796
Listen. Drink some water. 
-- What is, Ernie? 

405
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,985
Nothing. Let him rest assured. 

406
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,107
Where is Louis? 

407
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:25,858
Yes. Where is Louis? 

408
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,977
What happened? 

409
00:49:31,547 --> 00:49:35,496
Louis is dead. 
Slain by Cappy's son. 

410
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:44,086
What are we going to do? 
-- I must vomiting. 

411
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:47,890
We never get this way. 
We will all die. 

412
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:53,093
I want to return to the bungalows ... 
-- Kalmeer! You must remain calm. 

413
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:59,661
So next we will survive. 
We remain calm and we kill them. 

414
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:03,188
Otherwise they kill us. 
Deaths? With what? 

415
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:06,933
Whatever it asks of us. 
Whether we are dead. 

416
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:11,309
We have to be here. 
It is not safe here. That you know. 

417
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,501
We must find a shelter. 
We need you. Okay? 

418
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:15,212
We are gone. Come on. 

419
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:25,519
Jefferson refers to a major problem. 
-- Apparently. 

420
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:29,183
What is the situation? 
-- There are six children missing. 

421
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:33,047
They are the bungalows here. 
I heard geweerschoten 

422
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,950
I want to know who is shooting 
And from where it comes. 

423
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:38,255
Good? 
-- Included. 

424
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,091
Bubba. 
-- Yes. 

425
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,070
Go you with Jefferson and a few men. 
Beginning in the north. 

426
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:47,015
Willie. You still with me. 
I take the west. 

427
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:51,871
What should I do? 
All roads and trails to explore. 

428
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:56,109
We meet on the north 
Of riverbed. 

429
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:06,624
I do not understand something. 

430
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:14,519
Why is it, what we do, where we 
Also, that they always find us. 

431
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:17,197
We must continue to move. 

432
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,716
If we inaction, we 
Schietschijven. That you know. Okay? 

433
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,936
You must help him. I have to help him. 
We must help them now. 

434
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,752
Come Tommy. 
We should do this. We go. 

435
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,751
Here. We go. 
Come on. I have you. 

436
00:51:36,877 --> 00:51:38,482
Here is the riverbed. 

437
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:46,578
We have forests out operation. Nothing. 
-- They are crossing, Bubba. 

438
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:50,407
Take the men and several trucks. 
Search on the other side. 

439
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,863
Call and tell Freddy 
He met me at Cappy. 

440
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:57,489
I cross over here with Willie 
And go on foot until Cappy. 

441
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,293
Jefferson. We go. 

442
00:52:01,597 --> 00:52:02,947
To trucks. 

443
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:06,538
Do you have that book? 
-- That you weggesmeten. 

444
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:09,324
That other book. 
-- Yes. 

445
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:21,133
That's it. 
This building we. 

446
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:26,181
I want beautiful, large branches. 
We cover us with it. 

447
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,786
Make sure it is fixed. 
-- Okay. 

448
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:15,155
Stick with the radio. 
Freddy. Come on. 

449
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:35,579
What's up, Cappy? 
-- Good evening, sheriff. 

450
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:41,046
What's with all that blood? 
-- I just caught a large beast. 

451
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:50,384
Were that the shots we heard? 
-- Yes. I had to shoot a few times. 

452
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:53,769
Come in if you look like. 

453
00:53:56,214 --> 00:53:59,216
Could you not wait until tomorrow 
To see the documents in heels. 

454
00:53:59,326 --> 00:54:01,753
It stinks as a hoerenkot. 

455
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:07,845
There are some missing children. 
They have the river crossing. 

456
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:12,063
Have you seen someone. 
-- I was out hunting. I have seen no one. 

457
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,119
Hunting? In the dark? 

458
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:21,170
I have the eyes of an eagle 
And the smell of a grizzly. 

459
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:26,222
I smell everything from a mile away. 
I have no light. 

460
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,149
Let me speak with your boys. 
Are they here? 

461
00:54:31,324 --> 00:54:36,039
They are not here. 
I send them along tomorrow. 

462
00:54:36,096 --> 00:54:37,322
That is not necessary. 

463
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:41,459
If I do not find children for tomorrow 
Jefferson to send me here tomorrow. 

464
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,443
For me okay. 

465
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:25,513
Klootzakken. We need those guys 
For the sheriff it does. 

466
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,454
Come boy. 
We go on hunting. 

467
00:55:56,434 --> 00:56:01,275
They have him slain. 
They have poor Louis slain. 

468
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:27,112
Are those birds that sing to each other? 
-- No. They are. They give signals. 

469
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:28,475
How do you know that? 

470
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:33,001
Because birds at night not sing. 

471
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,673
And owls that? Those are also birds? 
-- Owls sing. They call. 

472
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,489
Thank God that he is not seen. 
-- Yes. 

473
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:27,270
What do you mean? 
-- I must urination. 

474
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,834
Plas then. 
I was shocked me a hat. 

475
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:58,522
Boys. 

476
00:59:12,931 --> 00:59:17,675
Hey. Bardus bosbewoner. 
Here I am. 

477
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:04,357
Come on. Pak him. 
Attention to the leg. 

478
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:18,804
They duwden me. It is their fault. 

479
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:24,782
Are you okay. Do not worry. 
I get that a patch. 

480
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:34,927
Be careful with him. 
-- I have him. 

481
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:45,815
The bastard has me concerned. 
-- Let me see. 

482
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:51,010
Good. It seems to be good. 
Connect him. 

483
01:00:59,229 --> 01:01:01,618
I can not oppose. 

484
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:08,914
Attention. 

485
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:13,434
To come along. 
-- I understand this is not. 

486
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:18,052
Wherever we go. They always find us. 
The north. It south. 

487
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:23,190
Did you hear him sniffing in the air? 
-- Yes. Why would that be? 

488
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:26,923
They smell your geurtje. 
As they find us. 

489
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:31,073
They can smell a mile away. 
They are boerenpummels. 

490
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:36,556
Do it off. Please. 
-- Why should I do that, vetzak. 

491
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,639
Listen. Please forgive me. 
The road. The road. 

492
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,972
The road ran to the cabin. 
Along that road, we can perhaps gone. 

493
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:48,121
But where is Cappy's cabin? 

494
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:54,597
I do not know. But if we 
Continue walking, we find they are. 

495
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,397
Okay. Along here. 

496
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:02,380
Goes with him? 
How does it. Please forgive me. 

497
01:02:30,726 --> 01:02:32,418
Keep moving. Come on. 

498
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:40,112
From here we split. 
-- We are looking for all the whole night. 

499
01:02:40,246 --> 01:02:43,837
We are tired. 
-- We want to rest. What should we do? 

500
01:02:47,576 --> 01:02:49,503
I will say what we are going to do. 

501
01:02:51,544 --> 01:02:55,524
Anyone who would like to, may continue. 
Because you are tired. 

502
01:02:55,634 --> 01:03:02,899
But first get your new schedule. The 
Next six months, nights and weekends. 

503
01:03:03,027 --> 01:03:05,610
How sounds that, Willie? 
-- Not good. 

504
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:08,467
That I thought too. 

505
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,750
It is morning. 
The boys are still missing. 

506
01:03:12,814 --> 01:03:17,176
Nobody leaves before we 
They have found. Understand each other? 

507
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:27,653
Go to Cappy's. Speak with Luke and Clem. 
Ask those who have seen boys. 

508
01:03:31,214 --> 01:03:34,897
What is happening? 
Sam says Billie Jo missing. 

509
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,376
Oh no. Not even one. 

510
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:41,828
What is the problem? 
-- It is my Billie Jo. 

511
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:44,735
She was not at home last night. 
I am really worried. 

512
01:03:45,736 --> 01:03:46,977
Reverse. 

513
01:03:49,149 --> 01:03:53,104
If we find nothing in the coming hours, 
I send one of my men. 

514
01:03:56,715 --> 01:04:00,647
We go. We divide us. 
Some of Bubba. 

515
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:04,466
Freddy. Take you the rest. 
Okay? 

516
01:04:16,362 --> 01:04:18,164
That is the truck. 

517
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,871
We have walked in circles. 
We should mark the trees. 

518
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:24,714
Do not worry. 
The road is somewhere in the vicinity. 

519
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:31,009
We need a radio in it. 
-- Let us have a look. 

520
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:56,364
Deputy Jefferson. Who is this? 
What's your name, boy. 

521
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,883
Where are you? 
-- In the woods. We need help. 

522
01:05:04,259 --> 01:05:06,924
Help please. 
-- Carmine. There will be somebody. 

523
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:10,411
There will be somebody. 

524
01:05:21,135 --> 01:05:22,888
Hello? Hello? 

525
01:05:46,131 --> 01:05:49,536
He idiot! Here I am. 

526
01:05:57,813 --> 01:06:00,210
You speak with the police. 
Answer, boy. 

527
01:06:07,766 --> 01:06:09,480
Cappy is there. 

528
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:42,115
Can you hear me? 

529
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:10,371
He breathes not. 
I think he is dead. 

530
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,623
Where is Carmine? 

531
01:07:19,777 --> 01:07:22,772
On the flight for that heikneuter 
With a scar. 

532
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:37,015
Poor. You are a bad boy. 
You showed me my brother hurt. 

533
01:07:42,036 --> 01:07:43,118
Sta law. 

534
01:08:35,385 --> 01:08:39,730
What happened? Is it? 
-- Are you okay? Wait. 

535
01:08:39,874 --> 01:08:43,256
They did. We go. 

536
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:49,566
He comes back right. 

537
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:29,449
NO ACCESS 

538
01:09:48,056 --> 01:09:51,337
I thought he was here. 
-- He was there. I swear it. 

539
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:54,258
I hit him on his head 
With a wrench. 

540
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:57,220
We must find him. 
We have to finish. 

541
01:09:57,314 --> 01:10:02,305
We must find a way. 
What can we Cappy care. 

542
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:04,108
We must no longer continue. 

543
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:07,556
Cappy still alive. 

544
01:10:07,685 --> 01:10:12,213
Do you really think he will stop when he notes 
What we have done with his children. 

545
01:10:12,269 --> 01:10:15,432
We must find him 
Before he finds us. 

546
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,915
I have another plan. 

547
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:56,879
Are you here? 
It is deputy Jefferson. 

548
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:20,550
Here is a body. 
-- Luke. The son of Cappy. 

549
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,606
Willie. Give me a radio. 

550
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:07,582
Where are you? 

551
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,980
They need us anyway 
Already search meantime? 

552
01:12:42,665 --> 01:12:44,695
We need to lure him in the fall. 

553
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:49,554
It is certainly true. He must think 
Us that he has to deal with 

554
01:12:51,004 --> 01:12:53,431
This is perfect. An open plain. 

555
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,835
If we get him here 
He is ours. 

556
01:12:58,721 --> 01:12:59,928
Let us do it. 

557
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:12,202
<i> If you can hear me </ i> 

558
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:14,919
Stay away from Cappy's cabin 
Until we are there. 

559
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:19,009
<i> We have a son 
Cappy dead </ i>. 

560
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:24,787
Kill those boys. Then the sheriff. 
Kill those boys. Then the sheriff. 

561
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:41,649
That's it. Find what sticks and 
Start digging. 

562
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,015
Make a pit. 

563
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:04,220
The arrow sticks by his mouth. 
He went through there. 

564
01:15:05,664 --> 01:15:08,102
I wonder who has done this? 

565
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:12,670
I do not know. But if we 
Cappy, we find the boys. 

566
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,523
Get a cloth. 

567
01:15:33,263 --> 01:15:38,394
My boys. 
My boys. 

568
01:16:10,694 --> 01:16:14,283
How to get there? 
Of those boerenpummel. 

569
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:16,038
I am back immediately. 
Keep digging. 

570
01:16:35,436 --> 01:16:37,665
Now there would be someone 
Still have to get something. 

571
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,945
I would like twigs and branches. 
We need to cover. 

572
01:16:41,019 --> 01:16:42,490
I do it very much. 

573
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,278
Do not go too far that you are not lost. 

574
01:18:18,422 --> 01:18:21,991
He is dead! 
Damn! He is dead! 

575
01:18:44,218 --> 01:18:48,674
<i> Ladies, say goodbye to 
The yellow stone away. </ I> 

576
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:56,980
<i> I never saw so many trees. 
It is really fine. </ I> 

577
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:04,880
<i> Ga not too far that you are not lost. </ I> 

578
01:19:07,177 --> 01:19:08,849
You know what, Cap? 

579
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:13,019
It's all over. 

580
01:19:14,073 --> 01:19:15,330
It's all over. 

581
01:19:28,612 --> 01:19:30,914
We need to figure out 
How we should go. 

582
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,493
We go back to there. Ga. 

583
01:19:42,794 --> 01:19:47,205
Where are you! Show yourself! 

584
01:19:48,168 --> 01:19:50,793
I killed your sons. 

585
01:19:51,384 --> 01:19:54,312
I am waiting for you to open. 

586
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:02,672
Straight on, boys. 

587
01:21:09,813 --> 01:21:12,771
You can not run away from me! 

588
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:18,194
You can not hide for me! 

589
01:21:21,988 --> 01:21:26,507
I am the law! 

590
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:34,333
It is not yet over! 

591
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:42,012
Now it's over! 

592
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:17,253
What will you do now? 
Who made you so mad? 

593
01:22:21,544 --> 01:22:24,054
Bring the children of the forest. 

594
01:22:24,288 --> 01:22:26,709
Their parents are waiting for them. 
-- Okay. 

595
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:28,425
I see them. 

596
01:22:28,765 --> 01:22:33,350
Ernie. There is Tommy. 
I see Carmine. 

597
01:22:35,257 --> 01:22:38,445
Are you all right, son? 
Thanks. 

598
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:43,234
Come here. Come on. 

599
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:46,184
What has happened to you been? 
Let me take a look. 

600
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:52,119
Where is Louis? Death? 

601
01:23:01,397 --> 01:23:02,961
Where is Michael? 

602
01:23:03,715 --> 01:23:06,743
How do you mean 'they do not know. " 
Where is Michael? 

603
01:23:06,744 --> 01:23:08,349
Where is Michael? 

604
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,289
Has anyone seen Michael? 

605
01:23:14,433 --> 01:23:15,649
I want my son ... 

606
01:23:35,118 --> 01:23:37,870
Answer <i> Freddy. 
What happens there? </ I> 

607
01:23:39,691 --> 01:23:43,339
We have the body of Jefferson. 
Without head. 

608
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:49,372
We have Joe Harlow and daughter 
Sam Cole. Both dead. 

609
01:23:49,714 --> 01:23:51,682
<i> God almighty. </ I> 

610
01:23:52,012 --> 01:23:56,456
Something I never saw. 
Even not in the film. 

611
01:23:57,925 --> 01:24:00,024
<i> Is the body of Clem already found? </ I> 

612
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:02,115
No. Not yet. 

613
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:04,541
Best <i> that we will begin searching. </ I> 

614
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:06,903
<i> According to the boys he is dead </ i> 

615
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:09,810
We will start immediately to search. 

616
01:24:23,193 --> 01:24:25,018
The son of Cappy still alive. 

617
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:29,249
What are you talking about? 
Cappy has no sons. 

618
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,527
You had a dream. 

619
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:35,548
We go. 

620
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:44,860
I will go nowhere today. 
I remain in bed. 

621
