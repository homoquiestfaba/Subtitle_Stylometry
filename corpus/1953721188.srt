1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,654
Selling love will make you rich.

2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,294
That's what my mother taught me.

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,411
Just don't put your heart in it.

4
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:49,338
Eight!

5
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:50,526
Seven!

6
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:51,682
Six!

7
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:52,832
Five!

8
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,050
Four!

9
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,269
Three!

10
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,496
Two!

11
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,621
One!

12
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,856
Happy New Year!

13
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,370
Happy fucking New Year!

14
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,730
You know, this is the greatest
country in the world.

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,638
And I'm the luckiest guy in the world
.

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,910
Sit your asses down and I'll tell you why.

17
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:42,257
What is this great country shit?

18
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:46,075
You know, hafalong Bontempo,
fresh off the Jersey prairie.

19
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,620
Get up here, Alana.

20
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,865
Come here!

21
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,180
This here is the greatest revenue generator
machine in the world.

22
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:02,121
Is better than gold!

23
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,732
You don't get your nails
dirty digging for it.

24
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:07,911
And the Good Lord just keeps
making more and more of it.

25
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,131
There's no business like
whore business!

26
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,209
I say, you've shown them enough.

27
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,406
Let's have some fun,
back in the swing...

28
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,593
Jay, put that music on, come on!

29
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,460
Wait a minute! Hold on!

30
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,624
I wanna make a toast!

31
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,850
Charlie, come back up here!

32
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:31,093
Charlie don't get mad,
but everybody knows...

33
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:34,671
That you ain't nothing
without your better half.

34
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,571
Now, she sprained her knee...

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,499
Bad, and she's kind of shy,
but if we ask real nice...

36
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,197
I'm staying right here!

37
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,455
Grace, it's New Year for crying out loud!
Come on up here!

38
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,258
You heard me.
I'm doing orientation, okay?

39
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,639
Someone's got to work around here.

40
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:58,171
- Hey, hold this.
- Ok.

41
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,615
My third leg!

42
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,558
You think I'd forgive you, Charlie?

43
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:40,421
Happy New Year!

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,518
The first kiss of the New Year!

45
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,349
Grace!

46
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:56,978
Samantha.

47
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,290
Ok, baby, I got to go.

48
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,408
Warren.

49
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,154
Happy New Year everybody!

50
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:08,513
Hi, happy New Year! Let's see that music!
Hope everybody have a good time!

51
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:09,834
Come on!

52
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,772
OK, soldier! At ease!

53
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,893
This bitch won't give
me what I want!

54
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,327
He said that he wanted it
just like in Saigon!

55
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,109
Yeah, just like in Saigon!!

56
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,055
OK, put your clothes on,
I'll buy you a drink. Come on!

57
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,614
- I ain't leaving till I get what I paid for.
- You didn’t paid for a shit!

58
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,013
- Well, I'm taking it anyway.
- Warren!

59
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,719
Pay attention Warren,
he's got a knife!

60
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,559
He's got a knife!

61
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,805
Get out, bastard!

62
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,483
Get out! Get out!

63
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,239
Get back, you!

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,031
- You're Okay?
- I'm fine!

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,079
Get back!

66
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,719
- I'll cut you!
- Hey. Calm. Easy.

67
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,524
- I'll cut you!
- Take it easy, take it easy. Hold up.

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,128
Get back!

69
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:20,661
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine Charlie, I'm sorry.

70
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,711
He fucking cut you, he?

71
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,992
I ruined my fucking guitar, Willie Nelson
gave me that fucking guitar!

72
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,726
Charlie... you're okay?

73
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,015
I'm fine honey, how are you,
you all right, you okay?

74
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,085
- Oh shit!
- What a way to start the new year!

75
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:34,675
Johnny boy, get him out of here,
will you please?

76
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:38,334
Come on folks! Don't let this
hold up the party. We got a lot...

77
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:40,507
Will! Will! Drinks from the house!

78
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,877
You hear that? Drinks from the house!

79
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:45,803
Happy New Year!

80
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,913
Happy New Year!
What a way to start the fucking new year.

81
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,453
- Oh, Charlie, I'm exhausted.
- I'm fucking tired too.

82
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,041
- I'm going to bed.
- That sounds like a good idea.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,461
But...

84
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,219
I do have to go have a drink
with the fucking manager of the Eldorado.

85
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,179
Shit! Maybe I could...

86
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,250
No, I gotta go. I gotta go.

87
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,985
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

88
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:13,514
Rio? Pay the band.

89
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,913
Hey, honey bun!

90
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,015
I waited all night for this honey...

91
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm falling apart, like this stupid town.

92
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,992
More tests, a second opinion?

93
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,710
I could be wrong.

94
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,695
You are not wrong.

95
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,871
You have options,
it's not a death sentence.

96
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,890
There are breakthroughs in
cancer research every day.

97
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,312
I'm not telling Charlie.

98
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,492
He doesn't like bad news,
not before dinner.

99
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:58,646
Speak of the devil...
My chariot.

100
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:08,172
So, what are you sick or some?
Why did you go to the fucking doctor for?

101
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,100
- Yearly check up.
- Uh!

102
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,438
Where are we going? Charlie I want
to go home, I got a headache.

103
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,313
No, no, no! We're going to see
that fighter I told you about.

104
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:17,665
What fighter?

105
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,416
The fighter!
Don't you fucking listen to me?

106
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,134
I must have told you
nine times!

107
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,484
You remember that fighter
Armando Bruza I told you about?

108
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,281
Who?

109
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:28,444
Armando Bruza, the Argentinian fighter,
I saw him gambling.

110
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,047
He was loosing,
I bailed him out.

111
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,741
Oh, not again!

112
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,951
What is this place?

113
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,838
It's where the fighters train.

114
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:48,351
- I'm staying in the car.
- No you're not. This is not just any fighter,

115
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,611
This is our fighter, we own him!

116
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,046
Get your ass out of the car, Grace.

117
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,830
Well. I'm not going anywhere
if you wear that hat.

118
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,510
This hat cost me 300, baby.

119
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,822
Who do you think you're,
Clint Eastwood?

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,195
Who do you think you're,
the Queen of fucking England?

121
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,440
Flesh!

122
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,551
I'm a sucker for it, honey.

123
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:18,572
How come everyone of this places smells
like they got a body floating in the pool?

124
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,393
Ah, I love this shit, baby.

125
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,376
Charlie, you don't need me here.

126
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,588
Hey, Grace!

127
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,229
You are my wife, ain't you?

128
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:26,518
Ah? Listen to me.

129
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:28,433
This here Bruza is not a nobo.

130
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,783
He fought Joe Frazier
and Muhammad Ali.

131
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,900
And he gave them full time,

132
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,462
And he is ranked fifth in the world
in the heavyweight division.

133
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:37,424
And I got a two night fight for him
coming at the Auditorium.

134
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:41,897
And after that, I'm gonna give him
a rematch with Muhammad Ali.

135
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,733
Oh, Charlie, not again.

136
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:46,270
Hey Grace! Don't give me that
"Charlie not again" bullshit!

137
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:48,257
You know, come on honey,
you know what this means?

138
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,033
This is gonna be reporters here
from all over the country.

139
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:54,014
And you know me baby,
I get my fucking hands on those guys.

140
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,240
Then it ain't gonna be anybody in whole
world didn’t hear about the Love Ranch.

141
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:00,741
The Love Ranch.
Sugar, come on baby, we're gonna be famous.

142
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,459
Come on, you can do this..

143
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:03,836
Hey Prado!

144
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,444
Good you could came down.

145
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:09,608
- Ms. Bontempo, Hernan Prado.
- Hi.

146
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,279
So glad to meet you.

147
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:12,803
How does he look?

148
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,381
This guy Colter, he
don't punch much.

149
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,227
Armando beat him easy.

150
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,319
Had better.

151
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:20,287
I'm talking to Ali's people,
they're interested.

152
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,600
Bruza! Hey!

153
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,195
- My man!
- Hey!

154
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:25,959
Charlie!

155
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:27,633
Charlie Good Time!

156
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,163
Looking good!

157
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,092
You bringing any of those
chiquitas with you, he?

158
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,216
Those smoking hot putas?

159
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:37,154
- Calma te.
- She's my wife.

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,974
- What?
- My wife is here.

161
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,537
- Su esposa
- Oh, your wife...

162
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,446
Quite a head of hair
you got there...

163
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,488
Mucho caveza, si!

164
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,496
Like the Beatles.

165
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:54,839
But you know...

166
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,145
In my country...

167
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,856
I'm more famous than
any fucking Beatle.

168
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:02,749
I am more loved than Perón
and his bitch wife, eh?

169
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,207
Come on in here, honey bun.

170
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:08,136
Come on, Grace.
He ain’t gonna bite you.

171
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,035
I am Bruza...

172
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,902
The Wild Bull of the Pampas.

173
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,569
Fantastic to meet you,
Ms. Good Time.

174
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,847
Pleasure is all mine.

175
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,729
Okay, come on out, girls.

176
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,385
Samantha Snow...

177
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,807
Irene...

178
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,173
Alana...

179
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,042
Christina.

180
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,168
You.

181
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,335
You.

182
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:11,862
You.

183
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,150
Yes ma’am.

184
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:18,564
That one there.

185
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,063
Okay.

186
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,484
That, you know...

187
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,749
Thank you very much!

188
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:24,484
Have a wonderful time!

189
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:34,514
Oh, go on, oh!

190
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,895
Oh, why are you stopping?

191
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:37,875
Quiet!

192
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,636
So last night, I had this guy...

193
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:49,530
So we had this straight kind of set up
and halfway through he says...

194
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,412
He wants the back door.

195
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,858
You know me, I'm like: "Sure!"

196
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,570
"But... we need to renegotiate."

197
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:59,399
They always want
something for nothing.

198
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,549
They think we gonna forget all
of that in the heat of passion.

199
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,163
You were in my room!

200
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,881
You're blocking the TV.
Could you move?

201
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,367
You went into my room,
and you stole my Quaaludes.

202
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:13,647
I know it was you.

203
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,116
I went into your room!

204
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,639
My God, I didn’t take your
fucking Quaaludes, Ok?

205
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,082
You probably took them,
and you don't remember...

206
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,687
Give them back...

207
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,147
Or I may tell Charlie.

208
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:28,693
Oh no!

209
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,059
She is gonna tell Charlie!

210
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,799
What shall I do?

211
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,448
You're fucking kidding me,
are you not?

212
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,094
Yesterday was New Year, Georgia girl.

213
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:43,115
See, Charlie he got a real short
attention span.

214
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,305
Short dick span too.

215
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,114
Has he made you do
that dog thing yet?

216
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,397
Kind of like get up
like this and you bark...

217
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,413
Hey, when I did, he was real nice.
He let me keep the collar!

218
00:14:58,488 --> 00:14:59,238
Shut up!

219
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,905
I still get it and I wear it
sometimes, it's cute.

220
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:04,819
All right, you fucking cunts!

221
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,217
Charlie and I are together,
he says he loves me.

222
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,951
He loves you...

223
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,670
So sweet!

224
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,772
You're a fucking moron,
get the fuck out of the way.

225
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,038
- Bitch!
- What?

226
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,670
Fuck! You ruined my dress!

227
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:24,200
Don't you, don't you ever...
ever lay your hands on me!

228
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,045
Hey, do you hear me?

229
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,303
Break it up, ladies.

230
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,882
She started it!

231
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,453
Don't you ever touch me again!

232
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,014
Get up, come on!

233
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,457
Fucking old witch!

234
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,676
I'm fining you 500 dollars.

235
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,050
500?

236
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,847
What the fuck about her?

237
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,518
I'll tell Charlie!

238
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,698
Go ahead, you go tell Charlie.

239
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:50,027
But I'm the boss around here,
and don't you forget, Ok?

240
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,599
I make the rules.

241
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:54,996
You want to stay here, you obey them
or you get out, you understand?

242
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,041
She, she ripped my dress.

243
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,511
Oh, boo hoo!

244
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,696
You know what? The next time
I'm in KMart, I'll buy you a new one.

245
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:07,589
Come on, go to your room.

246
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:19,645
OK.

247
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,027
The show is over.

248
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:30,815
It's okay, Warren?

249
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,092
Good, Grace.

250
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,581
Hey honey bunch!

251
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,105
Where've you been sugar?
I've been looking all over for you.

252
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,597
Listen, dickhead.

253
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,368
The next time you steal my mink...

254
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,996
So your sweet little screws
can wear it around Reno...

255
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:45,309
At least take the Quaaludes out of the pocket
before you flip it back into my closet.

256
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:47,543
Oh sugar, come on, darling,
you know better...

257
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:51,050
Oh, don't give me that cowboy shit!
It hurts me, Charlie.

258
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,652
It hurts me and it pisses me off when
you do it right in front of my nose.

259
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,682
Honey, there's something
else bothering you. Now what is it?

260
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,228
Come on, is it something
to do with the ranch?

261
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:01,392
- Nothing to do with the Ranch.
- If it ain't about the Ranch, what the fuck...

262
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,607
The Ranch is the only thing
in the goddamn word, okay!

263
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,100
Grace...

264
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,517
I know you.

265
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,607
Tell me what it is.

266
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,608
Charlie!

267
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,618
Remember that buddy of mine
who works for the election commission?

268
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,618
He says those church people
have called to file a petition.

269
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,523
We need to talk.

270
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,398
- Hello, Grace.
- Hey.

271
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,262
Hey, honey, we'll have a drink later
and talk about this, uh?

272
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,658
I'm sorry, honey.

273
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,883
Hey!

274
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:51,227
Mrs. Charlie!

275
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,332
Mrs. Good Time!

276
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,073
It's me, Bruza!

277
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,976
You remember? The fighter!

278
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,367
Oh, yes, yeah, I remember.

279
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,687
- The wild bull, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,382
Listen, you got someone
to help me with my stuff?

281
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,656
Your stuff? What stuff?

282
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,054
- Charlie didn't tell you?
- No.

283
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,679
No, Charlie didn't tell me.

284
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,062
I'm moving in.

285
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,220
You what?

286
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,356
Bruza, mi campeon!

287
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,060
Hey Charlie! Charlie Good Time!

288
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:26,203
Charlie, what's this shit
about he moving in?

289
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,429
Yes, that's right, he's gonna train
here at the Ranch!

290
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,511
- What?
- It'll be good for business!

291
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,539
What the hell do you get off,
telling me what's good for business?

292
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,015
Oh, come on, baby...

293
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,148
Look, look!

294
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:39,296
- If there's a problem...
- There's no problem!

295
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,249
There's no problem,
right, Grace?

296
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,661
She looks pretty mad, eh?

297
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:50,130
No, she's not mad...

298
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,958
I always got a bunch of friends about,
you know how women are like.

299
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,114
Get over here, I wanna show you something.
Stand right here, boy.

300
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,023
Warren, bring up
his bags for him.

301
00:18:58,088 --> 00:18:59,880
- What's up?
- Stay there.

302
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,838
Girls, come on out.

303
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,246
This here's Samantha,
and this is Angel.

304
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,427
This is our champion.
You take him back to the leopard room....

305
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,013
Show him the leopard room,
you know what I mean?

306
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,068
- The leopard room?
- The leopard room.

307
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,639
Come on tiger, get back there.

308
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,193
Okay, let's go.

309
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:22,413
Hey, Grace!

310
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:26,153
Why do you have to talk to me
like that before that fucking fighter?

311
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,536
How much did you give that guy?

312
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,818
What?
You mean to his contract?

313
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:32,154
You paid off his gambling debts,
how much?

314
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,373
Practically nothing.

315
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,067
I gave him maybe 15,000 dollars.

316
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,384
Oh, 15 means 50 with you!

317
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,998
You gave that lad
25 grand my money?

318
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,498
We're fifty-fifty, Charlie!

319
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,616
You gave that fighter
25 grand out of my pocket.

320
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,670
No, that's not right.

321
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,240
- Oh, I got it wrong!
- Yeah.

322
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,780
I can sure see it all now...

323
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,006
"Come to the Ranch.
Bang your way into shape..."

324
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,021
"Fuck all the girls,
don't pay a dime..."

325
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,341
- Party!" That's how it was, wasn't it?
- No.

326
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,216
Now listen to me.
You can act how you like out there.

327
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:02,473
You can prance around like a little king,
with your cigar stuck in your face...

328
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,029
But in here it's different!

329
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,912
Don't take what's mine!

330
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:09,106
If it wasn't for me, you'd be
sticking in shit to this damn day.

331
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,630
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

332
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:12,872
- Really? That's what you think?
- Yes, that's what I think..

333
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,458
- You really think that?
- What the fuck!

334
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,310
Through the fucking...!

335
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,943
No, not the phone! Not the phone!
I need the phone, okay?

336
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,958
Listen, I'm sorry.

337
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:22,372
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,537
Okay?

339
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:26,333
- How the fuck could you say that?
- I'm sorry.

340
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:28,930
Hey...

341
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:31,617
Maybe you're right
about the fighter.

342
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:35,086
Well, I know, I am not
a great visionary like you.

343
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,074
I'm just here with
the nuts and bolts,

344
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,298
Trying to keep the ship
from sinking, okay?

345
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:45,118
Gracie, Gracie.

346
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,998
Am I not always right
about this kind of things?

347
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:51,168
Yeah, you're, you are right.
You are.

348
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,180
Okay, look.

349
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,664
You want a new toy?
You got a new toy.

350
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,071
Just don't have him
stay at the ranch.

351
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:03,156
Can't he stay
at the trailer park?

352
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:04,946
I told the press.

353
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:09,214
It's gonna be out in print, I mean all the papers,
You wanna look stupid, is that what you want?

354
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,984
No, I don't want that, I know

355
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:14,062
Grace, I don't know
if you know...

356
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,644
What this means to me,
what it means to us.

357
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,331
To go to Vegas...

358
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,501
And have all those
fucking scumbags...

359
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:23,962
Say...

360
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,938
"Charlie, can you get me tickets
to the fight?"

361
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,016
"Charlie, come to my restaurant,
bring your beautiful wife..."

362
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,204
And then...

363
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,953
Welcome to the heavyweight
championship of the world!

364
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:40,531
Promoted by...

365
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,696
Charlie Bontempo!

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,837
And...

367
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,344
Sitting ringside,
is his gorgeous wife...

368
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,560
Gracie!

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,556
I dreamed of this shit
my whole life, my whole life.

370
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:03,353
Oh, you're fucking crazy, Charlie.

371
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,883
I try to be... more every day.

372
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:08,345
Oh listen, one more thing...

373
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,869
That guy Prado...

374
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,203
Prado? Who is Prado?

375
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,563
Prado, that trainer, manager,
whatever the fuck.

376
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,317
We met him at the gym
the other day.

377
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't trust this guy, so...

378
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:19,868
I told the commission
you'd be his new manager.

379
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,259
What?

380
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,876
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

381
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:28,165
Honey, I've told you, it's
a business asset...

382
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:29,556
And we got to protect him.

383
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,672
Why don't you do it!

384
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,509
I can't do it!
They wont let me manage him.

385
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:33,782
I can't get a license,

386
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,436
I'm a convicted felon!

387
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,041
What am I supposed to do?

388
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:39,001
Carry his spit bucket?

389
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:41,626
No...

390
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:44,415
You don't have to carry
his spit bucket.

391
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,306
All you have to do
is sign some papers...

392
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:48,672
You go to the fights...

393
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,603
You sit near his corner...

394
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:51,858
That's it!

395
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,234
You don't carry
his spit bucket...

396
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:56,554
Oh you're unbelievable!

397
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:58,975
No, we're unbelievable, baby.

398
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:00,809
I got to go to Carson City.

399
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,975
Sorry it ain't much.

400
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,996
- Charlie own this place?
- Yeah.

401
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,404
Yeah. He keeps rents low as long as
this people vote right at election time.

402
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,330
Smart.

403
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,389
American democracy at work.

404
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:48,905
Charlie had a Ranch maid
come over and spruce the place up.

405
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:00,842
Charlie wanted you to have this.

406
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,315
Use that to pay
for a hotel in Reno...

407
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:16,273
Or stay here...

408
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,258
And put it in your pocket.

409
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,890
I stay here.

410
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,132
The world-famous Love Ranch,
where your wildest fantasies come true.

411
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:02,601
How can I help you?

412
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,460
Pink handcuffs.

413
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:07,156
15.

414
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:08,484
Close?

415
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,249
Honey, we never close.

416
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,422
Grace!

417
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:13,351
What's this?

418
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,359
I found it on the window,
this morning.

419
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:17,035
Mrs. Good Time...

420
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,817
It's crazy to work out here in the snow.

421
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,786
Do you want a rematch with Ali or not?

422
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,210
Charlie really wants me here.

423
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,166
There's a perfectly good gym in Reno.

424
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:01,870
I took Charlie's money.
We're going to do this.

425
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:03,364
This is bullshit.

426
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:09,790
I need to straighten things out with his wife.
Go on... We need to eat, don't we?

427
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:14,514
Mrs. Bontempo.

428
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,144
Hello, Beautiful!

429
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,317
I haven't been out here
since we built the Ranch!

430
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,887
You're sure that old tree
is gonna hold that bag?

431
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:31,333
Hey, I thought you wanted
to talk to me.

432
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,067
Yeah.

433
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:34,614
Sorry about yesterday.

434
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:37,153
I didn't know that you
didn't know that I was coming.

435
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,293
That's okay.

436
00:26:38,512 --> 00:26:40,356
Charlie and me worked it out, but...

437
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,278
You're okay in the trailer park?
I know it's not the Hilton.

438
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,573
I sleep good anywhere.

439
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,599
Hey, hey...

440
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:54,072
You don't have to work out here.
You can go inside if you want.

441
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,479
I prefer to be here.

442
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,692
I don't like to be inside,
no offence.

443
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,356
Here I feel free.

444
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:00,435
Yeah!

445
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,895
Well, don't get too free.

446
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:04,004
I don't care what Charlie said.

447
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:06,138
These are working girls.

448
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,302
That means they're
supposed to be working.

449
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,567
You just keep your wild bull
pecker in your pants, okay?

450
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,216
Hey!

451
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:14,746
Mrs. Charlie...

452
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,006
You gonna help me?

453
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:18,817
Help you do what?

454
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,396
You're my manager.

455
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,286
You're going to get me ready
for the fight.

456
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,208
No, no, no, no, I told Charlie.

457
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,472
No, that's crazy.

458
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:27,411
A manager is supposed
to help the fighter, you know?

459
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:31,377
Listen, I got 25 psychotic whores to
manage, that's a full dance card.

460
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,677
Yeah, I know!

461
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:35,090
I don't like to work out alone!

462
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:36,247
I feel lonely.

463
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,317
A big boy like you?

464
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:38,951
Yeah, a big boy like me!

465
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,629
I need people to talk to.

466
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,551
Come on, it's easy.

467
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:43,872
I show you.

468
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,653
I hit like this.

469
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:48,614
You say: "Good." Then...

470
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,254
Come on, say it.
Say "Good"!

471
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,363
Good.

472
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:55,302
Nice!

473
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,810
Hey!

474
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,122
Now I hit like this.

475
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:01,790
- And you say: "Way to work..."
- Oh this is stupid!

476
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,958
No... not stupid!

477
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,520
Come on, say it.
Say...

478
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,286
"Way to work!"

479
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,434
- Way to work.
- There you go!

480
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,887
See!
Now you train me.

481
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,762
That's all Hernan ever do.

482
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,614
And I give him...

483
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:18,974
30%...

484
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,687
One last thing
you ought to know.

485
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,371
Now you say: "Don't loaf!"
"Don't loaf!"

486
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:34,497
Come on, say it! Say it!
Don't loaf!

487
00:28:34,575 --> 00:28:36,458
Come on, say it!
Say don't loaf!

488
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,870
Don't loaf!

489
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:39,833
There you go!
Right so!

490
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,036
You see how easy?

491
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:44,004
You watch me and you learn
everything in 10 minutes.

492
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,644
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey!

493
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,043
One last thing.

494
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:50,317
Hold the bag.

495
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:51,629
What?

496
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,240
Go on the other side
and hold the bag!

497
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,554
Are you're kidding,
that's, that's sweaty!

498
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:58,246
No, it's not sweaty, it's good!
Come on! Please!

499
00:28:58,929 --> 00:28:59,770
Please.

500
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:08,830
Give me that cane.

501
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:10,822
There you go!

502
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:12,665
Okay.

503
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,472
You feel that?

504
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:23,518
You're nuts.

505
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:25,938
You really think so?
Hey!

506
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:28,212
Your cane.

507
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:31,438
I go to work.

508
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:32,335
You just keep...

509
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:33,892
Banging away, okay?

510
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:38,790
Bruza...

511
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:41,719
In Argentina,
you are a king, a champion.

512
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,112
You don't belong here.

513
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:44,627
Friend...

514
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,546
I know exactly what I'm doing.

515
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:48,821
Surviving...

516
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,599
Don't worry, we'll be back on top.

517
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:53,681
These people can't
make you a champion...

518
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:55,310
This old lady and her pimp.

519
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:57,422
Let's go home, Bruza.

520
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,571
God forgives. Forgive thyself.

521
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:01,587
What God?

522
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,325
I spoke to Carmela's sister.

523
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,899
Nobody blames you.

524
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:05,689
Nobody!

525
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,691
Get this through your head.

526
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,699
Carmela's gone!

527
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,656
I am not going back, understand?

528
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:16,922
My job is to worry about you.

529
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:18,584
I'll worry about my own life!

530
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:19,852
Don't talk to me like that.

531
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,017
Fuck you all!

532
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,766
Is this Fench peckerhead
ever going to give up?

533
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,356
These fucking morons, eh?

534
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:10,698
Disgusting.

535
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:12,442
Our customers are gonna read this smut.

536
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:14,475
Warren, take them down, all.

537
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:17,654
It ain't against the law
to put up posters, Charlie.

538
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,202
Oh yeah?

539
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:21,754
What law is that you talking
about Johnny boy?

540
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:23,818
Do you forget who you work for?

541
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:25,351
Help him.

542
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:29,975
And hurry up, I got to get out to the
development to deal with that prick Tom Macy.

543
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,866
All right folks.

544
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:35,615
Now it's only fair to let you know that we
only have two of these babies left.

545
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:37,405
This one is totally custom...

546
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:40,852
Avocado appliances
and picturized on the inside.

547
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,772
You got cabinet tree to match.

548
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:44,895
One of a kind!!

549
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,045
I like it.

550
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,867
- It's 37,500, right?
- No.

551
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:53,381
This one is 41,500, because of the custom kitchen,
you get the double garage, lots of extras.

552
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,553
I think there is
someone in there.

553
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,310
Oh no, there's no one in there.

554
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,588
Let mommy and daddy
talk to Mr. Macy.

555
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:00,897
But I tell you what, folks...

556
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:02,421
If you make a decision today...

557
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:04,467
I might be able to do
a little better with the price.

558
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:06,074
There is someone in there.

559
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,840
Iti's the master bedroom.

560
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:13,833
Could be a critter guard in there or something, you know?
It's still pretty wild out here.

561
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,279
I'll go to take a look.

562
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:18,209
You folks make yourself at home,
look around, snoop. Okay?

563
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:19,554
I fell for the avocado.

564
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,483
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, you got to get the...

565
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,296
Let him go, let him go.

566
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,686
Tommy boy, my super salesman!

567
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,302
Listen to me, you fucking idiot!

568
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:42,384
Did you think I was gonna let your bible
banging sister put me out of business?

569
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,029
Did you think I was gonna do that?
Is that what you thought, uh?

570
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:50,748
Does Mary Fench know where her little brother
spends the commission I pay him, uh?

571
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:53,998
On whores!
And she wants to shut me down?

572
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:57,693
That will never happen, it will never
fucking happen, you hear me?

573
00:32:57,787 --> 00:33:00,951
You get that wretched bitch
to stop this referendum

574
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,858
Or you gonna loose your fucking job!
You got it?

575
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:06,076
You got it? Did you?

576
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:10,443
You're okay boy. You're okay.

577
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,748
You're all right.
You're okay.

578
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,850
You got 45 days.

579
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:17,178
I'm gonna debate
your sister on TV.

580
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,855
It'll be good for business.

581
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:22,232
But you... better... stop her,
do you understand?

582
00:33:22,323 --> 00:33:24,154
- Yes Charlie I understand.
- Here you go..

583
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:25,162
You look good.

584
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,436
Now go out there and make those
poor people give you their life-savings...

585
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:29,920
For this piece of shit.

586
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:31,053
Shit!

587
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:33,615
Please, folks!!

588
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:37,733
5... 4... 3... 2...

589
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:44,122
A referendum on Comstock County's controversial
law of legalizing prostitution...

590
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,483
Is coming up.

591
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:49,047
We've invited two local interested parties
to join us to discuss the matter.

592
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:52,662
Miss Mary Fench, of the
Nevada Families Association...

593
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,799
and Charles Bontempo, of
Love Ranch, a legal brothel.

594
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:58,274
You must be proud of yourself.

595
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,357
Trading on weakness of the flesh.

596
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,492
If somebody somewhere is having a
good time, does that wreak your day?

597
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,813
The contaminated anti-God
moral of our society...

598
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,775
Exploited by vermin like you, Mr Bontempo,
that's what wreaks my day.

599
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,584
They always have to bring
God into it, I hate that.

600
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,068
I was an altar boy in the church of Rome.

601
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,771
Not like this voodoo shit
they got here.

602
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,455
If I go to hell,
I go to hell, honey.

603
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,254
I don't need to hear about this
from that voodoo witch bitch.

604
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:34,185
Although I have to admit she was kind of cute
in her own librarian sort of way, you know?

605
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:40,005
I was actually thinking of sticking my hand up
her dress at one point and tickling her ass.

606
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:43,255
Oh, that would have changed
her mind all right!

607
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,689
You think so?

608
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,636
Listen Charlie, we got
another letter from the IRS.

609
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,263
They want to look at the books.

610
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,051
The good ones or the bad ones?

611
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:54,627
That was easier in the old days, Grace,
when we were illegal.

612
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,115
We just used to shaft
the money in our pocket.

613
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,451
Yeah, but don't let those secret deals
of yours get us into trouble.

614
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,107
Hey Grace, do me a favor....

615
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:04,638
Don't act like you never
stole anything, okay?

616
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,911
This guys will just keep coming...

617
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:09,396
I don't wanna to be the one
stuck holding the bag.

618
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:10,795
Hey.

619
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,014
Hey!

620
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,443
Don't worry so much,
you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

621
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,770
Got to go to Reno...

622
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,677
Meet some fight people for lunch.

623
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:33,678
Oh!

624
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:34,966
Hey, Charlie!

625
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,169
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

626
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:37,279
This is private.

627
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,060
Ah! I didn't know, sorry.

628
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,568
I didn't know, really.

629
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,326
It's great up here, uh?

630
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:45,263
Yeah!
It's where I come to relax.

631
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:47,412
Yeah. I can see why.

632
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:49,810
I got the idea when I was in Folsom.

633
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:50,685
Folsom?

634
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,740
Yeah, a prison.

635
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,388
You see the whole joint from up here.
You see everything.

636
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,896
Yes, the whole empire... from here.

637
00:35:58,169 --> 00:35:59,435
My empire.

638
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:00,849
Yeah.

639
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,606
What?

640
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,896
I said sorry!

641
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:06,762
Yeah, come on.

642
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,316
I want to show you inside.

643
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,614
I'm gonna show you something.

644
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:10,764
You see this trailers?

645
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,885
We are not gonna have trailers
anymore, you know.

646
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:16,337
Stand over here, watch this.
I wanna you to have a good look.

647
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,474
How's that!

648
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,685
Wow!

649
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,232
It came to me in a dream.

650
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:23,209
A star.

651
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,451
A fucking nova.

652
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:25,818
Bricks and mortar.

653
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,662
Ah? See this here?

654
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:29,662
I'm gonna have a bunch
of little lights over here.

655
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:33,919
And no matter like, how far away you are, like
planes coming by hundreds of miles away...

656
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,560
They'll be able to see the Love Ranch.

657
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,489
- Is that thing...
- Don't touch, don't touch.

658
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:39,792
The trees look like this little
broccoli, I like it.

659
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:41,052
They might get down.

660
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,131
Yes, that's it, it's gonna be
a new Love Ranch.

661
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:44,653
Nothing like it!

662
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,161
It's great, Charlie.

663
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:47,325
Thank you.

664
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,192
You know...

665
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,278
I don't got nothing like this.

666
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,309
No place to call my own.

667
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,067
You're a champion,
you'll make money.

668
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,317
Oh money... I made it, I lost it.

669
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:04,265
You have a great life, Charlie.

670
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,755
Really.

671
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:07,285
Yeah...

672
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,693
It depends how you
look at it, you know?

673
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,790
I mean, some guys like to leave
something behind.

674
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,673
You got any children?

675
00:37:16,513 --> 00:37:17,630
No.

676
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,642
It's a bitch, eh?

677
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:23,208
Six brothers and four sisters.

678
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,512
Bontempos go back
to fucking Nero.

679
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,935
And I have never once been
to a football game...

680
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:31,333
And said, "See that kid
out there kicking ass?"

681
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:33,309
"He's my son."

682
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:34,996
Have you seen a doctor?

683
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:36,434
We saw a million doctors.

684
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,598
Grace took it hard.

685
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,544
What about you?
Do you have kids?

686
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,739
Yes, in Argentina.

687
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,193
Ah, yes.

688
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:49,758
But I don't see them.

689
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:51,778
Not for a long time.

690
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:53,145
How come?

691
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,309
Because it's like...

692
00:37:58,286 --> 00:37:59,369
Complicado.

693
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,145
Oh, oh!

694
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:07,794
Hey, honey bunch!

695
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,426
The champ and I are just doing
a little male-bond in here.

696
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:12,458
I go back on in 20.

697
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,700
Oh!

698
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,653
Hey!
Seen Charlie?

699
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,294
No. I didn't
see him all day.

700
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,504
Not much of a liar, are you?

701
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,505
Just not so,
I am a very good liar.

702
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:42,653
The little bitch has
my mink coat on?

703
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,479
Don't fret.

704
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,387
I am used to this shit.

705
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,096
Ms. Good Time...

706
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,325
I've been watching...

707
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:53,114
And you and Charlie...

708
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,669
You're a great team, eh?

709
00:38:54,747 --> 00:38:56,808
- Oh yes, we are the best.
- Yeah!

710
00:38:57,684 --> 00:39:00,458
You know...
I could run a whorehouse.

711
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:01,934
I know I could.

712
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,024
Some day maybe...
I'll have a place like this.

713
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,824
That's your life ambition?
Great!

714
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,919
I go all over the world
fighting, you know.

715
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,528
Half the time,
I don't know where I am.

716
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,192
But here, I feel great.

717
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,634
It's like a family.

718
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:21,114
You and Charlie are like
the mom and dad...

719
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,919
The girls, they are...

720
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:24,843
Not like sisters, but...

721
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:26,009
So nice!

722
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,739
How did you and Charlie do it?

723
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,348
I mean, start everything up?

724
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:33,794
You mean you wanna know what a girl
like me is doing in a place like this?

725
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:35,138
Give me a break.

726
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:37,364
- Please I'm serious, I really wanna know.
- It's easy.

727
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,153
My mom was a whore.

728
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:42,059
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

729
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:43,989
Okay.

730
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:47,426
- That bother you?
- No.

731
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:50,926
Maybe.

732
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:54,091
Guys!
You're so predictable.

733
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,083
How much is Charlie
with that girl...

734
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,051
Like... in a week?

735
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,106
Well, that ain't none of your
fucking business now, is it?

736
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:04,817
I’m something like awed by it.

737
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:07,546
You are quite a piece of work,
aren't you?

738
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:09,321
Maybe.

739
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:14,975
The girl I took along, she had a pussy
like the Grand Canyon.

740
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,244
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be training?

741
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,507
So, go train.

742
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,554
Long before Las Vegas
was ever heard of, or even invented...

743
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:34,146
Reno...
was one hell of a fight town.

744
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:38,281
This is where the great Jack Johnson
defeated Jim Jeffries...

745
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:40,211
In the great "Wild Hope" movie.

746
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:44,046
Now Bruza here is gonna bring us
back on top where we belong.

747
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:50,068
Word is that Muhammad Ali
is coming up to the fight.

748
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,903
That's a long way to travel,
he must be a little scared of Bruza.

749
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:54,773
I figure.

750
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:57,428
Well Charlie, personally
I hope Ali do come.

751
00:40:57,616 --> 00:41:00,147
And then he'll see who he is
really supposed to be fighting...

752
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,476
Me, not that washed-up clown.

753
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:05,320
Bruza, what's your response to that?

754
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,163
I wanna tell everybody to bring
some flowers next month at the fight.

755
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,265
What do you mean?

756
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,187
It's gonna be a funeral, you know?

757
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,772
Leroy Colter's funeral!

758
00:41:17,464 --> 00:41:22,988
I'm gonna slap you silly. I'm gonna slap you
like Jack Johnson did that other ugly white boy.

759
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,429
I'm not a white, I am Argentinian.

760
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,827
Why, olé! You look white to me!

761
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,187
Fish belly white.

762
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,421
Ok, I'm gonna show you the difference
next month in the ring.

763
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:36,541
Why, you don't even know when
you get chumped, damn wet bag.

764
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:39,336
Mr. Colter, Mr. Colter...

765
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:43,218
You know, in my business
guys are always coming in talking big...

766
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,061
But when it comes down to it...

767
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,083
They are kind of little...

768
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,398
That's his manager, boys!

769
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,281
She got you good, uh?

770
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:55,017
Who is this old lady?

771
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,577
Is it your mama?

772
00:41:56,692 --> 00:41:59,670
But you got some nasty mouth,
own that to your mother...

773
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:02,085
No la puta che te paria...

774
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,617
I'll smash you so bad
granny won't recognize you!

775
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,187
Show her some respect, eh!

776
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:14,708
So, Bruza went out to this guy
to defend your honor?

777
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:18,276
That's hot.
Nobody ever did that for me.

778
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:21,798
Wrong!

779
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:23,544
Once my ex...

780
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,474
Put a coat over a puddle for me.

781
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:28,700
Except he was drunk
and it was my coat.

782
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,473
Who is it?

783
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:32,607
Here's Janelle.

784
00:42:32,696 --> 00:42:34,288
Yeah, come on in baby.

785
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:42,005
You see the kind of degenerate behavior
I have to put up with here?

786
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:44,357
I just got a offered an
accounting job in Tahoe.

787
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,020
- Oh baby, that's fantastic.
- Wow!

788
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,560
It pays shit.

789
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:50,161
An assistant...

790
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,121
Starts at 13,5, with only
partial medical benefit.

791
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,909
How am I gonna take care
of the twins?

792
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:59,137
You gone to school for three years
trying to give you kids a better life...

793
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,317
The first job you get
you turn chicken?

794
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:03,075
I like it here, Grace.

795
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,227
I feel safe.

796
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,560
Out there...

797
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,094
In the square world...

798
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:10,163
I don't trust those people.

799
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,050
I'll make it easy for you.

800
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,655
Here.

801
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:21,559
What's this?

802
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,391
Severance pay. You're fired.

803
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:24,399
What?

804
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,406
Take it.

805
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:31,031
Come on. Pack up your trunk, put your
kids into a decent school, take the job.

806
00:43:31,438 --> 00:43:35,685
If in six months, it doesn't work out, you can
always come back here, I'll be happy to have you.

807
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:36,583
But for now...

808
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,025
Pack up and get out of here.
Come on!

809
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,083
Thank you, Grace.

810
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:42,349
No problem.

811
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:48,540
Nicely done.

812
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:54,545
Wow...

813
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:55,771
What?

814
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,677
I just had a flash.

815
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,552
I just saw...

816
00:43:59,677 --> 00:44:01,193
You and Bruza...

817
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:03,466
Floating up on a cloud.

818
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:08,283
And there was froggy Charlie there,
jumping up and down in his little boots...

819
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:10,687
Waving his magic pecker...

820
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,825
- You're stoned.
- Yeah.

821
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,895
I'm gonna ask you something, Grace...

822
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:18,404
Have you ever been unfaithful to Charlie?

823
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:22,365
I don't know if you
noticed or not...

824
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:25,012
But, the big Neanderthal out there, dear...

825
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:26,513
Is fucking sexy.

826
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:29,116
Just a hassle, like all the rest.

827
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:31,814
You know he has already
taken Charlie some thousands.

828
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:33,911
Good for him!
I like him already.

829
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:36,099
Hey, excuse me,
it's my money too.

830
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,950
Moneysh money, Grace.

831
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,138
My God, you have to have a little fun.

832
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:41,841
You ain't gonna live forever.

833
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,561
Duty calls.

834
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:54,029
Yes, Pavlov!

835
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,481
The old dog is coming.

836
00:44:58,067 --> 00:44:58,977
You know...

837
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:00,915
You got to admit it, Grace.

838
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,138
Since he's been here...

839
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:04,832
You got a little more...

840
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:06,140
Spring in your step...

841
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:09,292
A little more... rhythm in your bum!

842
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:14,575
A little bit more yin... to your yang.

843
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:19,157
I am telling you!

844
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:21,831
And then...

845
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:22,940
Come on!

846
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,161
Do you really need
that cane anymore?

847
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,330
Think about it.

848
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:06,964
Don't loaf!

849
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:12,372
I should never teach
you that word.

850
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:20,527
These are real eye catching
clothes money can buy.

851
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:25,391
This is a Japanese cherry blossom corset.

852
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,661
Is all original design.

853
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,770
Girls, this a plain song!

854
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,314
Money in the bank.

855
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,693
Glad you like it.

856
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:44,400
This is a sheer merry
feathered baby doll...

857
00:46:44,688 --> 00:46:47,043
It comes with matching....

858
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,318
Are you tired?

859
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:01,810
How far I went?

860
00:47:01,913 --> 00:47:03,841
Oh, from the road,
about a mile and a half.

861
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:05,100
Oh, well!

862
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,333
Tomorrow, I do more.

863
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:10,193
You're okay?

864
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,013
Yes!

865
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:13,247
I'm tired.

866
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,396
You ought to lay off those candy bars.

867
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,122
What's over there?
On the other side?

868
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,560
I don't know, more of
the same. Nothing.

869
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:26,296
Maybe a couple of coyotes.

870
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:29,057
Maybe you haven't seen it
with the right person.

871
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,521
Oh, really? And who is that?

872
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,615
Mr. Wild Bullshit of the Pampers?

873
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,771
The Pampers?

874
00:47:39,513 --> 00:47:41,115
You mean like diapers?

875
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,813
You make me laugh, Grace.

876
00:47:44,474 --> 00:47:47,708
Yeah, well, I'm keeping you loose,
like a manager does, so I...

877
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,357
I just got to stay loose, no?

878
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,397
Yeah, but don't get too loose!

879
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:53,990
Get off of my car.

880
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,405
Respect, please.

881
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:58,779
I see the tire tracks...

882
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,200
And I wonder if the driver wanted
to miss the animal...

883
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,228
Or to hit it.

884
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:07,021
Tell me about you and your mother.

885
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,446
Finally! The 64,000 dollars question.

886
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,708
Was I a whore like my mom?

887
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:16,232
Well, the answer is no.

888
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:20,715
My mom said there was more money
in running whores than in being one.

889
00:48:21,305 --> 00:48:23,341
So I had my first house
by the time I was 20.

890
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:25,685
I ran joints all over the state.

891
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:29,880
It wasn't legal then, just,
you know, tolerated.

892
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:34,044
So one day, I am running this three girls
dump down in Fallon.

893
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,896
A guy pulls up driving a Reno cab.

894
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,326
Fallon is 75 miles out of Reno.

895
00:48:42,394 --> 00:48:43,509
It was Charlie.

896
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,677
Yeah, it was Charlie.

897
00:48:46,831 --> 00:48:49,904
He wasn't interested in girls,
he said it was me he came to see.

898
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:52,263
He'd heard I ran a good house.

899
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:54,779
He had this plan, you know.

900
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,326
A dream really, to make it legal.

901
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,851
He said if we were legal there wouldn't be
any cops around with their hands out..

902
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:02,982
Would be citizens.

903
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,818
Would make a lot of money.

904
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:07,912
He was right.

905
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:10,943
Yeah, he was right.

906
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,990
You know, I've been thinking
about the Ranch.

907
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:18,529
And many changes need to be made.
Immediately.

908
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,979
Oh, is that right?

909
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:24,099
Yeah, yeah, for example, I don't know
why you let your girls curse?

910
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:25,700
It's not sexy.

911
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,458
They call themselves cunts!

912
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:31,850
I hear that, and my thing
just... goes down.

913
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:36,162
Remind me to wash everybody's mouth
out with soap when I get back.

914
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:39,115
Well, you know, I got
plenty of good ideas.

915
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,576
To make the Ranch better.

916
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:44,101
Or maybe you wish to
call it Bruza's Love Ranch.

917
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:46,098
No, no way.

918
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,619
No, it should be
Grace and Bruza's.

919
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:52,334
Oh, boy! Charlie is not
gonna like that!

920
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,694
Charlie?
And who needs Charlie?

921
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:57,397
All right!
Who needs Charlie?

922
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,600
You see, Grace...

923
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,633
We think alike.

924
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:04,881
We are a good team.

925
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:09,508
You know...

926
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:12,436
I don't know why you stay with
that little man.

927
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:16,030
He wanders around
with that skinny girl.

928
00:50:17,037 --> 00:50:18,608
It makes me... sick...

929
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:20,162
How he treats you.

930
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:23,240
You don't love him, Grace.

931
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:26,412
A woman like you can not
love someone like him.

932
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,553
It could be just you and me.

933
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,162
Get out!

934
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:38,327
What?

935
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:40,092
Get the fuck out of the car!

936
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,033
Get out! Out!

937
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,209
Go! Get out!

938
00:50:43,303 --> 00:50:44,521
Do you think I'm that stupid?

939
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:45,771
- Okay, I'll get out!
- Yeah!

940
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,483
Then I'll get back in.
Come on, Grace...

941
00:50:48,616 --> 00:50:51,401
Come on, Grace! Grace!
Come on!

942
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:54,846
Grace! I didn't mean it!

943
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:56,334
I'm sorry!

944
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,456
Grace!

945
00:51:00,948 --> 00:51:01,951
I'm sorry.

946
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:04,950
I'm a fucking idiot!

947
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:10,993
Shit!

948
00:52:09,407 --> 00:52:13,286
Lorazepam. In case of insomnia.
Don't exceed 3 tablets in 24 hours.

949
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:10,036
Hey!

950
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,278
Hey!

951
00:53:38,704 --> 00:53:39,722
Hi.

952
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,581
Oh, it's you.

953
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,684
You gave me a start!

954
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,277
How're you doing?

955
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,738
Good!

956
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,085
These are nice!

957
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:50,474
You made them?

958
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,312
I learned in jail.

959
00:53:52,673 --> 00:53:54,473
They put me in
the welding shop.

960
00:53:56,214 --> 00:53:58,000
You just use old cars?

961
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:01,094
Whatever shit
people throw away.

962
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:03,605
You sleep there?

963
00:54:04,317 --> 00:54:05,714
They own the shop.

964
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:08,037
Grace lets me stay out here.

965
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:10,402
I can't stand being cooped up.

966
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:13,393
It was Grace that got
me sculpturing.

967
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,194
She saved my life.

968
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:17,656
She's good people,
you know what I mean?

969
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:19,948
Yeah, I know.

970
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:42,928
Rio, get me Tom Macy on the phone.
I'm gonna kill that little fuck.

971
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:44,234
Grace!

972
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,102
What are you doing, I've been
looking all over for you.

973
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,868
That fucking Fench lady
is on her way over here.

974
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:48,766
Who?

975
00:54:48,978 --> 00:54:52,573
Fench, the church lady from the fucking
TV show I did the other day.

976
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,540
She's coming, she got
Armored Christian soldiers,

977
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:56,540
They're marching up to
the fucking front gate now,

978
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:58,071
They got television crews
and everything.

979
00:54:58,115 --> 00:55:00,151
Charlie, when you look at me,
what do you see?

980
00:55:01,234 --> 00:55:01,914
What?

981
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:04,055
What do I look like to you?

982
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:07,294
Grace, what is this,
I got a fucking secret, now?

983
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:08,572
Charlie...

984
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:10,633
I'm serious.

985
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,227
Do you love me?

986
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:14,493
Do you?

987
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,353
Grace...

988
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:17,781
22 years we're married.
Do I love you?

989
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:21,462
Are you okay, honey?

990
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:23,231
Is it something wrong?

991
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,868
22 years...

992
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:28,461
It sounds like a stretch
in Quentin to me.

993
00:55:32,264 --> 00:55:33,587
I want to take a vacation.

994
00:55:33,994 --> 00:55:35,142
You wanna what?

995
00:55:35,952 --> 00:55:37,118
I want to take a vacation...

996
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,055
You know, just you and me.

997
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:45,360
You mean like that cruise we took
to Mexico, just me and you?

998
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:46,307
Yeah.

999
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:47,845
Yeah.
Wasn't that nice?

1000
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:49,290
Yes, it was nice.

1001
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:52,969
- Okay, we'll do it. Let's do it!
- Good.

1002
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:55,353
Good, let's go today.

1003
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:57,189
Grace, are you on fucking LSD?

1004
00:55:57,296 --> 00:55:59,314
In the middle of this
fucking shit, that one?

1005
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:00,744
Don't pull this fucking stuff!

1006
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:02,133
Charlie, I need to be with you.

1007
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,322
You're with me!

1008
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,041
Just reach out and fucking touch me,
I'm here, honey.

1009
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:08,227
Why do you have to make
everything so cheap?

1010
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:09,017
Okay.

1011
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:10,821
Okay, I'll break it down for you.

1012
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,852
- Do.
- When I went to the doctor...

1013
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,410
For your check-up!
Hold on!

1014
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:16,383
Hello?

1015
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:19,281
Hey Tom, your sister's over here
with the all fucking church!

1016
00:56:19,336 --> 00:56:20,594
It wasn't just a check up.

1017
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,084
I thought you were
gonna stop her.

1018
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:22,961
What?

1019
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:23,718
Her husband?

1020
00:56:23,766 --> 00:56:25,407
What do I give a shit!
Lean on!

1021
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,579
Do what you got to do!

1022
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:29,351
Hey, you better stop this bitch,
or you're fucking done!

1023
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:42,939
Grace...

1024
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:45,384
Honey...

1025
00:56:46,243 --> 00:56:47,417
Look at me.

1026
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,829
I may not always act like it...

1027
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:52,423
Or show it...

1028
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,923
But I love you.

1029
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,238
I fucking love you.

1030
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:00,855
I could have never found a woman
as loyal and sure to take my side.

1031
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:01,939
I know that.

1032
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:05,140
I fucking know, look what we did
together, look what we built.

1033
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:07,775
Isn't that beautiful?

1034
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:10,149
I do fucking love you.

1035
00:57:10,711 --> 00:57:12,180
I fucking love you.

1036
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:13,703
I love you.

1037
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,415
And I need you.

1038
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,429
I need you, I know I do.

1039
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:20,195
I can't go out there
and fight that bitch,

1040
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:23,358
They got television cameras,
it would look terrible if I do it.

1041
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,868
I need you to do it.

1042
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:26,952
I'm sorry, Grace, I know you...

1043
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,552
Okay, I'll be there Charlie,
I'll be there. Okay.

1044
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:30,716
Grace! Grace!

1045
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:32,269
Thank you, honey. Ok.

1046
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:35,302
Ok, ok, let's go!!

1047
00:57:38,427 --> 00:57:41,231
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1048
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:44,731
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1049
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:48,294
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1050
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,700
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1051
00:57:51,786 --> 00:57:55,044
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1052
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:58,373
Prostitution out of
Comstock County now!

1053
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:00,208
Prostitution...

1054
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:01,997
Legal or not...

1055
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,998
Is evil.

1056
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,036
Why do you think there's a fence
around the place?

1057
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,396
These women are in bondage.

1058
00:58:08,557 --> 00:58:09,676
Mrs. Fench...

1059
00:58:09,826 --> 00:58:11,310
You're on my property...

1060
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:13,224
I could have you removed...

1061
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,669
But, in my America I happen to think
that freedom of speech...

1062
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,786
Is a lot more important
than private property.

1063
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:21,224
So I'm going to invite
you people in...

1064
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,208
And let's start talk it over.

1065
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,919
This may be hard for you
to understand, Mr. Bontempo...

1066
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:29,629
But God-fearing people aren't interested
in your perversions.

1067
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:30,841
That's right!

1068
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,021
You are a woman!

1069
00:58:32,707 --> 00:58:34,736
How can you sell
their bodies like this?

1070
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:36,482
Oh, Mrs. Fench...

1071
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,028
Would you do me a favor and
just take a look at these girls?

1072
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:40,926
I don't need to.

1073
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:42,566
Oh, come on, just look at them.

1074
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:45,599
I mean, don't look at their
make-up or their clothes, but...

1075
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:47,825
But look at them,
the people they are...

1076
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,348
I mean, do you think they dreamed of being
hookers when they were little girls?

1077
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,668
No, they've taken what life
has thrown at them...

1078
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:56,060
And they're making
the best of it, okay?

1079
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,115
Yeah!

1080
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:59,092
And maybe being a whore
ain't so great...

1081
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,567
But it beats serving burgers
in Winnemucca.

1082
00:59:02,434 --> 00:59:03,989
God will win!

1083
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:05,724
Down legal sin!

1084
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,395
God will win!

1085
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:09,187
Down legal sin!

1086
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,115
God will win!

1087
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:12,880
Legal sex!

1088
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,645
Legal sex!

1089
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,310
Legal sex!

1090
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,067
Legal sex!

1091
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:33,243
Hi.

1092
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,111
How the hell
did you get in here?

1093
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,228
I picked the lock.

1094
00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:44,900
You what?

1095
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:46,470
I picked your lock!

1096
00:59:46,772 --> 00:59:48,868
I learned it when I was a boy
in the streets in Buenos Aires.

1097
00:59:48,938 --> 00:59:50,403
Any lock. No problem

1098
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,637
Well, you can just
get the hell out!

1099
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,340
Grace...

1100
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:03,970
I just...

1101
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:05,809
Wanted to make an apology.

1102
01:00:06,954 --> 01:00:08,574
What I said on the road....

1103
01:00:09,118 --> 01:00:10,340
It was wrong.

1104
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:13,316
I just never met anyone like you.

1105
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:15,582
And I don't know how to ask.

1106
01:00:15,984 --> 01:00:17,238
What do you want?

1107
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:20,412
- Want?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1108
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,451
I want you to be my manager...

1109
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:24,931
I want you to be with me and...

1110
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:26,032
Bullshit!

1111
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:26,994
I just...

1112
01:00:28,148 --> 01:00:29,135
I just like you...

1113
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:30,921
What do you mean you like me?
I mean, look at me...

1114
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:32,618
Look at me, I'm old.

1115
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:34,312
I am not like those girls...

1116
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,816
Sorry.

1117
01:02:35,943 --> 01:02:37,317
Oh, yeah!

1118
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:52,586
- Easy.
- Yes.

1119
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:22,779
Girls, If you want something,
get it now, come on!

1120
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:26,270
I don't wanna be in there!

1121
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:27,715
Hey Warren...

1122
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:29,535
Take care of it.

1123
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:32,949
- Hey Tommy!
- Hey, Charlie!

1124
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,346
Did you hear they canceled
that referendum?

1125
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:37,254
Nice work, boy.

1126
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,859
I see you found your little price
at the bottom of a crackerjack box...

1127
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:41,877
Is that all right?

1128
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:44,532
- It's a swell thing you did.
- All right, Tommy gun.

1129
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:48,806
Johnny boy... ringside for Mr. Macy
and his lovely date.

1130
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,714
Charlie!

1131
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:56,619
Grace, you are as beautiful as
the first time I busted you 20 years ago.

1132
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,166
Can I have that box, please. Thank you.

1133
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:00,604
Asshole.

1134
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,577
And... just as sweet!

1135
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,291
You know how women are,
Mr. Prosecutor.

1136
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,323
They can't all be as
forgiving as me, Jim.

1137
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:10,002
This is a big night for you, uh?

1138
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:11,379
Comme ci, comme ça.

1139
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,330
Look, Charlie, I been thinking...

1140
01:04:15,129 --> 01:04:16,533
You known, we go way back.

1141
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,157
And guys like us, we shouldn't be...

1142
01:04:18,753 --> 01:04:20,339
Butting heads...
You know what I mean?

1143
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:22,760
I mean you got some
big things coming...

1144
01:04:23,312 --> 01:04:24,869
I can give you a little boost.

1145
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:28,666
You want to give me
a little boost, Jim?

1146
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:33,119
I don't like anybody's
hand in my pockets.

1147
01:04:33,197 --> 01:04:34,386
Especially your.

1148
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:37,269
Don't get too sure of yourself,
Charlie Good Time.

1149
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:39,964
It just makes it harder
when you fall.

1150
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:43,958
- Hey! Salaam alaikum
- Alaikum salaam

1151
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:46,583
Charlie Bontempo,
I pray life is good.

1152
01:04:46,726 --> 01:04:48,535
Same shit, different flies.

1153
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:52,840
Say hi to our State's Senator and former
District Attorney James Pettis.

1154
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,459
Meet Naasih Mohammad.

1155
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:56,969
Welcome to Comstock County.

1156
01:04:57,752 --> 01:05:00,582
Now, is there any truth to this rumor
that I have heard that...

1157
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:02,457
Ali himself is coming here... soon?

1158
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:04,773
Inshallah!

1159
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,239
That means "God willing."

1160
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:08,577
Right! Right, right,
God willing.

1161
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:11,551
Yes, well, It would be economically
wonderful for Reno.

1162
01:05:11,685 --> 01:05:14,040
I mean, and spiritually too,
of course.

1163
01:05:14,598 --> 01:05:16,231
The spiritual is always permanent.

1164
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,575
Why, yes it is!

1165
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:18,692
Yes it is!

1166
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:20,262
It certainly is!

1167
01:05:20,996 --> 01:05:24,996
I want you to know that you can call your new
friend Jimmy anytime you need something.

1168
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:26,793
Will you do that?

1169
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,223
Good luck tonight, Charlie.

1170
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:30,621
Good luck to you too, Jim.

1171
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:33,309
Politicians...

1172
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:34,858
They can be useful.

1173
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,075
Yeah, in small doses.

1174
01:05:36,153 --> 01:05:37,145
So. How is Bruza?

1175
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,909
I mean, he's got to look good,
or the network wont pay.

1176
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,939
The kid is champing at
the bit, he's ready.

1177
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:44,207
I'm telling you, he can be good.

1178
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:51,074
I'll knock him out.

1179
01:05:51,432 --> 01:05:52,723
Of course.

1180
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:59,325
- Hi.
- Come in, come in.

1181
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,792
Hi!

1182
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:02,122
Beautiful!

1183
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,653
Oh, my God!

1184
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:07,207
You look completely different
without your beard.

1185
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:09,753
Look! Look what I've made for you.

1186
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:14,434
- It's mi lingo! Bruza!
- Si!

1187
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,770
Beautiful!

1188
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,114
And look, Charlie wanted you to wear this,
advertise the Ranch...

1189
01:06:21,402 --> 01:06:24,114
He wants to advertise the Ranch...

1190
01:06:29,348 --> 01:06:30,291
- And that...
- Shh!

1191
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:31,747
Yeeh!

1192
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,723
- Bruza!
- Yeah!

1193
01:06:39,988 --> 01:06:41,035
You know what?

1194
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:43,980
I'm gonna knock him out
in the first round.

1195
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:48,373
Jab, jab at the body
and a big right, and...

1196
01:06:52,644 --> 01:06:53,927
Your boy's catchin'.

1197
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:57,198
A slow starter, will wring rust.

1198
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:58,728
Hold buddy, he'll be there!

1199
01:07:05,332 --> 01:07:06,797
He's gone, he's gone!

1200
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:24,114
Yeah!

1201
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:28,787
You seen that?
I told you he was ready!

1202
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:31,285
You see that fucking right?
He almost took his head off.

1203
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,151
Come on, Bruza!

1204
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:39,537
How about that, honey?
Uh? Uh?

1205
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,948
This is great.

1206
01:07:41,043 --> 01:07:42,793
Seven... Eight...

1207
01:07:54,434 --> 01:07:56,529
Break!
Break it up!

1208
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,952
Let them fight!
Let them fight!

1209
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:07,632
Colter, fake it!

1210
01:08:10,522 --> 01:08:12,070
That's the way to go, Bruza!

1211
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:16,288
It is going just like
I dreamed, honey.

1212
01:08:16,446 --> 01:08:17,983
You let that bum get away.

1213
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,179
We should be home by now.

1214
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:24,304
Please welcome our first
Love Ranch beauty... Mallory!

1215
01:08:24,387 --> 01:08:26,988
Hey! Hey!
This guy is on fire!

1216
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:29,088
Maybe we should go, like,
close circuit...

1217
01:08:29,175 --> 01:08:30,292
Then network.

1218
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,246
And a 5% of course, of course!

1219
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:34,293
You know, the fight ain't over yet.

1220
01:08:35,374 --> 01:08:38,128
Maybe after the fight,
I'm gonna ask you for 60%.

1221
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:40,792
Stay away from him!
Keep that left in his face!

1222
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:44,714
Think. Breathe through your nose.
Calm down.

1223
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,268
I'm gonna rip his balls off.

1224
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,848
That's it!
That's knock-down number two!

1225
01:09:13,907 --> 01:09:15,313
No knock-down, no knock-down!

1226
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:18,304
It's not knock-down man, he was pushed!

1227
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,919
That's not regular.

1228
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:22,169
That's because he was hanging on him!
It's not his fault.

1229
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,975
The referee got to break them up!

1230
01:09:26,148 --> 01:09:28,017
See, your boy lost this round.

1231
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,616
I'm telling you, because of the ref.

1232
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:43,980
Opened his eye!
He opened his eye.

1233
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,175
C'mon! C'mon!

1234
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,534
Charlie he got a little cut here.

1235
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:02,588
It's a wonder it's all he's got, the
way he's fighting. I don't get it.

1236
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:04,590
Ok, folks! Welcome...

1237
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:06,659
Alana!

1238
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:25,203
Are you cut motherfucker?
Hearing me?***

1239
01:10:25,947 --> 01:10:26,806
Come on!

1240
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:37,061
Stop!

1241
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:38,219
Time out!

1242
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,483
Charlie! This guy's trained
on blow-jobs or what?

1243
01:10:45,725 --> 01:10:47,288
I've been saying,
work on his left eye.

1244
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:51,216
If you go over the cut above the eye,
they'll stop fight.

1245
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,343
Show him the heavy,
brother, move it!

1246
01:10:53,741 --> 01:10:56,692
All right, let's welcome Angel!

1247
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:07,673
It's over, Bruza fall, Bruza fall!

1248
01:11:07,988 --> 01:11:09,018
Charlie...

1249
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:10,393
It's over.

1250
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:13,510
Neutral corner!

1251
01:11:14,954 --> 01:11:15,985
Two...

1252
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,852
Three...

1253
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:20,680
Four...

1254
01:11:21,297 --> 01:11:22,938
Five...

1255
01:11:23,672 --> 01:11:25,344
Six...

1256
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:27,414
Seven...

1257
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:29,039
Eight...

1258
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,495
Okay?

1259
01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:34,571
Go! Go!

1260
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,596
Hey you!
I got you, damn fool!

1261
01:12:03,746 --> 01:12:05,627
Come on, doctor!
Doctor come on here!

1262
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:07,627
Hey Charlie!

1263
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,692
Charlie, maybe you should take me up
on my offer for a boost!

1264
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:14,854
He's to die, but
don't worry about it!

1265
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:18,081
- No! Excuse me madam.
- I'm his manager.

1266
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,411
Get out of my way!!

1267
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,315
Please, give me
one more round, please.

1268
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:25,268
- One more round!
- No!

1269
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:27,439
I can do it!
One more round!

1270
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,620
One more round! Please!

1271
01:12:28,714 --> 01:12:29,542
One more round!

1272
01:12:29,598 --> 01:12:31,111
One more round!, and that's it.

1273
01:12:32,113 --> 01:12:33,050
One more.

1274
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:35,003
- Please, stop!
- I want one more round!

1275
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,129
Trust me!
Trust me! One more round!

1276
01:12:37,168 --> 01:12:39,387
You can't let him do this,
it's crazy.

1277
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,862
He don't listen to me!

1278
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,300
Do something this round
or it's over.

1279
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,352
Work on that eye!

1280
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:05,402
Oh, shit!

1281
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:07,144
You put blood on me!

1282
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:08,878
Who's gonna clean it?

1283
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:10,496
I'll tell you, you are!

1284
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:13,932
I think is you!
It's you!

1285
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:19,931
All right?

1286
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,181
All right?

1287
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:23,782
That's all now?

1288
01:13:23,824 --> 01:13:25,500
Why, when I'm done with you...

1289
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,660
Your granny over there
wont be able to...

1290
01:13:54,757 --> 01:13:56,461
Bruza! Bruza!

1291
01:13:56,694 --> 01:13:57,874
You are okay?

1292
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:06,720
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner...

1293
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,819
By way of knock-out...

1294
01:14:10,755 --> 01:14:12,457
Armando...

1295
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:15,223
The Wild Bull...

1296
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,987
Bruza!

1297
01:14:18,151 --> 01:14:27,745
Bruza! Bruza! Bruza! Bruza!

1298
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:28,762
Get me out of here.

1299
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,051
I'm gonna take him away, okay?

1300
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,353
I'm gonna go to Naasih!

1301
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:35,496
Bruza! Bruza! Bruza! Bruza!

1302
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:36,973
- Ooh!
- Bruza, what is it?

1303
01:14:37,043 --> 01:14:38,349
Take me to the hospital.

1304
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:39,230
- Prado!
- Si!

1305
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,421
No, no, I want you to
take me to the hospital.

1306
01:14:41,488 --> 01:14:42,582
Come on!

1307
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:47,238
Hey, Naasih!

1308
01:14:48,091 --> 01:14:49,382
What are you doing?
Come on up here,

1309
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:51,413
We're celebrating and
then we're gonna go to some to eat.

1310
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,101
With the girls.
Come on!

1311
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:54,772
No, I'll call you later.

1312
01:14:55,014 --> 01:14:56,514
We're gonna have dinner
over at the Ranch...

1313
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,894
We can talk about
the Ali contract.

1314
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:03,116
Charles Bontempo?
Can I have a word with you?

1315
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:05,617
Robert Bellner,
Internal Revenue Service.

1316
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:08,100
We tried to reach you
at the Ranch many times...

1317
01:15:08,164 --> 01:15:10,038
But we haven't been able
to get a hold of you.

1318
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,461
What's your name again?

1319
01:15:22,294 --> 01:15:24,968
That little fag has messed
me up good, eh?

1320
01:15:25,865 --> 01:15:27,277
Sure did.

1321
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,382
I look like...

1322
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:32,417
A monster.

1323
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:33,565
Yeah!

1324
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:34,920
Frankenstein.

1325
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:42,082
I'm come to suck your blood...

1326
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:46,067
- It's Dracula.
- What?

1327
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:48,452
Dracula sucks blood,
not Frankenstein.

1328
01:15:49,262 --> 01:15:50,375
I'm sorry.

1329
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,184
Wrong monster.

1330
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:54,262
Wrong monster...

1331
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:04,954
What?

1332
01:16:05,426 --> 01:16:06,395
What is it?

1333
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:09,224
My head!
Hell, my head!

1334
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,549
Your head?

1335
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:15,438
Okay, I'll get you there.
We're near now.

1336
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:28,273
Intensive Care Unit

1337
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,481
What are you doing in here?

1338
01:17:02,714 --> 01:17:04,782
I'm here to see Armando Bruza.

1339
01:17:05,312 --> 01:17:07,942
I'm afraid ICU is off limits,
Mrs. Bruza.

1340
01:17:08,746 --> 01:17:09,661
No...

1341
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:12,628
Bontempo, Mrs. Bontempo.

1342
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,012
Your relationship to the patient?

1343
01:17:14,112 --> 01:17:15,223
I'm his manager.

1344
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:16,374
Is he going to be all right?

1345
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,616
His manager.

1346
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:20,218
You ought to be in jail.

1347
01:17:21,052 --> 01:17:21,921
Why?

1348
01:17:22,035 --> 01:17:23,787
This man had a craniotomy.

1349
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:26,012
A cra...

1350
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:27,787
A brain operation.

1351
01:17:27,949 --> 01:17:30,707
Mr. Bruza has a
metal plate in his head.

1352
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,371
He has a 6 inches scar in his
skull, did you not know this?

1353
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:34,815
No, no, I didn't.

1354
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,393
No.

1355
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,917
He never said anything
about any operation.

1356
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:42,121
Mr. Bruza has no business
being in a prizefight ring.

1357
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:43,910
He has no business
wearing a tight hat.

1358
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:45,479
Please don't lecture me!

1359
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:47,862
Just tell me,
is he going to be all right?

1360
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,199
With brain injuries,
it's hard to tell.

1361
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:54,770
Oh my God...

1362
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,309
Oh, my God...

1363
01:17:58,629 --> 01:18:01,273
We've put Mr. Bruza in a
medically induced coma.

1364
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:04,581
We'll wake him up tomorrow morning
and do tests, observe him.

1365
01:18:05,058 --> 01:18:06,449
Look, Mrs. Bontempo...

1366
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:07,506
Go home...

1367
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,673
Get some sleep, and...

1368
01:18:10,726 --> 01:18:11,967
Call me tomorrow.

1369
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:14,857
Thank you.

1370
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:17,928
I drove his car here.

1371
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:19,440
What shall I...

1372
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:20,537
Can I...

1373
01:18:20,684 --> 01:18:22,037
Call you a taxi?

1374
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:24,186
Yes!

1375
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,193
Thank you.

1376
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:28,138
I'll let the nurse tell you
when the taxi arrives.

1377
01:19:04,361 --> 01:19:05,773
Where the fuck were you?

1378
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:07,666
I was in the hospital.

1379
01:19:07,728 --> 01:19:09,970
I've been looking
for you all fucking night.

1380
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,633
Somebody had to
take him to the hospital...

1381
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:14,445
Why the fuck did you have to take him?
Why not fucking Prado take him?

1382
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,672
Because he wanted
me to take him!

1383
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:18,101
You are the one who wanted
me to be his manager.

1384
01:19:18,164 --> 01:19:20,655
What did you fucking do, operate him?
You've blood all over your face.

1385
01:19:20,749 --> 01:19:22,626
- I have?
- Yeah!

1386
01:19:22,772 --> 01:19:24,609
Grace I've been fucking
looking up for you!

1387
01:19:24,679 --> 01:19:26,912
You don't know the fuck I
went through all night.

1388
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,530
I was looking for you...
How's the fucking loser anyway?

1389
01:19:29,585 --> 01:19:30,554
He's bad!

1390
01:19:30,618 --> 01:19:32,305
Bad, Charlie, he's really bad.

1391
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:34,704
Did you know... he had a plate
in his head?

1392
01:19:35,149 --> 01:19:37,165
No, I mean what did they do, operate
and put in a plate, you mean?

1393
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:39,173
No, no! He had an
operation some time ago.

1394
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:41,602
You know he could
have died fighting?

1395
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,907
Did you know that?

1396
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,447
You mean before the fight
he had a plate?

1397
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,868
Yeah, yeah, some time ago.

1398
01:19:48,486 --> 01:19:50,080
What the fuck is going on?

1399
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:51,719
They sold us damaged goods!

1400
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:54,907
I mean they hadn't noticed
before the fight, Grace!

1401
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,329
This is like they sold us
damaged goods!

1402
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,384
This fucking spick!

1403
01:19:58,462 --> 01:20:00,594
His fucking head should blow up
in that fucking hospital.

1404
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:01,829
It should explode!

1405
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:04,383
Listen to me! He nearly died
and he fought a great fight.

1406
01:20:04,428 --> 01:20:06,468
What the fuck...
Hey I'm fucking talking to you!

1407
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:07,743
Where the fuck are you going?

1408
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,188
What's wrong with you?

1409
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:11,212
You listening to what
I'm telling you?

1410
01:20:11,252 --> 01:20:13,877
I mean this fucking
fellow up hard on me tonight...

1411
01:20:13,941 --> 01:20:16,735
Everything that I fucking
worked for, for us!

1412
01:20:16,852 --> 01:20:18,360
All my fucking dreams!

1413
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:22,360
You worry about a fucking spick head
blowing up, who was looking to fuck us?

1414
01:20:22,858 --> 01:20:24,571
What's wrong with you?

1415
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:28,063
Fucking Naasih said we'll not
even get the Ali fight...

1416
01:20:28,143 --> 01:20:30,359
Because even though he won,
the fighter looks bad!

1417
01:20:30,423 --> 01:20:31,759
So we are not getting that!

1418
01:20:31,821 --> 01:20:32,673
Everything!

1419
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,837
On top of everything else,
in the middle of fucking the ring,

1420
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,555
A guy walks up to me
and hands me a paper....

1421
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,575
The IRS has summoned me...

1422
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:42,803
In my... In my fucking fight!

1423
01:20:42,908 --> 01:20:46,025
Why don't they just take a broom so
they can shove it up my fucking ass!

1424
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:48,208
And everybody says "Where's Grace?"

1425
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:49,358
"Where's Grace?"

1426
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:51,670
What's going on... I am looking around...
What the fuck is going on?

1427
01:20:51,718 --> 01:20:52,795
Charlie, let's...

1428
01:20:52,857 --> 01:20:55,495
Charlie, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

1429
01:20:55,692 --> 01:20:56,524
I'm sorry.

1430
01:20:57,508 --> 01:20:59,443
Right now, I'm really cold...

1431
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,803
I'm really tired, and I want
to go to bed.

1432
01:21:03,622 --> 01:21:04,860
We'll talk about it later.

1433
01:21:05,381 --> 01:21:07,106
Not your fault, Grace.
Is that it?

1434
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:09,512
My problem, uh?

1435
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:49,697
Fucking whores, do you ever think about
cleaning up after yourselves in here?

1436
01:21:49,777 --> 01:21:50,972
It stinks!

1437
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:54,628
Is it not why we pay you
50% of our salaries?

1438
01:21:54,757 --> 01:21:56,417
Excuse me, what did you say?

1439
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,049
I said, is it not what we pay you 50% for?

1440
01:22:01,123 --> 01:22:03,361
No, it is not that you pay me 50% for it.

1441
01:22:03,528 --> 01:22:06,503
As a matter of fact I do purchase a lot
of things like soap and water...

1442
01:22:06,682 --> 01:22:08,994
Which I don't think you use too much,
because you got some...

1443
01:22:09,112 --> 01:22:12,221
Smelly pussies around here
the guys don't want to pay for!

1444
01:22:13,209 --> 01:22:14,376
Fuck you!

1445
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,545
Fuck me? No, fuck you,
you little fuck you!

1446
01:22:18,623 --> 01:22:20,901
Fuck me, after all the shit
I do around here?

1447
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:22,604
You talk to me that way?

1448
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:25,881
You better get your fucking priorities
straight, who the fuck you're talking to!

1449
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:29,299
Fuck me? Fuck you!
Get your shit, pack off, out!

1450
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,120
Out! Get the fuck out of here!

1451
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:35,010
Are you serious?

1452
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:36,826
Yes I'm fucking serious!

1453
01:22:36,897 --> 01:22:39,385
I'm tired of your fucking
smart mouth, shit!

1454
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:42,418
What kind of shit is that after all
I fucking do for you, girls?

1455
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:46,135
You'd better fucking clean this fucking
place up a little bit, it fucking stinks!

1456
01:22:46,349 --> 01:22:47,550
Five minutes.

1457
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:49,460
I new dress?

1458
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:53,233
I'll fucking teach you to motherfucking
blame my head 'cause I said it.

1459
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:56,135
I'm fucking saying I can smell a shit.

1460
01:22:57,837 --> 01:22:59,973
Fucking stinking motherfuckers!

1461
01:23:00,052 --> 01:23:02,294
It fucking stinks around here!

1462
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,734
Fuck him!

1463
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:06,864
Don't worry about him,
I'll talk to Grace.

1464
01:23:10,081 --> 01:23:11,120
Grace!

1465
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:15,891
It's me!

1466
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,338
You scared the shit out of me!

1467
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,338
How the hell
did you get in here?

1468
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:23,869
Through the window.

1469
01:23:26,857 --> 01:23:28,674
You're supposed to be
in the hospital.

1470
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:29,550
Yes but...

1471
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,299
They woke me up this morning
and they wanted to...

1472
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:34,836
Drill holes inside my brain.

1473
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,682
I said fuck you!
I'm leaving now.

1474
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:40,205
Look what they did to me.

1475
01:23:40,278 --> 01:23:41,563
Your hair.

1476
01:23:42,275 --> 01:23:43,565
This is terrible, uh?

1477
01:23:43,638 --> 01:23:45,018
No more Wild Bull.

1478
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:46,784
Look at that!

1479
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:48,854
Look at that!

1480
01:23:49,268 --> 01:23:51,955
My God!
You had that scar all along!

1481
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:53,081
Yeah!

1482
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,438
I had.

1483
01:23:54,494 --> 01:23:56,938
That doctor said you could have
died fighting in that ring...

1484
01:23:56,994 --> 01:23:58,214
Why did you do that?

1485
01:23:58,276 --> 01:23:59,829
Grace, I'm a fighter,
so I fight.

1486
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,830
Don't give me that macho shit!

1487
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,674
He said you could
die at any time.

1488
01:24:05,996 --> 01:24:07,550
But I wanted to see you.

1489
01:24:08,957 --> 01:24:10,534
I wanted to see you.

1490
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:13,979
I don't give a shit, I die, I die.

1491
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,526
What?

1492
01:24:25,459 --> 01:24:26,528
What?

1493
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,237
Oh my God, it's a joke,
it's the biggest joke in the...

1494
01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:33,268
Fucking history of the world.

1495
01:24:33,647 --> 01:24:35,650
What is a joke,
what do you mean?

1496
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,424
I'm dying too.

1497
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:40,963
What?

1498
01:24:41,104 --> 01:24:43,960
Yes... I've got...
I don't know...

1499
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:47,312
Six months, maybe less, maybe more.

1500
01:24:49,003 --> 01:24:51,734
- That's not true.
- Yes, I had all the tests.

1501
01:24:52,503 --> 01:24:53,843
Cancer...

1502
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,752
Yeah, nobody knows, not even Charlie.

1503
01:24:57,464 --> 01:24:58,943
You gonna tell him Grace...

1504
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:01,202
You know when I found out?

1505
01:25:01,528 --> 01:25:03,862
I found out the day that I met you.

1506
01:25:04,779 --> 01:25:05,930
Remember?

1507
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,123
In the gym.

1508
01:25:07,176 --> 01:25:09,408
You took off your headgear
and all that...

1509
01:25:09,768 --> 01:25:11,682
Beautiful hair came out.

1510
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:12,714
Remember?

1511
01:25:17,728 --> 01:25:19,072
Get it?

1512
01:25:20,062 --> 01:25:21,884
We're both dying, Grace!

1513
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,291
Some punch-line, uh?

1514
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,478
Grace?

1515
01:25:31,549 --> 01:25:32,718
You in there?

1516
01:25:33,697 --> 01:25:34,798
Yeah?

1517
01:25:35,955 --> 01:25:38,515
Charlie has just fired Mallory.
You got to get out here...

1518
01:25:38,893 --> 01:25:39,745
I...

1519
01:25:39,846 --> 01:25:41,455
Well, I can't come right now.

1520
01:25:42,702 --> 01:25:44,189
Grace, you don't want
to lose Mallory...

1521
01:25:44,252 --> 01:25:47,018
Charlie is going insane.
You really have to come out here now..

1522
01:25:47,463 --> 01:25:50,024
Okay, I'll be there in
five minutes, okay?

1523
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,111
Listen, you better hurry...

1524
01:25:58,167 --> 01:25:59,604
I don't know where Charlie is.

1525
01:26:00,247 --> 01:26:02,276
My God, you'd better get out of here.
You know, if Charlie...

1526
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:03,518
I'm not afraid of Charlie.

1527
01:26:03,563 --> 01:26:05,533
Please, please, you got to go,
you got to go now...

1528
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,018
Go out the window.

1529
01:26:07,957 --> 01:26:09,231
But I go with you.

1530
01:26:10,116 --> 01:26:11,249
What do you mean with me?

1531
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:12,524
- Where?
- With you, yeah!

1532
01:26:12,586 --> 01:26:13,554
Anywhere!

1533
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,469
Out of here!

1534
01:26:16,466 --> 01:26:18,133
Please, please, out of here.

1535
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:23,656
Oh no, no, no,
I can't do that, I can't...

1536
01:26:23,837 --> 01:26:25,077
I am afraid, I...

1537
01:26:25,188 --> 01:26:27,430
Grace, Grace, look at me!
Look at me, please.

1538
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,313
You're not afraid of nothing.

1539
01:26:30,871 --> 01:26:31,805
Okay?

1540
01:26:34,506 --> 01:26:35,495
Okay!

1541
01:26:36,815 --> 01:26:38,405
Look ahead!
Hey, hey, don't...

1542
01:26:38,641 --> 01:26:39,563
So!

1543
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:42,163
It's not like this is not...
troubled this night, you know?

1544
01:26:42,214 --> 01:26:45,381
All of a sudden, walking down
the aisle comes this IRS guy.

1545
01:26:45,748 --> 01:26:50,609
He's walking down the aisle like death! The
fucking Grim Reaper, you know, I'm no....

1546
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:52,391
Oh, fuck!

1547
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:53,602
Oh, fuck!

1548
01:26:54,164 --> 01:26:55,521
Oh, yeah!

1549
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,656
- Is that Grace?
- Forget her.

1550
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:03,742
Looks like Grace.
Where the fuck is she going?

1551
01:27:04,027 --> 01:27:05,594
Come on, Charlie!

1552
01:27:05,759 --> 01:27:07,046
But... Wait! Wait up!

1553
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:08,430
Charlie baby!

1554
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,704
Fucking asshole!

1555
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:14,930
Hey, Grace!

1556
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,914
Shit!
What shall I do?

1557
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,340
No, come on, I drove my car
from the hospital.

1558
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,828
Ok, give me the keys.

1559
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:22,828
Grace, what's going on?

1560
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:24,493
Hurry!

1561
01:27:25,973 --> 01:27:26,961
Grace!

1562
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,617
What the hell is going on?

1563
01:27:35,357 --> 01:27:36,301
Shit!

1564
01:28:50,661 --> 01:28:51,531
Where are we?

1565
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:52,585
California.

1566
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:53,796
Not way!

1567
01:28:54,013 --> 01:28:56,140
Yeah! Reno is just half an hour
from the border.

1568
01:28:57,204 --> 01:28:59,125
Where are the girls in bikinis?

1569
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:03,507
My mom used to bring me up here,
when she wasn't drinking.

1570
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:06,554
I had forgotten how
beautiful it is.

1571
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:08,193
A good place to think.

1572
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:10,078
You want to think?

1573
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,111
Listen to this.

1574
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,076
Well, you seem to be
feeling better.

1575
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:29,187
You make me feel better.

1576
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,257
It's beautiful, uh?

1577
01:29:32,381 --> 01:29:33,492
Who is that?

1578
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:35,096
Carlos Gardel.

1579
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:37,178
- Who?
- Carlos Gardel.

1580
01:29:37,273 --> 01:29:38,789
Cardo... Carder...

1581
01:29:39,585 --> 01:29:41,179
Cardo Gardel!

1582
01:29:41,633 --> 01:29:43,008
Carlos Gardel!

1583
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:44,828
Cardo Garvel!

1584
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:47,742
He is God!

1585
01:29:48,025 --> 01:29:49,156
- He is God?
- Yeah!

1586
01:29:50,102 --> 01:29:52,046
No, no, Elvis is God.

1587
01:29:52,781 --> 01:29:53,859
No, Carlos Gardel.

1588
01:29:54,344 --> 01:29:55,445
No, Elvis.

1589
01:29:55,579 --> 01:29:57,171
Carlos Gardel is God.

1590
01:29:57,289 --> 01:30:00,710
You know? Here is God, here is Elvis,
and here is Carlos Gardel.

1591
01:30:00,765 --> 01:30:02,328
- No!
- Yeah!

1592
01:30:07,023 --> 01:30:08,012
Grace?

1593
01:30:15,698 --> 01:30:17,241
Grace, you in here?

1594
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:21,538
Looking for Grace?

1595
01:30:22,702 --> 01:30:23,615
Charlie!

1596
01:30:24,282 --> 01:30:25,568
She's not here.

1597
01:30:25,933 --> 01:30:28,898
Why don't you sit down? We'll have
a drink and wait for her together.

1598
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:30,398
That's Ok, Charlie.

1599
01:30:30,772 --> 01:30:31,858
I'll come back later.

1600
01:30:38,595 --> 01:30:40,450
You knew about
this thing, Irene?

1601
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:41,539
What?

1602
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:43,595
You knew about her fucking this spick.

1603
01:30:44,394 --> 01:30:46,068
I don't know what you're
talking about, Charlie.

1604
01:30:46,295 --> 01:30:49,748
You didn't know that she was fucking around
with this fighter, with this fucking spick?

1605
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:55,511
Charlie, I have just found
out about it this afternoon.

1606
01:30:55,965 --> 01:30:57,379
But I got to tell you something.

1607
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,213
I'm happy for her.

1608
01:30:59,526 --> 01:31:03,062
I hope she's banging the shit out of him. I
hope she's having a thunder of fucking life.

1609
01:31:06,237 --> 01:31:07,754
How can you be fucking happy?

1610
01:31:07,825 --> 01:31:09,411
How can you be that, uh?

1611
01:31:09,473 --> 01:31:11,090
You know what she meant to me?

1612
01:31:11,176 --> 01:31:13,238
- It doesn't feel so good, does it!
- Get out!

1613
01:31:13,309 --> 01:31:14,395
Get the fuck out!

1614
01:31:14,457 --> 01:31:17,105
Listen little man, it doesn't
feel so good, does it?

1615
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:19,379
Warren!

1616
01:31:19,535 --> 01:31:20,668
Get hold of Johnny boy.

1617
01:31:20,715 --> 01:31:22,356
Get him over, we're going
to take care of something.

1618
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:31,795
Mom and I used to come up here
and tent in the summertime.

1619
01:31:32,368 --> 01:31:34,459
"Two little girl scouts," she called it.

1620
01:31:34,881 --> 01:31:36,084
I loved it!

1621
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,295
What's this?

1622
01:31:37,677 --> 01:31:39,107
That's for emergencies.

1623
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:41,332
You know, it gets
snowed out, here.

1624
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:45,060
This is the Donner Path,
famous in American history.

1625
01:31:45,462 --> 01:31:47,192
There was cannibalism here.

1626
01:31:47,258 --> 01:31:48,529
- Canibalismo?
- Yeah!

1627
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,779
- Here?
- Yeah!

1628
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,458
Yeah!

1629
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:53,560
You know, there was this
wagon train...

1630
01:31:53,646 --> 01:31:56,615
They came through here and they got
snowed in. They run out of...

1631
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:57,795
Food.

1632
01:31:58,044 --> 01:32:02,318
There was this Indian tribe living around here
and they'd never seen white people before.

1633
01:32:02,887 --> 01:32:04,639
They peeked through the trees at them...

1634
01:32:04,795 --> 01:32:06,654
And they saw them
cooking bodies.

1635
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,779
And one of the Indians
turned to the other one and said:

1636
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:12,256
"They eat of each other."

1637
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,506
- They ate each other, uh?
- Yeah.

1638
01:32:38,923 --> 01:32:40,157
You know?

1639
01:32:40,619 --> 01:32:42,094
- I kind of like it.
- I like it.

1640
01:32:42,134 --> 01:32:43,588
I could get used to it.

1641
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,766
- To what?
- To your hair!

1642
01:32:45,907 --> 01:32:48,617
No, no!
It's horrible.

1643
01:32:49,603 --> 01:32:51,935
Have you read the book
about Samson, in the Bible?

1644
01:32:52,012 --> 01:32:53,419
Do you believe in this stuff?

1645
01:32:53,487 --> 01:32:55,532
Yes, every word!

1646
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:58,009
I know I'm going to hell.

1647
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:01,708
And I'm not going to be alone!

1648
01:33:01,763 --> 01:33:03,763
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1649
01:33:04,123 --> 01:33:05,566
Who's going with you?

1650
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:07,019
You.

1651
01:33:07,974 --> 01:33:08,935
Charlie.

1652
01:33:09,054 --> 01:33:11,016
That's for sure.

1653
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,849
Almost everybody.

1654
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,583
You know, what you
said before is right.

1655
01:33:22,904 --> 01:33:24,706
We still eat each other.

1656
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:30,003
We still eat each other....

1657
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:55,208
I hurt people who loved me.

1658
01:33:56,357 --> 01:33:57,357
Grace...

1659
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:01,685
My family...

1660
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:06,610
I saw, I saw that picture on the wall,
in your trailer, I know.

1661
01:34:17,034 --> 01:34:18,058
That was...

1662
01:34:18,885 --> 01:34:21,409
That was the most
happy time for me.

1663
01:34:24,853 --> 01:34:26,378
I loved my wife.

1664
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:30,010
We had our son.

1665
01:34:32,147 --> 01:34:33,698
I said to myself...

1666
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:36,965
"Finally, I've put up something real."

1667
01:34:40,854 --> 01:34:42,385
I think: "Maybe I fight..."

1668
01:34:42,456 --> 01:34:44,878
"One, two more times, and then..."

1669
01:34:45,956 --> 01:34:49,135
"And then we move to the
countryside, you know?"

1670
01:34:49,956 --> 01:34:51,768
"Away from everything."

1671
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,760
But I'm stupid, Grace.

1672
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:00,413
In Argentina, I am a hero.

1673
01:35:01,753 --> 01:35:03,284
Money, women...

1674
01:35:04,526 --> 01:35:05,801
Everything is free.

1675
01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:10,448
Then one day I met
a movie star in Buenos Aires...

1676
01:35:12,758 --> 01:35:14,229
She is very beautiful...

1677
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,806
I am the champion...

1678
01:35:20,096 --> 01:35:22,909
My wife read about it
in the papers, and...

1679
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:28,487
She jumps out of the window...

1680
01:35:33,212 --> 01:35:34,406
With my boy.

1681
01:35:34,636 --> 01:35:35,745
I know, I know...

1682
01:35:35,815 --> 01:35:38,378
You know, I read about it
in a fight magazine.

1683
01:35:40,907 --> 01:35:43,034
So you know why
I fight with this...

1684
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:46,292
Thing in my head.

1685
01:35:50,116 --> 01:35:51,846
I don't know... Maybe...

1686
01:35:52,721 --> 01:35:54,729
- I deserve the pain.
- No.

1687
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:58,206
I don't care what happens to me.

1688
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:06,237
I only care about...

1689
01:36:06,549 --> 01:36:08,010
Being here...

1690
01:36:09,167 --> 01:36:10,144
With you.

1691
01:36:12,736 --> 01:36:14,424
Now I been thinking and...

1692
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:16,346
I don't know....

1693
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:18,636
How much time we got.

1694
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:24,370
Two months, two weeks...

1695
01:36:25,463 --> 01:36:27,784
Two minutes...
I don't know and...

1696
01:36:29,347 --> 01:36:30,690
I don't care neither.

1697
01:37:08,534 --> 01:37:09,683
Bruza...

1698
01:37:11,275 --> 01:37:12,264
Bruza, wake up.

1699
01:37:13,387 --> 01:37:14,768
Bruza, wake up!

1700
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:16,026
Wake up!

1701
01:37:16,606 --> 01:37:18,403
Bruza! Armando!

1702
01:37:20,182 --> 01:37:21,690
What?
What happens?

1703
01:37:23,349 --> 01:37:25,704
Listen, I got to go
back to the ranch.

1704
01:37:26,292 --> 01:37:27,221
To the Ranch?

1705
01:37:27,286 --> 01:37:28,198
Yes, now.

1706
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,230
No, no!

1707
01:37:29,281 --> 01:37:30,182
For what?

1708
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:31,245
For what?

1709
01:37:31,455 --> 01:37:32,815
We got to go away from there!

1710
01:37:32,911 --> 01:37:34,503
I know, I want to,
I will, but...

1711
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:35,745
No, no, it's a mistake!

1712
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,229
The Ranch, it's over for you.

1713
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:38,917
Whatever we need, we can get!

1714
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,979
I have to go back.
I have to make my peace with Charlie.

1715
01:37:42,066 --> 01:37:44,072
I owe him that.
Do you understand?

1716
01:37:44,142 --> 01:37:45,595
- Ok, then I'm going with you.
- No!

1717
01:37:45,643 --> 01:37:47,112
- No!
- Yes.

1718
01:37:47,182 --> 01:37:49,721
You have no idea
what he is capable of.

1719
01:37:49,912 --> 01:37:52,037
I can handle Charlie.
Don't worry!

1720
01:37:52,102 --> 01:37:54,005
Ok, what do you want
me to do, stay here?

1721
01:37:54,071 --> 01:37:56,795
No, no, I know
somewhere to take you.

1722
01:38:06,287 --> 01:38:07,178
Okay!

1723
01:38:07,491 --> 01:38:09,677
Listen, you'll be safe here.

1724
01:38:09,803 --> 01:38:11,287
These people hate Charlie.

1725
01:38:11,459 --> 01:38:15,576
He used to have a suite at the hotel here and
then he screwed them on a business deal..

1726
01:38:16,985 --> 01:38:20,677
But he got spies everywhere,
so, do not leave your room...

1727
01:38:20,754 --> 01:38:23,632
- Promise me. You will not leave your room!
- I promise, I promise.

1728
01:38:23,841 --> 01:38:26,287
- Okay.
- Ah... take this.

1729
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:30,935
You know, when I came
to the US...

1730
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:32,935
I only knew two words in English...

1731
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,029
So maybe this is not so good,
but I wrote it for you.

1732
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:38,306
A poem... you...

1733
01:38:39,037 --> 01:38:41,008
- You wrote me a poem?
- Yeah!

1734
01:38:41,318 --> 01:38:42,662
I am Argentinian.

1735
01:38:43,403 --> 01:38:46,844
I couldn't be only a fighter...
I must be a poet, you know?

1736
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:49,412
You can read it now,
it's not so long.

1737
01:38:50,274 --> 01:38:52,287
You're a caress to my brain...

1738
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,490
You are the refuge
from my pain...

1739
01:38:56,286 --> 01:38:57,594
- You're my beauty.
- You're my beauty.

1740
01:39:01,114 --> 01:39:02,365
Is it okay?

1741
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,379
It's is beautiful.

1742
01:39:09,856 --> 01:39:11,264
I know.

1743
01:39:12,148 --> 01:39:13,398
Heyhey!

1744
01:39:23,356 --> 01:39:25,615
- I'll be here.
- Ok. Ok.

1745
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:37,152
Taxi!

1746
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:53,609
Grace's back here, Charlie.

1747
01:39:53,706 --> 01:39:55,350
Really?
When did she get in?

1748
01:39:55,437 --> 01:39:56,652
45 minutes ago.

1749
01:39:56,879 --> 01:39:59,234
- Well, thank you.
- I work at the bar, Charlie.

1750
01:40:17,697 --> 01:40:19,105
I remember that luggage.

1751
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:23,640
You're packing, uh?

1752
01:40:29,228 --> 01:40:33,195
Did I ever tell you what Prado
told me about Bruza's wife?

1753
01:40:34,202 --> 01:40:36,665
I don't know, it's
not very nice that...

1754
01:40:36,962 --> 01:40:38,548
You know, Bruza
jilted his wife...

1755
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,796
And she was so upset
that she took a...

1756
01:40:40,867 --> 01:40:43,226
Plunge off a
20-storey building...

1757
01:40:43,312 --> 01:40:44,945
With one of his kids
in her arms.

1758
01:40:45,695 --> 01:40:47,557
Imagine that,
one of your own kids.

1759
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,492
He never even made the funeral, 'cause he
was too high on coke and stuff, I heard...

1760
01:40:52,664 --> 01:40:54,149
It doesn't matter, Charlie.

1761
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:55,499
None of it does.

1762
01:40:55,709 --> 01:40:57,062
It doesn't matter, uh?

1763
01:40:57,226 --> 01:40:58,656
None of that matters.

1764
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:02,265
I wonder what matters.

1765
01:41:02,828 --> 01:41:04,422
Do you think something like...

1766
01:41:04,843 --> 01:41:06,914
You fucking him in our bed,
would matter?

1767
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:10,508
Who's bed are we talking about Charlie? When was
the last time you ever spent the night here?

1768
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:12,147
Oh God, dear Grace!

1769
01:41:12,264 --> 01:41:16,338
All this girls I ever fucked around
mean nothing to me, and you know it.

1770
01:41:16,468 --> 01:41:18,906
You're my wife, I never touched
anybody in our bed.

1771
01:41:18,999 --> 01:41:21,921
I'm your business partner,
that's all I have ever really been.

1772
01:41:21,976 --> 01:41:23,656
That's not true
and you know that.

1773
01:41:24,187 --> 01:41:27,131
What about family?
We were going to have kids, you forgot?

1774
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,170
We wanted them...

1775
01:41:29,688 --> 01:41:30,860
We tried.

1776
01:41:35,928 --> 01:41:36,959
Here.

1777
01:41:40,414 --> 01:41:41,649
You give me a ledger?

1778
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:44,054
That's the one you want
the IRS to see.

1779
01:41:45,006 --> 01:41:46,484
The other one...

1780
01:41:46,844 --> 01:41:48,508
You know, the real one...

1781
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:50,420
I got stashed.

1782
01:41:51,263 --> 01:41:56,027
The one that could send you to Lompoc
and me to Phoenix for a very long time.

1783
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:01,797
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie...

1784
01:42:03,437 --> 01:42:05,183
Now I know why...

1785
01:42:05,422 --> 01:42:09,140
Years ago, the first time I saw you
in that joint in Fallon, I said...

1786
01:42:09,328 --> 01:42:10,789
"This girl is for me."

1787
01:42:11,476 --> 01:42:13,541
You're fucking just like me!

1788
01:42:14,022 --> 01:42:15,205
You are!

1789
01:42:15,522 --> 01:42:18,049
Great move!
You backed up everything, uh?

1790
01:42:18,476 --> 01:42:19,975
Grace, listen to me.

1791
01:42:20,477 --> 01:42:22,047
I can understand...

1792
01:42:22,702 --> 01:42:24,956
A big, good-looking guy
comes along...

1793
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,716
Makes you feel good...

1794
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:28,640
Sweeps you off your feet...

1795
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,070
I understand.

1796
01:42:32,117 --> 01:42:33,537
I really do!

1797
01:42:33,764 --> 01:42:35,349
And I promise you...

1798
01:42:36,124 --> 01:42:37,109
I'll never...

1799
01:42:37,171 --> 01:42:39,797
Ever bring it up or mention it.
Never!

1800
01:42:40,118 --> 01:42:41,758
Oh, Charlie...

1801
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,515
I'm dying.

1802
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:47,896
You mean because of this
conversation, you're dying?

1803
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,148
It's cancer.

1804
01:42:49,633 --> 01:42:51,164
I got six months.

1805
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:53,102
No, less.

1806
01:42:53,766 --> 01:42:54,899
Grace...

1807
01:42:55,217 --> 01:42:56,764
You're talking to me!

1808
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,686
What kind of fucking
bullshit story is that?

1809
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:02,812
It's true. You remember the
doctor Smathers I went to?

1810
01:43:02,902 --> 01:43:06,019
He did all the tests in San Francisco...
Came up positive.

1811
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:07,882
If all this is true, how come
I never heard about it before?

1812
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:10,657
I tried to tell you
a thousand times!

1813
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,382
Charlie... Charlie!

1814
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:15,079
You see, I am not good to you.
Not good to the Ranch.

1815
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:16,320
So take it.

1816
01:43:16,383 --> 01:43:19,179
Take the Ranch, because that's
all you have really wanted.

1817
01:43:19,371 --> 01:43:21,623
There's no Ranch without you,
and you're not fucking dying.

1818
01:43:21,703 --> 01:43:23,318
That's a bunch of shit!

1819
01:43:25,176 --> 01:43:26,814
I've been dead for years.

1820
01:43:27,445 --> 01:43:29,193
You just never noticed.

1821
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,786
I will check with Smathers...

1822
01:43:36,515 --> 01:43:38,254
Find out about this bullshit.

1823
01:43:39,836 --> 01:43:41,140
Goodbye, Charlie.

1824
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,179
It ain't over, Grace!

1825
01:43:46,076 --> 01:43:47,867
By a fucking long shot!

1826
01:44:30,483 --> 01:44:33,077
Reba?
Reba, this is Bruza.

1827
01:44:33,469 --> 01:44:35,937
Is Grace there yet?
I need to talk to her.

1828
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,809
Bruza, do not come down.
Charlie is on the warpath.

1829
01:44:38,944 --> 01:44:40,356
Bruza?

1830
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,448
Charlie!
Charlie Good Time!

1831
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:46,094
Don't give me that Good Time Charlie
shit, you motherfucker...

1832
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:49,606
You want to see fucking Grace again?
You get your fucking ass down here.

1833
01:44:49,685 --> 01:44:51,349
That's right, me and you pal...

1834
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:52,747
Face to face, man to man!

1835
01:44:52,816 --> 01:44:54,794
Get your fucking ass down here!

1836
01:44:57,868 --> 01:44:59,380
I need my car, now.

1837
01:45:09,356 --> 01:45:10,595
Bruza?

1838
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:18,760
Damn!

1839
01:46:10,174 --> 01:46:12,688
- How can I help?
- Tell Charlie Bruza is here.

1840
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:21,730
Grace?

1841
01:46:26,304 --> 01:46:27,622
Where is Grace?

1842
01:46:27,831 --> 01:46:30,255
I didn't think you had
the balls to show up!

1843
01:46:31,977 --> 01:46:34,552
I thought this was between
you and me, Charlie.

1844
01:46:35,002 --> 01:46:36,917
A man don't bring his boys.

1845
01:46:37,009 --> 01:46:38,556
Hey, you want to talk!

1846
01:46:38,621 --> 01:46:41,589
I treat you like my flesh and blood,
and you wanna steal my wife!

1847
01:46:41,697 --> 01:46:44,222
Why, steal your wife!
I never stole your wife...

1848
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:45,879
Listen, you lost your wife.

1849
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,722
- I lost my wife?
- Yes!

1850
01:46:47,802 --> 01:46:49,793
Grace, I'm here!

1851
01:46:54,101 --> 01:46:55,784
Grace!

1852
01:46:55,898 --> 01:46:57,995
Bruza,
you think I'm to let you win?

1853
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,998
Come on, I can't let you win!

1854
01:47:00,076 --> 01:47:03,341
You better jiggle that fucking plate in
your head if you think I'm to let you win.

1855
01:47:03,452 --> 01:47:05,610
Why, you can't take my wife.

1856
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:07,881
Grace?

1857
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:09,897
Bruza!

1858
01:47:10,068 --> 01:47:12,061
Why did you come back here?

1859
01:47:13,147 --> 01:47:14,163
Bruza!

1860
01:47:14,209 --> 01:47:15,233
You're a fucking liar!

1861
01:47:15,284 --> 01:47:18,560
Come on! Come away!
What are you doing here?

1862
01:47:19,478 --> 01:47:20,706
Charlie...

1863
01:47:20,803 --> 01:47:21,835
Come on!

1864
01:47:21,914 --> 01:47:24,834
Come on! Come on, come on Armando!

1865
01:47:25,178 --> 01:47:26,592
Come on! Come on!

1866
01:47:26,811 --> 01:47:27,577
Grace!

1867
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:28,546
Grace!

1868
01:47:28,717 --> 01:47:29,545
Grace!

1869
01:47:29,632 --> 01:47:31,514
I love you, what are you doing?
Come here!

1870
01:47:31,573 --> 01:47:33,342
Charlie, we have been
through all this!

1871
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:36,467
There's nothing left
to be said, okay?

1872
01:47:36,561 --> 01:47:37,506
I talked to Smathers.

1873
01:47:37,686 --> 01:47:40,271
I can't believe this!
I can't believe it!

1874
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:41,888
You think I'd lie to you
about that?

1875
01:47:41,944 --> 01:47:42,874
Let's go!
Come on!

1876
01:47:42,942 --> 01:47:45,076
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Hey, Grace!

1877
01:47:45,608 --> 01:47:47,170
26 years we've been married...

1878
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,115
Can't you even talk to me
for one minute?

1879
01:47:49,196 --> 01:47:50,786
Charlie, we go now, okay?
We go!

1880
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:52,272
One minute... One minute...

1881
01:47:52,338 --> 01:47:53,771
One minute!

1882
01:48:01,556 --> 01:48:03,592
Grace... let me
take care of you...

1883
01:48:03,662 --> 01:48:05,099
I didn't know you were dying...

1884
01:48:05,162 --> 01:48:07,669
- It's too late Charlie.
- Grace...

1885
01:48:07,748 --> 01:48:09,868
- No... Shh...
- Come on!

1886
01:48:10,225 --> 01:48:11,631
Charlie, it's too late...

1887
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:13,818
I don't want any more of this!

1888
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,428
I don't want the Ranch.

1889
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:16,906
I don't want your dreams.

1890
01:48:17,005 --> 01:48:18,755
I don't want this life,
I don't want...

1891
01:48:18,842 --> 01:48:21,048
What the fuck we'll go away,
I'll take you somewhere...

1892
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:23,296
We will give it away,
I don't care.

1893
01:48:23,361 --> 01:48:25,317
Let me take care of you.

1894
01:48:26,244 --> 01:48:30,635
- Charlie, listen... I have such a little time...
- I know.

1895
01:48:31,389 --> 01:48:32,475
Okay?

1896
01:48:32,751 --> 01:48:34,423
I want to spend with him.

1897
01:48:34,513 --> 01:48:36,177
- No, no, Grace.
- Please!

1898
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,503
Please, Grace!

1899
01:48:37,645 --> 01:48:38,794
Shut up!

1900
01:48:39,728 --> 01:48:41,259
- Charlie!
- Fuck!

1901
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:42,564
- No!
- What have you done?

1902
01:48:42,628 --> 01:48:43,417
No!

1903
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:44,664
Oh, my God!

1904
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,460
Bruza!

1905
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:49,138
Warren, get him inside!
I'll take care of it!

1906
01:48:49,702 --> 01:48:50,851
Oh no!

1907
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:55,591
No!

1908
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,794
Grace stand back.
We'll call an ambulance.

1909
01:49:00,554 --> 01:49:02,234
Oh, no!

1910
01:49:03,363 --> 01:49:04,762
What the hell is going on?

1911
01:49:05,265 --> 01:49:07,212
- What's going on?
- What happened?

1912
01:49:08,467 --> 01:49:09,546
He had a gun!

1913
01:49:10,678 --> 01:49:12,372
Warren had to shoot him
in self-defense.

1914
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,139
You liar! Liar!

1915
01:49:15,827 --> 01:49:17,764
- Liar.
- Grace, I saw it all!

1916
01:49:19,642 --> 01:49:21,350
Call someone!

1917
01:49:23,354 --> 01:49:25,921
Liar!
You are a liar!

1918
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,714
Get some blankets!
Get some blankets!

1919
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:33,186
I'm so sorry.

1920
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,890
They called it self-defense,
justifiable homicide,

1921
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:02,084
On account of the gun
Bruza was supposed to have had.

1922
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:06,467
I told the cops what happened,
testified before the Grand Jury...

1923
01:50:06,608 --> 01:50:11,208
But it was Charlie's word against mine, and
of course Warren and Johnny backed him up.

1924
01:50:11,932 --> 01:50:13,343
Poor Warren...

1925
01:50:13,756 --> 01:50:14,999
He took the rap.

1926
01:50:17,921 --> 01:50:22,199
They shipped Bruza's body
back to Argentina, on a military plane...

1927
01:50:23,352 --> 01:50:26,826
His funeral was almost as big
as the one for Carlos Gardel.

1928
01:50:28,115 --> 01:50:29,946
He would have loved that!

1929
01:50:31,272 --> 01:50:33,650
The IRS did shut
the Ranch down.

1930
01:50:34,411 --> 01:50:38,113
What a party those bloodsuckers
had with the other ledger...

1931
01:50:38,615 --> 01:50:41,264
The real one, the one I sent them.

1932
01:50:42,178 --> 01:50:44,467
You should have seen
the look on Charlie's face...

1933
01:50:44,842 --> 01:50:48,428
When they took away his car,
his golf clubs, his cigars...

1934
01:50:50,266 --> 01:50:52,734
I knew I'd fall down too,
but it was worth it.

1935
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:55,233
Just to see him fall.

1936
01:50:56,802 --> 01:51:00,048
I did two years in a Federal pen
in Phoenix...

1937
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,125
But before the fuss of a single day,
he jumped bail and escaped the country

1938
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:09,173
He went to Brazil, where they
don't extradite tax cheats.

1939
01:51:10,012 --> 01:51:13,423
Charlie tried to phone me,
but I wouldn't take his call...

1940
01:51:15,027 --> 01:51:18,132
Like I could ever
forgive him what he did.

1941
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,330
About the only thing I couldn't predict,
it was still being alive...

1942
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:28,244
In prison I signed out
for radiation treatment...

1943
01:51:28,822 --> 01:51:30,525
What did I have to lose...

1944
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,397
Surprise!

1945
01:51:32,963 --> 01:51:34,242
Remission!

1946
01:51:35,423 --> 01:51:37,479
No one knows
how long it will last.

1947
01:51:38,369 --> 01:51:40,525
But I take it
one day at the time.

1948
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:43,549
When I got out...

1949
01:51:43,877 --> 01:51:46,775
I remembered what my mother
had always told me.

1950
01:51:47,235 --> 01:51:49,869
"If you're good at something, stick to it."

1951
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:55,749
So, I built our dream house.

1952
01:51:57,486 --> 01:52:00,158
The legal brothel business
was bigger than ever.

1953
01:52:01,304 --> 01:52:03,587
Today people come
from all over the world...

1954
01:52:03,682 --> 01:52:06,494
Just to party at the new
Love Ranch!

1955
01:52:06,977 --> 01:52:09,447
And some of my old girls
even came back.

1956
01:52:10,728 --> 01:52:13,119
You know, when you're family,
you stick together.

1957
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:17,886
I don't make apologies
for my life...

1958
01:52:18,102 --> 01:52:20,900
Selling what passes for love
in this sad little world...

1959
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:23,111
With so many lonely people.

1960
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:28,025
What keeps me going,
is that through all the lies...

1961
01:52:29,235 --> 01:52:30,586
I know the truth.

1962
01:52:32,931 --> 01:52:34,142
We had it...

1963
01:52:34,658 --> 01:52:36,776
Him and me for a moment.

1964
01:52:37,173 --> 01:52:39,509
Love and truth, together.

1965
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:41,541
Finally...

1966
01:52:41,885 --> 01:52:43,174
And forever.

1967
01:52:46,308 --> 01:52:48,845
Hey, how many people can say that?
