a chance
to look over the spreadsheets?

Steven:
Yeah.
Those numbers look good.

What about your flight?

Yeah, I'm on the 10:15
flight tomorrow morning.

10

Lookin' strong, kiddo.

Feeling strong, daddy-o.

19
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,742
It just stiffens up
on me sometimes.

to send over your report.

21

Hey.

25
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,879
Not as much as losing
my scholarship.

Are you rushing it?

27
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:26,096
Mom, I've been
babying it all summer.

28
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,097
If I'm gonna get
my scholarship back,

29
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,766
I have to start training again.

30

off to college. (Laughs)

This is really beautiful, mom.
All my favorites.

one last home cooked meal

No, it's just
I'm nervous about the move.

30 miles.

53
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:42,114
You'll be home to do
your laundry on the weekends.

54
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,783
It's not the distance.

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,180
It's not even that it's my first
time being away from home.

56

It's dorms. Roommates.

What if I don't like them?
What if they don't like me?

I lived in the dorms in college.

59

I met your dad in the dorms.
Made friends.

every 5000 calorie meal

She fell.

you're working so hard

How's it going?

It's still going.
How's it going with you?

It's only 5:00.

were saying all last year.

on the shoulder.

would be able to...

to have the key re-lock...

for something.

convinced
it wasn't Dane.

He's got a whole...

292
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,720
No. He wasn't just
looking for panties, Beth.

293
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,757
I mean, he... He was really
looking for something.

that it could have been

295

still here?

Maybe she didn't jump or fall.

paying attention?

Come on. First one's on me.

363
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,526
Okay. Ow!

364
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,951
What's wrong?

365
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,789
Sorry, uh, hit a rock
on the road of life.

366
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,458
Okay. I'm good.

367
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,517
My leg is acting up today.

368
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:29,335
Coach Simmons: Not bad.

369
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,517
Coach Simmons.

370
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:36,020
You set a pace for about
a 17, 18 second 100 meter.

371
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,857
Great. That would've
gotten me

372
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,288
sixth place at the church
picnic.

373
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,731
Even a church picnicker
couldn't hit 18 seconds

374
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:45,755
with a torn acl.

375
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm sorry
about the scholarship, Jenny.

376
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,869
It wasn't my call.

377
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,445
It's okay.

378
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,318
Gotta give the money
to someone who can run.

379
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,435
So, I'm gonna run, coach.

380
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,253
I'm gonna run my way
back into my scholarship.

381
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,740
When'd you get up,
two hours ago?

382
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,300
I didn't know
the first day of classes

383
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,438
was such a special occasion.

384
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,228
Every day is.

385
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,608
I feel my best
when I look my best.

386
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,328
Her grades were way
down last year.

387
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:44,561
College isn't for everyone.

388
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:55,933
How are you gonna
walk in those all day?

389
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,351
Beautifully.

390
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:35,973
Professor: I'll do it.

391
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,367
Honestly, Kyle, if your
assistance
is going to create

392
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:40,311
more hindrance than help,

393
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,312
I will find myself
another T.A.

394
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:42,388
Yes... sir.

395
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,135
Good morning.

396
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,155
Good morning!

397
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,492
This is American history 101.

398
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:59,646
If this is not the class
you're supposed to be in,

399
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,889
too bad you're stuck here

400
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,125
until I'm done in 50 minutes.

401
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,004
Where does
American history begin?

402
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:09,916
N...

403
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,661
This is a lecture, young lady.

404
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,238
Not a town hall.

405
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,432
The questions are rhetorical.

406
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,690
Kyle! Hey.

407
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:33,179
Jenny.
Yeah, I saw you in there.

408
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,519
You got a nip from old
Harrington.

409
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,537
Guess I asked for it though.
You didn't.

410
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,765
Ah, others are worse.

411
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:43,927
If you just let him
listen to himself talk,

412
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:44,951
you'll be all right.

413
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,550
How are you
after the other night?

414
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:56,220
Okay, I guess.

415
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,165
Sorry Beth was so hard on you.

416
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,226
She was just scared.

417
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:03,354
Hey, it's my job
to keep all the students

418
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:07,064
on my floor safe.
And I failed.

419
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:10,050
Twice now.

420
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,469
I asked for a rush
on that new lock.

421
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,905
Thanks.

422
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,305
[Thud]

423
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,186
You all jumped
when I came into the room?

424
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:29,996
Why?

425
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,743
Come on. This was in
your pre-term reading.

426
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,929
A loud noise startles you.

427
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,015
Is the reaction physiological
or psychological?

428
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:48,997
It's both.

429
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,166
Our brains instinctively
interpret loud noises

430
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:52,776
as potentially dangerous.

431
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:55,354
Then signal our bodies
to prepare for the threat.

432
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:56,447
By jumping out of your skin?

433
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:57,523
[Laughter]

434
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,286
Don't laugh. She's right.

435
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,680
Brain and body together

436
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:08,459
determine how we interpret and
react to our environment.

437
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:11,019
We want to examine
which is responsible for what?

438
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,022
What is instinct, as miss?

439
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,968
Willis. Jenny Willis. Jennifer.
Yeah. Jenny.

440
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,212
That's a lotta names.

441
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,622
As miss Willis has noted.

442
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:26,626
And what is a learned,
emotional response?

443
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:30,814
I am Dr. Davrow.
Welcome to my class.

444
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,140
Dr. Davrow: Thank you,
everyone.
We'll see you tomorrow.

445
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,508
Dr. Davrow (cont.) Miss Willis?
May I have a word?

446
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,828
Miss Willis?

447
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:48,666
Freshman? Very bold.

448
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,483
Most students would rather stick
their arm in a lion's cage

449
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,561
than in the air
on the first day of class.

450
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,839
I-I don't mind standing out.

451
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,841
University is more competitive
than high school.

452
00:27:57,918 --> 00:27:59,343
Even the bold
have to up their game

453
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:02,346
if they want to stand out.

454
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:03,823
I look forward
to seeing your paper.

455
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:14,692
[Heavy bass music plays]

456
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,373
Hey.

457
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,760
Okay, that's enough.
Headphones off!

458
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,177
Look, I'm not gonna sleep four
feet
from you for the next semester

459
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,126
and never have you say hello.

460
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,278
Hello.

461
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:47,707
You don't even know me.

462
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,785
You have no reason
not to like me.

463
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:52,955
Well, stealing my book
and my phone

464
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:54,398
seem like pretty good reasons.

465
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:57,125
I didn't...

466
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:58,144
Okay, fine. Here.

467
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,410
I don't dislike you.

468
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,413
I dislike Beth.

469
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,418
Why? Beth's nice.

470
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,307
Beth is as fake as twenty
dollar Prada.

471
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,315
She wakes up every morning,

472
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:21,925
and she hides behind
those dresses

473
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,463
because she's too afraid
to succeed in this world

474
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,429
as what she really is.

475
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,431
I'm sorry for ignoring you.

476
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:31,827
Whatever, but I'm not going
to fake nice just because.

477
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:33,229
So I have to choose
between you two?

478
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,107
No, Jenny. I chose.

479
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,323
Kyle? What happened?

480
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,329
Uh... professor Harrington.
He, uh... Heart attack.

481
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,344
Thank you very much.

482
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,559
Everything okay, miss Willis?

483
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,990
Let's take a look at your paper.

484
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,213
My paper?

485
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,734
Yes. The assignment.
You completed it, right?

486
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,902
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

487
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:48,965
Here.

488
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,768
You're gonna have to work harder
than that to stand out.

489
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,395
Okay. Diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders.

490
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,017
What was that?

491
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:26,777
Dr. Davrow.

492
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,337
Excuse me?

493
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:32,616
My students address me
as "Dr. Davrow."

494
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,953
Or "professor." It's an
honorific
that shows respect.

495
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,955
Well, you get respect
by showing it to others.

496
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:41,274
Hmm? Where'd you learn that?

497
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,627
Some book about the great
lessons
of kindergarten?

498
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:47,205
University is harder, Jenny.
Consider it a lesson.

499
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:48,799
In what, humiliation?

500
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,043
In rising to the challenge.

501
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:55,030
And you start by
putting yourself together.

502
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,865
This outfit, I don't know
what you call it.

503
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,792
Frumpy tracksuit?
You can do better.

504
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,478
How dare you!

505
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,963
I dare because I care.

506
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:07,709
You see, I can quote
pithy aphorisms, too.

507
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:08,779
So you're saying
you graded me down

508
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,487
because of my clothes?

509
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:14,049
No, I graded you down because
your paper was rushed,

510
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,068
ill-conceived and
subpar for my class.

511
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:19,496
And I'm pointing out to you
that going through life

512
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,740
looking like you slept
in an alleyway,

513
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,294
you'll find, repels rather than
attracts people

514
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:24,838
who might be in a position
to help you.

515
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,840
Which I could, if you show me
you're worthy.

516
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:35,679
He did it in front of everyone.

517
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,498
It was horrifying.

518
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,426
What, the paper or him
telling you to dress nicer?

519
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:42,761
Both!

520
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:43,913
Totally inappropriate!

521
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:48,859
What?

522
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,418
I don't know about the paper,

523
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,030
but as for the clothes,
I told you

524
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,590
I wouldn't be caught dead in...

525
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,289
Okay, "looking your best
to feel your best"

526
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,202
is different than dressing up

527
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,096
to get grades you should be
getting based on your work.

528
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,265
And if your work
can only get you so far?

529
00:34:03,283 --> 00:34:05,600
I don't claim to be
a unicorn, Jenny.

530
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,619
I know my merits.

531
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,382
(Scoffs) Are you saying
that... To get grades?

532
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:14,109
Beth, why, why would you...

533
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,887
What? You've never
batted your lashes

534
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,258
at a traffic cop to get out
of a speeding ticket?

535
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:20,390
Jenny no!

536
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,742
Flirted with the bouncer to
get past the line at a club?

537
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,897
Whatever. It's not like
I was failing.

538
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,383
I wore a nice dress and heels
to Davrow's class

539
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,402
and got an "a"
where I might have gotten a
"B."

540
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:35,130
What about the girls
who don't have a nice dress,

541
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:37,908
or don't look
as good as you in one?

542
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,296
Should they suffer because they
won't
flirt with the professor?

543
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,913
Just because he marks me up
for playing along

544
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,063
doesn't mean he marks anyone
else down who doesn't.

545
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,415
He did it to me!

546
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,250
If he had given you an "a"

547
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,242
in front of everyone,
would you be complaining?

548
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,507
It's like my chemistry teacher
once said,

549
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:57,319
"if you've got it, flaunt it."

550
00:34:57,337 --> 00:35:00,246
And somewhere
underneath that uh...

551
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,675
What'd you say he called it?
Frumpy tracksuit?

552
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:04,827
You've got it.

553
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,053
I don't want to get it
like that.

554
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:18,115
Oh, look. Kyle finally
made himself useful.

555
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,436
I cannot believe
neither one of you

556
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,180
told me someone tried to
break into our room.

557
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:28,032
You're not exactly
chatty with us.

558
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,185
Uh... Sarah?

559
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:32,295
Maintenance man new keys.

560
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:32,796
Thank you.

561
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,297
Thank you.

562
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,523
Now that we can sleep soundly.

563
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,968
All we have to do is find a guy

564
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:40,244
trolling the halls with a gouge
you put in his shoulder.

565
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,978
15.75 seconds.

566
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,058
Jenny: That's okay.

567
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,931
Jenny (cont.)
I'm gonna go home
this weekend.

568
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
You here for dinner tonight?

569
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,587
You're working overtime
for me, aren't you?

570
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,255
What?

571
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,408
You never
used to work this much.

572
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,410
Or go out of town
on the weekends.

573
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:30,020
No, kiddo. It's just this deal.

574
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,646
It's dragging me by the tail.

575
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,694
Worth every second though
to see you at Oldbridge.

576
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,030
You sure you don't want me
to transfer to state?

577
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:41,439
I'd rather have a hundred jobs

578
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,658
drag me around first. Okay?

579
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,263
Am I cooking,
or bringing something home?

580
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:51,524
Home cooked, please!
And no starches.

581
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,877
Well, I gotta go.
Love you, kiddo. Love you.

582
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,437
Love you, too.

583
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,047
Jenny: Love you, daddy-o.

584
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,198
And thanks.

585
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:02,368
You know...

586
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm sorry about...

587
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,131
Ah...

588
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:15,473
Me too. I wish
I could... Meddle forever.

589
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,216
But, you're an adult now...

590
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,694
And you can make
your own decisions.

591
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:24,407
But not for being worried.

592
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,985
I will always be your mother,

593
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:28,417
whether you let me
meddle or not.

594
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,253
And a student dying at a
party...

595
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:34,901
I just can't turn it off.

596
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,295
Kristen: Linda wants
to do a makeover for you.

597
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,672
How beautiful is she?

598
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:49,266
Stop.

599
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,937
You're gonna have to
bat the boys away.

600
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,086
Or I could just go plain

601
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:54,920
and not have to worry about
them bothering me at all.

602
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,165
Oh...

603
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,834
Jen Jen,
having boy troubles already?

604
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,836
She's in college, Kris,

605
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:04,948
they're not boys anymore,
they're men.

606
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,619
All right,
are you having men problems?

607
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:07,358
No, I'm not.

608
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,194
How about the cute jock?

609
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,029
He's a jerk.

610
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,622
Oh, do tell.

611
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,457
Is he coming on too strong

612
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,351
or is he holding back too much?

613
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:17,421
I've only ever found
one or the other,

614
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,296
casual or confident.

615
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,706
Never one who's mastered
"casually
confident." (Laughs)

616
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,449
There's no one, okay?

617
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,302
No one I'm dating. No one
I'm interested in.

618
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:26,619
Jenny, I... I'm sorry I didn't...

619
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,972
Lin, it's not you.

620
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:29,955
Hi. Welcome to blush.

621
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,975
Welcome.

622
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:33,218
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:46,156
You know, we just got these in.

624
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,828
Too casual? Too confident?

625
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:56,588
You're the perfect blend
of both, you know.

626
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:06,919
What's going on?

627
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,167
Promise not to judge me?

628
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:16,412
I'll hold it in.

629
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,189
And I'm not moving home.

630
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:24,936
There's a rumor on campus

631
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:27,271
that some of the professors

632
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:29,532
will give a girl better grades

633
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,201
if she dresses up for class.

634
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,872
And how much truth
is there to this rumor?

635
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,167
Please don't make
a big deal out of it.

636
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,435
Jenny, it is a big deal.

637
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,270
If it's true,
you should report him.

638
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:44,606
Well, no one
actually told me to dress up.

639
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,104
Then what exactly
have they told you?!

640
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:49,962
Nothing.

641
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:57,582
I knew this was going to happen.

642
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,400
You've been stuffing down
your feelings

643
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:04,809
about that girl dying.

644
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:05,885
Mom, it's...
It's not just that.

645
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,904
What?

646
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,407
Jenny, what?

647
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,399
Mom! Mom!!

648
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,918
Get in the car.

649
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:23,068
I'm not moving home!

650
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,754
You are!

651
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:25,922
Mother!

652
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,590
Daughter!

653
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:28,983
Someone broke into your room,

654
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,927
and you've been
hiding it from me.

655
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:31,836
Lying to me about it!

656
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,263
I didn't lie about anything!

657
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,155
Sin of omission. Get in the car.

658
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:35,932
No!

659
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,728
Others are telling girls
to dress up for grades.

660
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:38,768
And a professor died!

661
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,994
He had a heart attack.

662
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,496
Get in the car!

663
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm going back to school.

664
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:45,608
You're not.

665
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,404
You said yourself
I can make my own decisions.

666
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,445
Good ones!

667
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,906
Jennifer! Jennifer!!

668
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:00,159
Jenny:
Thanks, Beth, for picking me up

669
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:01,783
Jenny (cont.)
And showing me around town.

670
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:07,689
Hey, do you see this?

671
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,782
Someone was trying
to get back in.

672
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,801
Should we call security?

673
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,635
It's after midnight.

674
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,029
They won't get here til morning.

675
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:17,865
Maybe it was Sarah
trying to get in.

676
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:19,476
Lost her new key?

677
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,126
Well, I'm starving.

678
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,198
I'm gonna downstairs
and eat a snack.

679
00:41:22,222 --> 00:41:23,387
Do you want to come with me?

680
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I'm really tired.

681
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:26,649
Good night.

682
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,801
Good night.

00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,247
Kyle, what the heck?!

687
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,173
I'm sorry I didn't mean...

688
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,917
I just saw you
and thought I’d...

689
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:11,361
Scare me half to death?

690
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,988

691
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:20,870

the protein bars.

692
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:23,432
Okay.

694
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:42,541
Thanks, Kyle.

695
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,601
I'm Ms. Kingsley, your new
American history teacher.

696
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,980
I can't even believe...
This is ridiculous.

697
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,065
Beth: Oh, come on.

698
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,809
A bunch of rich parents

699
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,310
just bribed their kids into
college.

700
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:10,645
You don't think any of them

701
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:11,715
wouldn't have jumped at the
chance

702
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,314
to just get them a new wardrobe?

703
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,573
Do you even hear yourself?

704
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,093
I mean, do you have any
self-respect at all?

705
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,411
Yes, enough to shower

706
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,172
and put on nice clothes
every day.

707
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:22,604
Where's your self respect,
Sarah?

708
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:25,509
In here, Beth!

709
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:26,844
In my heart,

where I protect it
with everything I've got

from disgusting,
degrading sell-outs like you!

713
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520

00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,517
Don't make her wrong.
She's not wrong.

720
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:55,966
We are.

721
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,766
Oh, this is so exciting!
[Squeals]

722
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:10,480
Look at you!

723
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:17,804
Wow!

724
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:30,242
Excuse me.

725
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:10,989
Good morning, miss Willis.

726
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:15,770
Good morning, Dr. Davrow.

727
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:17,880
Okay, now you're just
kissing up.

728
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,032
Wouldn't think of it.

729
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,820
Let's talk about
psychopathology.

730
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,786
For those who can never
know what it's like

731
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:34,564
to be inside the mind
of a psychopath.

732
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,307
Where do we draw the line

733
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,901
between abnormality
and abnormally genius?

734
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:44,293
Beth:
Can I have a salad please?

735
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:45,317
Thank you.

736
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,303
I don't have to dress
for dinner, do I?

737
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,914
Don't act like I’m
twisting your arm.

738
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:54,417
Not you. Dr. Davrow.

739
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:55,585
Back up from "C’s".

740
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,404
Wonder what I have to do

741
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,149
to get the grade
I actually deserve in his class?

742
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:03,328
Stop wearing anything at all?

743
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:04,836
[Cell phone rings]

744
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:18,591
Everything all right?

745
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:21,444
I don't know.

746
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,282
I'm trying to let her
solve her own problems

747
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,269
but it isn't easy.

748
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,863
You can't hold her hand
all through college.

749
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:35,440
She's a smart kid, Kris.

750
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,700
You know, her way

751
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:37,921
may not be the same as yours,

752
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:39,444
but she'll find it.

753
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,464
I know.

754
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,049
Can I steer her
from behind a little bit?

755
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:12,811
Jenny:
I don't know if this
was a good idea.

756
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,957
Beth: It's gonna be awesome.

757
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,573
Beth: (Cont.)
It's totally legit.

758
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:19,226
Beth: (Cont.) Lots of
faculty,
male and female students, too.

759
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:21,729
Beth: (Cont.) They talk
about internships,
jobs after graduation,

760
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:23,506
Beth: (Cont.)
Make connections for you.

761
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:25,217
I can't believe the girl
who is fighting

762
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:27,304
with everything she has to get
her track scholarship back

763
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:29,728
is getting crushed so easily by
putting on a dress and heels.

764
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:32,908
Okay, fine. Let's go.

765
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:37,520
(Inaudible background chatter
and music)

766
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,428
I told you it was great.

767
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,947
Oh, good evening, ladies.

768
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,708
You both look radiant.

769
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:00,101
Beth...

770
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,545
The lady in the gold
sequin dress

771
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:05,214
is the fashion editor
for haute couture.

772
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,382
And Jenny...

773
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,626
The gentleman in the gray suit

774
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:09,944
books athletic endorsements

775
00:48:09,962 --> 00:48:12,796
for running shoes.
Track, right?

776
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:14,206
Are you interested
in endorsements?

777
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,950
Uh, yeah.

778
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,709
Great.

779
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,561
Let me know
if I can make an introduction

780
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:20,396
for either one of you.

781
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:21,380
I'd offer you a drink,

782
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,715
but state law, university rules

783
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,735
and societal mores prevent it.

784
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:27,737
But do help yourselves
to some hors d'oeuvres

785
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:28,888
and mingle.

786
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,910
Okay, it's great.

787
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:36,988
Thank you.

788
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:41,751
Quite the soiree, isn't it?

789
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,713
Eric told me that he was
particularly interested

790
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:44,328
in having you here.

791
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,829
Eric?

792
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,256
Dr. Davrow.

793
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:48,644
He says that you have
great potential

794
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:49,817
as a psychologist.

795
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:51,819
Oh, I'm not actually sure

796
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:52,653
I want to go into psychology.

797
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:53,672
History, maybe?

798
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:56,507
Whatever field you choose,

799
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:58,100
be proud of yourself, Jenny.

800
00:48:58,252 --> 00:48:59,251
The world needs
all of its young women

801
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,270
to grow up proud.

802
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,831
Will you excuse me?

803
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,924
I'll see you Monday morning,
8 A.M. the war of 1812.

804
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,777
Jackson and Lafayette
take on New Orleans.

805
00:49:07,928 --> 00:49:08,928
Thrilling.

806
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,768
You got gray suit's card?

807
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,271
Is your face coming
to a cereal box near me?

808
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,015
Okay, first I have to
get back on the track team.

809
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:24,109
Before that, I have to
pee. Bathroom?

810
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,295
Upstairs. Oh, and don't miss
the study on the left.

811
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,464
The artwork is unbelievable.

812
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,615
Okay. Come with me.

813
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:30,692
Yeah. Sure.

814
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:35,547
Dr. Davrow:
Beth.

815
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,143
Oh, you'll be okay.

816
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,900
Dr. Davrow:
Someone I want you to meet.

817
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:56,066
Dr. Davrow:
Impressive collection, isn't it?

818
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,552
Yeah, um, whose is it?

819
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,404
I mean, whose,
whose house are we in?

820
00:50:00,556 --> 00:50:01,664
Mine.

821
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh. This is a really nice house.

822
00:50:05,578 --> 00:50:08,004
Thank you.

823
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:13,234
Inspired by my travels. Italy.
Thailand. Borneo. Estonia.

824
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:14,902
Beautiful city of Tallinn.

825
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,520
All the buildings
are painted in pastels.

826
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:21,408
I didn't realize
teaching at public universities

827
00:50:21,427 --> 00:50:22,427
was so lucrative.

828
00:50:25,081 --> 00:50:28,024
They don't pay for the teaching.
They pay for the name.

829
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:29,935
I spent several years
building that, as well.

830
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,182
'66 chateau neuf de pape?

831
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,035
What happened to state law
and social mores?

832
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,376
I don't see either in here.
Cheers.

833
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:57,628
You don't like me, do you?

834
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,615
I... uh...
Why do you say that?

835
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:03,726
A man doesn't have to
travel the world

836
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:05,477
to discern when a
woman doesn't like him.

837
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,064
It shows in your eyes

838
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,957
every day in class.

839
00:51:09,975 --> 00:51:11,453
It's because I suggested
you dress up.

840
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:14,795
And you think
I'm basing your grades off it.

841
00:51:14,797 --> 00:51:18,407
You know, decades ago,
in the 60's,

842
00:51:18,484 --> 00:51:21,135
it would be unheard of for
a woman to show up to class

843
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:23,637
in sweat pants
and a torn tee-shirt.

844
00:51:23,656 --> 00:51:25,414
So should I get a pink
angora sweater

845
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:27,141
and a circle skirt
with a poodle on it?

846
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,420
You joke,
but it was the same for men.

847
00:51:31,497 --> 00:51:34,924
18, 19, 20-year-olds
would show up to school

848
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,593
every day in a suit and tie.

849
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:40,988
White dress shirts, starched
collar
and polished black wingtips.

850
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:44,174
Same at the office. Any office.

851
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:45,935
It showed respect
for their institutions,

852
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:50,106
their colleagues, themselves.

853
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,941
At a university,
it showed an appreciation

854
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:55,185
for higher learning,
which, I am sorry to say,

855
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,780
is lacking in the halls
of academia today.

856
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:58,931
You can't deny that.

857
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:03,577
Is it too much for me to
ask you to show

858
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:08,290
a little appreciation?

859
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:10,684
Look, I appreciate the wine.

860
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:14,630
And the art.
And the party, thank you.

861
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:17,093
But I do wonder, where is the
line
between normal appreciation

862
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:18,592
and abnormally inappropriate?

863
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,138
Clever.

864
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:24,646
I-I was heading to the bathroom.

865
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,477
That way.

866
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:29,554
Thanks.

867
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:35,818
You dressed up for your "B,"
Jenny.

868
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,653
This is how you get your "a."

869
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,989
[Yells] You thankless ingrate!

870
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:51,625
Jenny! Hey, Jenny!

871
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,843
I'm sorry, Jenny.
I am so sorry.

872
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,587
Dr. Davrow never did
anything like that to me,

873
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:05,497
not all last year.
The dresses...

874
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,516
Yeah.

875
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:08,834
But kissing?

876
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,187
[Jenny sobs]

877
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:14,415
I guess he upped his game.

878
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,358
Monday morning. Conduct...

879
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,361
No! I don’t want to get
into a political war

880
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:21,588
with a professor
my first month at school.

881
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,865
Or ever.

882
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,373
I just want to study
and run track.

883
00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:35,044
Can I please just do that?

884
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:36,195
I'm sorry.

885
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:47,281
13.2.

886
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:50,117
Not a church picnicker
who can do that.

887
00:53:50,135 --> 00:53:52,135
(Chuckles) Thanks, coach.

888
00:53:52,288 --> 00:53:53,896
What do I have to hit
to get on the team?

889
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:56,065
Shave a second off,
and I'll fight for you.

890
00:53:57,884 --> 00:53:58,717
And the scholarship?

891
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,904
Still not my call.

892
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:04,631
Competition for money is...

893
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,730
It's even fiercer than the
fight for the finish line.

894
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:10,746
No... there's nothing like
fighting
for the finish line.

895
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,513
That's what I love about
running.

896
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,753
There's no pedigree.

897
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,330
Doesn't matter what your name
is, what you look like,

898
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:22,091
what you think, do, say.

899
00:54:24,336 --> 00:54:27,221
It's just about your legs,
your breath, and your time.

900
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:30,658
That's all that matters.

901
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,590
Hi.

902
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,443
I prefer this look.

903
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,595
Me too.

904
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,894
You're gonna pay a price for it.

905
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,525
But at least you're not broken.

906
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:57,960
Andrew Jackson,
hero of New Orleans,

907
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,295
ending the English attempt

908
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,130
at taking back the colonies

909
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:02,926
they had lost
nearly half a century earlier.

910
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,051
Dr. Davrow:
Okay, I need a volunteer.

911
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:07,453
Miss Willis.

912
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:09,197
No, thank you.

913
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:11,307
Excuse me?

914
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,768
You asked for volunteers.
I'm not.

915
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:20,223
Participation is not optional
in my class.

916
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,893
When I call on you, you come.

917
00:55:23,045 --> 00:55:24,045
Privilege of authority.

918
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:26,138
You won't break me.

919
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,657
I what?

920
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:33,738
Break you.

921
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:43,797
I hope everyone
is paying attention.

922
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:53,666
I need a volunteer.

923
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,690
Alexis.

924
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:04,343
Come on up.

925
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:16,021
I know what you're doing.

926
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,857
You don't know anything, Jenny.

927
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,210
If you did, you wouldn't be
doing this to yourself.

928
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:23,361
I'm not doing anything to
myself.

929
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,455
You're the one doing this to me.

930
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:28,291
You're just an arrogant,
entitled misogynist,

931
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:29,276
and if you don't start grading
according to my merit,

932
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:29,868
I'm gonna report you T...

933
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:30,887
To whom?

934
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,724
You clearly
haven't thought this out.

935
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:39,043
It doesn't matter who you go to.

936
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:43,457
My department chair.
The faculty conduct committee.

937
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:46,068
With any of them, it's the word
of a prestigious professor

938
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:49,129
against a freshman girl
who offered him sex

939
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:50,331
in exchange for better grades.

940
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,395
I have tenure, Jenny.
Do you know what that is?

941
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,473
They can't fire me.
They can't censure me.

942
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:00,807
They can't dock my pay.

943
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:02,751
But for you, win or lose,

944
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,143
how do you think that will go
for your track scholarship?

945
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:14,154
Or we can just put all of this
ridiculousness behind us

946
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:15,436
and give each other
what we want.

947
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,067
Jenny: You said he didn't
Mark
down girls who don't play along.

948
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,609
I didn't think he did.

949
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:29,945
But I it's not like we all talk
to each other about it.

950
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,949
I didn't know anybody
who didn't play along.

951
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:36,452
Until you.

952
00:57:36,528 --> 00:57:38,603
He's right about
reporting him though.

953
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,456
Even if they believe you,

954
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:42,015
there's nothing
they can do to him,

955
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:45,018
and you'll suffer anyway.

956
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,437
Will you come with me
to report him?

957
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:49,131
Beth, please.

958
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,373
I'm guilty, Jenny.

959
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:52,209
He forced you.

960
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,528
Not like that.

961
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,971
He suggested, and I complied.

962
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,310
I'm sorry.

963
00:58:01,386 --> 00:58:04,980
They wouldn't believe two
students
more than one, anyway.

964
00:58:05,057 --> 00:58:06,943
Universities don't want to hear
about this kind of stuff.

965
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:07,967
Not from us.

966
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:10,819
But maybe from faculty?

967
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,503
Close the door, Ms. Willis.
Close the door!

968
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,812
She was so excited
to come to school.

969
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:06,063
She's been sullen since day one.

970
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:11,213
That poor girl in her room.

971
00:59:11,364 --> 00:59:14,457
She said a professor died,
and there was a break in.

972
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,512
Jenny's not having trouble
with any faculty, is she?

973
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:19,537
Oh, no, no, no just the dorms.

974
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,797
Adjusting to her new roommates.

975
00:59:23,452 --> 00:59:26,377
Unless you've
noticed something in class?

976
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,565
No. I mean, I can only
speak for myself, of course,

977
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:31,900
but I've found Jenny
to be a treasure.

978
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,477
Bright, confident.

979
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,990
Qualities she apparently
inherited.

980
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,076
Uh, would you uh...

981
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:44,137
I feel terrible even asking
this,

982
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,731
snowplow mom times a
thousand, but uh...

983
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,251
Would it be okay with you

984
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:52,254
if I checked in every now and
then,
just to see how she's doing?

985
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:55,924
Of course. Anytime.

986
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:57,593
Thank you... Eric.

987
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:04,329
Here's your orange passion.

988
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:14,109
Mom. What are you...
What are you doing here?

989
01:00:14,186 --> 01:00:15,593
These are delicious.

990
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,733
You gotta start making them
for me at home. (Chuckles)

991
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:19,063
They're like 700 calories.

992
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:26,955
Well, worth it
for the ice breaker.

993
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:31,627
I'm sorry that I push you so
hard.

994
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:36,356
Sorry for pushing back harder.

995
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:37,518
- Your dad was...
- Dad was...

996
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:45,031
I uh, met one of your teachers.

997
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,142
Mom, I'm not
in fifth grade anymore.

998
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,626
Right. Professors.

999
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,646
Yeah.

1000
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,313
He's very charming.

1001
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,482
You talked to Dr. Davrow?!

1002
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:54,316
He thinks you're wonderful.

1003
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:56,467
Mom... I swear!

1004
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,211
Stay out of it, please!

1005
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,655
I am just trying to help!

1006
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:04,660
[Door opens]

1007
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:11,667
Sorry. I'll get out of your way.

1008
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:13,894
You're not in my way.

1009
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:15,096
I'm always in your way, Sarah.

1010
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:22,493
What? Since the day I got here

1011
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:23,345
you’ve made it very clear
you want me as far away

1012
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:25,238
as possible.

1013
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,349
Sorry you got stuck
with two fake roommates.

1014
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,850
I shouldn't have said that.

1015
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:31,853
Look, I know.

1016
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:33,005
I know I've been mean.

1017
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:35,473
But if you want to talk...

1018
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:38,716
What's with the change of heart?

1019
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:43,807
Do you want to go to the park?

1020
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,431
Hey.

1021
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:53,600
You two going somewhere?

1022
01:01:53,602 --> 01:01:54,859
Jenny: The park.

1023
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,545
You want to come?

1024
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:59,105
Sarah:
You know what? Actually, I
feel like

1025
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,440
maybe I should stay back and
study.

1026
01:02:00,442 --> 01:02:01,482
Jenny: No, no, no, no.

1027
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,890
You took the step. You're
coming.

1028
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:10,617
Beth: He's cute.

1029
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:12,786
Why don't you go ride with him?

1030
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:14,637
If I wasn't as blond as I look,

1031
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,898
I'd say you were trying
to get rid of me.

1032
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,049
That didn't even make sense.

1033
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,384
Sarah, please.

1034
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,044
If you've had a change of heart
toward me,

1035
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,207
maybe you can have one
toward Beth, too?

1036
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:28,301
And you, the same.

1037
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,040
Please, I really need
both of you right now.

1038
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,510
[Loud noise]

1039
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:54,902
Beth
code blue. What's going on?

1040
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:57,105
Jenny
oh, my god. What was that?

1041
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:58,826
Ride announcer (on speaker)
We're experiencing
some type of technical
difficulty.

1042
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,833
Jenny seriously?

1043
01:02:59,835 --> 01:03:01,610
Sarah: Are we gonna die?

1044
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:01,759
Ride announcer (on speaker) We
apologize
for the inconvenience.

1045
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,761
I heard you guys.

1046
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:04,780
About not wanting to get
into a political battle

1047
01:03:04,856 --> 01:03:05,856
with the professor.

1048
01:03:08,026 --> 01:03:09,934
Dr. Davrow.

1049
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:10,953
You too?

1050
01:03:12,848 --> 01:03:15,624
Yeah. You fought him off?

1051
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:19,186
Good for you.

1052
01:03:20,856 --> 01:03:23,781
'Cause I didn't.

1053
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,133
And it was more than just
kissing.

1054
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:26,635
Oh my gosh, Sarah...

1055
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:28,804
You slept with him?

1056
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:29,954
And you've been judging
me all this time?

1057
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,139
Beth!

1058
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,975
No! How dare you, Sarah!

1059
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:35,863
How dare you point the finger
at me like I'm some...

1060
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:40,206
You don't understand!
It was awful!

1061
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:45,487
It was horrible!
I felt so... So dirty.

1062
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:48,990
And so I stopped

1063
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:50,826
and then when I did,

1064
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:53,161
he didn’t just drop me
back down to the grades

1065
01:03:53,238 --> 01:03:56,147
I was getting before,
he-he failed me.

1066
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,499
Like... like F’s.

1067
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:02,337
And he had other professors
do it, too.

1068
01:04:02,414 --> 01:04:03,799
He had other professors
do it to me.

1069
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:05,674
And Elaine.

1070
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:07,992
Wait, what?

1071
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,847
She was brave... Like you.

1072
01:04:11,923 --> 01:04:13,682
She was going to report him.

1073
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:16,852
And then she just falls
from the dormitory roof.

1074
01:04:16,928 --> 01:04:19,354
Oh my gosh!

1075
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:20,785
You think Dr. Davrow killed her?

1076
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:26,419
And I just... And I just shut up.

1077
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:28,029
Jenny, I am so sorry.

1078
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,255
I should have
said something to you sooner.

1079
01:04:29,257 --> 01:04:32,200
I just... I have been so... Scared.

1080
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:34,685
Dr. Davrow
couldn't have killed Elaine.

1081
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,039
A faculty member
couldn't make it all the way

1082
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:40,542
to the rooftop of a dorm without
getting recognized.

1083
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,785
And during a party!

1084
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:43,712
Okay, then someone's helping
him.

1085
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:44,379
Or there's...

1086
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:46,882
Or nothing.

1087
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,384
Dr. Davrow shouldn't be
forcing girls to dress up

1088
01:04:49,461 --> 01:04:53,889
or anything else
for grades, I'll give you that.

1089
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,593
But that doesn't mean he has
anything to do with Elaine.

1090
01:04:55,617 --> 01:04:57,617
There's no way.

1091

Hey, look, it doesn't matter.

01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:01,045
Whether he killed Elaine or not,

1093
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,713
what he's doing alone is enough
that we have to report him.

1094
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,548
Now you want to go to war?

1095
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,551
I don't care about
my scholarship anymore.

1096
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,790
I don't care if they kick me out
of school for making a scene.

1097
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:11,094
I mean, he can't
keep doing this.

1098
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:16,244
And if he did kill Elaine,
all the more reason.

1099
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:22,642
He killed Elaine.
Or somebody did it for him.

1100
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:23,971
But I... I can't say anything,
Jenny.

good grades again.

1103
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,151
It's too dangerous.

1104
01:05:31,153 --> 01:05:33,428
He'll kill me. He'll kill you,
too.

1105
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:39,434
So he just gets away with it?
With all of it?

1106
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:40,745
Maybe he'll forgot about you.

1107
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,066
That's the best
you can hope for.

1108
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,000
And Elaine?

1109
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:48,610

Forget about her?

01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:12,505
I'm gonna go home.

1250
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:13,931
I mean, I'm gonna
move home, I think.

1251
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,116
Leave school?

1252
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:17,952
No. Just drive in.

1253
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:20,788
Yeah, maybe dorm life's
not for me after all.

1254
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,083
My mom's coming to pick me up.

1255
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:23,107
[Elevator bell rings]

1256
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:42,051
Hey.

1257
01:14:42,203 --> 01:14:43,794
Oh my god.
Are you all right?

1258
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,980
Yeah. I'm just exhausted.

1259
01:14:49,969 --> 01:14:51,134
I'm gonna shower
then my mom's
coming to get me.

1260
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,378
What?

1261
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,322
You should come with me.

1262
01:14:54,473 --> 01:14:56,232
At least for a few nights.

1263
01:14:56,384 --> 01:14:57,384
It's not safe here.

1264
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:00,995
Yeah. Okay.

1265
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:03,405
Uh, you take a shower,
and relax,

1266
01:15:03,558 --> 01:15:04,165
and I'll pack some stuff.

1267
01:15:04,242 --> 01:15:05,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

1268
01:15:20,742 --> 01:15:21,741
Is that all they took?

1269
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:23,684
Yeah. That's all.

1270
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:25,201
I just need you
to sign this, please.

1271
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:28,356
Okay. Can I go now?

1272
01:15:28,432 --> 01:15:29,023
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
Thanks.

1274
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:32,176
Hey, you got the store?

1275
01:15:32,253 --> 01:15:33,010
Hey. How are you doing?

1276
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,195
I'm fine.

1277
01:15:34,346 --> 01:15:35,604
You should dress that leg.

1278
01:15:35,757 --> 01:15:36,757
It's fine. I gotta go.

1279
01:15:57,278 --> 01:15:58,678
[Water running]

1280
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,310
[Phone rings]

1281
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:15,403
Jenny, I'm so sorry. I'm just
leaving the store right now.

1282
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:17,721
I'm racing to you.

1283
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,315
Okay, I'll be there soon as I
can.

1284
01:16:19,467 --> 01:16:21,367
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this.

1285
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:40,837
Jenny!

1286
01:16:43,825 --> 01:16:45,545
[Gasps] Ugh! We have got to
stop doing that.

1287
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:50,921
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1288
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,181
I-I'll fix it.

1289
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,108
Uh, it's-it's fine.

1290
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:03,284
Beth said there was someone
in your room again?

1291
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:05,361
I don't know. I wasn't home.

1292
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:06,695
I'm just... I'm just tired..

1293
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:07,848
Of course. Yeah.

1294
01:17:33,224 --> 01:17:35,224
Jenny! Jenny, wait!

1295
01:17:35,376 --> 01:17:36,376
Jenny! Jenny, wait!

1296
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:40,062
Beth! Beth! Let me go!

1297
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:42,156
Listen to me!

1298
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,641
What is going on?

1299
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:45,308
He broke into the room!
I saw his shoulder!

1300
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,328
Wait.

1301
01:17:48,556 --> 01:17:49,830
- Did you kill Elaine?!
- No!

1302
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:51,056
Why'd you break in?
Do you have a key?

1303
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:52,574
Elaine gave me the key.

1304
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:53,501
Why would she give you a key?

1305
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:56,319
I loved her.

1306
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,391
We were dating, all last year.
All summer.

1307
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:59,156
Elaine never dated.

1308
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,083
It's not allowed for R.A.'S
and undergrads

1309
01:18:01,235 --> 01:18:02,235
so we didn't tell anyone.

1310
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:05,905
I loved her.

1311
01:18:05,907 --> 01:18:06,906
I want to find out
who killed her.

1312
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:08,908
Bull!

1313
01:18:08,926 --> 01:18:10,220
Find out how?
What are you looking for in
here?

1314
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:13,670
Elaine sent me a text
the night she died.

1315
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,242
She was sending it
right when she was killed.

1316
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:16,765
Elaine... fell.

1317
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:18,526
In the middle of texting me?

1318
01:18:18,602 --> 01:18:20,177
What proof?

1319
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,271
Pictures.

1320
01:18:22,423 --> 01:18:24,181
I'm not sure of what.

1321
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,919
She took them on her phone
at one of those "dinners"

1322
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:27,760
and printed them to make sure
they couldn't disappear.

1323
01:18:27,762 --> 01:18:30,612
Good thing, too, because

1324
01:18:30,765 --> 01:18:33,449
her phone got smashed
when she died.

1325
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:35,284
But I don't know where
she put them.

1326
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:36,435
Her parents let me go through

1327
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:38,045
everything they took
from here but...

1328
01:18:38,122 --> 01:18:39,547
I-I think they're still in here

1329
01:18:39,698 --> 01:18:40,697
if you haven't found them yet...

1330
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,291
I didn't do this.

1331
01:18:42,443 --> 01:18:43,442
I cut your shoulder.

1332
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:45,461
That time, yes.

1333
01:18:45,613 --> 01:18:46,757
But you almost caught me,
and then the new lock...

1334
01:18:46,781 --> 01:18:48,205
Which you tried to pick.

1335
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:52,634
I couldn't get in!
I didn't do this.

1336
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:54,431
I’ll prove it to you if we
can find the pictures.

1337
01:18:54,455 --> 01:18:55,455
Just help me, please!

1338
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:58,141
For Elaine.

1339
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,737
Okay, where haven't you looked?

1340
01:19:02,813 --> 01:19:06,465
Almost everywhere.
I'd barely started.

1341
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,107
Okay, we'll help you.
Let's start looking.

1342
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:21,071
(Whispering) He's lying, Jen.

1343
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,831
You even said,
a "guy she dumped."

1344
01:19:22,984 --> 01:19:25,575
He had a key.

1345
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,395
He could have gotten in here
during the party.

1346
01:19:27,488 --> 01:19:28,799
He could have killed Elaine,
and no one would ever...

1347
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:30,223
Okay, it doesn't hurt
to look, Beth.

1348
01:19:46,007 --> 01:19:47,114
Okay, search Sarah's bed.

1349
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:20,373
Hey. I found something.

1350
01:20:52,073 --> 01:20:55,424
Beth? You?
But, if he forced you...

1351
01:20:55,576 --> 01:20:56,576
He didn't force me.

1352
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:00,762
I love Dr. Davrow.

1353
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:03,840
He's brilliant and beautiful.

1354
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,268
A genius.

1355
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,437
But you you told me
to dress up for him.

1356
01:21:08,589 --> 01:21:09,922
You told me about
the study with the art...

1357
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:12,182
You delivered me to him.

1358
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:16,370
I was trying to help you!
Get your grades up.

1359
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:17,687
Get you your track scholarship!

1360
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:23,836
But he was right,
you're so... Ungrateful.

1361
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:26,882
And so was Elaine.

1362
01:21:31,612 --> 01:21:34,947
She was going to expose
the whole thing.

1363
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,466
And not only ruin
Dr. Davrow's good name,

1364
01:21:37,618 --> 01:21:39,635
she was going to ruin mine!

1365
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:41,378
I would have been kicked
out of school,

1366
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,123
no college degree,
no future at all.

1367
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,307
And so you murdered her?

1368
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:48,143
I wanted to keep her quiet.

1369
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:49,811
I wanted the pictures,

1370
01:21:49,964 --> 01:21:51,721
but she fought me, and she fell.

1371
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:52,889
She fell!

1372
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,149
Sarah didn't fall!

1373
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:56,969
Sarah stayed quiet.

1374
01:21:56,987 --> 01:21:58,728
The whole thing had quieted down

1375
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,582
until you came around
and stirred it back up again.

1376
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:03,417
And you...

1377
01:22:03,494 --> 01:22:05,661
Breaking in here.

1378
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:07,829
I suppose I should thank you.

1379
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:09,102
I've been looking for those.

1380
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:19,341
Phone too.

1381
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:21,843
Time to delete that text.

1382
01:22:21,996 --> 01:22:24,513
Why didn't she just
text you the pictures?

1383
01:22:24,665 --> 01:22:26,273
I'd ask her,
if you hadn't killed her!

1384
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,445
[Gunshot]

1385
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:46,795
Kyle: Come on!

1386
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:56,804
Wait, wait.

1387
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,175
I'm not going to make it
down 12 flights.

1388
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,289
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not fast enough.

1389
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,641
Come on.

1390
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:01,624
Beth: Hey!

1391
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,644
Come on.

1392
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:10,734
[Growling]
You can't run! You can't hide!

1393
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,998
Call Jenny!

1394
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:25,332
Mom?

1395
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:26,834
I'm on my way.

1396
01:23:26,985 --> 01:23:27,743
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Are you okay?

1397
01:23:27,895 --> 01:23:28,910
Where are you?

1398
01:23:29,063 --> 01:23:30,245
I'm coming to the dorms.

1399
01:23:30,397 --> 01:23:31,747
No, no, no! Not there!

1400
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:33,915
Jenny, I can't hear you.

1401
01:23:34,068 --> 01:23:35,068
Mom?

1402
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:39,346
Call Jenny! Call Jenny!

1403
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,593
Where's the police station?

1404
01:23:44,745 --> 01:23:45,761
This way. This way.

1405
01:23:45,913 --> 01:23:46,913
Okay.

1406
01:24:15,793 --> 01:24:18,010
[Tires screech and squeal]

1407
01:24:19,797 --> 01:24:20,797
Kyle: Jenny!

1408
01:24:22,449 --> 01:24:24,224
Yeah. It's crazy
how this all went down, huh?

1409
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:32,457
Kyle finds out
that the love of his life

1410
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:33,959
is sleeping with Dr. Davrow..

1411
01:24:33,961 --> 01:24:34,810
To get her grades up,

1412
01:24:34,962 --> 01:24:36,737
and in a jealous rage,

1413
01:24:36,814 --> 01:24:39,147
throws her off the rooftop.

1414
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,982
What are you talking about?

1415
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:42,409
Beth: I'm talking about

1416
01:24:42,486 --> 01:24:44,411
how Jenny saw the scratch
she gave to the guy

1417
01:24:44,488 --> 01:24:46,154
who broke into our room
on your arm,

1418
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:48,156
and you killed her.

1419
01:24:48,309 --> 01:24:49,452
It's just lucky that I
got here in time

1420
01:24:49,476 --> 01:24:50,751
to shoot you with your own gun

1421
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:51,955
before you got away with murder.

1422
01:24:51,979 --> 01:24:53,236
No.

1423
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,588
Again.

1424
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:55,809
Beth, please, you don't

[Gunshot]

1426
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:01,503
Are you crazy?

1427
01:25:01,655 --> 01:25:04,431
No, Jenny. I'm pissed.

1428
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,159
Pissed that you just
wouldn't let it go!

1429
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:08,769
You know, I liked you.

1430
01:25:08,846 --> 01:25:10,679
You were a way better
roommate than Sarah...

1431
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:13,849
But at least she shut up!

1432
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:15,161
Now look what you made Kyle do.

Kristen: Jenny!

1436
01:25:30,684 --> 01:25:31,608
Are you okay?

1437
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,201
I'm okay.

1438
01:25:33,354 --> 01:25:34,110
You're okay.

1439
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,295
Kyle!

1440
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:40,542
Kyle. Kyle. Okay.

1441
01:25:40,694 --> 01:25:42,136
Hey. It's okay.

1442
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:47,699
Yes. We need help.

1443
01:25:47,718 --> 01:25:49,125
A student's been shot
outside the dorms.

1444
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:50,644
At um.. Channing
and... and Telegraph!

1445
01:25:52,373 --> 01:25:54,373
Hey. Hang on.

Is everyone okay?

No, we need help.
We need a doctor.

1449
01:26:01,548 --> 01:26:04,399
Man's voice: I'm a doctor.

1450
01:26:04,551 --> 01:26:08,478
Psychology. Does that help?

1451
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,572
How'd he know where we...?

1452
01:26:10,724 --> 01:26:12,684
Beth told you that
Sarah and I were on the bridge.

1453
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:14,575
He killed professor Harrington.

1454
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:18,580
That old man
thought he was better than me.

1455
01:26:18,732 --> 01:26:21,008
Wanted to report me!

1456
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:22,492
If he was thirty years younger,

1457
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,751
he would have been thanking me.

1458
01:26:27,074 --> 01:26:29,424
You really did raise a fine...

1459
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:30,656

You know what "R.A." Stands for?
"Really awesome."

1466
01:27:32,656 --> 01:27:34,748
Good enough to get
my scholarship back?

1467
01:27:34,825 --> 01:27:36,825
It is still not my decision.

1468
01:27:36,977 --> 01:27:38,137
It's the athletic director's.

1473
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,857
Sarah, can I just say
how happy I am

1474
01:28:09,009 --> 01:28:10,191
