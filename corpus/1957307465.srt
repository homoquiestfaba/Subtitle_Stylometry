1
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:04,198
Give me the phone.

2
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,683
No!

3
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:07,702
No, no!

4
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,130
[Screams]

5
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,376
[Girl screams]

6
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,726
Man on phone: Have you had
a chance
to look over the spreadsheets?

7
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,297
Steven:
Yeah.
Those numbers look good.

8
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,562
Man on phone:
What about your flight?

9
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,892
Yeah, I'm on the 10:15
flight tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,657
You have me through the weekend?

11
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,658
Man on phone: Yeah.

12
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,677
Yeah.

13
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:58,326
Man on phone: Be ready.

14
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,586
Okay.

15
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:00,179
Man on phone:
It's gonna be a long one.

16
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,013
Hi.

17
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:01,755
Lookin' strong, kiddo.

18
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:03,831
Feeling strong, daddy-o.

19
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,742
It just stiffens up
on me sometimes.

20
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,685
Man on phone: Hey, be sure
to send over your report.

21
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:07,762
Steven yes, sir.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,357
Jenny: Hey.

23
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:13,434
Hey.

24
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,361
Leg hurt?

25
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,879
Not as much as losing
my scholarship.

26
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,368
Are you rushing it?

27
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:26,096
Mom, I've been
babying it all summer.

28
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,097
If I'm gonna get
my scholarship back,

29
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,766
I have to start training again.

30
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,044
(Squealing) My baby's going
off to college. (Laughs)

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,379
Please don't gush.

32
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,697
Ah! Give me a hug.

33
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,215
Don't.

34
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,717
Come on!

35
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:39,868
I'm an empty nester now.

36
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:42,463
Gimme a break.

37
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,224
I love you.

38
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,725
Love you.

39
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:47,375
Let me help you pack.

40
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,394
Okay. I need it.

41
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:58,070
This is really beautiful, mom.
All my favorites.

42
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,887
We thought you'd enjoy
one last home cooked meal

43
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,240
before dorm food.

44
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,800
Absolutely.

45
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,869
To our brave
and beautiful Jen Jen.

46
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,249
We love you so much.
Scholarship or not.

47
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,875
You'll never disappoint us.

48
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,426
Now don't party too much and
flunk all your classes.

49
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,224
Um... like I flunked
stand-up comedy?

50
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,587
Kristen: What's wrong?

51
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,441
No, it's just
I'm nervous about the move.

52
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:39,002
30 miles.

53
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:42,114
You'll be home to do
your laundry on the weekends.

54
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,783
It's not the distance.

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,180
It's not even that it's my first
time being away from home.

56
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,622
It's dorms. Roommates.

57
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,017
What if I don't like them?
What if they don't like me?

58
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,111
I lived in the dorms in college.

59
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,358
I met your dad in the dorms.
Made friends.

60
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,926
Like Linda. It'll be great.

61
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:05,954
You'll see.

62
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:22,487
Here. Lemme get that.

63
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,547
Thank you.

64
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,549
Anything else?

65
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:27,885
No. That's it.

66
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,295
Oh! I'm gonna cry.

67
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,399
Please don't.

68
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,568
I'm gonna tell a joke.

69
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:48,347
Oh! Please don't.

70
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,330
Have fun.

71
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
You too.

72
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,851
Love ya, kiddo.

73
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:57,022
I love you.

74
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,190
Good luck.

75
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,266
- Bye.
- Have fun.

76
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,196
Let's go.

77
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,368
â™ª

78
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,910
So exciting!

79
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,247
Gosh, it's so big.
I'm gonna get lost.

80
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,415
You won't get lost.

81
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,229
We don't get a lot of new
students
after winter break,

82
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:18,733
but we're glad to have
some new faces.

83
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:24,668
This is our dining hall.

84
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,611
You'll spend a lot of time here.

85
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:27,688
(Kristen chuckles)

86
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:37,122
If you're used to
a high school cafeteria,

87
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,625
you'll recognize the abundance
of
starches and carbohydrates.

88
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:43,186
But don't worry,
every 5000 calorie meal

89
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:46,298
is topped off at the
all-you-can-eat
snack bar,

90
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,449
which I invite you
to partake of now.

91
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,469
Alright.

92
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:53,766
Did they have this
when you lived in the dorms?

93
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,218
Oh, yeah.
I gained the freshman fifteen.

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,220
Ice cream here,
and my campus job

95
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:02,147
is at the smoothie shop.
Forget it.

96
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,149
You'll be training again.

97
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:07,319
You'll need
all these scrumptious calories.

98
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:08,653
So, the tour guide.

99
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,307
Articulate with a hint
of sarcasm? Hmm?

100
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,143
Mom, don't "hmm" me
over every guy we see.

101
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,330
Okay, not every guy,
but what about that one?

102
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,335
Stop.

103
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:24,728
He's cute.

104
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,890
Okay, you're embarrassing me.

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,250
[Elevator rings]

106
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:32,753
Anyone for floor 11?

107
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,187
I'm also on 12.

108
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:44,839
Oh, penthouse.

109
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,251
(Chuckles) I'm the floor RA.
"Resident assistant."

110
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,028
The school feels
more comfortable

111
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:52,197
trusting the welfare
of irresponsible freshman

112
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:53,868
to equally
irresponsible grad students.

113
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,162
Just kidding. Sort of.

114
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
This is the bathroom.

115
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,552
What? You've never seen
a co-ed bathroom before?

116
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:14,628
No.

117
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,394
Everyone's a jokester.

118
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:23,545
Let's see where you are.

119
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,293
1227?

120
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:32,629
What?

121
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:33,738
Um... uh, nothing.

122
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,701
It's right down here.

123
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,081
That was weird, right?

124
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,475
Like my room leads
into a Stephen King novel?

125
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,402
No. No, no, no.

126
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,422
It was weird.

127
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,650
Uh, here it is. 1227.

128
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,932
Let me know
if you need anything.

129
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:03,661
[Knock on door]

130
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,593
Hello. 1227, a little bit
o' heaven. I'm Beth.

131
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,613
Come in.

132
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:16,615
Jenny.

133
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,858
Jenny Willis. And my mom.

134
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,952
Hi. I'm Kristen.

135
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,622
And that's sour Sarah.

136
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,790
Ignore her,
and she'll do the same.

137
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,350
She'll even ignore you
if you don't.

138
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,701
But don't worry,

139
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,854
I'm friendly enough
for the both of us.

140
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,523
That's your bed.
And your desk.

141
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,645
Not claustrophobic, are you?

142
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,802
Uh, not yet.

143
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,638
Right? The double rooms
are even smaller.

144
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,698
The triples are a trade off.

145
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,642
We get a little
extra floor space,

146
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:45,938
even though the bunk doesn't
take up that much more room.

147
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,036
Beth.

148
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:48,980
What? She's gonna
sleep in that bed

149
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,137
whether you like it or not.

150
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:55,378
What's wrong with her?

151
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,489
Sorry about her.

152
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:58,882
She warms up
once you get to know her.

153
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:03,069
Oh, wait... No.
She doesn't.

154
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,330
What made her so upset?

155
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,868
She was really fond
of our last roommate, Elaine.

156
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,742
But there'll be time
for all that later.

157
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,504
We have you now!

158
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,063
Where's all your stuff?

159
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,732
It's in the car.

160
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,400
- Let's go get it.
- Okay.

161
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,459
Okay, when you're done, let's
meet in the cafeteria.

162
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah, I usually just skip
this whole section

163
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,861
and go straight to the veggies.

164
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,421
Only thing worse
than the freshman fifteen

165
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
is the sophomore sixty.

166
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Sixty?

167
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,535
Girls come in here
wanting to be models

168
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,326
and by Christmas
they're made out of Clay.

169
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,696
What's up, toppers?

170
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,716
Toppers?

171
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,791
Top floor.

172
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,369
Meet Jenny.
My new lower.

173
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:04,889
Hi.

174
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,041
You got Elaine's bed?

175
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,893
Everyone, stop.

176
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,062
You didn't tell her?

177
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,230
You have to tell her?

178
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,307
What? Tell me what?

179
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,236
Lot of returning students
had a party last week.

180
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:19,993
Last rager before classes start.
And Elaine

181
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,410
well, everyone was having fun,
but it was loud.

182
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,662
So, she went to the roof
to get some air and she...

183
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
She what?

184
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,810
She fell.

185
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:34,828
She fell?

186
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:41,484
She died.

187
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,261
Your last roommate
fell off the roof

188
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,430
and died at the party
last weekend?

189
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,701
And I'm sleeping in her bed?

[Cell phone rings]

191
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:01,946
Hey.

192
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,840
Steven: Hi.

193
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,341
Kristen (on phone) I love that
you're working so hard

194
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,952
to keep Jenny
in private school.
How's it going?

195
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:11,289
It's still going.
How's it going with you?

196
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
Horrible. I left her at 1:00,
and she still hasn't called.

197
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,465
Steven:
It's only 5:00.

198
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,802
Uh, yeah, I know,
but it feels like a lifetime.

199
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:25,303
Why don't you call her?

200
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,472
No.

201
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,808
I know you,

202
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,603
you're gonna worry
about her until you call her.

203
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,202
I don't want to bug her.

204
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,704
You're not gonna be able
to fall asleep

205
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,147
until you call her. Just call
her.

206
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:38,483
Alright, well, I gotta
get back in this meeting.

207
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,902
I love you. Okay? Bye.

208
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,322
If you believe she fell.

Michelle.

210
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,991
I'm just saying.

211
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,827
Elaine bombed last year.

212
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:51,054
Her grades went from like
Aâ€™s to Câ€™s and Dâ€™s,

213
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,664
and there's a rumor going around

214
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:53,959
that she didn't
fall from the balcony.

215
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:54,666
She jumped.

216
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,893
She jumped?

217
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,561
Enough, Michelle.

[Cell phone rings]

219
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,679
Honey, what's wrong?

220
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,331
The girl who was in my bed
last semester died.

221
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,742
That girl died?
Are you kidding?

222
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,019
I know. It's so horrible.

223
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,574
I'm coming to get you
right now, okay?

224
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:18,247
No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:20,024
No, no, no, no.

226
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,584
You can't live in the dorms.
You can't.

227
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,602
You can commute.

228
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:24,420
An hour each way?

229
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,197
Yes, you can!

230
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,350
I know. But I can't just
run away on my first day.

231
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,536
Besides, I have to be on the
track in the afternoon.

232
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,097
I'm coming to get you.
Okay? A girl died.

233
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:38,267
Mom, it's okay.

234
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,027
I'm okay.
I'll call you later.

235
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,047
No, Jen Jen.
You have to come home.

236
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,564
Jenny:
You won't understand, mom.

237
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,446
Jenny?

238
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,730
Sorry. I-I didn't mean to...

239
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,139
Jenny: No!

240
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,808
I-I don't know why I'm so upset.

241
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,903
I mean, you guys
are the ones that knew her.

242
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,419
Because you have to sleep
in her bed.

243
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:11,743
Hey, babe.

244
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,394
Stop, Dane.

245
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,747
Dane! Seriously,
leave me alone.

246
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:17,209
That is not what you
were saying all last year.

247
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,642
That's right, last year.

248
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,920
So, by now you should accept

249
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,662
that it's never
going to happen again.

250
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,088
Never say never.

251
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Hey!

252
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,092
I want my dorm room key.

253
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:38,512
Hey!

254
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:47,946
Are you okay?

255
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,948
Should we call security?

256
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:51,950
Don't bother.
I'm sure it was Dane.

257
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,509
Dane? Whoever it was,

258
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,954
I got him really good
on the shoulder.

259
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,513
I gave him a key
back when we were dating,

260
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,123
and he never gave it back.

261
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,880
Said he'd keep it
for when I "came around."

262
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,686
I just never thought
he'd use it.

263
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:05,088
Probably trying to
steal my panties!

264
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,362
Take off your shirt!

265
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,788
I knew you'd come around
eventually.

266
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,789
Oh, god!

267
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,308
What is going on?

268
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,770
Someone broke into our room.
I cut his shoulder.

269
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:19,626
And you think that Iâ€™m...

270
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,646
Give me my key.

271
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,046
I was just hoping that we
would be able to...

272
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,064
Leave me alone.

273
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,994
I didn't go into your room.

274
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,161
I wouldn't do that.

275
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,394
You're both all right?

276
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:48,006
Anything uh, missing or stolen?

277
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:50,566
Only our sense
of safety and security.

278
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,844
You're doing
a bang-up job, "R.A."

279
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,178
First Elaine, now this.

280
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,091
I-I'm... I'm sorry.

281
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:01,352
I'll put in a req
to have the key re-lock...

282
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,146
The, uh, the lock re-keyed.

283
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,174
How long does that take?

284
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,361
(Sighs) A couple of days.

285
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,365
(Scoffs) We'll sleep
real soundly until then.

286
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,707
Kinda hard on him.

287
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,767
He's lucky
I didn't sting him harder.

288
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,878
Beth, the guy... The guy in here,

289
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,938
I mean, he was... He was looking
for something.

290
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,215
You know, I'm still not
convinced
it wasn't Dane.

291
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,942
He's got a whole...

292
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,720
No. He wasn't just
looking for panties, Beth.

293
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,757
I mean, he... He was really
looking for something.

294
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,460
Do you think
that it could have been

295
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:44,062
about Elaine?

296
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:45,396
Elaine?

297
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,065
I don't know.

298
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:47,899
Does she have any stuff
still here?

299
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,625
Her parents took it all.

300
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:50,401
It's just weird, you know?

301
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:53,296
A week ago, she dies

302
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,406
and now someone breaks in?

303
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,300
Maybe...

304
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:58,502
Maybe she didn't jump or fall.

305
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,306
Maybe she was murdered.

306
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:06,492
No. The police were here.

307
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,477
They questioned everyone.

308
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,714
There was twenty people
in the hall,

309
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:10,755
and no one saw anyone.

310
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,815
But you said it was a party.

311
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,594
I mean, no one was probably
paying attention?

312
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:16,928
Did anyone not like her?

313
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,223
Was there a guy that she dumped?

314
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,264
Everyone liked Elaine.

315
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,267
And I never even saw her date.

316
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:26,437
She wasn't killed, Jenny.

317
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,274
I mean, the police
said I it was an accident.

318
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:29,942
She fell.

319
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,622
And time to walk on eggshells.

320
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:45,773
I'm gonna take a shower.

321
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:56,694
Thanks for shopping at blush.

322
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,755
Thank you.

323
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:00,531
Have a nice day, ladies.

324
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:01,608
Thank you.

325
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,762
Died?

326
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,188
A student died?

327
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,541
Yeah.

328
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,359
And Jen is sleeping in her bed?

329
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,378
Can I make her move home?

330
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,548
Oh, I want her to move home.

331
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,960
At 18?
How's that gonna work?

332
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:22,611
I don't know.

333
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,947
And how does someone spend
two decades of their life

334
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,782
trying to keep their kid safe,

335
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:27,892
only to have them move away

336
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:29,603
and not be able
to protect them anymore?

337
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,731
I have two under ten,
and I cannot wait

338
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,048
until they're both
out of the house

339
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,068
and have to
keep themselves alive.

340
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,463
Oh, no, you say that now,
and then they're gone,

341
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,406
and all you can think about

342
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:47,078
is how you've totally
lost your purpose.

345
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,321
Worst first night
in the dorms ever, huh?

346
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,932
Coulda been worse.

347
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,123
You could've been stuck in
a double only with Sarah.

348
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:13,496
Come on.

349
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:15,439
When the going gets tough,

350
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,850
the tough go shopping!
My treat.

[Elevator rings]

352
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,114
Do you like it?

353
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,190
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that outfit,

354
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:26,951
but I admire your fire.

355
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:28,413
I bet you're the first
to raise your hand

00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:29,677
for every question, aren't you?

Jenny: Can we slow down?

358
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,037
Oh, my campus job.

359
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,779
Really?

360
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,280
Yeah.

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,373

Come on. First one's on me.

363
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,526
Okay. Ow!

364
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,951
What's wrong?

365
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,789
Sorry, uh, hit a rock
on the road of life.

366
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,458
Okay. I'm good.

367
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,517
My leg is acting up today.

368
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:29,335
Coach Simmons: Not bad.

369
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,517
Coach Simmons.

370
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:36,020
You set a pace for about
a 17, 18 second 100 meter.

371
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,857
Great. That would've
gotten me

372
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,288
sixth place at the church
picnic.

373
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,731
Even a church picnicker
couldn't hit 18 seconds

374
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:45,755
with a torn acl.

375
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm sorry
about the scholarship, Jenny.

376
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,869
It wasn't my call.

377
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,445
It's okay.

378
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,318
Gotta give the money
to someone who can run.

379
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,435
So, I'm gonna run, coach.

380
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,253
I'm gonna run my way
back into my scholarship.

381
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,740
When'd you get up,
two hours ago?

382
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,300
I didn't know
the first day of classes

383
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,438
was such a special occasion.

384
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,228
Every day is.

385
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,608
I feel my best
when I look my best.

386
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,328
Her grades were way
down last year.

387
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:44,561
College isn't for everyone.

388
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:55,933
How are you gonna
walk in those all day?

389
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,351
Beautifully.

390
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:35,973
Professor: I'll do it.

391
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,367
Honestly, Kyle, if your
assistance
is going to create

392
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:40,311
more hindrance than help,

393
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,312
I will find myself
another T.A.

394
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:42,388
Yes... sir.

395
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,135
Good morning.

396
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,155
Good morning!

397
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,492
This is American history 101.

398
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:59,646
If this is not the class
you're supposed to be in,

399
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,889
too bad you're stuck here

400
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,125
until I'm done in 50 minutes.

401
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,004
Where does
American history begin?

402
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:09,916
N...

403
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,661
This is a lecture, young lady.

404
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,238
Not a town hall.

405
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,432
The questions are rhetorical.

406
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,690
Kyle! Hey.

407
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:33,179
Jenny.
Yeah, I saw you in there.

408
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,519
You got a nip from old
Harrington.

409
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,537
Guess I asked for it though.
You didn't.

410
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,765
Ah, others are worse.

411
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:43,927
If you just let him
listen to himself talk,

412
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:44,951
you'll be all right.

413
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,550
How are you
after the other night?

414
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:56,220
Okay, I guess.

415
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,165
Sorry Beth was so hard on you.

416
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,226
She was just scared.

417
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:03,354
Hey, it's my job
to keep all the students

418
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:07,064
on my floor safe.
And I failed.

419
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:10,050
Twice now.

420
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,469
I asked for a rush
on that new lock.

421
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,905
Thanks.

422
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,305
[Thud]

423
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,186
You all jumped
when I came into the room?

424
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:29,996
Why?

425
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,743
Come on. This was in
your pre-term reading.

426
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,929
A loud noise startles you.

427
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,015
Is the reaction physiological
or psychological?

428
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:48,997
It's both.

429
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,166
Our brains instinctively
interpret loud noises

430
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:52,776
as potentially dangerous.

431
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:55,354
Then signal our bodies
to prepare for the threat.

432
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:56,447
By jumping out of your skin?

433
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:57,523
[Laughter]

434
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,286
Don't laugh. She's right.

435
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,680
Brain and body together

436
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:08,459
determine how we interpret and
react to our environment.

437
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:11,019
We want to examine
which is responsible for what?

438
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,022
What is instinct, as miss?

439
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,968
Willis. Jenny Willis. Jennifer.
Yeah. Jenny.

440
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,212
That's a lotta names.

441
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,622
As miss Willis has noted.

442
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:26,626
And what is a learned,
emotional response?

443
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:30,814
I am Dr. Davrow.
Welcome to my class.

444
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,140
Dr. Davrow: Thank you,
everyone.
We'll see you tomorrow.

445
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,508
Dr. Davrow (cont.) Miss Willis?
May I have a word?

446
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,828
Miss Willis?

447
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:48,666
Freshman? Very bold.

448
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,483
Most students would rather stick
their arm in a lion's cage

449
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,561
than in the air
on the first day of class.

450
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,839
I-I don't mind standing out.

451
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,841
University is more competitive
than high school.

452
00:27:57,918 --> 00:27:59,343
Even the bold
have to up their game

453
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:02,346
if they want to stand out.

454
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:03,823
I look forward
to seeing your paper.

455
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:14,692
[Heavy bass music plays]

456
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,373
Hey.

457
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,760
Okay, that's enough.
Headphones off!

458
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,177
Look, I'm not gonna sleep four
feet
from you for the next semester

459
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,126
and never have you say hello.

460
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,278
Hello.

461
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:47,707
You don't even know me.

462
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,785
You have no reason
not to like me.

463
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:52,955
Well, stealing my book
and my phone

464
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:54,398
seem like pretty good reasons.

465
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:57,125
I didn't...

466
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:58,144
Okay, fine. Here.

467
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,410
I don't dislike you.

468
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,413
I dislike Beth.

469
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,418
Why? Beth's nice.

470
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,307
Beth is as fake as twenty
dollar Prada.

471
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,315
She wakes up every morning,

472
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:21,925
and she hides behind
those dresses

473
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,463
because she's too afraid
to succeed in this world

474
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,429
as what she really is.

475
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,431
I'm sorry for ignoring you.

476
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:31,827
Whatever, but I'm not going
to fake nice just because.

477
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:33,229
So I have to choose
between you two?

478
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,107
No, Jenny. I chose.

479
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,323
Kyle? What happened?

480
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,329
Uh... professor Harrington.
He, uh... Heart attack.

481
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,344
Thank you very much.

482
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,559
Everything okay, miss Willis?

483
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,990
Let's take a look at your paper.

484
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,213
My paper?

485
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,734
Yes. The assignment.
You completed it, right?

486
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,902
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

487
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:48,965
Here.

488
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,768
You're gonna have to work harder
than that to stand out.

489
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,395
Okay. Diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders.

490
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,017
What was that?

491
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:26,777
Dr. Davrow.

492
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,337
Excuse me?

493
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:32,616
My students address me
as "Dr. Davrow."

494
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,953
Or "professor." It's an
honorific
that shows respect.

495
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,955
Well, you get respect
by showing it to others.

496
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:41,274
Hmm? Where'd you learn that?

497
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,627
Some book about the great
lessons
of kindergarten?

498
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:47,205
University is harder, Jenny.
Consider it a lesson.

499
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:48,799
In what, humiliation?

500
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,043
In rising to the challenge.

501
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:55,030
And you start by
putting yourself together.

502
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,865
This outfit, I don't know
what you call it.

503
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,792
Frumpy tracksuit?
You can do better.

504
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,478
How dare you!

505
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,963
I dare because I care.

506
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:07,709
You see, I can quote
pithy aphorisms, too.

507
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:08,779
So you're saying
you graded me down

508
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,487
because of my clothes?

509
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:14,049
No, I graded you down because
your paper was rushed,

510
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,068
ill-conceived and
subpar for my class.

511
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:19,496
And I'm pointing out to you
that going through life

512
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,740
looking like you slept
in an alleyway,

513
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,294
you'll find, repels rather than
attracts people

514
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:24,838
who might be in a position
to help you.

515
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,840
Which I could, if you show me
you're worthy.

516
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:35,679
He did it in front of everyone.

517
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,498
It was horrifying.

518
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,426
What, the paper or him
telling you to dress nicer?

519
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:42,761
Both!

520
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:43,913
Totally inappropriate!

521
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:48,859
What?

522
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,418
I don't know about the paper,

523
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,030
but as for the clothes,
I told you

524
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,590
I wouldn't be caught dead in...

525
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,289
Okay, "looking your best
to feel your best"

526
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,202
is different than dressing up

527
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,096
to get grades you should be
getting based on your work.

528
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,265
And if your work
can only get you so far?

529
00:34:03,283 --> 00:34:05,600
I don't claim to be
a unicorn, Jenny.

530
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,619
I know my merits.

531
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,382
(Scoffs) Are you saying
that... To get grades?

532
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:14,109
Beth, why, why would you...

533
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,887
What? You've never
batted your lashes

534
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,258
at a traffic cop to get out
of a speeding ticket?

535
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:20,390
Jenny no!

536
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,742
Flirted with the bouncer to
get past the line at a club?

537
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,897
Whatever. It's not like
I was failing.

538
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,383
I wore a nice dress and heels
to Davrow's class

539
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,402
and got an "a"
where I might have gotten a
"B."

540
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:35,130
What about the girls
who don't have a nice dress,

541
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:37,908
or don't look
as good as you in one?

542
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,296
Should they suffer because they
won't
flirt with the professor?

543
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,913
Just because he marks me up
for playing along

544
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,063
doesn't mean he marks anyone
else down who doesn't.

545
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,415
He did it to me!

546
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,250
If he had given you an "a"

547
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,242
in front of everyone,
would you be complaining?

548
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,507
It's like my chemistry teacher
once said,

549
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:57,319
"if you've got it, flaunt it."

550
00:34:57,337 --> 00:35:00,246
And somewhere
underneath that uh...

551
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,675
What'd you say he called it?
Frumpy tracksuit?

552
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:04,827
You've got it.

553
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,053
I don't want to get it
like that.

554
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:18,115
Oh, look. Kyle finally
made himself useful.

555
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,436
I cannot believe
neither one of you

556
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,180
told me someone tried to
break into our room.

557
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:28,032
You're not exactly
chatty with us.

558
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,185
Uh... Sarah?

559
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:32,295
Maintenance man new keys.

560
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:32,796
Thank you.

561
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,297
Thank you.

562
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,523
Now that we can sleep soundly.

563
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,968
All we have to do is find a guy

564
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:40,244
trolling the halls with a gouge
you put in his shoulder.

565
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,978
15.75 seconds.

566
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,058
Jenny: That's okay.

567
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,931
Jenny (cont.)
I'm gonna go home
this weekend.

568
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
You here for dinner tonight?

569
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,587
You're working overtime
for me, aren't you?

570
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,255
What?

571
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,408
You never
used to work this much.

572
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,410
Or go out of town
on the weekends.

573
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:30,020
No, kiddo. It's just this deal.

574
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,646
It's dragging me by the tail.

575
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,694
Worth every second though
to see you at Oldbridge.

576
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,030
You sure you don't want me
to transfer to state?

577
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:41,439
I'd rather have a hundred jobs

578
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,658
drag me around first. Okay?

579
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,263
Am I cooking,
or bringing something home?

580
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:51,524
Home cooked, please!
And no starches.

581
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,877
Well, I gotta go.
Love you, kiddo. Love you.

582
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,437
Love you, too.

583
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,047
Jenny: Love you, daddy-o.

584
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,198
And thanks.

585
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:02,368
You know...

586
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm sorry about...

587
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,131
Ah...

588
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:15,473
Me too. I wish
I could... Meddle forever.

589
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,216
But, you're an adult now...

590
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,694
And you can make
your own decisions.

591
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:24,407
But not for being worried.

592
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,985
I will always be your mother,

593
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:28,417
whether you let me
meddle or not.

594
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,253
And a student dying at a
party...

595
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:34,901
I just can't turn it off.

596
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,295
Kristen: Linda wants
to do a makeover for you.

597
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,672
How beautiful is she?

598
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:49,266
Stop.

599
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,937
You're gonna have to
bat the boys away.

600
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,086
Or I could just go plain

601
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:54,920
and not have to worry about
them bothering me at all.

602
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,165
Oh...

603
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,834
Jen Jen,
having boy troubles already?

604
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,836
She's in college, Kris,

605
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:04,948
they're not boys anymore,
they're men.

606
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,619
All right,
are you having men problems?

607
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:07,358
No, I'm not.

608
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,194
How about the cute jock?

609
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,029
He's a jerk.

610
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,622
Oh, do tell.

611
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,457
Is he coming on too strong

612
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,351
or is he holding back too much?

613
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:17,421
I've only ever found
one or the other,

614
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,296
casual or confident.

615
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,706
Never one who's mastered
"casually
confident." (Laughs)

616
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,449
There's no one, okay?

617
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,302
No one I'm dating. No one
I'm interested in.

618
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:26,619
Jenny, I... I'm sorry I didn't...

619
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,972
Lin, it's not you.

620
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:29,955
Hi. Welcome to blush.

621
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,975
Welcome.

622
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:33,218
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:46,156
You know, we just got these in.

624
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,828
Too casual? Too confident?

625
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:56,588
You're the perfect blend
of both, you know.

626
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:06,919
What's going on?

627
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,167
Promise not to judge me?

628
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:16,412
I'll hold it in.

629
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,189
And I'm not moving home.

630
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:24,936
There's a rumor on campus

631
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:27,271
that some of the professors

632
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:29,532
will give a girl better grades

633
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,201
if she dresses up for class.

634
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,872
And how much truth
is there to this rumor?

635
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,167
Please don't make
a big deal out of it.

636
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,435
Jenny, it is a big deal.

637
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,270
If it's true,
you should report him.

638
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:44,606
Well, no one
actually told me to dress up.

639
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,104
Then what exactly
have they told you?!

640
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:49,962
Nothing.

641
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:57,582
I knew this was going to happen.

642
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,400
You've been stuffing down
your feelings

643
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:04,809
about that girl dying.

644
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:05,885
Mom, it's...
It's not just that.

645
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,904
What?

646
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,407
Jenny, what?

647
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,399
Mom! Mom!!

648
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,918
Get in the car.

649
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:23,068
I'm not moving home!

650
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,754
You are!

651
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:25,922
Mother!

652
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,590
Daughter!

653
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:28,983
Someone broke into your room,

654
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,927
and you've been
hiding it from me.

655
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:31,836
Lying to me about it!

656
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,263
I didn't lie about anything!

657
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,155
Sin of omission. Get in the car.

658
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:35,932
No!

659
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,728
Others are telling girls
to dress up for grades.

660
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:38,768
And a professor died!

661
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,994
He had a heart attack.

662
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,496
Get in the car!

663
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm going back to school.

664
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:45,608
You're not.

665
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,404
You said yourself
I can make my own decisions.

666
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,445
Good ones!

667
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,906
Jennifer! Jennifer!!

668
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:00,159
Jenny:
Thanks, Beth, for picking me up

669
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:01,783
Jenny (cont.)
And showing me around town.

670
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:07,689
Hey, do you see this?

671
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,782
Someone was trying
to get back in.

672
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,801
Should we call security?

673
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,635
It's after midnight.

674
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,029
They won't get here til morning.

675
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:17,865
Maybe it was Sarah
trying to get in.

676
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:19,476
Lost her new key?

677
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,126
Well, I'm starving.

678
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,198
I'm gonna downstairs
and eat a snack.

679
00:41:22,222 --> 00:41:23,387
Do you want to come with me?

680
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I'm really tired.

681
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:26,649
Good night.

682
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,801
Good night.

00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,247
Kyle, what the heck?!

687
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,173
I'm sorry I didn't mean...

688
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,917
I just saw you
and thought Iâ€™d...

689
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:11,361
Scare me half to death?

690
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,988

the protein bars.

694
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:42,541
Thanks, Kyle.

695
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,601
I'm Ms. Kingsley, your new
American history teacher.

696
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,980
I can't even believe...
This is ridiculous.

697
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,065
Beth: Oh, come on.

698
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,809
A bunch of rich parents

699
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,310
just bribed their kids into
college.

700
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:10,645
You don't think any of them

701
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:11,715
wouldn't have jumped at the
chance

702
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,314
to just get them a new wardrobe?

703
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,573
Do you even hear yourself?

704
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,093
I mean, do you have any
self-respect at all?

705
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,411
Yes, enough to shower

706
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,172
and put on nice clothes
every day.

707
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:22,604
Where's your self respect,
Sarah?

708
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:25,509
In here, Beth!

709
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:26,844
In my heart,

where I protect it
with everything I've got

from disgusting,
degrading sell-outs like you!

00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,517
Don't make her wrong.
She's not wrong.

720
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:55,966
We are.

721
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,766
Oh, this is so exciting!
[Squeals]

722
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:10,480
Look at you!

723
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:17,804
Wow!

724
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:30,242
Excuse me.

725
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:10,989
Good morning, miss Willis.

726
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:15,770
Good morning, Dr. Davrow.

727
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:17,880
Okay, now you're just
kissing up.

728
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,032
Wouldn't think of it.

729
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,820
Let's talk about
psychopathology.

730
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,786
For those who can never
know what it's like

731
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:34,564
to be inside the mind
of a psychopath.

732
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,307
Where do we draw the line

733
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,901
between abnormality
and abnormally genius?

734
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:44,293
Beth:
Can I have a salad please?

735
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:45,317
Thank you.

736
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,303
I don't have to dress
for dinner, do I?

737
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,914
Don't act like Iâ€™m
twisting your arm.

738
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:54,417
Not you. Dr. Davrow.

739
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:55,585
Back up from "Câ€™s".

740
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,404
Wonder what I have to do

741
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,149
to get the grade
I actually deserve in his class?

742
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:03,328
Stop wearing anything at all?

743
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:04,836
[Cell phone rings]

744
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:18,591
Everything all right?

745
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:21,444
I don't know.

746
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,282
I'm trying to let her
solve her own problems

747
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,269
but it isn't easy.

748
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,863
You can't hold her hand
all through college.

749
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:35,440
She's a smart kid, Kris.

750
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,700
You know, her way

751
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:37,921
may not be the same as yours,

752
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:39,444
but she'll find it.

753
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,464
I know.

754
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,049
Can I steer her
from behind a little bit?

755
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:12,811
Jenny:
I don't know if this
was a good idea.

756
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,957
Beth: It's gonna be awesome.

757
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,573
Beth: (Cont.)
It's totally legit.

758
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:19,226
Beth: (Cont.) Lots of
faculty,
male and female students, too.

759
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:21,729
Beth: (Cont.) They talk
about internships,
jobs after graduation,

760
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:23,506
Beth: (Cont.)
Make connections for you.

761
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:25,217
I can't believe the girl
who is fighting

762
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:27,304
with everything she has to get
her track scholarship back

763
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:29,728
is getting crushed so easily by
putting on a dress and heels.

764
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:32,908
Okay, fine. Let's go.

765
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:37,520
(Inaudible background chatter
and music)

766
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,428
I told you it was great.

767
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,947
Oh, good evening, ladies.

768
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,708
You both look radiant.

769
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:00,101
Beth...

770
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,545
The lady in the gold
sequin dress

771
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:05,214
is the fashion editor
for haute couture.

772
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,382
And Jenny...

773
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,626
The gentleman in the gray suit

774
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:09,944
books athletic endorsements

775
00:48:09,962 --> 00:48:12,796
for running shoes.
Track, right?

776
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:14,206
Are you interested
in endorsements?

777
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,950
Uh, yeah.

778
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,709
Great.

779
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,561
Let me know
if I can make an introduction

780
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:20,396
for either one of you.

781
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:21,380
I'd offer you a drink,

782
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,715
but state law, university rules

783
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,735
and societal mores prevent it.

784
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:27,737
But do help yourselves
to some hors d'oeuvres

785
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:28,888
and mingle.

786
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,910
Okay, it's great.

787
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:36,988
Thank you.

788
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:41,751
Quite the soiree, isn't it?

789
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,713
Eric told me that he was
particularly interested

790
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:44,328
in having you here.

791
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,829
Eric?

792
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,256
Dr. Davrow.

793
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:48,644
He says that you have
great potential

794
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:49,817
as a psychologist.

795
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:51,819
Oh, I'm not actually sure

796
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:52,653
I want to go into psychology.

797
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:53,672
History, maybe?

798
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:56,507
Whatever field you choose,

799
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:58,100
be proud of yourself, Jenny.

800
00:48:58,252 --> 00:48:59,251
The world needs
all of its young women

801
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,270
to grow up proud.

802
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,831
Will you excuse me?

803
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,924
I'll see you Monday morning,
8 A.M. the war of 1812.

804
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,777
Jackson and Lafayette
take on New Orleans.

805
00:49:07,928 --> 00:49:08,928
Thrilling.

806
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,768
You got gray suit's card?

807
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,271
Is your face coming
to a cereal box near me?

808
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,015
Okay, first I have to
get back on the track team.

809
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:24,109
Before that, I have to
pee. Bathroom?

810
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,295
Upstairs. Oh, and don't miss
the study on the left.

811
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,464
The artwork is unbelievable.

812
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,615
Okay. Come with me.

813
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:30,692
Yeah. Sure.

814
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:35,547
Dr. Davrow:
Beth.

815
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,143
Oh, you'll be okay.

816
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,900
Dr. Davrow:
Someone I want you to meet.

817
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:56,066
Dr. Davrow:
Impressive collection, isn't it?

818
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,552
Yeah, um, whose is it?

819
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,404
I mean, whose,
whose house are we in?

820
00:50:00,556 --> 00:50:01,664
Mine.

821
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh. This is a really nice house.

822
00:50:05,578 --> 00:50:08,004
Thank you.

823
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:13,234
Inspired by my travels. Italy.
Thailand. Borneo. Estonia.

824
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:14,902
Beautiful city of Tallinn.

825
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,520
All the buildings
are painted in pastels.

826
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:21,408
I didn't realize
teaching at public universities

827
00:50:21,427 --> 00:50:22,427
was so lucrative.

828
00:50:25,081 --> 00:50:28,024
They don't pay for the teaching.
They pay for the name.

829
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:29,935
I spent several years
building that, as well.

830
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,182
'66 chateau neuf de pape?

831
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,035
What happened to state law
and social mores?

832
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,376
I don't see either in here.
Cheers.

833
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:57,628
You don't like me, do you?

834
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,615
I... uh...
Why do you say that?

835
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:03,726
A man doesn't have to
travel the world

836
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:05,477
to discern when a
woman doesn't like him.

837
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,064
It shows in your eyes

838
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,957
every day in class.

839
00:51:09,975 --> 00:51:11,453
It's because I suggested
you dress up.

840
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:14,795
And you think
I'm basing your grades off it.

841
00:51:14,797 --> 00:51:18,407
You know, decades ago,
in the 60's,

842
00:51:18,484 --> 00:51:21,135
it would be unheard of for
a woman to show up to class

843
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:23,637
in sweat pants
and a torn tee-shirt.

844
00:51:23,656 --> 00:51:25,414
So should I get a pink
angora sweater

845
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:27,141
and a circle skirt
with a poodle on it?

846
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,420
You joke,
but it was the same for men.

847
00:51:31,497 --> 00:51:34,924
18, 19, 20-year-olds
would show up to school

848
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,593
every day in a suit and tie.

849
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:40,988
White dress shirts, starched
collar
and polished black wingtips.

850
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:44,174
Same at the office. Any office.

851
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:45,935
It showed respect
for their institutions,

852
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:50,106
their colleagues, themselves.

853
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,941
At a university,
it showed an appreciation

854
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:55,185
for higher learning,
which, I am sorry to say,

855
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,780
is lacking in the halls
of academia today.

856
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:58,931
You can't deny that.

857
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:03,577
Is it too much for me to
ask you to show

858
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:08,290
a little appreciation?

859
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:10,684
Look, I appreciate the wine.

860
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:14,630
And the art.
And the party, thank you.

861
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:17,093
But I do wonder, where is the
line
between normal appreciation

862
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:18,592
and abnormally inappropriate?

863
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,138
Clever.

864
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:24,646
I-I was heading to the bathroom.

865
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,477
That way.

866
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:29,554
Thanks.

867
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:35,818
You dressed up for your "B,"
Jenny.

868
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,653
This is how you get your "a."

869
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,989
[Yells] You thankless ingrate!

870
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:51,625
Jenny! Hey, Jenny!

871
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,843
I'm sorry, Jenny.
I am so sorry.

872
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,587
Dr. Davrow never did
anything like that to me,

873
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:05,497
not all last year.
The dresses...

874
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,516
Yeah.

875
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:08,834
But kissing?

876
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,187
[Jenny sobs]

877
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:14,415
I guess he upped his game.

878
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,358
Monday morning. Conduct...

879
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,361
No! I donâ€™t want to get
into a political war

880
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:21,588
with a professor
my first month at school.

881
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,865
Or ever.

882
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,373
I just want to study
and run track.

883
00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:35,044
Can I please just do that?

884
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:36,195
I'm sorry.

885
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:47,281
13.2.

886
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:50,117
Not a church picnicker
who can do that.

887
00:53:50,135 --> 00:53:52,135
(Chuckles) Thanks, coach.

888
00:53:52,288 --> 00:53:53,896
What do I have to hit
to get on the team?

889
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:56,065
Shave a second off,
and I'll fight for you.

890
00:53:57,884 --> 00:53:58,717
And the scholarship?

891
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,904
Still not my call.

892
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:04,631
Competition for money is...

893
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,730
It's even fiercer than the
fight for the finish line.

894
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:10,746
No... there's nothing like
fighting
for the finish line.

895
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,513
That's what I love about
running.

896
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,753
There's no pedigree.

897
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,330
Doesn't matter what your name
is, what you look like,

898
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:22,091
what you think, do, say.

899
00:54:24,336 --> 00:54:27,221
It's just about your legs,
your breath, and your time.

900
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:30,658
That's all that matters.

901
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,590
Hi.

902
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,443
I prefer this look.

903
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,595
Me too.

904
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,894
You're gonna pay a price for it.

905
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,525
But at least you're not broken.

906
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:57,960
Andrew Jackson,
hero of New Orleans,

907
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,295
ending the English attempt

908
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,130
at taking back the colonies

909
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:02,926
they had lost
nearly half a century earlier.

910
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,051
Dr. Davrow:
Okay, I need a volunteer.

911
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:07,453
Miss Willis.

912
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:09,197
No, thank you.

913
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:11,307
Excuse me?

914
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,768
You asked for volunteers.
I'm not.

915
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:20,223
Participation is not optional
in my class.

916
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,893
When I call on you, you come.

917
00:55:23,045 --> 00:55:24,045
Privilege of authority.

918
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:26,138
You won't break me.

919
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,657
I what?

920
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:33,738
Break you.

921
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:43,797
I hope everyone
is paying attention.

922
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:53,666
I need a volunteer.

923
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,690
Alexis.

924
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:04,343
Come on up.

925
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:16,021
I know what you're doing.

926
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,857
You don't know anything, Jenny.

927
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,210
If you did, you wouldn't be
doing this to yourself.

928
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:23,361
I'm not doing anything to
myself.

929
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,455
You're the one doing this to me.

930
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:28,291
You're just an arrogant,
entitled misogynist,

931
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:29,276
and if you don't start grading
according to my merit,

932
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:29,868
I'm gonna report you T...

933
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:30,887
To whom?

934
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,724
You clearly
haven't thought this out.

935
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:39,043
It doesn't matter who you go to.

936
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:43,457
My department chair.
The faculty conduct committee.

937
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:46,068
With any of them, it's the word
of a prestigious professor

938
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:49,129
against a freshman girl
who offered him sex

939
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:50,331
in exchange for better grades.

940
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,395
I have tenure, Jenny.
Do you know what that is?

941
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,473
They can't fire me.
They can't censure me.

942
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:00,807
They can't dock my pay.

943
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:02,751
But for you, win or lose,

944
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,143
how do you think that will go
for your track scholarship?

945
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:14,154
Or we can just put all of this
ridiculousness behind us

946
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:15,436
and give each other
what we want.

947
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,067
Jenny: You said he didn't
Mark
down girls who don't play along.

948
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,609
I didn't think he did.

949
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:29,945
But I it's not like we all talk
to each other about it.

950
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,949
I didn't know anybody
who didn't play along.

951
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:36,452
Until you.

952
00:57:36,528 --> 00:57:38,603
He's right about
reporting him though.

953
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,456
Even if they believe you,

954
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:42,015
there's nothing
they can do to him,

955
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:45,018
and you'll suffer anyway.

956
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,437
Will you come with me
to report him?

957
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:49,131
Beth, please.

958
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,373
I'm guilty, Jenny.

959
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:52,209
He forced you.

960
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,528
Not like that.

961
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,971
He suggested, and I complied.

962
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,310
I'm sorry.

963
00:58:01,386 --> 00:58:04,980
They wouldn't believe two
students
more than one, anyway.

964
00:58:05,057 --> 00:58:06,943
Universities don't want to hear
about this kind of stuff.

965
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:07,967
Not from us.

966
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:10,819
But maybe from faculty?

967
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,503
Close the door, Ms. Willis.
Close the door!

968
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,812
She was so excited
to come to school.

969
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:06,063
She's been sullen since day one.

970
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:11,213
That poor girl in her room.

971
00:59:11,364 --> 00:59:14,457
She said a professor died,
and there was a break in.

972
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,512
Jenny's not having trouble
with any faculty, is she?

973
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:19,537
Oh, no, no, no just the dorms.

974
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,797
Adjusting to her new roommates.

975
00:59:23,452 --> 00:59:26,377
Unless you've
noticed something in class?

976
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,565
No. I mean, I can only
speak for myself, of course,

977
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:31,900
but I've found Jenny
to be a treasure.

978
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,477
Bright, confident.

979
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,990
Qualities she apparently
inherited.

980
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,076
Uh, would you uh...

981
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:44,137
I feel terrible even asking
this,

982
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,731
snowplow mom times a
thousand, but uh...

983
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,251
Would it be okay with you

984
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:52,254
if I checked in every now and
then,
just to see how she's doing?

985
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:55,924
Of course. Anytime.

986
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:57,593
Thank you... Eric.

987
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:04,329
Here's your orange passion.

988
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:14,109
Mom. What are you...
What are you doing here?

989
01:00:14,186 --> 01:00:15,593
These are delicious.

990
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,733
You gotta start making them
for me at home. (Chuckles)

991
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:19,063
They're like 700 calories.

992
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:26,955
Well, worth it
for the ice breaker.

993
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:31,627
I'm sorry that I push you so
hard.

994
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:36,356
Sorry for pushing back harder.

995
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:37,518
- Your dad was...
- Dad was...

996
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:45,031
I uh, met one of your teachers.

997
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,142
Mom, I'm not
in fifth grade anymore.

998
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,626
Right. Professors.

999
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,646
Yeah.

1000
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,313
He's very charming.

1001
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,482
You talked to Dr. Davrow?!

1002
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:54,316
He thinks you're wonderful.

1003
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:56,467
Mom... I swear!

1004
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,211
Stay out of it, please!

1005
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,655
I am just trying to help!

1006
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:04,660
[Door opens]

1007
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:11,667
Sorry. I'll get out of your way.

1008
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:13,894
You're not in my way.

1009
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:15,096
I'm always in your way, Sarah.

1010
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:22,493
What? Since the day I got here

1011
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:23,345
youâ€™ve made it very clear
you want me as far away

1012
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:25,238
as possible.

1013
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,349
Sorry you got stuck
with two fake roommates.

1014
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,850
I shouldn't have said that.

1015
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:31,853
Look, I know.

1016
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:33,005
I know I've been mean.

1017
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:35,473
But if you want to talk...

1018
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:38,716
What's with the change of heart?

1019
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:43,807
Do you want to go to the park?

1020
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,431
Hey.

1021
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:53,600
You two going somewhere?

1022
01:01:53,602 --> 01:01:54,859
Jenny: The park.

1023
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,545
You want to come?

1024
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:59,105
Sarah:
You know what? Actually, I
feel like

1025
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,440
maybe I should stay back and
study.

1026
01:02:00,442 --> 01:02:01,482
Jenny: No, no, no, no.

1027
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,890
You took the step. You're
coming.

1028
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:10,617
Beth: He's cute.

1029
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:12,786
Why don't you go ride with him?

1030
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:14,637
If I wasn't as blond as I look,

1031
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,898
I'd say you were trying
to get rid of me.

1032
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,049
That didn't even make sense.

1033
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,384
Sarah, please.

1034
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,044
If you've had a change of heart
toward me,

1035
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,207
maybe you can have one
toward Beth, too?

1036
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:28,301
And you, the same.

1037
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,040
Please, I really need
both of you right now.

1038
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,510
[Loud noise]

1039
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:54,902
Beth
code blue. What's going on?

1040
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:57,105
Jenny
oh, my god. What was that?

1041
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:58,826
Ride announcer (on speaker)
We're experiencing
some type of technical
difficulty.

1042
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,833
Jenny seriously?

1043
01:02:59,835 --> 01:03:01,610
Sarah: Are we gonna die?

1044
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:01,759
Ride announcer (on speaker) We
apologize
for the inconvenience.

1045
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,761
I heard you guys.

1046
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:04,780
About not wanting to get
into a political battle

1047
01:03:04,856 --> 01:03:05,856
with the professor.

1048
01:03:08,026 --> 01:03:09,934
Dr. Davrow.

1049
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:10,953
You too?

1050
01:03:12,848 --> 01:03:15,624
Yeah. You fought him off?

1051
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:19,186
Good for you.

1052
01:03:20,856 --> 01:03:23,781
'Cause I didn't.

1053
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,133
And it was more than just
kissing.

1054
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:26,635
Oh my gosh, Sarah...

1055
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:28,804
You slept with him?

1056
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:29,954
And you've been judging
me all this time?

1057
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,139
Beth!

1058
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,975
No! How dare you, Sarah!

1059
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:35,863
How dare you point the finger
at me like I'm some...

1060
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:40,206
You don't understand!
It was awful!

1061
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:45,487
It was horrible!
I felt so... So dirty.

1062
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:48,990
And so I stopped

1063
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:50,826
and then when I did,

1064
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:53,161
he didnâ€™t just drop me
back down to the grades

1065
01:03:53,238 --> 01:03:56,147
I was getting before,
he-he failed me.

1066
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,499
Like... like Fâ€™s.

1067
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:02,337
And he had other professors
do it, too.

1068
01:04:02,414 --> 01:04:03,799
He had other professors
do it to me.

1069
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:05,674
And Elaine.

1070
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:07,992
Wait, what?

1071
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,847
She was brave... Like you.

1072
01:04:11,923 --> 01:04:13,682
She was going to report him.

1073
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:16,852
And then she just falls
from the dormitory roof.

1074
01:04:16,928 --> 01:04:19,354
Oh my gosh!

1075
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:20,785
You think Dr. Davrow killed her?

1076
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:26,419
And I just... And I just shut up.

1077
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:28,029
Jenny, I am so sorry.

1078
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,255
I should have
said something to you sooner.

1079
01:04:29,257 --> 01:04:32,200
I just... I have been so... Scared.

1080
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:34,685
Dr. Davrow
couldn't have killed Elaine.

1081
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,039
A faculty member
couldn't make it all the way

1082
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:40,542
to the rooftop of a dorm without
getting recognized.

1083
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,785
And during a party!

1084
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:43,712
Okay, then someone's helping
him.

1085
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:44,379
Or there's...

1086
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:46,882
Or nothing.

1087
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,384
Dr. Davrow shouldn't be
forcing girls to dress up

1088
01:04:49,461 --> 01:04:53,889
or anything else
for grades, I'll give you that.

1089
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,593
But that doesn't mean he has
anything to do with Elaine.

1090
01:04:55,617 --> 01:04:57,617
There's no way.

1091
01:04:57,619 --> 01:04:59,119
Hey, look, it doesn't matter.

1092
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:01,045
Whether he killed Elaine or not,

1093
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,713
what he's doing alone is enough
that we have to report him.

1094
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,548
Now you want to go to war?

1095
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,551
I don't care about
my scholarship anymore.

1096
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,790
I don't care if they kick me out
of school for making a scene.

1097
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:11,094
I mean, he can't
keep doing this.

1098
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:16,244
And if he did kill Elaine,
all the more reason.

1099
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:22,642
He killed Elaine.
Or somebody did it for him.

1100
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:23,971
But I... I can't say anything,
Jenny.

good grades again.

I...

1103
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,151
It's too dangerous.

1104
01:05:31,153 --> 01:05:33,428
He'll kill me. He'll kill you,
too.

1105
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:39,434
So he just gets away with it?
With all of it?

1106
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:40,745
Maybe he'll forgot about you.

1107
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,066
That's the best
you can hope for.

1108
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,000
And Elaine?

1109
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:48,610

Forget about her?

01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:12,505
I'm gonna go home.

1250
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:13,931
I mean, I'm gonna
move home, I think.

1251
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,116
Leave school?

1252
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:17,952
No. Just drive in.

1253
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:20,788
Yeah, maybe dorm life's
not for me after all.

1254
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,083
My mom's coming to pick me up.

1255
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:23,107
[Elevator bell rings]

1256
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:42,051
Hey.

1257
01:14:42,203 --> 01:14:43,794
Oh my god.
Are you all right?

1258
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,980
Yeah. I'm just exhausted.

1259
01:14:49,969 --> 01:14:51,134
I'm gonna shower
then my mom's
coming to get me.

1260
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,378
What?

1261
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,322
You should come with me.

1262
01:14:54,473 --> 01:14:56,232
At least for a few nights.

1263
01:14:56,384 --> 01:14:57,384
It's not safe here.

1264
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:00,995
Yeah. Okay.

1265
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:03,405
Uh, you take a shower,
and relax,

1266
01:15:03,558 --> 01:15:04,165
and I'll pack some stuff.

1267
01:15:04,242 --> 01:15:05,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

1268
01:15:20,742 --> 01:15:21,741
Is that all they took?

1269
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:23,684
Yeah. That's all.

1270
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:25,201
I just need you
to sign this, please.

1271
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:28,356
Okay. Can I go now?

1272
01:15:28,432 --> 01:15:29,023
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
Thanks.

1274
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:32,176
Hey, you got the store?

1275
01:15:32,253 --> 01:15:33,010
Hey. How are you doing?

1276
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,195
I'm fine.

1277
01:15:34,346 --> 01:15:35,604
You should dress that leg.

1278
01:15:35,757 --> 01:15:36,757
It's fine. I gotta go.

1279
01:15:57,278 --> 01:15:58,678
[Water running]

1280
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,310
[Phone rings]

1281
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:15,403
Jenny, I'm so sorry. I'm just
leaving the store right now.

1282
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:17,721
I'm racing to you.

1283
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,315
Okay, I'll be there soon as I
can.

1284
01:16:19,467 --> 01:16:21,367
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this.

1285
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:40,837
Jenny!

1286
01:16:43,825 --> 01:16:45,545
[Gasps] Ugh! We have got to
stop doing that.

1287
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:50,921
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1288
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,181
I-I'll fix it.

1289
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,108
Uh, it's-it's fine.

1290
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:03,284
Beth said there was someone
in your room again?

1291
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:05,361
I don't know. I wasn't home.

1292
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:06,695
I'm just... I'm just tired..

1293
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:07,848
Of course. Yeah.

1294
01:17:33,224 --> 01:17:35,224
Jenny! Jenny, wait!

1295
01:17:35,376 --> 01:17:36,376
Jenny! Jenny, wait!

1296
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:40,062
Beth! Beth! Let me go!

1297
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:42,156
Listen to me!

1298
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,641
What is going on?

1299
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:45,308
He broke into the room!
I saw his shoulder!

1300
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,328
Wait.

1301
01:17:48,556 --> 01:17:49,830
- Did you kill Elaine?!
- No!

1302
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:51,056
Why'd you break in?
Do you have a key?

1303
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:52,574
Elaine gave me the key.

1304
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:53,501
Why would she give you a key?

1305
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:56,319
I loved her.

1306
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,391
We were dating, all last year.
All summer.

1307
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:59,156
Elaine never dated.

1308
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,083
It's not allowed for R.A.'S
and undergrads

1309
01:18:01,235 --> 01:18:02,235
so we didn't tell anyone.

1310
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:05,905
I loved her.

1311
01:18:05,907 --> 01:18:06,906
I want to find out
who killed her.

1312
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:08,908
Bull!

1313
01:18:08,926 --> 01:18:10,220
Find out how?
What are you looking for in
here?

1314
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:13,670
Elaine sent me a text
the night she died.

1315
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,242
She was sending it
right when she was killed.

1316
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:16,765
Elaine... fell.

1317
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:18,526
In the middle of texting me?

1318
01:18:18,602 --> 01:18:20,177
What proof?

1319
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,271
Pictures.

1320
01:18:22,423 --> 01:18:24,181
I'm not sure of what.

1321
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,919
She took them on her phone
at one of those "dinners"

1322
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:27,760
and printed them to make sure
they couldn't disappear.

1323
01:18:27,762 --> 01:18:30,612
Good thing, too, because

1324
01:18:30,765 --> 01:18:33,449
her phone got smashed
when she died.

1325
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:35,284
But I don't know where
she put them.

1326
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:36,435
Her parents let me go through

1327
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:38,045
everything they took
from here but...

1328
01:18:38,122 --> 01:18:39,547
I-I think they're still in here

1329
01:18:39,698 --> 01:18:40,697
if you haven't found them yet...

1330
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,291
I didn't do this.

1331
01:18:42,443 --> 01:18:43,442
I cut your shoulder.

1332
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:45,461
That time, yes.

1333
01:18:45,613 --> 01:18:46,757
But you almost caught me,
and then the new lock...

1334
01:18:46,781 --> 01:18:48,205
Which you tried to pick.

1335
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:52,634
I couldn't get in!
I didn't do this.

1336
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:54,431
Iâ€™ll prove it to you if we
can find the pictures.

1337
01:18:54,455 --> 01:18:55,455
Just help me, please!

1338
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:58,141
For Elaine.

1339
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,737
Okay, where haven't you looked?

1340
01:19:02,813 --> 01:19:06,465
Almost everywhere.
I'd barely started.

1341
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,107
Okay, we'll help you.
Let's start looking.

1342
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:21,071
(Whispering) He's lying, Jen.

1343
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,831
You even said,
a "guy she dumped."

1344
01:19:22,984 --> 01:19:25,575
He had a key.

1345
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,395
He could have gotten in here
during the party.

1346
01:19:27,488 --> 01:19:28,799
He could have killed Elaine,
and no one would ever...

1347
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:30,223
Okay, it doesn't hurt
to look, Beth.

1348
01:19:46,007 --> 01:19:47,114
Okay, search Sarah's bed.

1349
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:20,373
Hey. I found something.

1350
01:20:52,073 --> 01:20:55,424
Beth? You?
But, if he forced you...

1351
01:20:55,576 --> 01:20:56,576
He didn't force me.

1352
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:00,762
I love Dr. Davrow.

1353
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:03,840
He's brilliant and beautiful.

1354
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,268
A genius.

1355
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,437
But you you told me
to dress up for him.

1356
01:21:08,589 --> 01:21:09,922
You told me about
the study with the art...

1357
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:12,182
You delivered me to him.

1358
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:16,370
I was trying to help you!
Get your grades up.

1359
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:17,687
Get you your track scholarship!

1360
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:23,836
But he was right,
you're so... Ungrateful.

1361
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:26,882
And so was Elaine.

1362
01:21:31,612 --> 01:21:34,947
She was going to expose
the whole thing.

1363
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,466
And not only ruin
Dr. Davrow's good name,

1364
01:21:37,618 --> 01:21:39,635
she was going to ruin mine!

1365
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:41,378
I would have been kicked
out of school,

1366
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,123
no college degree,
no future at all.

1367
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,307
And so you murdered her?

1368
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:48,143
I wanted to keep her quiet.

1369
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:49,811
I wanted the pictures,

1370
01:21:49,964 --> 01:21:51,721
but she fought me, and she fell.

1371
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:52,889
She fell!

1372
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,149
Sarah didn't fall!

1373
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:56,969
Sarah stayed quiet.

1374
01:21:56,987 --> 01:21:58,728
The whole thing had quieted down

1375
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,582
until you came around
and stirred it back up again.

1376
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:03,417
And you...

1377
01:22:03,494 --> 01:22:05,661
Breaking in here.

1378
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:07,829
I suppose I should thank you.

1379
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:09,102
I've been looking for those.

1380
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:19,341
Phone too.

1381
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:21,843
Time to delete that text.

1382
01:22:21,996 --> 01:22:24,513
Why didn't she just
text you the pictures?

1383
01:22:24,665 --> 01:22:26,273
I'd ask her,
if you hadn't killed her!

1384
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,445
[Gunshot]

1385
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:46,795
Kyle: Come on!

1386
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:56,804
Wait, wait.

1387
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,175
I'm not going to make it
down 12 flights.

1388
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,289
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not fast enough.

1389
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,641
Come on.

1390
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:01,624
Beth: Hey!

1391
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,644
Come on.

1392
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:10,734
[Growling]
You can't run! You can't hide!

1393
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,998
Call Jenny!

1394
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:25,332
Mom?

1395
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:26,834
I'm on my way.

1396
01:23:26,985 --> 01:23:27,743
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Are you okay?

1397
01:23:27,895 --> 01:23:28,910
Where are you?

1398
01:23:29,063 --> 01:23:30,245
I'm coming to the dorms.

1399
01:23:30,397 --> 01:23:31,747
No, no, no! Not there!

1400
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:33,915
Jenny, I can't hear you.

1401
01:23:34,068 --> 01:23:35,068
Mom?

1402
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:39,346
Call Jenny! Call Jenny!

1403
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,593
Where's the police station?

1404
01:23:44,745 --> 01:23:45,761
This way. This way.

1405
01:23:45,913 --> 01:23:46,913
Okay.

1406
01:24:15,793 --> 01:24:18,010
[Tires screech and squeal]

1407
01:24:19,797 --> 01:24:20,797
Kyle: Jenny!

1408
01:24:22,449 --> 01:24:24,224
Yeah. It's crazy
how this all went down, huh?

1409
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:32,457
Kyle finds out
that the love of his life

1410
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:33,959
is sleeping with Dr. Davrow..

1411
01:24:33,961 --> 01:24:34,810
To get her grades up,

1412
01:24:34,962 --> 01:24:36,737
and in a jealous rage,

1413
01:24:36,814 --> 01:24:39,147
throws her off the rooftop.

1414
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,982
What are you talking about?

1415
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:42,409
Beth: I'm talking about

1416
01:24:42,486 --> 01:24:44,411
how Jenny saw the scratch
she gave to the guy

1417
01:24:44,488 --> 01:24:46,154
who broke into our room
on your arm,

1418
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:48,156
and you killed her.

1419
01:24:48,309 --> 01:24:49,452
It's just lucky that I
got here in time

1420
01:24:49,476 --> 01:24:50,751
to shoot you with your own gun

1421
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:51,955
before you got away with murder.

1422
01:24:51,979 --> 01:24:53,236
No.

1423
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,588
Again.

1424
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:55,809
Beth, please, you don't

[Gunshot]

1426
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:01,503
Are you crazy?

1427
01:25:01,655 --> 01:25:04,431
No, Jenny. I'm pissed.

1428
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,159
Pissed that you just
wouldn't let it go!

1429
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:08,769
You know, I liked you.

1430
01:25:08,846 --> 01:25:10,679
You were a way better
roommate than Sarah...

1431
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:13,849
But at least she shut up!

1432
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:15,161
Now look what you made Kyle do.

Kristen: Jenny!

1436
01:25:30,684 --> 01:25:31,608
Are you okay?

1437
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,201
I'm okay.

1438
01:25:33,354 --> 01:25:34,110
You're okay.

1439
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,295
Kyle!

1440
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:40,542
Kyle. Kyle. Okay.

1441
01:25:40,694 --> 01:25:42,136
Hey. It's okay.

1442
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:47,699
Yes. We need help.

1443
01:25:47,718 --> 01:25:49,125
A student's been shot
outside the dorms.

1444
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:50,644
At um.. Channing
and... and Telegraph!

1445
01:25:52,373 --> 01:25:54,373
Hey. Hang on.

Is everyone okay?

No, we need help.
We need a doctor.

1449
01:26:01,548 --> 01:26:04,399
Man's voice: I'm a doctor.

1450
01:26:04,551 --> 01:26:08,478
Psychology. Does that help?

1451
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,572
How'd he know where we...?

1452
01:26:10,724 --> 01:26:12,684
Beth told you that
Sarah and I were on the bridge.

1453
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:14,575
He killed professor Harrington.

1454
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:18,580
That old man
thought he was better than me.

1455
01:26:18,732 --> 01:26:21,008
Wanted to report me!

1456
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:22,492
If he was thirty years younger,

1457
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,751
he would have been thanking me.

1458
01:26:27,074 --> 01:26:29,424
You really did raise a fine...

1459
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:30,656

You know what "R.A." Stands for?
"Really awesome."

1466
01:27:32,656 --> 01:27:34,748
Good enough to get
my scholarship back?

1467
01:27:34,825 --> 01:27:36,825
It is still not my decision.

1468
01:27:36,977 --> 01:27:38,137
It's the athletic director's.

1473
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,857
Sarah, can I just say
how happy I am

1474
01:28:09,009 --> 01:28:10,191
