2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,125
Makes you think.

3
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:20,546
Makes you think about
the people in your life.

4
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:24,050
I think of Neil and if he were sittin'
here right now, what he'd say to me.

5
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,052
He'd say, "John, what's it about?

6
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,348
What's life about...

7
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,686
if you don't go through
it as a man's man."

8
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:38,147
He'd say, "Suck it up.
Take the fall. Do the time.

9
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,900
That's what made you who you
are. That makes you what you are."

10
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,114
How long we been around this
thing of ours, this Cosa Nostra?

11
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,492
120 years. And what's it about?

12
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:51,661
It's about the rules, parameters.

13
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,664
You take the beatin' for the friend.
You don't run, you don't lay down.

14
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,959
You don't betray who
you are, what you are.

15
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,086
- Self-esteem, John. -
Self-esteem. It's basic.

16
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,672
You pick it up on the street.
You gotta remember Angie here.

17
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,132
I loved this guy. I loved him.

18
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:07,134
He was stupid. He never listened to me.

19
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:09,470
He always wanted the goddamn dope money.

20
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,931
He never rolled. You know that?

21
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:15,893
He never rolled.

22
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,895
My brother Gene, Joey
D'Mig, they don't roll.

23
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,189
They're doin' a thousand years.
They don't roll. They don't rat.

24
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:23,109
Why? That's the rule. You
don't break. You don't rat.

25
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:26,654
Basic rules. Gives you
a little power, right?

26
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,366
Not the kind a power these Feds have.

27
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,910
God forbid we pull their
chain in public, right?

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,872
Fuckin' dress better than them, they
take it personal, like it's a vendetta.

29
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:39,542
They're supposed to act
better than the rest of us.

30
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,257
They just want me to be somethin'
I wasn't even born to be.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,593
Humble. They want you to be humble.

32
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,679
So you humble me. What you got now?

33
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:53,639
You got a war?

34
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:57,643
You got a global war?

35
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:01,731
You got the Chinks, Dominicans,
Asians, Russians, Columbians, Jamaicans.

36
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:04,859
What are they doin'?
They desecrate the nation.

37
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,612
You got your veritable fuckin'
snowstorms of cocaine and smack...

38
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,614
whatever the hell else
they shove in their veins.

39
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,533
You got a worldwide crime
syndicate now. There's no rules.

40
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,245
There's no parameters.
There's no feelings.

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,706
There's no feelings for this country.

42
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,250
- Anarchy.
- You got anarchy.

43
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,881
So?

44
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,883
Five, ten years from now...

45
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,054
there gonna wish there
was American Cosa Nostra.

46
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:37,224
Five or ten years from now...

47
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,854
they're gonna miss John Gotti.

48
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,187
Ang, remember the time we were in Vegas,
we seen that funny guy, Joey Villa?

49
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,438
At the Riviera.

50
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:31,691
Who was the guy who walked
in the bar that night, Jo-Jo?

51
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,361
That short guy. This is
a funny story. Listen.

52
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:39,240
Jo-Jo comes into the bar wearin'
a solid gold buckle this big.

53
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:40,616
It says Jo-Jo on it.

54
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,119
He's got a bracelet on
his arm says Jo-Jo on it.

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,830
Got a fuckin' necklace says Jo-Jo on
it. He's got solid gold cuff links.

56
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,457
They all say Jo-Jo on 'em.

57
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,459
Little Chink bellhop
walks in, he says...

58
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,128
"Excuse me, Mr. Jo-Jo."

59
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,338
He says, "Shut the fuck up. I
don't want nobody to know I'm here."

60
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,300
True story. I was there.

61
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,637
All right.

62
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,973
Do what you want with yours.
I'm gettin' down on the Knicks.

63
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:08,227
John, who owns a bigger piece of
you, your bookie or your tailor?

64
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,229
I'm split right down the middle, baby.

65
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:13,566
Put out the fuckin' cigarette before
you give us all cancer, please.

66
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,528
What cancer? The government has
not proved cigarettes cause cancer.

67
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,572
What fuckin' government
is he talkin' about now?

68
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,866
You know the tobacco
people own the Feds.

69
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:24,535
- Fuck them.
- Put out the fuckin' cigarette.

70
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,871
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

71
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,623
What a fuckin' ball breaker here.

72
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,168
Gene, you goin' to Mom's later?

73
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,128
It's Friday night. Me
and Pete are both goin'.

74
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,464
Give it up. Put your share on top of it.

75
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,008
Kick somethin' into that
like you're supposed to.

76
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,260
No, right now. D'Mig, kick in.

77
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,971
You been robbin' cannolis from
us for 20 fuckin' years now.

78
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:48,601
John, your old man told me
your mother's got a Zulu maid.

79
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,394
Fuckin' guy.

80
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,396
He never wanted me to marry Vicki.

81
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:54,774
Best thing that ever
happened to me in my life.

82
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,734
- Never wanted me to marry her.
- Why not?

83
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,445
Vicki's stepfather's Italian,
but her real father was a Jew.

84
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,530
- So?
- The Jews whacked out Jesus.

85
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:05,243
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Maybe he had it comin'.

86
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:07,411
Under the table. Watch out
for that bolt of lightning.

87
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,664
Cover your head, Angie.

88
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,085
That's funny.

89
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,545
John, it's Neil.

90
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,673
- Hey, Neil.
- Mr. Neil.

91
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,593
How are ya? All right?

92
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,976
- What is it?
- Don Carlo wants to see you.

93
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,479
He wants to see me?

94
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,609
- Right now?
- Right now.

95
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,156
Angie goes with?

96
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,663
Bring him along.

97
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,298
Who would a thought the King of
the Volcano lived in this place?

98
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:03,384
It's the old-timer's style.
He don't flash nothin'.

99
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,556
- Hey, you stink.
- Angie can't come?

100
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:11,642
Don Carlo sent for you, not Angie.

101
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:14,854
Let him talk. Don't interrupt.

102
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:19,233
He's old, but he's still sharp.
And don't dare underestimate him.

103
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,073
- Hey, Neil, how you doin'?
- Hello. Sammy Gravano.

104
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:29,076
- You know John Gotti?
- Just by reputation.

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,829
- Same here. How you doin'?
- You're smilin'.

106
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:33,331
- You must've heard good things.
- Nothin' but.

107
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,583
- Come by my club. We'll go bouncin.
- Sounds good.

108
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,501
They're expectin' you fellas.

109
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,170
Thanks, Sammy.

110
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,262
Don Carlo, this is John Gotti.

111
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,641
How are ya?

112
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,267
Paul Castellano.

113
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:56,270
How you doin', Paul?

114
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:58,147
- Joe Armone.
- How are you?

115
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,149
Well, sit down.

116
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:04,528
I heard good things.

117
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,573
You built Carmine's
Brownsville book up...

118
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:08,991
a hundred thousand a month.

119
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,578
A hundred thousand.

120
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:14,580
Never took a dime from the top.

121
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,003
You're a young man not
tempted by foolish money.

122
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,804
You seem to respect my, uh...

123
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,389
my policy on drugs.

124
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,604
You know, the Feds...

125
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:42,567
they tolerate certain things.

126
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:45,111
Certain things.

127
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,821
Not drugs.

128
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:53,244
You make your crew understand.
They deal in drugs, that's all.

129
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,870
They die!

130
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:57,081
I've done that.

131
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:04,088
I tell you this 'cause
I see a future for you.

132
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,009
But fiirst there's something else.

133
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:13,055
My-- My
nephew.

134
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,685
He's a saint.

135
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,979
Not of our life, no.

136
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,403
Westies. Scum!

137
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,155
Irish scum.

138
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:33,284
They blew his face away and
they put him back in the car.

139
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:42,251
The man responsible has been
found. Lives in Staten Island.

140
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,179
I want you to do this for me.

141
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,722
It's done.

142
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,769
From this moment, you're under my flag.

143
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,361
I want you to take one
of my men with you--

144
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,196
Ralph Galione.

145
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,532
I'll fiill Neil in with the details.

146
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,204
It went well.

147
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,374
This hit is a walk in the sun.

148
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:24,001
The old man...

149
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:25,628
will never forget it.

150
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,255
Yeah.

151
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,841
Who's this Galione?

152
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,969
He's in Castellano's crew.

153
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:37,765
Between him and Sammy Gravano,
they whacked a dozen bums.

154
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:44,564
Why didn't they give me Sammy? I
know nothin' about this Galione.

155
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:49,527
You're the underboss here. Castellano
should defer to you a little.

156
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,197
If he wants one of his
guys along, I got no beef.

157
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:58,035
- Just tell him to give me Sammy.
- Paul wants Galione on this.

158
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,455
Leave it at that.

159
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,125
Is that what you want?

160
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,627
It doesn't matter what the fuck I want.

161
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,754
That's the way it is.

162
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,340
Just let it go.

163
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,467
Just go with it. Go with the tide.

164
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:16,304
All right. Forget I said it.

165
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,808
Galione. Hop in.

166
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,075
Galione, you always snort on a hit?

167
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:41,746
- Sharpens my concentration.
- Good. Start concentratin'.

168
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,873
We're goin' out to a
joint in Staten Island.

169
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:46,459
No one's gonna pay attention
to us now if we're cool.

170
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,961
McBratney's there every night.
He sits at the end of the bar.

171
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,547
I'm gonna mention some
names from the West Side.

172
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:54,133
He's gonna fiigure I'm gonna try to
sell him some stuff. Stay near the door.

173
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:58,471
We're gonna take him out to the car,
whack him in the parking lot. Capisce?

174
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,484
Where you goin'? He sees a third
guy, he's gonna smell a rat.

175
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,945
- I said the door.
- All right. Take it easy.

176
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,079
- What'll it be?
- You got any Boudels?

177
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,790
- Yeah, we got it.
- What are you drinkin', Ang?

178
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,793
- Dewars.
- Dewars and the Boudels.

179
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,629
Who's that, Jimmy? McBratney, right?

180
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,965
- Who wants to know?
- We know people. Mickey from 46th.

181
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,717
- Dumb-Dumb. - You
know Mickey Dumb-Dumb?

182
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,220
- How you doin'?
- We were talkin' about you last night.

183
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:41,347
My buddy Angie. Meet McBratney.

184
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,556
How you doin'?

185
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:45,393
- Where do you know Mickey from?
- We all worked Kennedy together.

186
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:58,698
- That's a good racket.
- We're movin' some stuff. Look.

187
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,366
Nice, huh?

188
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,869
You got more?

189
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,497
- Fourteen carat.
- It's nice, isn't it?

190
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:22,805
I got a gross sittin' in the trunk of
my car. Your name's written all over it.

191
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:25,391
- Let's go take a look.
- Excuse me!

192
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:30,104
Ferrone, 17th Squad.
You wanna step outside?

193
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,940
Where the hell did you get that,
some kind of a Cracker Jack box?

194
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,317
You fuckin' Guinea hump!

195
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,111
Take that fuckin' thing and
shove it up your ass along with--

196
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,707
Can't kill him, John.
You can't kill him.

197
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:51,959
He's Paul Castellano's soldier.

198
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:54,629
We need an okay, or else you're
steppin' way outta line here!

199
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:57,048
He fucked up the personal
favor I'm doin' for Don Carlo.

200
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,759
He's fuckin' goin'.

201
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,638
I know you're thinkin'
Castellano said use Galione.

202
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,473
He should've given us Sammy Gravano.

203
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,476
You're thinkin' that Mick bartender's
gonna make us from fuckin' mug shots.

204
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,604
I'm not thinkin'. You're
thinkin'. I'm eatin'.

205
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,274
Now, he's goin'.

206
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:18,212
The bottom line is John Gotti...

207
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:21,257
clipped a soldier in my decina...

208
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,259
without my okay.

209
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,595
That's a flagrant violation.

210
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,763
John Gotti should fuckin' die.

211
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,976
No need to curse, Paul. No need.

212
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,648
You know me, Don Carlo.

213
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:41,861
I'm a street guy. If I
can't curse, I can't talk.

214
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,239
You sent a fuckin' moron on this hit...

215
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:49,118
who endangered the life of a
young man  I think of as a son!

216
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,956
Galione deserved to be clipped!

217
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:58,169
John Gotti was doing a piece of
work that could buy him 25 years.

218
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,922
That's fuckin' immaterial!

219
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,633
The bottom
line is that--

220
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:06,969
Bottom line. That's weasel words!

221
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,722
My God, a businessman talks like that.

222
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:11,474
What the hell kind of word is that?

223
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:15,728
Paul, you don't know the streets.

224
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,980
I mean, you never have.

225
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:23,194
John Gotti clipped your scumbag soldier
because your soldier deserved it.

226
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,030
John Gotti is Cosa Nostra.

227
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,749
The rule was broken. Yes,
it calls for Gotti to die.

228
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:41,003
Was there reason for breakin'
the rule so powerful...

229
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,714
that it was justifiied?

230
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:45,716
We need all the John Gotti's we can get.

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,262
But we survive by our rules.

232
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:53,307
If it was my call, he would go.

233
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,408
Some combination, huh?

234
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,994
Your Frankie catchin'
and my son passin'?

235
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,746
Your kid's got a great
arm. Come here, you!

236
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,336
You gotta cradle the ball
more. Let me show you somethin'.

237
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,756
When he snaps it at you,
I want you to suck it in.

238
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,217
Suck it in. That's it. Do it again.

239
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:31,429
He's gonna snap it at
you-- a lateral pass.

240
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,764
- You gotta suck it in.
- Ready to go home yet?

241
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,975
No, I got my bike. I'm gonna ride home.

242
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,644
- You were great.
- Thanks.

243
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:41,230
- You're doin' great, man.
- Thanks.

244
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:43,983
- You're my champ, you know that?
- Yeah.

245
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,902
Hey! Take that.

246
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:54,493
How's the couch business? You
still sellin' Castro convertibles?

247
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,912
It's a living. Can't complain.

248
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,874
We gotta run. You got a great arm, kid.

249
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,125
Thanks.

250
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,127
See ya next week.

251
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,451
I've been negotiating all night.

252
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,621
Just take a walk, all right?

253
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,506
- Negotiatin' what?
- Your fuckin' life!

254
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,633
- For takin' out a fuckin' coke head?
- Be quiet!

255
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,220
Sit down.

256
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:59,183
I said, sit down!

257
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,148
You know, I've clipped
a lot of guys in my life.

258
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,192
Close friends.

259
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,987
Guys I didn't know.

260
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,115
I didn't always agree that
the guy should be clipped.

261
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,159
But I never questioned the orders...

262
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:19,161
and I never went off half-cocked...

263
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:21,163
and clipped somebody
I wasn't supposed to!

264
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,873
Now, you shut up!

265
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,209
You just listen.

266
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,799
Big Paul went down to Don Carlo
for permission to have you whacked.

267
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:35,845
It came this close.

268
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:39,974
I told Don Carlo you
were like a son to me.

269
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:46,772
That touched the old man. He
told Paul to give you a pass.

270
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:51,611
But if Don Carlo had said...

271
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:54,030
you gotta go...

272
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,073
I would've come here today...

273
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:59,952
with these two zips...

274
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,913
and you would go.

275
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:09,045
You cannot whack a made
man on somebody else's crew!

276
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,465
There are rules!

277
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:15,885
You break the rules, this
whole goddamn thing of ours...

278
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:17,261
cracks and crumbles!

279
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,766
You never break the rules.

280
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,861
Let's drink to that.

281
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,866
Wipe your face.

282
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,703
You're sweating up a
hundred dollar shirt.

283
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:46,040
Don Carlo says you'll do some time.

284
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,834
But he's gonna take care of your family.

285
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,503
Here.

286
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:56,801
La familia, and the rules
that hold us together.

287
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,018
And the rules that hold us together.

288
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:08,915
Good-bye, Frankie.

289
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:46,118
- You look good, John.
- Hey, thanks, man.

290
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,455
How do you swing a three-year sentence
with a guy dead on a saloon floor?

291
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:52,583
You just make sure it's an
Irish scumbag who deserved it.

292
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,169
This way, at least you know
you performed a public service.

293
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,890
Don Carlo made it offiicial.
You come out of here...

294
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:11,060
you come out a captain.

295
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:14,355
God bless you, Neil. God bless you.

296
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:18,234
How's my Frankie?

297
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:20,653
He's good. Vicki and
the kids are all fiine.

298
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:24,574
Your mother, forget about her.

299
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,794
She told me the place out
in Sheepshead is a palace.

300
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:40,006
She called it that?

301
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,928
She told me, "My son got me a palace."

302
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:51,601
It's not just Vicki and the kids.

303
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:53,769
The whole neighborhood will
be glad to have you back.

304
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:58,691
People ask about you all the time.

305
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,363
Got a bit of bad news.

306
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:07,408
Don Carlo
had a--

307
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:09,327
had a heart attack.

308
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:15,541
Well, I guess when he goes,
you're gonna have your day.

309
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,044
- We'll see.
- What's that mean?

310
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:21,547
You're next in line. What's that mean?

311
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:23,966
Listen.

312
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,053
I heard a little news
on the street that--

313
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:31,766
I heard that your brother
Gene and Angie's brother Sal...

314
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,309
are pushing dope.

315
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,479
- They're pushin' dope?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:39,190
Sally's not a made guy. He's a civilian.

317
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,192
He does whatever the fuck he wants.

318
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,987
And my brother Gene's no genius,
but the guy's not pushin' dope.

319
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:49,784
Ask Angie. I understand
he's getting a percentage.

320
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:52,578
Where the fuck did you get this?

321
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,331
One of Big Paul's soldiers told me.

322
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,002
Well, Jesus Christ. Consider the source.

323
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,463
I'm only sittin' here
three fuckin' years...

324
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:05,508
because of that incompetent
Sicilian candy-ass.

325
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,510
I'm supposed to believe my
own brother's pushin' dope?

326
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:09,512
Believe what you want.

327
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:13,808
But ask Angie.

328
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:17,395
I want this fuckin' rumor proved...

329
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:19,021
or disproved.

330
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:24,026
An FBl spokesman said today
that a promising lead...

331
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:27,530
on the where abouts of Patty
Hearst resulted in a deadend.

332
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:31,158
They oungheiress is wanted in a series
of politically motivated bankrobberies.

333
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,160
You know this bitch is
richer than Rockefeller?

334
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,664
With all her money, what's she doin'
tryin' to overthrow the government?

335
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:40,126
They're gonna lock up this twat for
100 fuckin' years when they catch her.

336
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,169
Come on, Johnny.

337
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:46,924
- You got anything you wanna tell me?
- Like what?

338
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:49,260
Like secret shit.

339
00:26:49,302 --> 00:26:52,513
- Like what kinda secret shit?
- Like secret shit.

340
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:55,516
Like how many times a night I whack off?

341
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,519
I said, like secret shit.

342
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:01,272
You and me, we change each
other's diapers, for Christ's sake.

343
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,857
What fuckin' secrets I keep from you?

344
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,657
Where'd you get the prosciutto?

345
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:13,326
I know people.

346
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,579
We got a problem with the Zulu chief.

347
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,540
He's threatin' to put a hit
on this kid Joey Perillo...

348
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:21,584
for stealin' six ounces
of nose candy from him.

349
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,545
- Yeah? Who is he?
- He's the kid at the end.

350
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,716
The skinny kid.

351
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,594
Who's the kid with?

352
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,346
Nobody. He's a street thief.

353
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,306
Then fuck him. He's got
nothin' to do with us.

354
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:39,101
But the kid says he knows Sammy Gravano.
He says him and Sammy go way back...

355
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:41,437
and there's no time to
check this out with Sammy.

356
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,442
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah, for sure he knows Sammy.

357
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:54,116
Better I stand up for Sammy in here than
fiind out I should've when I get out.

358
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,009
Hey, what's this motherfucker want?

359
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,431
How ya doin', chief?

360
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:31,696
How about you and me, we
go for a walk and talk, huh?

361
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,244
What do you say?

362
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:42,999
I say a dago ain't a
pimple on a nigger's ass.

363
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:44,542
I sure as hell hope not.

364
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:53,217
What do you want me to do?
I'm alone here, see? I'm clean.

365
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:55,636
Step into my offiice
here. This is business.

366
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,680
Business, huh?

367
00:28:57,763 --> 00:29:01,225
You know you're one crazy
motherfuckin' wop, right?

368
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,355
Let's walk.

369
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:12,737
- I hear you're missin' 6 ounces of coke.
- You heard right.

370
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,948
And that Guinea Perillo, he's
gonna get a shiv stuck in his ass.

371
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:19,827
You know, I say hard
time is for hard-ons.

372
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,330
What are we tryin' to do here?
We're tryin' to do some easy time.

373
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:24,832
You start that shit, it's a
lockdown. Then what you got?

374
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,627
No booze, no broads,
no phones, no visitors.

375
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:30,004
You ain't even gonna get TV rights.

376
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,214
Come on. You and me, we cool that, huh?

377
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:34,091
Yeah, well, I'm listening.

378
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,720
That 6 ounces ofcoke you
lost, I'm gonna replace it.

379
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:40,473
You're gonna get 18 grand
cash and a van full of Lucky's.

380
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:43,768
Your whole side ofthe yard here
can all be stokin' and smokin'...

381
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,520
your fuckin' brains out for a
month as far as I'm concerned.

382
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:49,148
From here on out, anyone
here in my court...

383
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:52,610
fucks with your action,
you just come to me.

384
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:55,905
- And who the fuck are you?
- John Gotti.

385
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:03,204
- So when do I get my drop?
- With your mornin' paper.

386
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,043
Count up in two wing.

387
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:26,143
Come on! Let's have
a little respect here!

388
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:27,687
Respect age, will ya?

389
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:32,024
Look at you!

390
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:45,663
College looks good on you.

391
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,671
Wait here. Thankyou, Willy.

392
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,478
- You okay?
- I got Neil here.

393
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,860
We're back!

394
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,785
What is it?

395
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,665
Don Carlo's dead.

396
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,126
Heart attack an hour ago.

397
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,714
Let him rest.

398
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:41,761
He made Big Paul the
new boss on his deathbed.

399
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:43,721
What?

400
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:48,267
No fuckin' way Carlo passed you up.

401
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,603
For what? That piece of shit?

402
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:54,315
He don't understand the street. He
wants to be some butter-ass businessman.

403
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,025
That's not Cosa Nostra.

404
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:59,528
Maybe a street guy
is not what is needed.

405
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,864
Maybe times are changin'.

406
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,658
Bullshit! Come on!

407
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:06,786
The soldiers don't even
want him. Ask anyone here.

408
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:09,163
They starve under the
guy. The fuckin' guy...

409
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:11,958
he squeezes a fuckin' quarter
till the eagle screams.

410
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,835
Don Carlo was the boss.

411
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:17,338
He picked his
brother-in-law.

412
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:20,800
Now, Paul is the boss. That is it.

413
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:23,594
Neil, you devoted your
life to this thing.

414
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:26,639
You never back-doored nobody,
never took a dime wasn't yours!

415
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:30,601
You want me to blow the fuckin' borgata
right now? Here, I'll do it right now!

416
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:52,456
The king is dead. Long
live his brother-in-law.

417
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,418
Johnny Boy doesn't seem to think so.

418
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,671
How many captains would behave
like that with Neil Dellacroce?

419
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:04,677
You know, I think we got a little
crack developing in the Gambino family.

420
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:07,388
- Maybe more than meets the eye.
- Like what?

421
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:10,558
Gotti's heritage is Neapolitan.

422
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:13,561
Castellano is Sicilian, like Don Carlo.

423
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:15,980
The rivalry's subtle, but it's there.

424
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,070
"Never fear Rome.

425
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:25,823
The serpent lies coiled in Naples."

426
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:42,965
First off, I want everybody to know
Tommy Bilotti continues as a captain.

427
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,469
But he's also gonna be my
personal Doberman, right, Tommy?

428
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,762
Always, Paul. Always.

429
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:53,226
And Frankie De Cicco
is our new consigliere.

430
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,147
Armone, he wants to get out of harness.

431
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:01,651
I've done my stint for 44 years.

432
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,278
I bought a little
hole-in-the-wall cafe in Astoria.

433
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,572
I could walk to work every
morning and get away from my wife.

434
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,830
Anyone ever wants to consult,
come right over. Coffee's on me.

435
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:18,167
Everyone at this table should
be proud to be sitting here...

436
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:19,710
in front of a man's man.

437
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,179
All right, fiinally.

438
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:35,309
I think everybody here knows I'm
keeping Neil on as my underboss.

439
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:38,187
- It gives us some continuity.
- Grazie, Paul.

440
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:42,775
You know, I don't think
the Queens boys know Di B.

441
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:46,320
This is John Gotti, Robert
Di Bernardo, known as Di B.

442
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:49,657
- I love your handkerchief.
- I was gonna say the same thing.

443
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,742
That is Angelo Ruggeirio.

444
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,869
You know my tailor?

445
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:56,581
Di B runs all the porno in Brooklyn.

446
00:34:56,664 --> 00:35:00,251
You don't have to say anything about
John. His reputation precedes him.

447
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,297
All right, all right.
What's on the table?

448
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:11,137
I have Genovese people hijackin' three
loads outta Kennedy the last two months.

449
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:13,431
Colombos took off a couple too.

450
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:15,474
If I gotta rip somebody's
fuckin' eyes out here to--

451
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,935
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

452
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,604
Nobody's eyes are gonna get ripped out.

453
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:23,441
- I'm ready to whack the motherfuckers!
- Nobody is gonna get whacked!

454
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:28,195
Not unless the boss of
this family approves.

455
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:32,533
Understood?

456
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:41,083
You've been away for a while.

457
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,544
Maybe you don't know that we got...

458
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:47,423
a lot of joint ventures with
the Genoveses and Colombos.

459
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:50,551
The future of this family
doesn't depend on...

460
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:52,428
a couple of loads from Kennedy anymore.

461
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,349
We're like United Nations
now, is that right?

462
00:36:00,186 --> 00:36:05,650
Neil, you, me and Franike, we'll
work this Kennedy thing out later.

463
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,485
All right, next case.

464
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,655
All right. Nicki Scibetta's gotta go.

465
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,990
Johnny, I want your crew to whack him.

466
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:14,533
What do you mean, my crew?

467
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:18,663
Nick Scibetta's in the construction
business with Sammy there in Brooklyn.

468
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,581
That's Brooklyn business.

469
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:23,125
That's why it makes more sense
for you guys to do the job.

470
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:26,170
I live in Queens, okay? You
whack your own people. Forget it.

471
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:30,091
- What do we got, two families here?
- Frankie, go fuckyourself.

472
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:32,802
We ain't got no problem here.
Nick's my brother-in-law.

473
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:36,389
He's my embarrassment. I'll
whack him nice and easy.

474
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:39,058
We'll have the wake at Tomasulo's,
keep it in the neighborhood.

475
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,185
Good thinking, Sammy. You
stick with your in-laws.

476
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:43,187
I like that.

477
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:46,649
I gotta get back on the streets.
That's where all the money is.

478
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:50,152
Hey, Paul, not for nothin'.
That was a great spread.

479
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:05,042
The guy just got outta the
joint, for Christ's sake.

480
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:10,256
I mean, he's complicated,
but his motives are good.

481
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,133
Besides, he's a good earner.

482
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:16,345
Hey, John's aces with
me. He got a kid I know...

483
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:18,764
out of a jam with the
Zulus up in Greenhaven.

484
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:20,266
He didn't have to.

485
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:24,061
Johnny's problem is that
he's a street Neapolitan, huh?

486
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,690
Always scheming.

487
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:30,693
Worse than the Sicilians.

488
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:38,576
Are you remindin' me now
what I owe you, cocksucker?

489
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,370
Have I ever missed settlin' with
you? Come on. I'm like a clock.

490
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:43,039
Place the fuckin' bet.

491
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,293
Forgets who made him a rich
fuckin' man. Some fuckin' nerve.

492
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:50,463
John, why do you go nuts every
week tryin' to scrape up money?

493
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:52,673
What's Richie gonna do if you
just say "Go fuckyourself"?

494
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:55,051
A player loses, he pays.

495
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:57,094
A bookie loses, he
pays. Give me a break.

496
00:37:57,136 --> 00:38:00,014
- Tell it to the guys who owe us.
- Where's D'Mig?

497
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:03,059
At the warehouse with Bobby the Jew
tryin' to get rid of those watches.

498
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,770
By the time the fence takes
its cut, it's small potatoes.

499
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,313
We're breakin' our balls for peanuts.

500
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:10,358
Not for nothin', but the guys don't
have two nickels to rub together.

501
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:12,818
What are we doin' here,
policy slips? It's bullshit.

502
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:14,946
All you's do, you cry like babies.

503
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,989
All day long, you bite
my ass around the clock.

504
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:20,076
If I'm not in here havin' my famous
espresso with Tony Ducks by ten...

505
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,119
I'm back by noon to check the numbers.

506
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,081
But I'm the one that goes down to
Mulberry to check it out with Mr. Neil.

507
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,252
I'm the one that goes to Staten Island
to pay respect to that lay-down Paul.

508
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:31,254
I gotta drink bitter coffee
'cause his spic maid...

509
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:33,256
cannot even run a
fuckin' espresso machine.

510
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:35,758
I gotta sit with that zombie
Bilotti. Doberman my ass!

511
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:39,470
I gotta go out to the island now to
talk to Bobby about stolen watches?

512
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:41,931
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
I coulda been a meter maid.

513
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:45,685
I coulda worked for UP-fuckin'-S
and made more fuckin' money!

514
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,145
Where the fuck you come cryin'
to me about empty pockets?

515
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:50,314
Why don't you just say what
you want. What do you want?

516
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:55,027
You want a piece of DiB's porn?
A piece of Sammy's construction?

517
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,154
What do you want,
demolitions, cement or garbage?

518
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:01,117
You want trucks, meat, fiish,
garment? So the fuck do I!

519
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:08,374
Anybody got any ideas?

520
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,128
- I got one or two.
- Yeah?

521
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,088
- Here's the money!
- What the fuck?

522
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,715
Johnny! Come on!

523
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:19,594
Don't think for one minute you're not
diggin' into Angie's drug operation.

524
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:23,014
You and Angie and D'Mig and
your brother Sally are dealin'.

525
00:39:23,055 --> 00:39:25,892
Don't ever fuckin'
think I don't know that.

526
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,521
And I hear you with that
in the joint, Quack-Quack.

527
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:36,235
What's the matter now?
You got nothin' to say?

528
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:43,618
You got it wrong. Nobody's dealin'.
We're movin' a few things for Sally.

529
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:46,370
You movin' furniture
for five dollars an hour?

530
00:39:47,455 --> 00:39:48,623
Fuck you.

531
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,667
Let me tell you somethin'.

532
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:54,253
This Sicilian motherfucker fiinds
out you're dealin' heroin...

533
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:56,589
I can't save your ass, and
I'm the first to get hit.

534
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,885
You know why? I don't let
anyone whack out my crew.

535
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,887
Now, is that what you want?

536
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:09,602
Good.

537
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:20,238
What do you say the three
of us go down to Umberto's...

538
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,198
we get some scungillis, we relax.

539
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,826
I'm relaxed. I'm plenty relaxed.

540
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,497
I'm goin' down to Regine's,
have a drink with Di B.

541
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,376
I smell like a fuckin' animal now.

542
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:50,434
Hey, to each his own.

543
00:40:50,476 --> 00:40:52,436
There's big bucks in
it. That's for sure.

544
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,939
Hey, fuck this shit.
They lock you up forever.

545
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,941
Money ain't a good enough
reason to do a hundred years.

546
00:40:56,983 --> 00:40:59,360
You like this joint, huh?

547
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:01,821
It's classy.

548
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,447
Classy?

549
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:06,033
You got any idea how much money
this place must gross in a month?

550
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:07,285
Fuckin' Sammy.

551
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:10,454
He's all business, you know
what I mean? But he's right.

552
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,790
I wouldn't mind a piece
of this place myself.

553
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:14,250
Let me ask you something, John.

554
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,877
How come you don't have a
piece of anything legitimate?

555
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:21,757
Di B and me, we're in drywall,
construction, demolition, night clubs.

556
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:23,384
Legitimate, huh?

557
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:26,387
You know what I think is
bullshit? You should become CPAs.

558
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:28,764
I'm serious. Certifiied Public Assholes.

559
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:33,769
This way you could have
your legitimate businesses...

560
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:36,230
and your books and
your workman's comp...

561
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:38,357
and your Blue Cross
and your Blue Shield.

562
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:41,193
And on top of that, you go
pay your taxes, all right?

563
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,488
You think I got a button to become
some kind of straight-up businessman?

564
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:46,741
- Get the fuck outta here.
- You know what I think?

565
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:51,245
Under these $2.000 suits,
you're really an old-timer.

566
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,414
Yeah, man.

567
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:56,584
Gotta remember where we come from.

568
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,128
Amen.

569
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,631
Your boss is so busy
bein' a businessman...

570
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:04,383
I can't even get the right
backing when I need it.

571
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:05,551
What's that about?

572
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,222
Not just our boss.

573
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:11,265
Don't get me wrong. I know.

574
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:14,644
Yeah, he's my boss. He's my boss.

575
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:20,566
Off the record, I'd been
happy to see Neil get it.

576
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,069
Off the record, I don't
think anybody woulda cried...

577
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,112
if Mr. Neil got it.

578
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:28,991
But, you know, it's Cosa
Nostra. We got the boss we got.

579
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,038
Here's to changin' the subject.

580
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:35,706
To the boss!

581
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:42,463
- I gotta get goin'.
- Where you goin'?

582
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:45,091
- Business or pleasure?
- What the fuck's the difference?

583
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:47,885
- There he goes.
- Take care.

584
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:52,181
- Come here, you.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

585
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:57,144
A million a month gross,
minimum. I could be off by 50%.

586
00:42:57,186 --> 00:42:58,688
Fuckin' Sammy.

587
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,234
You know that contract we got in Queens?

588
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:07,113
We're the low bidders, but it turns out
it's like one of those "modifiied" bids.

589
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,073
It's always modifiied...

590
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:11,117
modifiied to the point where
we can't make any money.

591
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,622
Nicki, come here.

592
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:20,209
Take down that piece of drywall
up there, the one on the top.

593
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,879
For what?

594
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:28,843
For what?

595
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:31,679
'Cause maybe you ain't buyin'
the kinda quality that you should.

596
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:40,521
You don't trust nobody, man.

597
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,407
- What?
- Oh, fuck.

598
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:57,121
What are you doing?
Are you fuckin' nuts?

599
00:43:57,163 --> 00:44:00,124
When I fiirst picked up this piece
of shit, I knew it was a mistake.

600
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,252
- We're family.
- Son of a bitch.

601
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:05,129
I'm Deborah's brother, for God's sake!

602
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:07,632
Shut the fuck up, Nicki!

603
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:10,218
Don't kill me, please! What did I do?

604
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:17,016
You know somethin'? You are some whiner.

605
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,259
Oh, God!

606
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:40,600
- Jesus, John. I'm so sorry.
- Hey, Sammy. How are ya?

607
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:46,898
Who done this?

608
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:48,900
Leave it alone. It was an accident.

609
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:52,653
Just had an accident, that's all.

610
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:57,825
This isn't the time or
the place for all this.

611
00:45:57,909 --> 00:46:00,745
This is John's friends and family.

612
00:46:02,413 --> 00:46:03,748
Just stay here.

613
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,376
Thanks for comin', man.

614
00:46:26,812 --> 00:46:28,773
Who did this, Joe?

615
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:32,401
The guy that lives next
door. His name is Favara.

616
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:29,750
My God, I am heartily sorry...

617
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,752
for having offended Thee.

618
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:37,383
And I detest all past sins...

619
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:42,096
for Thyjust punishment.

620
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:50,187
But most ofall I have offended Thee.

621
00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:56,319
Oh, God...

622
00:47:56,402 --> 00:47:59,071
you're deserving of all my love.

623
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:04,035
I from here resolve to
the top of Thy grace...

624
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:07,538
to sin no more.

625
00:48:38,486 --> 00:48:40,988
Is this gonna take long?

626
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:43,032
It's 20.000 bucks I'm pickin' up.

627
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:45,826
We can afford a few
minutes. I'll be right back.

628
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:17,024
Somebody's gotta move this thing or
they're not gonna have headlights!

629
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:22,321
I'll be out in a minute.
I'll move the car in a minute.

630
00:49:22,363 --> 00:49:25,741
Hey, big shot, is this yours?

631
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:29,787
Is that yours?

632
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,831
Relax. I'll be out in a minute.

633
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,335
Is that yours?

634
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:40,298
I'll call you back in a few minutes.

635
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,260
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

636
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:46,721
Is that yours?

637
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:49,307
- Is what mine?
- The Lincoln.

638
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:53,519
What Lincoln?

639
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:09,076
- Let him go!
- Calm down, man!

640
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:18,628
Let go! John, a cop!
Get the fuck outta here!

641
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:20,630
Mr. Cutler, what's the real story here?

642
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:24,759
There is no real story. My client
was tryin' to break up a fight.

643
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:26,886
What does this have to
do with loan-sharking?

644
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:29,472
- Did he owe you money?
- Don't be ridiculous.

645
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:31,933
Mr. Gotti sells plumbing
supplies. That's all.

646
00:50:36,437 --> 00:50:39,732
Leave the man alone!
Leave the man alone!

647
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:41,943
What was your reaction
to these accusations?

648
00:50:41,984 --> 00:50:43,069
Take that.

649
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,071
Do you always hand out
fifties to street people?

650
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:46,822
Is that a fiifty? Take a hundred.

651
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:49,492
Give me back the fiifty.

652
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:52,036
It's tough on the streets. Everybody's
gotta score once in a while.

653
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,038
-That's why your neighborhood loves you.
-Could be.

654
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,208
How does it feel getting a
hundred dollars from John Gotti?

655
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,586
My guess is that once this
Piecyk fiinds out who you are...

656
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:02,672
he'll withdraw.

657
00:51:02,713 --> 00:51:05,716
But there's a bigger problem comin' up.

658
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:08,469
Not with you. With your people.

659
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:10,179
What do you mean, my people?

660
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:13,516
Angelo Ruggeirio, your
brother Gene, D'Mig...

661
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,811
on a heroin conspiracy-- indictment's
comin' down this afternoon.

662
00:51:16,852 --> 00:51:18,813
- Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
- I'm not kiddin' you.

663
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:22,817
And the really bad news is Angie's
house has been bugged for months.

664
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,780
Jesus Christ.

665
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:31,367
That stupid, greedy,
motherfuckin' moron!

666
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,289
Goddamn him! Goddamn him!

667
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:39,000
Paul is gonna whack the three of them.

668
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,919
Yeah. And me too.

669
00:51:42,044 --> 00:51:44,505
I got Moe, I got Larry, and I got Curly.

670
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:48,134
The bail I raised for you three,
I'll be broke here a fuckin' year!

671
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,471
How many times we gotta go through this?

672
00:51:52,555 --> 00:51:56,100
We're in the street, scratchin'
and scrapin', so we took a taste.

673
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:57,643
We'rejust tryin' to survive.

674
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:02,899
Angelo, how do you get caught
on a bug in your own house?

675
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:04,859
Motherfuckers!

676
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:06,652
Don't say motherfuckers, all right?

677
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:09,655
Even when you were a kid, you
don't shut your fuckin' mouth.

678
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,825
That's why I called you Quack-Quack.
They don't have to bug you.

679
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:14,911
Anyone in New York dials
seven digits to get you.

680
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:17,121
I had my house swept by
this electronic expert.

681
00:52:17,163 --> 00:52:19,123
The motherfucker told me it was safe.

682
00:52:19,165 --> 00:52:20,917
- Safe?
- Yeah.

683
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,919
Have you heard of technology?

684
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:27,590
There is no "safe."

685
00:52:27,632 --> 00:52:29,967
Don't you know they got
a parabolic mike today?

686
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,887
It could hear a fuckin'
snake fart in Egypt!

687
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:36,933
The Feds are a machine. They
don't run out of time or money!

688
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:40,102
They sent a whole fuckin'
army to grab 30 spics...

689
00:52:40,186 --> 00:52:42,396
in that Caribbean shithole,
whatever the fuck it was.

690
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,899
That's power, Angelo. That's real power.

691
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:47,902
You shut the fuck up for a
minute. I'm tryin' to make a point.

692
00:52:47,985 --> 00:52:50,529
That's the kind of power the
Feds have that made the bosses...

693
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:53,074
ban the goddamn drugs
in the first place!

694
00:52:53,157 --> 00:52:57,245
Every fuckin' boss ofevery family's
into drug money, off the record.

695
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,537
Paul's full ofshit.

696
00:52:58,621 --> 00:53:00,831
He's takin' fuckin' drug
money from Roy De Meo.

697
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:03,417
He don't ask where the cash
comes from, but he knows.

698
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:04,919
- So he's a hypocrite?
- Yeah.

699
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:06,921
Is this somethin' new?

700
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:10,299
He's the boss!

701
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:13,844
Do you get it? He's the boss.

702
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:21,018
- How bad are these tapes?
- Forget about it.

703
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:24,647
I said a lot of shit about
people, about Paul too.

704
00:53:36,826 --> 00:53:38,911
- Paul, good swim?
- I should be doin' more ofthis.

705
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,540
Helps me sleep better.

706
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,879
I sat down with the Colombos...

707
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:50,882
and those asbestos removal contracts...

708
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:53,926
that you guys got in
with the Board of Ed.

709
00:53:54,051 --> 00:53:56,637
Anyhow, I agreed to up their
end of it to 40 percent.

710
00:53:56,721 --> 00:53:58,514
- 40 percent?
- Jesus, Paul.

711
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:01,183
They don't even deserve the
30 percent they're in for now.

712
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:04,520
I know for a fact when Don Carlo was
alive, they were lucky to get ten.

713
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:06,480
Don Carlo's been dead
for a long time now.

714
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:10,818
And Neil, when Neil goes,
that's the end of that regime.

715
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,071
Finished. This is a new age.

716
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:16,198
We got more money to make...

717
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:18,659
workin' with the other
families than shuttin' them out.

718
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:20,703
Me and the Colombos...

719
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:25,625
we also had a little talk
about our John Gotti problem.

720
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,420
What John Gotti problem?

721
00:54:29,462 --> 00:54:31,964
- What's the matter with Johnny?
- You mean the Ruggeirio thing?

722
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:35,343
What John Gotti problem? What problem?

723
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:39,138
Don't you guys fuckin'
read? Give me that newspaper.

724
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,351
When the New York Times
carries it, you got trouble.

725
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:45,645
I had dinner last week
with this chicken guy.

726
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:47,855
What's his name? Looks like a chicken.

727
00:54:47,897 --> 00:54:49,857
What's he gonna think when
he sees these headlines?

728
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:52,360
These guys are not stupid.
They know who we are.

729
00:54:52,443 --> 00:54:55,238
But it's not supposed to be so public.

730
00:54:56,656 --> 00:54:59,200
This John Gotti is like some
throwback to our street days.

731
00:54:59,283 --> 00:55:02,161
Goes to work on some guy with
a baseball bat in the street!

732
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:05,122
The guy jumped him with a bat.
John's got a temper. So what?

733
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:07,833
- The guy's a hell
of-- - What? An earner?

734
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,961
Yeah, I know.

735
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:12,797
What the hell is it
with these $3.000 suits?

736
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,466
The man dresses better than Como.

737
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:19,262
And these FBI bugs.

738
00:55:20,805 --> 00:55:22,765
Who knows what's on those fuckin' tapes?

739
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:26,602
Do you?

740
00:55:26,644 --> 00:55:30,731
Who the hell knows what kind of shit
that fat fuck Angie talked about me.

741
00:55:33,401 --> 00:55:37,071
Anyway, if we gotta
whack John and his crew...

742
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:39,115
the Colombos are givin'
us the soldiers to do it.

743
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,451
Who's talkin' about whackin' John Gotti?

744
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:49,041
This way, it keeps us from
having war within the family.

745
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:53,504
Paul, as your consigliere, I have
an obligation to tell you this.

746
00:55:53,546 --> 00:55:57,049
It's not right for us to reveal family
problems in front of the Colombos.

747
00:55:57,174 --> 00:56:00,136
- It weakens us.
- It weakens nothin'.

748
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:03,097
If those tapes show that Angie
and those two other Mamelukes...

749
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:08,144
are dealin' powder, the rule
since 1957 is deal and die.

750
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:11,397
I gotta clip 'em, and Johnny Boy too.

751
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:21,699
What's up, fellas?

752
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:23,826
Can we go offthe record here?

753
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,370
- Absolutely.
- All right.

754
00:56:26,454 --> 00:56:28,664
What Carlo built up for
30 years with his blood...

755
00:56:28,748 --> 00:56:30,958
this prick is givin'
away piece by piece.

756
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:33,044
The other families are
gonna piss all over us.

757
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:35,546
He's not tryin' to build.
Mark my words, Sammy.

758
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:38,049
We're gonna starve with this guy.

759
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,677
Offthe record, I agree
with you 100 percent.

760
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,721
I'll tell you one other thing.

761
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:47,975
This guy don't understand for
one fuckin' minute who Gotti is.

762
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:52,188
You all right?

763
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:56,317
You gotta get to a hospital.

764
00:56:57,777 --> 00:57:01,405
- You hear me?
- What good would that do?

765
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:04,575
Theyjust wanna shoot that
toxic shit into me, and I--

766
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:07,161
I'll die that much sooner.

767
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:09,372
I just
don't wanna--

768
00:57:09,497 --> 00:57:12,458
I don't wanna leave a war behind me.

769
00:57:14,794 --> 00:57:16,379
He would be within his rights.

770
00:57:16,462 --> 00:57:19,799
Paul has every right to
whack out your whole crew.

771
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:26,681
"Deal and die." That was Carlo's edict.

772
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:27,932
Right, right.

773
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:32,645
And that's why Carlo Gambino wasn't
takin' drug money off De Meo like Paul.

774
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:35,565
Paulie ain't one tenth of
Carlo Gambino. You know that.

775
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:38,484
Carlo ran this family like
it was supposed to be run.

776
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:40,820
Like a brotherhood.
But it was our thing.

777
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:43,614
Paulie runs it like it's his thing.
Carlo would step out ofthe grave.

778
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:46,325
He'd set this whole
thing right, if he could.

779
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,079
Nobody in my crew is
gettin' clipped. That's all.

780
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,456
Ifanybody's gettin' clipped, it's Paul.

781
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:58,379
I brought you into this
family. I made you what you are.

782
00:57:58,462 --> 00:58:01,465
You're strong and you're smart.

783
00:58:01,507 --> 00:58:03,968
But don't ever believe that
you are bigger than anything--

784
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,970
- I don't think I'm
bigger-- - Don't interrupt--

785
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:07,972
Don't interrupt me.

786
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:12,268
I know what you're thinkin'.

787
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,896
But you cannot whack out a boss.

788
00:58:14,937 --> 00:58:18,524
Only the full commission
could make that call.

789
00:58:20,943 --> 00:58:23,404
I love you like a son...

790
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:28,075
but don't ever put me on the spot.

791
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:33,122
And don't ever force my hand.

792
00:58:34,665 --> 00:58:36,584
I would never do that.

793
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,427
Let's take a walk, huh?

794
00:58:55,728 --> 00:58:58,773
I gotta tell you, we can't clear
this with any of the bosses.

795
00:58:58,856 --> 00:59:00,816
It's our family, it's our
move. Nobody gives a fuck...

796
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:02,944
about this greedy cazzo.

797
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:06,113
- When?
- Not until Neil goes.

798
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,532
All right, Di B's with us all the way.

799
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:11,118
De Cicco says you oughta get
all the cappo regimes together...

800
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:12,662
and make 'em vote right away.

801
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:14,747
That'll make it offiicial.

802
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:18,709
He can deliver Joe Armone out
of retirement to sit next to you.

803
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:21,128
That oughta give it some weight.

804
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:23,130
You're gonna be underboss.

805
00:59:24,257 --> 00:59:25,883
You ready?

806
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,180
Frankie De Cicco will be consigliere.

807
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:36,727
With him, we're tight. Yeah, real tight.

808
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:40,314
Pull it tight like no government
nowhere is ever gonna break this.

809
00:59:40,356 --> 00:59:42,608
We're gonna make a powerhouse now.

810
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:48,072
A Cosa Nostra ain't
seen since Anastasia.

811
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:50,324
Anastasia?

812
00:59:50,366 --> 00:59:52,868
Shit, this is bigger than
killin' the fuckin' president.

813
00:59:52,952 --> 00:59:57,039
Hey, you think I was put on this
Earth to make them rich and me poor?

814
00:59:57,123 --> 01:00:01,043
We're gonna do a hit now.
We're gonna do a real hit.

815
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,463
We're goin' back.

816
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,968
Back to some real
in-your-face Cosa Nostra.

817
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:10,970
Out in front on the line.

818
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:13,055
Make 'em sit back and
watch the volcano blow.

819
01:00:13,097 --> 01:00:15,433
You with me?

820
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:18,227
I'm with you.

821
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,062
All the way to the fiinish.

822
01:00:35,036 --> 01:00:39,206
We had it all. The booze, the girls.

823
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:42,335
Pockets full of money.

824
01:00:49,508 --> 01:00:52,011
I had a girl.

825
01:00:52,136 --> 01:00:54,096
Was that that Irish girl?

826
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,514
Yeah.

827
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:03,356
I could go two, three
days without sleep.

828
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:04,899
My God.

829
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:09,278
I was so strong.

830
01:01:12,114 --> 01:01:16,327
You know, you live this
goddamn life long enough...

831
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:21,874
and you can't take
anything with you except...

832
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,126
your honor.

833
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:28,881
Don't ever lose that, Johnny.

834
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:38,599
This whole fuckin' thing...

835
01:01:40,142 --> 01:01:44,188
lasts only fiive minutes.

836
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:22,268
He's gone...

837
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,689
and that fuck Castellano
never even come say good-bye.

838
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:17,490
What did DeCicco need this
meetin' for? I got shoppin' to do.

839
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,993
Probably another beef about
the fuckin' garbage routes.

840
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:23,371
Yeah, more garbage.

841
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:53,401
It's gonna cost us another
20 bucks to park this thing.

842
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:56,404
We ought to get into these
Manhattan parking lots.

843
01:03:57,446 --> 01:03:59,448
It's a license to steal.

844
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:01,951
Let me out.

845
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:17,693
- La famiglia!
- La famiglia!

846
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,511
Here he comes.

847
01:05:48,432 --> 01:05:50,560
Hey, John, who's your tailor?

848
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:54,272
Mr. Gotti, did you have anything to
do with the Paul Castellano murder?

849
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:57,608
Is it true you're the new
boss of the Gambino family?

850
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,986
I askyou to look around
the courtroom, Mr. Piecyk...

851
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:04,240
and identify the man who assaulted you.

852
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:10,871
I don't see him.

853
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,500
Take offyour glasses, please.

854
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:19,839
Now, study the defendant.

855
01:06:25,011 --> 01:06:26,804
I never seen that guy before.

856
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:34,520
You're under oath.

857
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:37,106
You have never before seen this man?

858
01:06:37,148 --> 01:06:40,151
Yeah, I seen Mr. Gotti
on TV and the newspapers.

859
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,736
I never met the man.

860
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,113
Are you telling this
court that John Gotti...

861
01:06:44,238 --> 01:06:47,658
is not the same man you
incriminated on an assault warrant?

862
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:51,329
It was a long time ago. I
don't remember. I'm sorry.

863
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,166
Any further questions, Mr. Bartley?

864
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:58,211
- No, Your Honor, I think it's clear.
- Mr. Cutler.

865
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:01,172
Your Honor...

866
01:07:01,214 --> 01:07:03,674
I respectfully move for a dismissal....

867
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:05,176
ofall charges.

868
01:07:08,846 --> 01:07:10,348
Motion granted.

869
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,398
There he is!

870
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:30,034
You beat 'em, John!

871
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,994
I can't believe this son ofa bitch.

872
01:07:32,036 --> 01:07:33,955
Every time he beats a rap,
his popularity goes up.

873
01:07:34,038 --> 01:07:37,458
- He's making us look like idiots.
- Our day will come, believe me.

874
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,502
See the fiireworks on the way over?

875
01:07:39,585 --> 01:07:41,629
John's tossing a block
party for beating the case.

876
01:07:41,712 --> 01:07:43,714
Yeah, right. Everybody loves him.

877
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,426
He whacks out Paul Castellano
in the middle of46th Street.

878
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,345
Where are the New York cops?

879
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:52,515
And now it's some unsolved homicide.

880
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:56,018
Now this Piecyk thing. How do you
think this egomaniac must feel?

881
01:07:56,102 --> 01:07:57,103
Untouchable.

882
01:07:57,186 --> 01:08:00,439
Son ofa bitch is sitting on a
$500 million-a-year enterprise...

883
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:02,441
and he knows how to spread it around.

884
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:04,026
Correction.

885
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:07,863
He's sitting on top ofa $500
million-a-year criminal enterprise.

886
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:10,366
This is no Fortune 500
company he's running here.

887
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:12,994
Are you forgetting the
prosecutor spent the last year...

888
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:15,079
building a RICO case against him?

889
01:08:15,162 --> 01:08:18,499
You guys don't get it. I want this guy.

890
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:23,754
So spread the money around. Offer
immunity to some hard-timers.

891
01:08:23,796 --> 01:08:28,092
We'll spend 24 hours a day in that
room if we have to. I do not care!

892
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,809
He's doing business
somewhere in the building.

893
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:38,936
We fiind out where, we got him.

894
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,607
I do not want this son ofa bitch
as the next mayor of New York.

895
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:44,567
Only Sally.

896
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:48,654
He gets arrested in a rented Mercedes.

897
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:52,325
I think the Feds wired his mailbox.
Anyway, they're goin' through his car.

898
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:54,535
They fiind two Berettas
in the glove compartment...

899
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:56,287
and an axe under the front seat.

900
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,289
A fuckin' axe, right?

901
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:00,958
So they're lookin' at him. They say...

902
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:04,337
"You got any idea why there's
two handguns in the glove box...

903
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,547
and an axe under the front seat?''

904
01:09:06,672 --> 01:09:08,591
Sally says, "Are you serious?

905
01:09:08,674 --> 01:09:11,427
I will never rent a car
from fuckin' Avis again.''

906
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:17,266
Hey, Bruce!

907
01:09:20,686 --> 01:09:23,481
Get over here, you
cocksucker. Where you been?

908
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:25,983
- Long story.
- Yeah?

909
01:09:26,025 --> 01:09:28,527
I thought you should know
this sooner than later.

910
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:31,614
I got something for you,
but strictly offthe record.

911
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:34,200
So we'll go upstairs. Come on.

912
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:38,955
- Who's place is this?
- Mikey Cirelli's.

913
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:41,082
- I thought he was dead.
- He is.

914
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:43,125
Maybe that's why there's nobody here.

915
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,461
So what's goin' on?

916
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:48,548
U.S. Attorney's offiice has been
working a whole year on a RICO case...

917
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,716
against you, your brother
Gene, Angelo and D'Mig.

918
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:53,010
- Damn these fucks.
- I'm sorry.

919
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,515
- They don't let you live.
- Yeah, I know.

920
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,767
Let me go through this RICO thing again.

921
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,229
It says ifanyone anywhere is
caught doin' anything wrong...

922
01:10:03,271 --> 01:10:05,648
then everyone is guilty
up and down the line.

923
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,942
Wait a minute.
This is a law--

924
01:10:08,025 --> 01:10:10,861
Yeah, it is the government's license
to throw out the Constitution.

925
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:14,699
Ifthey can prove that somebody is part
ofa continuing criminal enterprise...

926
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:16,784
they can lock 'em up for life.

927
01:10:16,826 --> 01:10:19,370
"Continuing criminal enterprise." I
don't know what the fuck that means.

928
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:21,622
Did they lock up Nixon for
life when they raided...

929
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:23,875
his Democratic National Headquarters,
whatever the fuck they were?

930
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:24,959
The Plumbers.

931
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:27,962
He had an ongoing criminal
enterprise his entire career.

932
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:29,338
That's a RICO case.

933
01:10:29,422 --> 01:10:32,592
The assistant U.S. attorney on this
case does not see you as a defendant.

934
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:36,178
- To her, you're some kind oftrophy.
- "Her"? Who "her"?

935
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:39,307
- Diane Giacalone. Very ambitious.
- Would you forget about it?

936
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:42,602
No brush named Giacalone is
gonna be jerkin' me off for long.

937
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,937
And would you tell her to
leave us the fuck alone?

938
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,398
And another thing, I don't
wanna be alone tonight.

939
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:51,444
You remember? Who was
the guy? Tony Rigoletto.

940
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:53,529
No. Rigoletto is an opera.

941
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:56,157
- It was Tony Rigatto.
- I'm talkin' about opera.

942
01:10:56,198 --> 01:11:00,244
The guy could sing an entire
opera in Italian word for word...

943
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:01,996
didn't speak a word of Italian.

944
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:04,165
He was like an idiot savant.

945
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,959
These guys are retarded, but
they do one thing perfect.

946
01:11:07,043 --> 01:11:08,753
How come only servants
can do this stuff?

947
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:11,130
- Savant!
- What servant?

948
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:13,174
You fuckin' idiot!

949
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:22,141
You know, I gotta say this.

950
01:11:23,226 --> 01:11:25,186
- You got everyone's respect here.
- Thanks, John.

951
01:11:25,311 --> 01:11:28,064
I mean that. I was gonna
say you dress classy too...

952
01:11:28,147 --> 01:11:30,066
but I don't want you
to get a swell head.

953
01:11:30,107 --> 01:11:31,525
Thanks, John.

954
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:35,613
Paul thought of me as a money machine.
It's good to be treated as a friend.

955
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:38,658
Hey, you are a friend,
and Sammy G's a friend...

956
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:40,326
and what is with this guy?

957
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:42,912
His fuckin' wife has got
him home 6:00 every night.

958
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:45,081
Unless he's out whacking somebody.

959
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:50,628
Mr. Gotti?

960
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,634
Mr. Gotti? Hi. Nice to meet you.

961
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,803
My name's Roger, and
this is my wife, Ann.

962
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:01,305
We came in from Rochester
for the weekend...

963
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:03,766
and no one's gonna believe
we actually met you.

964
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:05,142
Wejust got married.

965
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:06,811
Theyjust got married!

966
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:10,481
Give 'em a bottle ofchampagne.

967
01:12:10,523 --> 01:12:12,817
- Thankyou very much.
- Get his autograph.

968
01:12:12,858 --> 01:12:15,152
I'll give you an
autograph. Tommy, come here.

969
01:12:17,655 --> 01:12:18,906
Thank you very much.

970
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:28,958
John Gotti, I'm FBI Agent
Russo, this is Agent Gabriel.

971
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:31,669
Russo. You know what FBI means, right?

972
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:33,379
Why don't you tell me.

973
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:35,673
"Forever Bother the Italians."

974
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:39,385
An FBI bug has picked up information
we thinkyou might be interested in.

975
01:12:39,468 --> 01:12:40,469
No kidding.

976
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:42,680
A capo in the Bonanno Family
has been recorded stating...

977
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:44,557
that the Commission has
sanctioned a hit on you.

978
01:12:47,184 --> 01:12:48,394
Thanks for the tip.

979
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:51,564
We have a legal and moral
obligation to inform you.

980
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:54,025
Legal and moral, is it?
Let's not bullshit each other.

981
01:12:54,066 --> 01:12:56,152
- You'd be happy to see me go.
- Not at all.

982
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:58,279
We're gonna take you down ourselves.

983
01:13:13,336 --> 01:13:16,297
Mr. Gotti, what are your
feelings about the RICO law?

984
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:18,382
John, are you ready for
the end ofthis trial?

985
01:13:18,466 --> 01:13:19,926
l'm always ready.

986
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:25,348
Are you the boss ofthe Gambino family?

987
01:13:25,431 --> 01:13:28,059
l'm a memberof the Gotti
family. My wife Vicki's the boss.

988
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,732
For seven torturous months...

989
01:13:34,774 --> 01:13:38,527
the government has been trying
to sell you on this indictment.

990
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,571
This indictment stinks.

991
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:45,993
And a fancy wine dressing called RICO
isn't going to make it any better.

992
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:47,370
It's still rancid.

993
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:49,413
It is still rotten.

994
01:13:49,497 --> 01:13:52,291
Still makes you retch and vomit.

995
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:55,211
To be brief...

996
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:58,422
ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, there is no case.

997
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:02,969
You can convict John Gotti
because he curses on the telephone.

998
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:06,138
You can convict John Gotti
because he gambles excessively.

999
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,432
- You can convict John Gotti...
- You see Juror Number 5?

1000
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:11,185
because he lives a lifestyle
which you may or may not--

1001
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:12,562
What about him?

1002
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:14,647
- But that is not...
- We own him.

1003
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:16,315
what my client is charged with!

1004
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:18,651
- Worst-case, it's a hung jury.
- You want to get John Gotti?

1005
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:22,238
You do it the right way.

1006
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:25,283
Do it the American way.

1007
01:14:25,366 --> 01:14:27,368
Thejury has reached a verdict.

1008
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:33,875
Defendant Joseph Dimiglia:
Not guilty on all counts.

1009
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,793
Yes!

1010
01:14:35,877 --> 01:14:37,253
That's what I been tellin' youse.

1011
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:41,090
Ifyou can't control yourselves...

1012
01:14:41,173 --> 01:14:43,593
you will spend the next
30 days in this building...

1013
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:45,970
- and ifyou think that I'm kidding...
- Are we in grade school?

1014
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:48,347
- I invite you to try it.
- This is bullshit.

1015
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:51,642
Defendant Angelo Ruggiero:
Not guilty on all counts.

1016
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:53,352
Defendant Gene Gotti:

1017
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:55,396
Not guilty on all counts.

1018
01:14:57,273 --> 01:14:59,191
Defendant John Gotti:

1019
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:02,570
Not guilty on all counts.

1020
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:27,637
John Gottihasbeaten a federal RlCO case.

1021
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,639
After seven months oftestimony...

1022
01:15:29,722 --> 01:15:34,227
Gotti has once again proven to be immune
to government efforts to convict him.

1023
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:36,896
The "DapperDon" is
now the "Teflon Don. "

1024
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,065
- Can I have your view on the trial?
- John Gotti?

1025
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:41,651
Have you ever walked into the
Boys' Club on the East Side?

1026
01:15:41,692 --> 01:15:44,320
Every bit of equipment
bought by John Gotti.

1027
01:15:44,362 --> 01:15:46,530
Ma'am, can I have
your view on the trial?

1028
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:48,032
We love him.

1029
01:15:48,115 --> 01:15:50,326
The government should just
leave the poorman alone.

1030
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:54,163
Perhaps the most personable gangland
boss ever to grace the BigApple.

1031
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:57,166
John Gottiis, in underworldterms...

1032
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,961
the undisputed "King of the Volcano. "

1033
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:09,637
You rule, John!

1034
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:24,235
You know why the people
in this city love me?

1035
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:26,862
I'm beatin' the same system now
that's fuckin' them every day.

1036
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:28,739
Everybody loves a celebrity gangster.

1037
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:30,741
You forget your father
was a rich businessman.

1038
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:33,536
You don't know the system
from the outside. They know.

1039
01:16:33,578 --> 01:16:34,912
They know I know.

1040
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:36,998
Whatever you say, John.

1041
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,252
You know, Frankie...

1042
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,462
why would a guy born of
money choose our life?

1043
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:52,179
- Hey, Angie.
- What?

1044
01:16:52,263 --> 01:16:56,142
Three guys sittin' in a car.
Mexican, black guy and a Puerto Rican.

1045
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,184
- Who's drivin'?
- The black guy.

1046
01:16:57,268 --> 01:16:59,270
- Puerto Rican.
- The police.

1047
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:03,316
- You seen a fuckin' doctor?
- No.

1048
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,318
Will you please go see
Gennaro on Prince Street?

1049
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:08,112
Bulldoze your way in. Don't
sit in no waitin' room.

1050
01:17:08,195 --> 01:17:10,448
If I'm gonna see a doctor,
I'm gonna see a Jew doctor.

1051
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:12,658
Jews, Wops,
Chinks, Zulus--

1052
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:15,578
It's one world, it's one people.
Would you stop it with that shit?

1053
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,747
Not when it comes to doctors.

1054
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,583
John, I gotta talk to
you private for a minute.

1055
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,878
What's the matter? All right.
Tell Vic I'll be up in a minute.

1056
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,963
- We're late as it is.
- The guy can't wait?

1057
01:17:26,047 --> 01:17:28,424
Tell him I'll be in there.

1058
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:30,760
Go on. What is it?

1059
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:32,845
I heard Di B sayin' some things.

1060
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:35,932
He says ifyou're goin' away on this
RICO thing, Sammy should be the boss.

1061
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:38,768
- That's bullshit.
- No, it ain't!

1062
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:40,853
I know you're pissed
offat me, but it's true.

1063
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,897
I'm not pissed at
you. I don't trust you.

1064
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,858
You put my tit in the ringer
on that goddamn dope beef.

1065
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,152
I love you, all right?
I just don't trust you.

1066
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:51,447
- That's how it started with Paul.
- What started with Paul?

1067
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,658
Di B's talkin' subversive,
and Sammy's right next to him.

1068
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:56,369
Di B is solid, and so is Sammy.

1069
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:59,622
Put out the fucking
cigarettes and see a doctor.

1070
01:17:59,705 --> 01:18:01,624
Come on. Stop that.

1071
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:12,802
Where is everybody?

1072
01:18:12,885 --> 01:18:14,804
I think Gene's at Sheepshead
Bay with your mother.

1073
01:18:14,887 --> 01:18:18,057
Pete's downtown lookin' at a buyer
who wants to talk to you about buyin'.

1074
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:20,601
- That son ofa bitch-- -
I really don't wanna know.

1075
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:22,562
It's just an expression.

1076
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:25,314
So, consigliere...

1077
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:30,695
Angie says Di B is talkin' subversive.
There's nothin' to that, right?

1078
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:34,574
Di B's a solid guy.

1079
01:18:34,657 --> 01:18:37,159
Between us, Angie's
just a little jealous...

1080
01:18:37,201 --> 01:18:39,912
that me and Sammy got the
slots we did after Paulie went.

1081
01:18:39,996 --> 01:18:43,040
They don't like you spending
so much time with Di B.

1082
01:18:43,124 --> 01:18:46,043
Forget about it, Johnny.
Normal family bullshit.

1083
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:48,754
Where is Sammy today?

1084
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:50,965
He's working. Hey.

1085
01:18:51,007 --> 01:18:53,009
You know the guy got a
$13 million contract...

1086
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:55,595
to build a new school in Brighton Beach?

1087
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:57,763
This guy's a wonder. He
opens a business a minute.

1088
01:18:57,805 --> 01:19:00,308
Since you made him underboss,
nobody can keep up with him.

1089
01:19:00,391 --> 01:19:02,727
In a few years, between him and Di B...

1090
01:19:02,768 --> 01:19:04,812
they're gonna own all of Brooklyn.

1091
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:08,941
This guy, O'Connor,
head of the 608 Union?

1092
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:11,736
He trashed the place 'cause
Tommy didn't use his people.

1093
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:14,280
They defiinitely knew
they was under your flag.

1094
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:16,574
I was ready to whack the guy...

1095
01:19:16,657 --> 01:19:18,659
but I mentioned it to Di B.

1096
01:19:18,743 --> 01:19:20,828
He said I ought to run it by you.

1097
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:24,457
What is this? You and Di B discuss
who gets whacked and who don't?

1098
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,876
Who the fuck is the boss, may I ask?

1099
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:29,503
We weren't discussin' anything.

1100
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:32,298
I mentioned it to Di B in
passing. He waved the flag.

1101
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:35,718
- It ain't no big fuckin' deal.
- I hear he's promotin' you for boss.

1102
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:37,845
I don't think he was talkin' out ofturn.

1103
01:19:37,887 --> 01:19:39,847
- Di B was thinkin' ofthe family.
- He's thinking.

1104
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:42,058
He got no right to think it.

1105
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:44,143
I just spent half a
million on legal fees.

1106
01:19:44,227 --> 01:19:46,229
I'm sitting on the griddle
for seven fuckin' months.

1107
01:19:46,312 --> 01:19:48,940
I got you and Di B layin' me
down. What kind of friend is that?

1108
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:51,317
Get the fuck outta
here, layin' you down.

1109
01:19:51,442 --> 01:19:53,486
What are you talkin' about?

1110
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:55,571
What's the matter with you?

1111
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:59,116
I'm in a courtroom for seven months.
Now I got Gene and Angie's drug trial.

1112
01:19:59,242 --> 01:20:02,870
Then the FBI pops up in the men's
room every time I take a piss.

1113
01:20:02,954 --> 01:20:06,082
I'm talkin' about my blood pressure!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1114
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:08,543
- Forget I said anything.
- You got it.

1115
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:14,674
You really worried about this thing?

1116
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:19,053
I mean, you want me to
keep an eye on Di B or what?

1117
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:24,058
Yeah.

1118
01:20:25,393 --> 01:20:27,520
Keep an eye on him.

1119
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:30,022
Come here.

1120
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,025
Take care ofyourself.

1121
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:35,987
I'm worried about your blood pressure.
Don't be eatin' all that greasy shit.

1122
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:48,040
Seven fuckin' months.

1123
01:20:48,165 --> 01:20:50,751
Seven fuckin' months that
RICO case had me tied up.

1124
01:20:50,835 --> 01:20:53,379
- They don't let you live.
- Seven months of my life.

1125
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:55,464
I know. They don't let you live.

1126
01:20:55,506 --> 01:20:57,800
Speaking oftime, we got
that 3 o'clock in midtown.

1127
01:20:57,842 --> 01:20:59,802
- What time is it now?
- Time to go.

1128
01:20:59,844 --> 01:21:02,763
Tell 'em I can't break away. I'm
staying. I'll ride back with Sammy.

1129
01:21:02,805 --> 01:21:04,640
You goin' into Manhattan? Good.

1130
01:21:04,724 --> 01:21:06,934
- See you later.
- We'll do it tomorrow.

1131
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:09,353
Jimmy, thanks for everything.
Put it on Sammy's tab.

1132
01:21:09,395 --> 01:21:11,522
Sure. Ciao.

1133
01:21:14,442 --> 01:21:17,069
So, Cheech, you wanna drop
me off at Mulberry Street?

1134
01:21:17,153 --> 01:21:19,155
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1135
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:23,034
You wanna talk about Fourth
Avenue or whatever the fuck it was?

1136
01:21:23,117 --> 01:21:24,118
What Fourth Avenue?

1137
01:21:26,287 --> 01:21:27,538
Fuckin' Buick.

1138
01:21:54,815 --> 01:21:56,692
Who's not here? Is anybody missing?

1139
01:21:56,776 --> 01:21:59,195
- Tommy Marino ain't here!
- He's in Florida!

1140
01:21:59,278 --> 01:22:01,572
I don't see Di B. Di B ain't here!

1141
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:05,910
Di B ain't here.

1142
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:12,166
I know you come from
upstate, Connecticut, Jersey.

1143
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,920
I'm not gonna keep youse here.
I heard some ofyouse talkin'.

1144
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:18,714
Nobody knows who killed Frankie DeCicco.

1145
01:22:18,756 --> 01:22:20,216
So don't ask.

1146
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:24,637
Nobody's got to look over their
shoulder. Tell your crews to stay calm.

1147
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:28,849
You're the Gambino family.

1148
01:22:30,309 --> 01:22:33,563
And don't you ever fuckin' believe...

1149
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:35,189
that
anyone--

1150
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:37,984
anyone
anywhere--

1151
01:22:40,027 --> 01:22:42,029
is gonna fuck with us.

1152
01:22:45,616 --> 01:22:47,785
Now, go home and drive carefully.

1153
01:22:47,827 --> 01:22:50,746
Believe me, that's the most
dangerous part ofyour lives.

1154
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:56,294
Thankyou for bein' here.

1155
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:19,317
Man, that car. You oughta
see that fuckin' car.

1156
01:23:19,358 --> 01:23:21,944
Thisjust could be a
renegade element, that's all.

1157
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:23,988
Maybe it's one ofTommy Bilotti's people.

1158
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:28,075
Hey, Frankie DeCicco set up
the meeting with Big Paul.

1159
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,077
Payback time.

1160
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:32,288
Yeah, but the question is, is it over?

1161
01:23:34,165 --> 01:23:36,459
There was nothin' left
ofthat fuckin' car.

1162
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:46,469
- How are you, Joe?
- I'm good.

1163
01:23:46,552 --> 01:23:47,720
Good.

1164
01:23:47,803 --> 01:23:49,430
Jordan, espresso.

1165
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:55,561
For sure you were supposed to
be in that car with Frankie.

1166
01:23:55,603 --> 01:23:56,604
We goin' to war?

1167
01:23:57,438 --> 01:23:58,898
They took their shot.

1168
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:02,485
They'll be satisfiied with one
for one and give you a pass.

1169
01:24:02,568 --> 01:24:04,654
But you got even bigger problems.

1170
01:24:04,737 --> 01:24:09,033
Yeah? You sellin' the special
here, oryou tellin' fortunes today?

1171
01:24:09,075 --> 01:24:11,869
Don't take no fortune-teller
to see where you're headin'.

1172
01:24:11,953 --> 01:24:14,622
I went to your inauguration.

1173
01:24:14,705 --> 01:24:16,624
I held my nose, but I went.

1174
01:24:16,707 --> 01:24:19,877
What did you have to hold your
nose about? I'm just curious.

1175
01:24:19,919 --> 01:24:21,671
I got every right to talk this way.

1176
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:26,509
I was at the sit-down with
Neil and Paul and Don Carlo...

1177
01:24:26,592 --> 01:24:28,594
afteryou clipped Galione.

1178
01:24:28,678 --> 01:24:32,265
You broke a rule then,
but Neil got you a pass.

1179
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:35,601
Then you broke another rule. You whacked
out a boss without a Commission okay.

1180
01:24:35,643 --> 01:24:36,644
Excuse me.

1181
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:39,105
I'm supposed to get a Commission okay...

1182
01:24:39,146 --> 01:24:41,190
while my family is being bled to death?

1183
01:24:41,274 --> 01:24:43,276
Hey, fuck Paul. He deserved it.

1184
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:45,736
That's got nothing to do with it.

1185
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:48,865
The rules are for everybody.

1186
01:24:48,906 --> 01:24:52,368
Right now, on a street in
Brooklyn, there's a young kid.

1187
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,663
He works himself up, and he talks
to Di B, he talks to Gravano...

1188
01:24:55,746 --> 01:24:58,958
he talks to three or four capos,
and you get a bullet in your head.

1189
01:25:01,252 --> 01:25:04,005
We survive by our rules.

1190
01:25:04,088 --> 01:25:06,716
And now you're breakin'
the oldest rule of all.

1191
01:25:06,757 --> 01:25:08,885
You're goin' fuckin' public.

1192
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:10,386
On TV and magazine covers.

1193
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:12,471
These fancy suits, these fancy haircuts.

1194
01:25:12,555 --> 01:25:13,764
"John Gotti, John Gotti."

1195
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:16,267
Don't give me that shit.
I didn't ask to go public.

1196
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,352
They shove their cameras
and microphones in my face.

1197
01:25:18,436 --> 01:25:20,021
Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:25:20,104 --> 01:25:22,148
You're turning this thing
ofours into entertainment...

1199
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,483
for everyone who watches
the six o'clock news.

1200
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:26,569
But our thing is secret.

1201
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:31,490
Secret. And what
you're doin' won't work.

1202
01:25:32,909 --> 01:25:34,952
You believe you can keep spitting
in the government's face...

1203
01:25:34,994 --> 01:25:36,537
and get away with it?

1204
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:38,956
You're making them come afteryou.

1205
01:25:38,998 --> 01:25:41,417
What do you think, Joe?

1206
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,628
You don't think the
FBI knows who you are?

1207
01:25:44,962 --> 01:25:47,215
Your face hasn't been on
the wall next to mine...

1208
01:25:47,298 --> 01:25:49,050
for the last 20 years?

1209
01:25:49,133 --> 01:25:51,719
Get outta here. They
know me. I know who I am.

1210
01:25:51,802 --> 01:25:53,763
I'm not embarrassed by who I am.

1211
01:25:53,804 --> 01:25:56,515
I'm not gonna sit in the
dark like some fuckin' rat.

1212
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:59,185
In the end, maybe I'll get
respect. I'm not gettin' any here.

1213
01:25:59,268 --> 01:26:02,230
John, you made a hell ofa long walk...

1214
01:26:02,355 --> 01:26:05,524
from a cockroach tenement to
the cover of Time magazine.

1215
01:26:05,608 --> 01:26:07,026
That takes ability.

1216
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:11,697
But a Cosa Nostra boss don't belong
on the cover of Time magazine.

1217
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:13,699
Wherever I'm at, it's
'cause I am who I am.

1218
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:16,202
I'm not gonna change or
apologize for who I am.

1219
01:26:16,244 --> 01:26:18,371
But you'll wind up in a cell...

1220
01:26:18,454 --> 01:26:20,456
because you are who you are.

1221
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,168
And you'll take a lot
of good people with you.

1222
01:26:26,462 --> 01:26:30,049
Duck, John. Learn to duck sometimes.

1223
01:26:30,132 --> 01:26:32,843
No more comments about
me lowering my profile.

1224
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:34,637
It's not my style.

1225
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:37,098
We're not gonna be
this styleless family.

1226
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:39,809
First order of business,
new consigliere.

1227
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:41,811
Frankie, the job is yours.

1228
01:26:41,894 --> 01:26:43,938
You get word to the four bosses today.

1229
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,107
If DeCicco was payment
in full, we settle.

1230
01:26:46,148 --> 01:26:48,150
- We all want to get on with our lives.
- It's done.

1231
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:50,903
Gene, you got a drug trial
comin' up. Stay off the street.

1232
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:52,697
- Let Pete run Queens.
- You got it.

1233
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,448
What's myjob?

1234
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:57,076
Killin' people. What
else? You been buggin' me.

1235
01:26:57,118 --> 01:26:59,912
You want to clip Lou Di Bono
and Mickey whatever-his-name-is?

1236
01:26:59,996 --> 01:27:01,455
- Mickey De Batt.
- Fine.

1237
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:03,833
Clip 'em both, makes you feel good.

1238
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,167
All right.

1239
01:27:07,044 --> 01:27:10,590
Look, I hate to bring this up
'cause I'm really close to the guy...

1240
01:27:11,757 --> 01:27:13,926
but I got an obligation
to the family here.

1241
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:23,686
Maybe Angelo ain't so crazy when he
said Di B's been doin' a lot of talkin'.

1242
01:27:23,769 --> 01:27:25,771
Whoa. Wait a minute.

1243
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:28,482
Angelo's been sipping morphine
for months for his cancer.

1244
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:31,110
The guy's in and out. You can't
believe him on something like this.

1245
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:33,821
It isn'tjust what Angelo said.

1246
01:27:33,946 --> 01:27:36,032
Di B's got his own agenda.

1247
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:39,410
Where was he last night?
John almost got killed.

1248
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:41,954
It's like a spit in the
face, not showin' up.

1249
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:44,248
- You know where he was?
- I know where he was.

1250
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:46,667
Di B was in Brooklyn on union business.

1251
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,753
It was bona fide. I
checked it out today.

1252
01:27:48,878 --> 01:27:51,756
Di B told me he told you that
and that you were to tell John.

1253
01:27:53,216 --> 01:27:57,178
- He never told me anything.
- Di B's no threat, for chrissakes!

1254
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,597
Even if he said something,
it don't mean shit.

1255
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,140
Fuck it!

1256
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:08,189
See, I got no time.

1257
01:28:08,981 --> 01:28:11,943
I got no time for subversives. Not now!

1258
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:13,402
Not now.

1259
01:28:14,278 --> 01:28:17,323
I love Di B as much as
any man in this room...

1260
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:20,243
but if he's
backdoorin' John--

1261
01:28:22,745 --> 01:28:24,205
It's Di B!

1262
01:28:24,288 --> 01:28:25,665
Come on in!

1263
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:31,796
John, I'm sorry I'm late. Just
wanted you to know I was here.

1264
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:34,423
You want me in on this,
or you want me downstairs?

1265
01:28:34,465 --> 01:28:35,925
No, downstairs is all right.

1266
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:37,969
All right. See you later.

1267
01:28:46,978 --> 01:28:49,438
I don't want the world
to think I'm in hiding.

1268
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:53,859
You comin' bouncin', Sammy?

1269
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:56,070
Not tonight, Johnny.

1270
01:28:56,195 --> 01:28:57,947
I'll take Di B.

1271
01:28:59,574 --> 01:29:01,075
What a life, huh?

1272
01:29:02,368 --> 01:29:04,829
Pallin' around with a guy
I'm gonna have clipped.

1273
01:29:13,462 --> 01:29:15,506
That little list of guys who go...

1274
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:17,842
Louie Di Bono has two
businesses with Sammy.

1275
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:19,927
Mickey De Batt is in
demolition with Sammy.

1276
01:29:19,969 --> 01:29:23,097
Yeah, and Di B and Sammy got
over a dozen businesses together.

1277
01:29:33,608 --> 01:29:35,902
Bruce, come here.

1278
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:37,278
What?

1279
01:29:39,822 --> 01:29:41,282
Check this out.

1280
01:29:46,162 --> 01:29:48,331
Why are these capos showing
her all this respect?

1281
01:29:48,414 --> 01:29:50,666
That's a good question.

1282
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,544
- Does she live in the building?
- I don't know.

1283
01:29:55,087 --> 01:29:58,341
I'm not in this thing out
of the goodness of my heart.

1284
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:00,760
I'm in this thing to make money.

1285
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:02,303
Come on in.

1286
01:30:08,017 --> 01:30:10,186
Hey, Joe, get Di B an espresso.

1287
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:13,105
All right. Don't worry about it.

1288
01:30:13,147 --> 01:30:15,274
Yeah. Whatever.

1289
01:30:15,358 --> 01:30:18,027
All right, we'll straighten
it out tomorrow, all right?

1290
01:30:19,278 --> 01:30:21,614
Subcontractor from that
school out in Queens.

1291
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:24,033
Looks like we got a little
$30,000 envelope coming.

1292
01:30:24,116 --> 01:30:26,077
Good. Could use the money.

1293
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:28,037
With your fuckin' habits.

1294
01:30:30,456 --> 01:30:32,792
- Here you go. Two sugars.
- Thank you.

1295
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,087
Cheers.

1296
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:49,100
Thought you weren't gonna come.

1297
01:30:49,183 --> 01:30:51,185
- I wasn't.
- Fuckyou.

1298
01:30:52,436 --> 01:30:54,355
- Hey, John.
- What?

1299
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:57,525
Things are different now.

1300
01:30:57,608 --> 01:30:59,443
Yeah? What's different?

1301
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:01,028
Look at me.

1302
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:05,700
- I fucked up.
- So?

1303
01:31:06,784 --> 01:31:08,703
You're a fuck-up, yeah?

1304
01:31:10,162 --> 01:31:12,164
You still mad at me?

1305
01:31:13,457 --> 01:31:14,917
You still mad at me?

1306
01:31:17,795 --> 01:31:18,796
I'm thinkin'.

1307
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,970
That's good.

1308
01:31:27,763 --> 01:31:29,724
- Hey, John.
- What?

1309
01:31:33,936 --> 01:31:35,062
I'm sorry.

1310
01:31:38,941 --> 01:31:41,068
Just shut up and eat, all right?

1311
01:31:47,074 --> 01:31:51,245
Mrs. Michael Cirelli, apartment 10
in Gotti's building. Lives alone.

1312
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:53,956
Widow of Mikey Cirelli.

1313
01:31:56,042 --> 01:31:58,336
Lifelong soldier for Neil Dellacroce.

1314
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:48,010
So what? So it's another RICO case.

1315
01:32:48,052 --> 01:32:52,014
What am I supposed to say? These Feds
got nothin' better to do than chase me?

1316
01:32:52,056 --> 01:32:54,976
I'm the only game in
town now? We'll sue them.

1317
01:32:55,017 --> 01:32:57,395
For harassment. What the hell else?

1318
01:32:57,478 --> 01:32:59,939
It's 2:45 in the morning.
Am I getting billed for this?

1319
01:33:00,022 --> 01:33:01,983
Then let's say nothin', all right?

1320
01:33:07,655 --> 01:33:09,407
What is it?

1321
01:33:11,242 --> 01:33:13,160
They got a new grand jury goin' now.

1322
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,789
- Jesus, Johnny.
- Fuckin' government.

1323
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:20,793
Like a 1,000-pound gorilla.

1324
01:33:20,877 --> 01:33:22,378
You beat 'em before.

1325
01:33:24,672 --> 01:33:25,673
Beat 'em again.

1326
01:33:29,385 --> 01:33:30,887
Come to bed.

1327
01:33:31,637 --> 01:33:33,598
Let me look at my races.

1328
01:33:46,027 --> 01:33:48,029
So who do we got today?

1329
01:33:54,952 --> 01:33:57,121
We got my lucky baby, my lucky star.

1330
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:01,626
Susan Valley, Eddie's Delight.

1331
01:34:06,214 --> 01:34:07,882
What looks good?

1332
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:11,636
What looks good?

1333
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:26,400
He's here.

1334
01:34:27,276 --> 01:34:28,778
With his lawyer.

1335
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:40,039
Where are we?

1336
01:34:40,122 --> 01:34:43,167
They're coming down with 15, 20 counts
of RICO, including the Castellano hit.

1337
01:34:43,209 --> 01:34:45,336
- This is serious.
- What is this gonna cost?

1338
01:34:45,378 --> 01:34:47,004
Forget that.

1339
01:34:47,088 --> 01:34:51,008
It's their last shot. If we win
again, we're out of the woods.

1340
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:53,052
But ifthey come up
with something strong...

1341
01:34:53,135 --> 01:34:56,264
we might have to think about
striking a deal with the prosecutor.

1342
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,475
- What are you talkin' about?
- Listen to me.

1343
01:35:01,102 --> 01:35:03,104
Who you talkin' to here?

1344
01:35:05,982 --> 01:35:07,775
No, no.

1345
01:35:07,858 --> 01:35:12,238
You don't let anyone in this
family cop any kind of a plea.

1346
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,032
A plea bargain is
just another gun--

1347
01:35:15,116 --> 01:35:17,410
Am I talkin' to myself?
I said no fuckin' deals.

1348
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:20,580
I don't give a shit ifeveryone here
goes to Marion for a thousand years.

1349
01:35:20,663 --> 01:35:22,623
There's gonna be no fuckin' deals!

1350
01:35:22,707 --> 01:35:23,916
No fuckin' deals!

1351
01:35:26,919 --> 01:35:29,881
I'll get Jacoby and Meyers
to plea bargain my ass.

1352
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:33,926
Cost me eight cents.

1353
01:35:50,735 --> 01:35:53,821
We got the place to ourselves.
The old lady's with her nephew.

1354
01:35:53,863 --> 01:35:57,700
I just told Cutler no
one is taking that stand.

1355
01:35:57,783 --> 01:35:59,785
You get my cell ready right now.

1356
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:02,622
'Cause if it ain't malicious mopery
or car theft, we deny everything.

1357
01:36:02,663 --> 01:36:04,999
Cutler told me they come
up with a new statute.

1358
01:36:05,082 --> 01:36:08,294
It's called "committing murder
in furtherance of your position."

1359
01:36:08,336 --> 01:36:10,671
That's nice. That's real nice.

1360
01:36:10,755 --> 01:36:13,382
They come up with anything
they want. Fuckin' government.

1361
01:36:14,634 --> 01:36:17,345
That dunce Bush. Yeah, old Bush.

1362
01:36:17,428 --> 01:36:20,306
He could send a whole army to
Panama to grab one man-- the spic.

1363
01:36:20,389 --> 01:36:21,515
Yeah, Noriega.

1364
01:36:21,599 --> 01:36:24,143
You know how many people they
whacked out to get that fuck?

1365
01:36:24,227 --> 01:36:28,856
The spic's workin' for Washington the
whole time. They got no parameters.

1366
01:36:30,524 --> 01:36:32,235
What time is it, anyway?

1367
01:36:32,318 --> 01:36:34,487
- About 11:30.
- Where's Sammy?

1368
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:36,531
I guess he's home. He's tired.

1369
01:36:37,865 --> 01:36:40,826
Tired of being the world's
only pussy-whipped hit man.

1370
01:36:42,537 --> 01:36:44,664
Tired 'cause he got 40
fuckin' companies now.

1371
01:36:44,747 --> 01:36:47,041
The guy's creating capital.

1372
01:36:47,124 --> 01:36:49,544
For you? For me? No
shit? For the family?

1373
01:36:49,627 --> 01:36:51,671
I got people in the carpet business.

1374
01:36:51,754 --> 01:36:55,258
They come to be every day. They
say, "John, we can't even get a job.

1375
01:36:55,299 --> 01:36:57,802
Sammy's locking up everything.
We can't even turn a buck.''

1376
01:36:57,885 --> 01:37:00,221
I go to Sammy with that.
You know what he says?

1377
01:37:00,304 --> 01:37:02,265
"I'll whack the cocksuckers.
Then they won't beef."

1378
01:37:02,348 --> 01:37:04,642
What kind of attitude is that?

1379
01:37:04,725 --> 01:37:07,979
He does it undermy flag. He uses myname.

1380
01:37:08,062 --> 01:37:09,272
Yougotta understand.

1381
01:37:09,397 --> 01:37:12,858
Sammy brings in 100,000
in cash every month.

1382
01:37:12,942 --> 01:37:16,445
I say stick it up his
ass. I'd rather die broke.

1383
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:19,615
Then what? Bleed my family to
death? We been through this!

1384
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,700
It aggravates me.

1385
01:37:20,783 --> 01:37:22,285
lt aggravatesme!

1386
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:25,788
l can be a billionaire, ifl wanna
be a greedy boss. lt ain 't right.

1387
01:37:25,872 --> 01:37:27,540
That ain 't right. When does itstop?

1388
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:29,834
How much is enough? How
much could Sammy want?

1389
01:37:29,876 --> 01:37:30,877
lf not for his greed...

1390
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,295
you gotta love the guy.

1391
01:37:32,378 --> 01:37:33,337
The guy is down.

1392
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:35,923
What the fuck is this, Rome?

1393
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:39,302
What is this? "All roads lead to Sammy"?

1394
01:37:40,011 --> 01:37:42,763
I agree. Sammy's gotta pull it in.

1395
01:37:42,847 --> 01:37:44,974
I gotta askyou something.

1396
01:37:47,143 --> 01:37:50,521
-Did you ever hear Di B talk subversive?
-Never.

1397
01:37:50,563 --> 01:37:54,400
Who took over Di B's
construction unions? Who?

1398
01:37:58,487 --> 01:37:59,906
Fuckin' Sammy.

1399
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:03,659
It's makin' me sick.

1400
01:38:06,037 --> 01:38:08,039
It's makin' me physically sick.

1401
01:38:09,457 --> 01:38:11,500
I love that guy.

1402
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,586
What am I gonna do? Whack him?

1403
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:15,671
I tell him a million times.

1404
01:38:15,755 --> 01:38:17,548
"Will you slow it down?

1405
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:20,426
You don't have to wind up with every
dime on the plate. Spread some cheer.''

1406
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:21,844
What am I talkin' about?

1407
01:38:21,886 --> 01:38:24,430
The guy whacked out Louie Malito,
Louie Di Bono, Mickey De Batt and Di B.

1408
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:27,099
They're all in business with Sammy.

1409
01:38:27,183 --> 01:38:29,101
And Di B -

1410
01:38:30,478 --> 01:38:33,022
What the fuckdid we do, Frankie?

1411
01:38:33,064 --> 01:38:34,649
The guy was a gentleman.

1412
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:37,193
Who clipped him? Who did the work?

1413
01:38:37,235 --> 01:38:39,362
Who did the work?

1414
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,742
Fuck it.

1415
01:38:46,285 --> 01:38:47,411
Fuck it.

1416
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:51,624
I'll tell you something
else. You want a real circus?

1417
01:38:51,749 --> 01:38:54,377
You set it up for Sammy to
grab everything off the plate.

1418
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,837
Him and the lawyers.
You know what you got?

1419
01:38:56,963 --> 01:38:59,924
You got the Cutler, Shargel
and Fuckstein crime family.

1420
01:38:59,966 --> 01:39:01,926
That fuck. AndCutler...

1421
01:39:02,927 --> 01:39:04,845
he tellsme about Marion.

1422
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:08,266
Twenty-three anda halfhours lockdown.

1423
01:39:09,475 --> 01:39:11,269
One phone call a night.

1424
01:39:12,353 --> 01:39:14,438
Enough food to keep you
alive in an 8-by-7 cage...

1425
01:39:14,564 --> 01:39:16,649
and no one on the goddamn cell block.

1426
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:20,236
I say, "Fuck 'em! I'll die in a cage,
and I'll outlive the motherfuckers."

1427
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:23,072
I'm not leaving some kind
ofa goddamn circus here.

1428
01:39:23,781 --> 01:39:26,534
You hungry? Let's go get some pizza.

1429
01:39:26,617 --> 01:39:28,703
Fuckin' starvin'. Let's get outta here.

1430
01:39:28,786 --> 01:39:30,997
We ain't comin' back, neither.

1431
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,542
I put a hundred in.
What you want from me?

1432
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,627
- A ten. Gimme that.
- Fuckin' ten.

1433
01:39:36,669 --> 01:39:38,629
Come on. We'rejust starting here.

1434
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:40,590
Go ahead.

1435
01:39:40,631 --> 01:39:43,551
- Come on.
- Just play the fuckin' game.

1436
01:39:43,676 --> 01:39:45,303
- A three.
- Three ofdiamonds.

1437
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,347
- Gimme a card!
- Straight. Look at that.

1438
01:39:54,312 --> 01:39:55,313
Okay, let's go!

1439
01:39:57,148 --> 01:39:59,275
The three of you go around the back.

1440
01:40:07,742 --> 01:40:10,244
We're here to arrest Frankie LoCascio...

1441
01:40:10,328 --> 01:40:12,580
Sam Gravano and John Gotti.

1442
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,127
I want everyone else to do
themselves a favor and stay put.

1443
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:19,962
I'll tell you when you can leave.

1444
01:40:22,006 --> 01:40:24,675
- Get outta here.
- What's Gotti being arrested for?

1445
01:40:40,983 --> 01:40:42,944
Didyou everhear DiB talk subversive?

1446
01:40:45,738 --> 01:40:47,114
Never.

1447
01:40:48,866 --> 01:40:50,952
Who took over DiB's construction unions?

1448
01:40:53,746 --> 01:40:55,122
Fuckin'Sammy.

1449
01:40:56,582 --> 01:40:59,126
That makesmesick, 'cause llove theguy.

1450
01:41:00,253 --> 01:41:03,923
llove the guy. And what
am l gonna do? Whack him?

1451
01:41:03,965 --> 01:41:06,842
ltell him a million times,
"Will you slow it down?

1452
01:41:06,926 --> 01:41:10,596
You don't have to windup with every
dime on theplate. Spreadsome cheer. ''

1453
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,140
What am ltalkin'about? The
guy whacked out Louie Malito...

1454
01:41:13,224 --> 01:41:14,684
Louie DiBono, Mickey De Batt and Di B!

1455
01:41:14,725 --> 01:41:17,019
DiB! They're in business with theguy.

1456
01:41:17,061 --> 01:41:21,858
And Di B Theguy, he was
agentleman, for chris sakes.

1457
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:25,361
- Who clipped him? Who did the work?
- Fuckin'Sammy.

1458
01:41:25,444 --> 01:41:27,071
Fuckin'Sammy.

1459
01:41:27,947 --> 01:41:30,366
- lt's making me sick.
- I've heard enough.

1460
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,789
Defendants shall be held without bail.

1461
01:41:36,831 --> 01:41:39,250
I'm also granting the
government's motion...

1462
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:41,711
to disqualify present defense counsel.

1463
01:41:41,794 --> 01:41:44,297
Cutler, Shargel and Pollok
have to be disqualifiied...

1464
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:48,092
because their role as house counsel
was discussed in taped conversations...

1465
01:41:48,175 --> 01:41:53,306
that the prosecution may use
as evidence in this trial.

1466
01:41:53,389 --> 01:41:57,852
Beyond that, there are also
conflict of interest issues...

1467
01:41:57,935 --> 01:42:00,855
because of prior representation
of potential witnesses.

1468
01:42:00,938 --> 01:42:04,859
Therefore, the lawyers could be
called as witnesses in this trial.

1469
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:07,862
The defendants are advised
to appear before me at...

1470
01:42:09,572 --> 01:42:13,201
9:30 a.m., Monday the
23rd, with new counsel.

1471
01:42:13,284 --> 01:42:14,452
Court is adjourned.

1472
01:42:39,435 --> 01:42:41,979
We're gonna have to release
them into the prison population.

1473
01:42:42,063 --> 01:42:44,649
The judge ruled that keeping
them in isolation is punitive.

1474
01:42:44,732 --> 01:42:49,237
Okay. So tell the warden to
put Gravano in with Gotti.

1475
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:52,114
What about LoCascio?

1476
01:42:52,156 --> 01:42:54,116
Doesn't matter. Put him anywhere.

1477
01:42:54,242 --> 01:42:55,743
Sammy's the key.

1478
01:43:07,255 --> 01:43:09,006
What do you say, Sammy?

1479
01:43:15,888 --> 01:43:17,932
How could you say those
things about me, John?

1480
01:43:18,015 --> 01:43:20,351
Tapes are tapes, man.
Don't mean nothing.

1481
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:23,688
I'm talkin', right? I
can fuckin' talk, can't I?

1482
01:43:23,771 --> 01:43:25,189
Yeah, some fuckin' talk.

1483
01:43:25,231 --> 01:43:27,191
You backdoored me...

1484
01:43:27,275 --> 01:43:30,278
while I was your underboss
and I was whackin' guys foryou.

1485
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:34,574
Hey. Get the fuck outta here
with that shit right now.

1486
01:43:34,657 --> 01:43:36,868
You're the one who gets off
whackin' people out, not me.

1487
01:43:36,951 --> 01:43:40,204
You come cryin' to me about Di Bono--
your partner for years, not mine.

1488
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,456
I don't know the man.

1489
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,792
You wanted to whack him.
I said, "Do what you want."

1490
01:43:44,876 --> 01:43:47,253
Same with Louie Malito.

1491
01:43:47,336 --> 01:43:50,923
The same with Scibetta-- your own
brother-in-law, for chrissakes.

1492
01:43:50,965 --> 01:43:53,426
What am I talkin' about?
What about Tommy Spinelli?

1493
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:56,762
Eddie Garafalo? Mickey
whatever-the-fuck-his name was.

1494
01:43:56,846 --> 01:44:01,267
Worst ofall, Di B. You come into a
ton of fuckin' money when Di B went.

1495
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,811
Ton of fuckin' money.
Don't ever deny that.

1496
01:44:03,895 --> 01:44:06,981
- Don't you ever fuckin' deny that.
- Let's not rewrite history here.

1497
01:44:07,064 --> 01:44:08,983
I didn't mind Di B goin'.

1498
01:44:09,066 --> 01:44:11,360
Fuckin' playboy instead
ofa business partner.

1499
01:44:11,444 --> 01:44:14,530
But you wanted it, and when John
Gotti wanted somebody in the ground...

1500
01:44:14,614 --> 01:44:16,699
John Gotti called Sammy Gravano.

1501
01:44:16,782 --> 01:44:18,993
- You barked, I bit, remember?
- "You bit"?

1502
01:44:19,076 --> 01:44:22,163
You pillage this city under my
flag, usin' my name. My name!

1503
01:44:24,165 --> 01:44:26,167
You're a selfiish prick.

1504
01:44:27,752 --> 01:44:30,254
You're greedy is your fuckin' problem.

1505
01:44:30,379 --> 01:44:31,964
This is all my fault now?

1506
01:44:32,048 --> 01:44:34,300
It's not yours, with
all your $2,000 suits...

1507
01:44:34,383 --> 01:44:36,427
and all your front-page
"Dapper Don" shit?

1508
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:39,347
Even your lawyer didn't
know how to pull it in.

1509
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:42,642
You beat the government, you're
supposed to walk away humble.

1510
01:44:42,725 --> 01:44:45,353
You're not supposed to stand in front
of TV cameras crowin' about it...

1511
01:44:45,436 --> 01:44:48,439
'cause it's gonna
come back in your face.

1512
01:44:48,522 --> 01:44:51,067
I got news for you.

1513
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,736
It ain't me on those tapes.

1514
01:44:53,861 --> 01:44:57,114
Truth is, it's your big mouth
that brought this borgata down.

1515
01:44:57,198 --> 01:44:59,700
Let me ask you something.

1516
01:44:59,784 --> 01:45:02,703
If Neil himself come up with
the widow Cirelli's apartment...

1517
01:45:02,745 --> 01:45:05,873
and Joe Watts swept it, how am
I supposed to know it was bugged?

1518
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:10,002
Sammy, what do they got?

1519
01:45:10,086 --> 01:45:12,046
They got some tapes.

1520
01:45:13,089 --> 01:45:16,050
They got no witnesses. They got tapes.

1521
01:45:16,092 --> 01:45:19,595
So, let 'em play the
livin' shit outta the tapes.

1522
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,681
Let 'em leak. I don't give a fuck.

1523
01:45:21,764 --> 01:45:25,101
It's like hearin' the same
song over and over again.

1524
01:45:25,184 --> 01:45:27,895
You play it enough, you
don't hear it no more.

1525
01:45:30,439 --> 01:45:32,191
You hear me?

1526
01:45:32,275 --> 01:45:34,443
All right. Whateveryou say, John.

1527
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:46,706
- What?
- Your friend, Gravano...

1528
01:45:46,747 --> 01:45:48,749
wasjust escorted from the building.

1529
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:50,793
Thought you might like to know.

1530
01:46:12,523 --> 01:46:13,649
Sit.

1531
01:46:17,904 --> 01:46:19,822
I think we all know why we're here.

1532
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:22,408
I've got a lot to offer.

1533
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:26,370
And I got a lot ofconcerns.

1534
01:46:29,624 --> 01:46:31,876
So I'm thinking that
maybe we can make a deal.

1535
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:34,003
What kind ofdeal?

1536
01:46:37,465 --> 01:46:39,425
If I talk, I walk.

1537
01:46:39,467 --> 01:46:41,510
Impossible. You'll have to do time.

1538
01:46:42,803 --> 01:46:45,389
- How much?
- Less than 20.

1539
01:46:45,473 --> 01:46:48,684
And whatever's worked out, we'll
be obliged to inform Gotti's lawyer.

1540
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:51,229
Once that happens, word is out.

1541
01:46:54,565 --> 01:46:56,734
Everything's gonna come
out in the trial, right?

1542
01:46:56,817 --> 01:46:58,152
Everything.

1543
01:46:59,237 --> 01:47:03,032
So when Deborah fiinds out I
killed her brother, 18 others...

1544
01:47:03,074 --> 01:47:04,534
she'll fiile for divorce.

1545
01:47:06,077 --> 01:47:08,079
That part of my life is over.

1546
01:47:08,162 --> 01:47:10,289
So what's your motive, Sammy?

1547
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:12,542
Revenge? Repentance? What?

1548
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:15,002
What are you talkin' about?

1549
01:47:15,044 --> 01:47:17,046
You heard those tapes.

1550
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:20,758
John and I are finished.

1551
01:47:20,841 --> 01:47:23,177
So either I spend the
rest of my life in jail...

1552
01:47:23,261 --> 01:47:25,513
or I'm out on the streets.

1553
01:47:25,596 --> 01:47:27,265
Either way, I'm dead.

1554
01:47:27,306 --> 01:47:30,685
So what kind of information
you have to offer?

1555
01:47:33,604 --> 01:47:35,606
I'll give you the whole Cosa Nostra.

1556
01:47:36,983 --> 01:47:39,068
I'll give you the Paul Castellano hit.

1557
01:47:40,152 --> 01:47:43,531
I'll testify that I personally
fixed the Giacalone jury.

1558
01:47:45,074 --> 01:47:48,119
I'll give you the murders of
Louie Di Bono, Louie Malito...

1559
01:47:48,202 --> 01:47:51,247
Mickey De Batt, Robert Di Bernardo...

1560
01:47:51,372 --> 01:47:54,500
Tommy Spinelli, Willy Boy Johnson...

1561
01:47:55,751 --> 01:47:57,336
a dozen or so more.

1562
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,256
Tommy Sparrow.

1563
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,678
I'll give you the
John O'Connor shooting.

1564
01:48:05,761 --> 01:48:08,306
I'll give you the ins and
outs ofthe Gambino family...

1565
01:48:08,347 --> 01:48:09,807
from upstate New York to Brooklyn.

1566
01:48:09,849 --> 01:48:12,476
Salvatore "Sammythe Bull" Gravano...

1567
01:48:12,518 --> 01:48:15,146
underboss of the notorious
Gambino crime family...

1568
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:19,233
hasagreed to testify against
John Gotti and Frank LoCascio.

1569
01:48:19,317 --> 01:48:21,903
Gravano, himself an admitted killer...

1570
01:48:21,986 --> 01:48:23,946
will expose the vast
criminal enterprise...

1571
01:48:24,071 --> 01:48:25,698
he served for 30 years.

1572
01:48:25,781 --> 01:48:27,783
ln return forhis testimony...

1573
01:48:27,867 --> 01:48:29,827
the government has
charged Mr. Gravano...

1574
01:48:29,911 --> 01:48:31,829
with a single count of racketeering.

1575
01:48:31,954 --> 01:48:34,248
Known as "The Bull" among associates...

1576
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:37,877
Sammy Gravano has been seen for years
in the constant company of Mr. Gotti.

1577
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:41,589
Gravano was said to be
trusted by Gotti completely.

1578
01:48:41,672 --> 01:48:44,550
Federal officials today were elated
at the defection of Mr. Gravano--

1579
01:48:46,093 --> 01:48:48,721
What you got now? You got Sammy.

1580
01:48:51,307 --> 01:48:53,684
What's he doin' with his
life? Where's he goin'?

1581
01:48:54,852 --> 01:48:57,730
You know the Feds,
they see the guy--

1582
01:48:57,813 --> 01:49:00,399
they always smell out the
guy with no parameters.

1583
01:49:00,483 --> 01:49:03,069
They move right in. This
whole RICO statute bullshit...

1584
01:49:03,152 --> 01:49:06,531
is designed for the rats by the rats.

1585
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:08,658
You show me that Wall Street bum.

1586
01:49:08,741 --> 01:49:10,993
He stole billions from the country.

1587
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:15,289
Walked outta the goddamn courtroom
with billions in his back pockets.

1588
01:49:15,414 --> 01:49:17,583
Frankie, you show me the
bum in that chemical company.

1589
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:22,129
In one fuckin' day, this fuck, he kills
5,000 innocent people in an instant.

1590
01:49:23,422 --> 01:49:25,383
Did he do his instant?

1591
01:49:25,466 --> 01:49:28,553
You show me any important thief
in today's business world...

1592
01:49:28,636 --> 01:49:31,097
who's denied his counsel of choice.

1593
01:49:32,223 --> 01:49:34,183
And they fiire my lawyer?

1594
01:49:35,851 --> 01:49:37,812
Is this America?

1595
01:49:40,857 --> 01:49:42,733
We're wops, John.

1596
01:49:42,817 --> 01:49:46,320
We're fools. You know
why? 'Cause we did it.

1597
01:49:46,404 --> 01:49:50,825
We let Sammy into something
that's called "a thing of ours."

1598
01:49:53,077 --> 01:49:54,412
And you know what?

1599
01:49:54,453 --> 01:49:56,622
On my mother I say this:

1600
01:49:56,706 --> 01:49:59,709
Let Sammy have his millions, let
him have his witness protection.

1601
01:49:59,792 --> 01:50:03,045
'Cause every day he's still
gonna wake up to the rat...

1602
01:50:06,841 --> 01:50:08,843
starin' him in the mirror.

1603
01:50:10,845 --> 01:50:12,179
He's gonna have nothin'.

1604
01:50:15,725 --> 01:50:17,727
I'm gonna sit right here...

1605
01:50:19,145 --> 01:50:21,147
and still with me...

1606
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:24,734
there's gonna be Cosa Nostra...

1607
01:50:27,945 --> 01:50:29,906
till I die.

1608
01:50:29,947 --> 01:50:32,241
Thegovernment calls Salvatore Gravano.

1609
01:50:51,761 --> 01:50:53,387
Will you raise your right hand, please?

1610
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:55,306
Put your left hand on the Bible.

1611
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:57,350
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth...

1612
01:50:57,433 --> 01:50:59,936
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1613
01:51:00,019 --> 01:51:01,938
- I do.
- You can sit down.

1614
01:51:03,856 --> 01:51:06,234
Mr. Gravano, do you have a nickname?

1615
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:07,777
Excuse me?

1616
01:51:07,818 --> 01:51:09,862
Do your friends call you Salvatore?

1617
01:51:11,113 --> 01:51:13,658
Would you keep your voice up,
please? That microphone isn't on.

1618
01:51:13,783 --> 01:51:16,160
Do your friends call you Salvatore?

1619
01:51:16,327 --> 01:51:17,662
No.

1620
01:51:17,745 --> 01:51:19,872
What do your friends call you?

1621
01:51:19,956 --> 01:51:20,957
Sammy.

1622
01:51:22,291 --> 01:51:24,794
My friends call me Sammy.

1623
01:51:24,877 --> 01:51:28,714
Sammy, would you describe your
position in the Gambino crime family...

1624
01:51:28,756 --> 01:51:31,926
relative to the defendant, Mr. Gotti?

1625
01:51:32,885 --> 01:51:35,596
He was the boss, and
I was the underboss.

1626
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,723
And did you commit
murder and other crimes...

1627
01:51:37,807 --> 01:51:41,727
as part ofyour association with Mr.
Gotti and the Gambino crime family?

1628
01:51:41,769 --> 01:51:42,979
Yes.

1629
01:51:44,063 --> 01:51:45,982
In addition to Mr. Gotti...

1630
01:51:46,023 --> 01:51:49,318
are there other members ofthe Gambino
crime family in this courtroom--

1631
01:51:53,698 --> 01:51:55,992
The defendants will rise.

1632
01:51:56,075 --> 01:51:58,744
Clerk will read the verdict.

1633
01:51:58,828 --> 01:52:01,539
We, the jury, unanimously
find the defendants...

1634
01:52:01,622 --> 01:52:04,625
John Joseph Gotti and Frank LoCascio...

1635
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:06,961
guilty on all counts.

1636
01:52:12,174 --> 01:52:14,260
Order in the court! Order!

1637
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:17,680
Mr. Gotti...

1638
01:52:17,763 --> 01:52:19,849
having been found
guilty on all counts...

1639
01:52:19,932 --> 01:52:22,143
you are hereby sentenced
to life imprisonment...

1640
01:52:22,226 --> 01:52:24,896
without the possibility of parole.

1641
01:52:24,937 --> 01:52:27,356
The sentence is to be
served in federal prison...

1642
01:52:27,398 --> 01:52:28,941
in the state of Illinois.

1643
01:52:43,831 --> 01:52:45,875
Makesyou think.

1644
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:48,044
Makes you think about
the people in your life...

1645
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:50,880
and l think
of Neil--

1646
01:52:50,963 --> 01:52:53,090
if he was here, what he'd say to me.

1647
01:52:53,174 --> 01:52:55,718
He'd say, "John, what's life about...

1648
01:52:55,801 --> 01:52:58,304
if you don't go through
it as a man's man?''

1649
01:53:01,974 --> 01:53:04,018
He'dsay, "Suckit up, take
the fall, do the time.

1650
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:06,812
That's made you who you are.
That makes you what you are. ''

1651
01:53:06,896 --> 01:53:10,316
How long we been around, this
thing ofours, this Cosa Nostra?

1652
01:53:10,441 --> 01:53:12,276
120 years.

1653
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,780
What's it about? lt's
about rules. Parameters.

1654
01:53:16,989 --> 01:53:19,450
You take the beatin' for the
friend. You don't lay down.

1655
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:22,036
You don't betray who
you are, what you are.

1656
01:53:33,089 --> 01:53:35,633
You gotta rememberAngie,
my brother Gene, JoeyD'Mig.

1657
01:53:35,716 --> 01:53:37,927
They don't roll. They're
doin' a thousand years now.

1658
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:39,929
They don't rat. Why? That's the rule.

1659
01:53:40,012 --> 01:53:41,973
You don't break. You don't rat.

1660
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,538
They want me to be something
l wasn 't even born to be.

1661
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:09,166
Humble. Okay, so you humble me.

1662
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,919
What you got now? You got a war.

1663
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:15,339
You got global war. You got a
worldwide crime syndicate now.

1664
01:54:15,423 --> 01:54:18,259
There's no rules. There's no parameters.

1665
01:54:18,301 --> 01:54:19,760
There's no feelings.

1666
01:54:22,179 --> 01:54:24,223
There's no feelings for this country.

1667
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:32,064
So, five, ten years from now...

1668
01:54:32,148 --> 01:54:34,358
they gonna wish there
was American Cosa Nostra.

1669
01:54:36,986 --> 01:54:38,988
Five, ten years from now...

1670
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:44,160
they're gonna miss John Gotti.
