1
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,664
Ah! Damn!

2
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,134
Just once I wish they would
discover diamonds in Hawaii.

3
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,470
[Laughing]

4
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,713
Hustle it, Tanner!

5
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,149
Tanner, get outta there!

6
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,150
Let's go you guys.

7
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,450
Let's go!

8
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,585
[Work horn]

9
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,586
Come on!

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,890
[Work horn]

11
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,800
They got some environmentalist
showing up from Washington,

12
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,768
And I sure as hell
don't want her to see

13
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,905
The way of setting
explosives below
the aquifer.

14
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,874
You set?

15
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,743
Let her rip, Tyee!

16
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,578
Fire in the hole!

17
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,381
[Beeping]

18
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,184
[Explosion]

19
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:36,889
Alright, let's go!

20
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:48,202
Alright, everybody, listen up!

21
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,470
The truckers are going
to make one more run!

22
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,806
But there's a bonus for
everyone if we get this process

23
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,309
Before our friend
from Washington arrives.

24
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,643
[Laughter]

25
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,911
You are talking my language,
boss.

26
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,180
Whoa!

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,714
Tanner?

28
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:02,816
What the hell just happened?

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,886
Must have fallen.

30
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,556
Tanner, where's Tanner?

31
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,400
Get rescue down here now!

32
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,902
Now, damn it!!!!

33
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,536
Come on Kruger, it's breakup.

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,240
You know I can't send
a truck up that road.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,376
It's 34 degrees!

36
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,512
Ice melts at 32!

37
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,525
Thanks for the lift.

38
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,523
So 44 huh?

39
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,394
Just had to get one
more run in, didn't ya?

40
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,527
A guys gotta make
a living.

41
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,430
Yeah, yeah, save it.

42
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,531
[Laughing]

43
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,535
44 flip-flops each.

44
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,537
Makes it a tie for top dog,
Jack!

45
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,439
There's never been
a tie before.

46
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,440
First time for everything.

47
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,508
Uh-huh.

48
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,742
Come on, let's get paid.

49
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,512
You're killing me,
you know that, don't you?

50
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,420
Fine, fine, I'll see
what I can do.

51
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,489
Just hang tight.

52
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,457
Damn it!

53
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,970
Your name is on this thing
five times, Jack.

54
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,572
This was supposed
to be my year.

55
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,510
You know, the Japanese say
a tie is better than a win.

56
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,514
I'm not Japanese and this
sure ain't no geisha house.

57
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,451
Alright, before you rush off
to cash these

58
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,453
At the first bank you see
in Fairbanks,

59
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,786
I need one more delivery.

60
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,988
(All): Aww!!!!

61
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,857
Come on, Sparkman,
hand them over.

62
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,460
I got a hot date tonight with
this Swedish little seat-cover

63
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,360
You ever saw.

64
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,862
She calls me every day.

65
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,931
Yeah, it's his mom.
He's late on the rent.

66
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,533
[Laughter]

67
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,769
Listen, Kruger is desperate
for enough explosives

68
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,471
To hold him over 'till the
first boat gets through.

69
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,840
Explosives?

70
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,073
I wouldn't hold manure
through that slush.

71
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,475
You can count me out.

72
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,644
Count me out.

73
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,579
Come on.

74
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,027
Triple rate.

75
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,597
Come on, triple?

76
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,864
Take it or leave it,
Sparky.

77
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,568
Triple rate.

78
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,478
Jack, I need two rigs.

79
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,514
One more flip-flop makes me
top dog, Jack.

80
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,550
Triple rate, huh?

81
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,525
Just kill ya if I won this,
wouldn't it?

82
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,527
What do you say, Jack?

83
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,663
I say I'm a poor trucker
with alimony payments.

84
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,899
You got yourself
another rig.

85
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,866
Now you're talking.

86
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:18,739
One more convoy of 20 tons
of kaboom, my friend.

87
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,874
Don't get nervous
on me now...

88
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,643
Huh?

89
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,814
[Laughs]

90
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,662
I am going in.

91
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,864
Need light and steady.

92
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,039
Hang in there Tanner!

93
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,907
Coming down!

94
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:08,188
[Growls]

95
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,890
Holy Mother!!!

96
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,828
Run! Everybody run!!!!

97
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,866
Run! Go go!!!

98
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:24,637
[Growls]

99
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,240
Go, go!!!

100
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,683
Bombshell!!!

101
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,150
Radio for help!!!

102
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,686
I'll get the explosives!!

103
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,319
Can you move?!

104
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,689
Yeah!

105
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:47,827
[Growls]

106
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,231
[Screaming]

107
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,059
Okay, but no promises.

108
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,827
I appreciate your assistance.

109
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,295
Everybody appreciates.

110
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,832
You should appreciate crapping
on my already crappy day.

111
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,737
Welcome to my world.

112
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,274
[Screaming]

113
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,309
[Distant screams]

114
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:43,015
[Growls]

115
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,118
Mr. Kruger, thank god!

116
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,254
Get outta my way!

117
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,026
[Roar]

118
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,928
Ugh!!!!!!

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,868
Please... I don't want to die.

120
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,672
You're already dead.

121
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,907
Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!

122
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,723
What the hell is
that thing?!

123
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,325
Wentshu!

124
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,128
Wentshu!!!

125
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,665
I got keys,
I got keys!!!

126
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:44,712
[Gagging sounds]

127
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,047
Anybody call for help!

128
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,419
No!

129
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,757
Go, go, go!!!!

130
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,425
Go, go, go!!!!

131
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,163
Come on, let me in!!

132
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,664
It's Kruger!!!

133
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,235
Let me in!!!!!!

134
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,749
You two make a break
for it.

135
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,185
I'll keep it busy.

136
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,086
You mean we let it eat
you while we run away?!

137
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,722
You don't get it, we
don't have a choice.

138
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,258
We need to get help now!

139
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,694
Go!

140
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,744
Hey! Haven't you loaded
up yet?

141
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,945
I hate hauling this stuff.

142
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,749
When it's on the trailer,
it's all dead weight to me.

143
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,751
Oh, god, that reminds me.

144
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,753
I knew this guy
in Oregon once,

145
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,823
Who was hauling this load of
explosives to this strip mine,

146
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,859
If this story ends with a bang,
spare me, will ya?

147
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,526
Oh, Jack, all my stories
end with a bang.

148
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,196
That's what makes them
so interesting.

149
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,966
Jack, got a hitchhiker
for you.

150
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,901
A what?

151
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,036
Rachel Harris.

152
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,436
Well, hello, Rachel.

153
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,307
I'm Neil Conroy, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

154
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,174
What's this about?

155
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,876
Some congressional
committee is demanding

156
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:28,514
An environmental assessment
of Arctic breeze.

157
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,283
So you're what...
a scientist?

158
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,052
Research analyst
actually.

159
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,386
Oooh.

160
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,889
Now, that's what I call
tax dollars at work.

161
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,290
She gets a ride up
there today

162
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,027
Or they're shutting
the mine down.

163
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,528
Oh, you're gonna love
the Arctic breeze doc.

164
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,230
It's got the charm of
a Siberian Gulag.

165
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,866
Why can't she take
the chopper?

166
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,199
Chopper is down, Jack.

167
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,537
Well, in that case you
never mind them, doc.

168
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,204
I'll be your chauffeur today.

169
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,206
Here, let me take
your bag for you.

170
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,145
You're riding with him, lady?

171
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,882
A trailer full of explosives
are the least of your worries.

172
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,383
You just shut your pie hole.

173
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,119
Honestly, ma'am, I'm a southern
gentleman.

174
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,988
Fine, she's all yours then.

175
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,055
You all set doc?

176
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,290
Let me give you the tour.

177
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,457
Now, if you come with me,

178
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,959
Let me introduce you
to my rig.

179
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,161
We got hot water, tunes.

180
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,162
Bye, bye Jack.

181
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,464
Have a good trip.

182
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,136
Well, welcome aboard doc.

183
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,406
This is my home away
from home here.

184
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,007
Nice.

185
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,010
Oh, yeah. She's a
nice '96 Peterbilt

186
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:36,048
With a big can 4-350,
got 3-90's and one
sweet air ride.

187
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,183
I have no idea
what you just said,

188
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,451
But I'll take your word
for it.

189
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,187
[Laughs]

190
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,525
She's also got 18 speed
floor transmission.

191
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,027
You know what that means?

192
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,395
No.

193
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,963
It means she may take
a little while,

194
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,999
But once she gets
warmed up

195
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,968
Oh, boy, she'll give you
one smooth ride

196
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,971
If you know what I mean.

197
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,840
Listen...
You're a smart gal,
aren't you?

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,976
Yeah.

199
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,177
Me too.

200
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,546
I lied, I'm a Pisces.

201
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,416
Me too.

202
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,484
[Laughs]

203
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,953
I'll tell you what, doc,
tours not over.

204
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,424
I've got a whole big bedroom
back here.

205
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,994
Comfy mattress,
tons of videos,

206
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,464
Actually on second thought you
might not be into those videos.

207
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,035
I got satellite TV though,
HBO.

208
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,972
Appealing.

209
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,515
Want to give a lady a lift?

210
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,985
You know, you don't need
to worry about Neil.

211
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,488
He's all talk,
absolutely harmless.

212
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,991
I rode up here on a gravel
hauler with a teamster

213
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,525
That would not shut up.

214
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,261
I haven't really slept
in 24 hours.

215
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,363
So I could really use some...

216
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,266
Quiet.

217
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:00,900
You mind?

218
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,137
No, come on up.

220
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,054
Jack, you old dog!

221
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,458
You're one lucky suicide
jockey, you know that? 10-4.

222
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,997
Suicide jockey, huh?

223
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,500
That's a trucker's talk for
a driver hauling explosives.

224
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,934
Nice.

225
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,176
Hey doc,

226
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,279
Next 300 miles
there's nothing between us

227
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,748
And the cold blue sea except
a couple of feet of ice.

228
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,718
[Laughs]

229
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,289
Don't worry,
it's not that soft.

230
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,423
Don't listen to him, doc,
he's plenty soft.

231
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,189
You think someone got
a call out for help?

232
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,159
Wentshu took down
the satellite uplink.

233
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,461
That's the second time
I heard you call it that.

234
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,265
Wentshukumishiteu.

235
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,166
What are you talking about?

236
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,269
It's an Inuit legend.

237
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:21,274
Lives under the ice
and feeds on human flesh.

238
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,241
Wentshu.

239
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,478
No freaking legend
is taking me alive.

240
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,482
If it comes to it or us,
okay?

Is this your daughter?

248
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,144
Yeah.

249
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,744
Are you married?

250
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,415
Divorced?

251
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,389
Messy, huh?

252
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,294
I thought you wanted
to sleep.

253
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,397

to make conversation.

255
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,624
What was that?

256
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,827
Hold on.

257
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,639
Are we turning around?

258
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,310
No, not when they're
paying triple we're not.

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,948
What do you say,
top dog?

260
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,451
Follow me
and stay close.

263
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,772
Open your door.

264
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,474
What?
Open your door.

265
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,308
If I tell you to jump you
do and ask no questions.

266
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,944
Okay.

267
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,646
Hold on.

Come on now.

269
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,431
I got your back.

Come on.

Come on, baby.

Yeah, we're good.

Welcome to life
on the ice road.

279
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,426
If I lost my rig,

280
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,796
You'd be hearing from
my insurance company.

281
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,966
Yeah, you wish, cowboy.

282
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:02,354
There really is nothing
out there, is there?

283
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,424
Well, not completely.

284
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,758
Do you want a coffee?

285
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,095
Don't tell me
there's a Starbucks.

286
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,963
Better.
Lowman's.

Beryl.

The best Java
for 300 miles.

291
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,943
Is that because it's the only
Java for 300 miles.

292
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,446

293
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,416

someday.

No thanks.

295
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,457
I don't plan on spending
too much time on the ice road.

296
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,860
Yeah, I said that
once too.

297
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,709
Hey Jack, gate is up.

298
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,517
That's weird.

They don't get
their explosives,

303
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,162
They just take
the day off?

304

No... this is something else.

is the first response team?

It's Reid.

it was just a myth,

Can you walk?

Let's get outta here before
whatever that thing is returns.

You're gonna be fine,
alright?

is that thing?

I told you...
it's Wentshu.

What's the story?

367
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:39,385
It moves under rock, ice,
and on land and it eats...

368
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,990
What?

369
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,191
Us.

370
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:51,430
I saw it take Tanner
Krem, Reid.

371
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:54,801
Kruger too.

372
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,436
[Roars]

373
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:00,171
[Whispers]
It's crisscrossing
back and forth out there.

374
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,342
It can't see us...

375
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,881
Where did this thing
come from?

376
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,882
We set our charges deeper
into the permafrost

377
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,986
Than ever before.

378
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,123
The charge unearthed a ton
of high-grade diamonds.

379
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:22,160
It grabbed Tanner,
crawled out of the pit

380
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,831
And went wild.

381
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,505
[Loud roars]

382
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,248
Okay, okay.

383
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,421
So what do we do?

384
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,423
How did you survive?

385
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,927
I hid under this blanket.

386
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:59,097
The thermal blanket.

387
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,232
Kept me warm.

388
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,102
Well most of me.

389
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:09,941
[Roars]

390
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,450
Jack we can't stay
here, okay?

391
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,086
This thing is going
to find us.

392
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,991
[Truck engine starting]

393
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,927
Oh, my god,
that's my rig.

394
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,130
Someone just
started up my rig!

395
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,132
At least we know
we're not alone.

396
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,936
Alright, we're going to have
to make a run for it.

397
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:41,206
[Loud growls]

398
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,009
You ready?

399
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,912
Okay, now!!

400
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:48,079
Come on!!!

401
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,000
Come on! Come on!!!

402
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,337
Go, go, go!!!!

403
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,439
Nice of you to join
the party, Kruger!!!

404
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,973
Move over!

405
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,110
Go... Go... Go.

406
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,179
Good idea.

407
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,422
Alright.

408
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,398
Come on, baby.

409
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,069
Come on! Come on!!!
Come on!!!!

410
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,440
What the hell are
you doing?

411
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,050
Son of a bitch,
follow me!!

412
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:01,920
That's it!

413
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,057
Follow me,
leave them alone.

414
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,995
The road's that way.

415
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,429
Not leaving them behind.

416
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,431
This might be
our only chance!

417
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,432
Give me the wheel!!!

418
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,201
Shut up and sit down!!!!!!

419
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,439
I can't see him,
where is he?

420
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,140
I don't know!

421
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,021
I don't see it,
I don't see it!

422
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:38,724
Oh, geeze!

423
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:46,965
I think we lost it!

424
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,570
What the hell was
that thing?

425
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,672
I don't know.

426
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,645
Neil, I think we lost it.

427
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,646
Let's get the hell out
of here!

428
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,981
We're right behind you!

429
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,650
Kruger's with me!

430
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,153
He's seen better days,
but he'll make it!

431
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,722
Kruger's alive?

432
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,091
[Laughs]

433
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,199
I think we could go faster
if you unhook the trailer?

434
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,535
I'm not stopping until
there's a hundred miles
between us.

435
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:27,638
You don't understand...
It will never give up...

436
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:48,459
It will follow...

437
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,630
Unless that thing can do 45
miles an hour on the ice road,

438
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,133
It's not going to bother
us again.

439
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,607
Why is Neil pulling ahead?

440
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,777
Come on Neil,
give it more gas.

441
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,081
Come on Jack,
come on.

442
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,587
You okay back there?

443
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:20,792
Neil, I think we blew out
a couple tires.

444
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,828
I'll slow down so you can
keep up...

445
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,665
Slow down...
are you crazy?

446
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,533
Maybe you're used to
abandoning your men,

447
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,868
But I'm not leaving
him behind.

448
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,104
He needs my help!!!

449
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,740
Listen to me, what we need
is to get to Lowman's

450
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,741
He's got a ham radio.

451
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,874
We can call for help.

452
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,876
Jack can take care of
himself.

453
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,113
I'm not leaving him behind!!!

454
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,881
You don't like it,
feel free to walk!

455
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:47,186
Don't wait for us.
Get to Lowman's
and call for help.

456
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:53,491
Not leaving you behind, buddy,
I'll keep pace with you.

457
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:58,730
That cowboy doesn't know
what's good for him.

458
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,800
What would you do if
the situation was reversed?

459
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:03,168
Wentshu...

460
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,536
Wentshu...

461
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,405
Try to rest, okay?

462
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,175
You think he could
be right?

463
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:13,179
Some kind of
Inuit legend?

464
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,745
I don't know.

465
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,815
It looked like a pliosaur
to me.

466
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,185
What, like a dinosaur?

467
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,852
Yeah.

468
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:25,823
In 2008, a Norwegian team of
scientists found a large skull

469
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,859
In the Arctic.

470
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:32,164
It had teeth 12-inches long.
No one seen anything like it.

471
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:37,169
They think it's the largest
marine predator that ever lived.

472
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:40,206
This give a name
to this thing?

473
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,408
Predator X.

474
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,478
[Loud noise]

475
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,580
Jack...
What the hell was that?

476
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,756
[Loud roars]

477
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,924
Nooooo!!!!!!!!!!

478
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,958
Noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

479
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:04,929
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

480
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:08,934
Stay back.

481
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,940
Oh my god!!!!

482
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,909
He just took him!!!!

483
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,849
[Loud roars]

484
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,784
Hold on! Hold on!!!

485
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,877
Fire!!!!!!!!

486
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:54,913
Fire!!!!!!!!!!!

487
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:55,946
What?!

488
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:59,950
We're on fire!!!!!!

489
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,220
Neil, we're on fire and
the thing is back!!!!!!

490
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,860
Yeah, I gotcha in
my mirrors.

491
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,928
You're lit up like a roman
candle, Jack!

492
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,664
Coming to get you, buddy!
Get ready to bail out.

493
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,900
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to him.

494
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,771
Jack knows what's right.
We have to warn others...

495
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,409
Trucker's don't
abandon truckers.
Going flaps down.

496
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,547
It's okay, it's okay.

497
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,882
You get ready to bail him out
when I pull up alongside.

498
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,899
Get ready to jump!
Cross my lap, come on!!!

499
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,538
When I say jump,
jump, alright!!

500
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,847
I got you!!!

501
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,280
What about you?

502
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,550
I'll be right behind you.

503
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,951
Hand!

504
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,020
Come on!!!
Don't worry, I'll catch you!!!!

505
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:12,957
Come on!
I'll catch you!!!

506
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,926
Come on, come on!!!

507
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,734
Come on!

508
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,036
Jump!

509
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:28,840
Jump!!!

510
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,980
Jump now!!!

511
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,519
Come on!!!!

512
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,958
Jack!

513
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,929
Jack!

514
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,003
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

515
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,806
Jack, nooooooo!!!!!!!!!

516
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,340
Did you get him?
It's too late!

517
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,609
Let's go! Let's go!

518
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,912
Nooooo! Jack!

519
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,882
Come on!!!!

520
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,689
Get in!

521
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,391
Noooo!!!!!!

522
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,928
I'm right here!

523
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,535
Jack, you're amazing!

524
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,701
Jack!!!

525
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,972
Good to see you again,
Jack.

526
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,807
Thanks.

527
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,976
Thanks for coming back.

528
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,378
Anytime.

529
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,683
You okay?

530
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,684
Yeah.

531
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,521
You?

532
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,989
Let me see.

533
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,658
Does it hurt?

534
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,859
A little bit.

535
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,127
I didn't know truckers
had such a low
tolerance for pain.

536
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,730
[Laughs]

537
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,799
I guess I owe you a beer.

538
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,935
I think you owe him
a six-pack.

539
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,638
You know what they say,
old truckers never die.

540
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,140
No, they just get
a new Peterbilt.

541
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,518
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

542
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,019
Why aren't' we going faster?

543
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,522
We'll jackknife.

544
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:27,025
We can't drive faster than
30 with that trailer.

545
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,693
Hang on, Doc.

546
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,161
You're about see the
fastest trailer drop

547
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,097
In trucking history.

548
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:42,773
Great!!!!!!!

549
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,010
Perfect!! Just perfect!!!!!

550
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,952
It's completely frozen!!!

551
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,854
Alright, let's see what
we knock loose.

552
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:22,147
Back there at the mine
I left Tyee all alone.

553
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:26,217
I hid while he was out there,
all alone...

554
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,020
Defenseless.

555
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,221
I heard him calling out,

556
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:35,093
I heard his voice
asking for help...

557
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,663
I could have
done something.

558
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,931
I should have
done something.

559
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,535
Survival is a strong
instinct.

560
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,670
Let me tell you something,

561
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,538
It had nothing to do
with survival,

562
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:49,274
It was fear,
plain and simple.

563
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,211
Sure, I saved myself,
but what about my men.

564
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,880
They were good men.

565
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,683
I worked with a lot of them
most of my life.

566
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:02,520
Good men with families
and I let them down.

567
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,925
And then when I saw
your trucks...

568
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,293
If I could have gotten
that truck started...

569
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,662
I would have left.
That's right.

570
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,633
I would have gotten away as far
as possible from the mine...

571
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:21,106
From that thing...

572
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,142
What Neil did back there...

573
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,112
Saving you guys...

574
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,681
I would never have
come back for you.

575
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,757
The ice, it's...

576
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,227
It's not the ice...

577
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,062
It's something underneath it.

578
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,864
What?
We've got to get
out of here, now!!

579
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,199
Run!!!!!!!

580
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,769
Run!!!!

581
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,170
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

582
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,739
Nooooo!!!!!!!!!

583
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:58,176
Come on, let's go! Noooo!!!

584
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:01,179
He's gone, he's gone!!!!!!

585
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,981
Come on, get in!!!!

586
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,119
Go, go, go!

587
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,717
Damn it!

588
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,351
Tail end's still dragging
like it's knee-deep in mud.

589
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,754
We didn't disconnect.

590
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:44,890
Hook-up must be iced over.

591
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,291
What if you swerve
from side-to-side

592
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:49,661
Wouldn't that make
the trailer drop.

593
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:50,896
Good thinking doc.

594
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,964
We'll make a trucker
out of you yet.

595
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,894
Look like our friend
wants to play.

596
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:23,928
You gotta be kidding me!

597
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,930
Won't this thing
give up?!

598
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:29,066
We're the only food source
for about 100 miles.

599
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,838
Well, guess who's coming
for dinner.

600
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,776
Let's see who
blinks first.

601

[Truck horn]

602
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,714

[Laughing]

608
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,228
Now that's some driving!

609
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,503
We've got to rid
of that trailer.

610
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,881
It's Alamo time.

611
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:51,115
Keep it in gear.

612
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,550
I'll break the ice
off the hitch,

613
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,551
As soon as the trailer's
free you go!

614
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:55,986
You don't wait for me.

615
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,256
We're not going
to leave you.

616
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,190
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

617
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,293
Same goes for me,
buddy.

618
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,844
Jack!!!!!!!!

619
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,482
We gotta go!!!

620
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:59,384
Go, go!!!!!!

621
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,227
Get in the snow.
What?

622
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,229
Get in the snow.

[Snarls and growls]

624
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,505
Doc...

625
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,644
That was close.

626
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,382
Jack!

627
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,316
Where's Jack?

628
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:14,658
Jack!

629
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,936
Jack, are you alright?

630
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,304
Are you okay?

631
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,640
Yeah, I'm fine.

[Loud roars]

633
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:39,584
Four more payments and it
would have been all mine.

634

You have insurance,
right?

635
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,589
Not sure if I took the
prehistoric monster coverage.

636
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,525
Let's get outta here before
it remembers we're here.

637
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,061
Lowman's is a few miles
away, let's go.

638
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,087
It shouldn't be too
much further.

639
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,376
We need to rest.

640
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:43,347
We can't, Rachel we can't.

641
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,449
If we stay here we're dead,
alright?

642
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,717
Either from hypothermia
or that thing out there.

643
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:50,387
Rachel, listen to me
please get up!!!

644
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,290
I need you to get up.

645
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,426
I need you to dig deep and find
something to live for.

That's deep, Jack.

649
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,736
Besides Doc, you don't want
our little friend back there

650
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,737
To see you down,
do you?

651
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:10,375
Come on, I'm freezing!!

652
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,728
What about you?

653
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,765
What's your reason?

654
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,669
Is it your daughter?

655
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,171
Maybe.

656
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,509
Do you ever see her?

657
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:52,617
Every summer for one week.

658
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,187
That's not very much.

659
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,189
No, it's not.

660
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:00,524
Why'd you leave?

661
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,060
What are you doing
all the way up here?

662
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,733
I was having trouble
making ends meet.

663
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,237
Supporting myself and...

664
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,672

child support payments.

Lost my house.

666
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,379
Sold pretty well everything
I owned, my rig.

667

Environmental regulations,
price of fuel,

668
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,753
I was barely
holding on to that.

669
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:32,323
One day, a friend of mine
tells me about the ice road.

670

Says it pays
the big bucks.

671
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,494

I'll get out of town,

it for a few seasons

my feet.

I got nothing to go back to.

You don't know that unless
you go back, do you?

he's gonna be there?

00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,542

00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,482
You look like
death warmed over.

732
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,551
Come on, let's
get you inside.

733
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,420
Where are your trucks?

734
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,455
We need to call for help.

735
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,557
Something attacked the mine.

736
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,758
Let's get you inside.
Go inside.

737
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,495
Alright.

738
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,630
Lowman, it's some kind
of creature.

739
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,433
What's that you say?

740
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,834
Lowman, come on, let's
get that water boiling.

741
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,452
Lowman why don't you call
for the chopper.

742
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:58,456
Let's get these folks
out of here.

743
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,690
What the hell are
you guys doing?

744
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,360
Close these curtains
and stay out of sight.

745
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,529
There's something out there.

746
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:06,796
Is the back door locked.

747
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:09,466
Bolted.

748
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,102
This is Lowman, we need
a chopper.

749
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:18,542
[Static sounds]

750
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,478
Let me try.

751
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,946
Hello? Hello?

752
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:25,483
Beryl here, I got us
an emergency...

753
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,452
[Static sounds]

754
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:28,619
It's the aurora.

755
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,622
Plays havoc
with the radio.

756
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:38,963
You said you guys were attacked
by something?

757
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,631
Destroyed the mine,
my rig...

758
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,132
Jack's too.

759
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:47,071
Tyee said it was
a Went-shu.

760
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,508
A Wentshu?

761
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,510
Come on, Beryl.

762
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,644
It's just an ol' Eskimo
legend.

763
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,681
Inuit. It's an Inuit legend.

764
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,115
Same thing.
What do you know?

765
00:56:58,147 --> 00:56:59,984
I have been living here
50 years

766
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,519
And I've never seen one.

767
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:06,089
[Rumbling sounds]

768
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,558
It's here.

769
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,650
How big is this thing?

770
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:36,587
Big enough.

771
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:38,187
Everyone hold
still.

772
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,535
You got a gun?

773
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:53,638
Gun, do you have a gun!!!!

774
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:56,607
Yeah, yeah, right here.

775
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,960
Come on, Jack,
we're not talking about
a coyote here.

776
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,662
I took down a black bear
with that thing once.

777
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,231
It was a cub with a limp.

778
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,300
Fiercest creature
you ever saw.

779
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:24,802
You don't understand.

780
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,606
Nothing stops a Wentshu

781
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,608
Not once it has
a human's scent.

782
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,742
Nothing.

783
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,979
Well, I'm sure as hell
going to try.

784
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,989
Neil, check the upstairs
window.

785
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,891
Great idea.

786
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,259
You don't have to worry.

787
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:52,630
I built this place
with my own hands.

788
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,632
Nothing's going to get in here.
We're safe.

789
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,634
Listen to you, the big hero.

790
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,636
Do you remember the storm
two seasons ago?

791
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,204
We had ten tons of snow...

792
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,639
Six tons.

793
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,642
On that roof
and we were fine.

794
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:06,243
This thing is a little
bigger than that.

795
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,645
[Roars]

796
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:09,646
Maybe we should
just hold up here

797
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,980
Until someone comes through.

798
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,649
Maybe you haven't
noticed, Doc.

799
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,952
That ice road is
melting out there.

800
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,121
Someone's gonna notice
if they don't hear
from the mine.

801
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,655
Someone's going to come
investigate.

802
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,658
We got food enough.

803
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,660
If we have to, we can wait
for first boat.

804
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,162
I am not waiting
for no boat, alright?

805
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,364
Neil's right.
We can't wait here.
We gotta go.

806
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:29,667
Wait, what are we all
complaining about?

807
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,201
I got a truck out there.

808
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,671
Two key words:

809
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,673
Out... There!

810
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:37,642
But it's close.

811
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,644
Not close enough.

812
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:58,327
[Loud roars]

813
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:03,233
Is it there?

814
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,102
Yeah, it's there.

815
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,804
I want to see it.

816
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,205
I've heard these stories
all my life.

817
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:18,381
[Roars]

818
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:24,154
Holy!

819
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,889
Believe us now?

820
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,202
My grandfather was right!

821
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:41,205
Lowman, that is a Wentshu.
The man-eater.

822
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,908
Just like the legend says.

823
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:49,112
Still think that little popgun
is going to do the job?

824
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,915
Eskimo mumbo jumbo.

825
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,282
Inuit.

826
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,383
I told you Inuit.

827
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:57,287
I have an idea.

828
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:01,191
I'd love to hear it.

829
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,660
Remember the blanket
and the snow?

830
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,195
It couldn't see.

831
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,465
I think it's vision is based on
some kind of thermal imaging.

832
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,301
It can only see heat.

833
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,070
Like warm bodies

834
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,303
Yeah.

835
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,205
We can use that to create
a diversion.

836
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,440
And then run to
the truck.

837
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:19,243
Sounds like a plan.

838
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,211
So how do we do it?

839
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:22,847
We have to wait.

840
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,248
We can't go at night,
it's too cold.

841
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,250
We'd be too easy
to find us.

842
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,919
We'll wait until morning.

843
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,220
Hate to break it to you, Doc,

844
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:31,922
But it doesn't get
too warm around here.

845
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,223
Not even during
the day time.

846
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,958
Every little bit will count.

847
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,160
Then we'll wait
until sunrise.

848
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:58,447
And then I'm going to stab
it right through the heart.

849
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,285
Where do you suppose
the heart is on that thing, doc?

850
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:05,755
Forget the heart,
aim for the eye.

851
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,357
Yeah, he's probably right.

852
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,093
If this thing survived
under the pressure

853
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:13,030
Of tons of rock and permafrost
for who knows how long

854
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,199
Just imagine how
thick its skin is?

855
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,101
Fine.

856
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,069
The eye it is.

857
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32,817
You should talk to him.

858
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,484
What do you mean?

859
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,921
Don't give me that.

860
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,523
I might be stuck here
looking after this old dump,

861
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,961
Doesn't mean I don't remember
what it's like to fall in love.

862
01:02:46,595 --> 01:02:49,266
Believe it or not, he was
once the most dashing,

863
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:54,070
Charming man in town.

864
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:59,175
The idea of going up to him
terrified me.

865
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,011
But I knew if I was going
to make him mine...

866
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:05,282
I just have to do it.
And you know what?

867
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,918
Not a day goes by that
I don't thank the stars

868
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,554
I took that chance.

869
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,496
Jack's a good man.

870
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,132
And you might not get
a chance later.

871
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,202
Go on.

872
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,094
This'll keep you awake.

873
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,195
Thank you.

874
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,631
I told you, best coffee
for 300 miles.

875
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:59,036
Of course it's the only coffee
for 300 miles.

876
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,837
[Laugh]

877
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,275
Thanks by the way.

878
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,612
For what?

879
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:12,182
Saving my life back there.

880
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:15,252
As I recall, you saved
mine a couple times too.

881
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,631
Who knew a bunch of
colliding charged particles

882
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:31,668
Could be so beautiful.

883
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:37,206
The Cree call it "the
Dance of the Spirits".

884
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,676
Dance of the Spirits.

885
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:44,081
I like that.

886
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:10,139
What brought you
up here?

887
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:13,576
A gravel hauler.

888
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,179
That's not what I meant.

889
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:17,680
Nobody comes up here
to the edge of the world

890
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:21,986
Without being pushed.

891
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,955
I was pushed.

892
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:29,058
A guy?

893
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:32,195
Yeah.

894
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:36,200
It was my career or him.

895
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,235
He lost?

896
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:44,173
You might say he won.

897
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:50,246
You know Alaska is
kind of the last stop
for social misfits.

898
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:55,652
After the lower 48,
there is no other place to go.

899
01:05:55,684 --> 01:06:02,092
So it kind of makes us
kindred spirits.

900
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:05,062
You think so?

901
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:08,098
I hope so.

902
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:21,211
I came up here because
I wanted to get away
from anything

903
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:28,451
And anyone I knew.

904
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,789
I just figured if I didn't
know anyone,

905
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:37,094
No one would hurt me.

906
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:43,232
I could just disappear.

907
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:46,802
There is something
about living up here,

908
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:51,541
Isolated from the rest
of the world

909
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:56,146
Forces you to learn how
to live with yourself.

910
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,247
Alone...

911
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:02,818
Survive...

912
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:07,790
The only problem is
sometimes you learn
that lesson too well

913
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:11,661
And you forget
what it means...

914
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,331
To have other people
in your life.

915
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:26,110
I think I am starting
to remember.

916
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:29,779
Me too.

917
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:57,207
Alright, I am clear
on this side.

918
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,784
Here.

919
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,252
Try this.

920
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,254
Thank you.

921
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:16,125
When I start the truck,
you three come running.

922
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,795
Don't give it too much gas.

923
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,165
I'll be careful.

924
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,565
You better.

925
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,834
I ain't running
this place by myself.

926
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:31,208
Ready?

927
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,177
Yeah.

928
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:38,148
Now!

929
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,190
Once you start it,
put it in gear.

930
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:48,692
It's gonna take a while
to warm up.

931
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,194
He doc, I am going
to light you up.

932
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:04,140
Hopefully the heat
from this distracts it.

I'm working on it!

No!

943
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,754

01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,872
It's gone.

951
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,341
You go help Jack.

952
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:46,843
I'll find him.

Jack, Jack, Jack!!

954
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:54,518
Can you hear me?!

955
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,885
We got to get him inside!!!

956
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,888
Come on, buddy.

957
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:02,759
Get the spark.

01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:49,839
I thought I lost you.

You can't get rid of me
that easy.

966
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,816
Where's Lowman?

I gotta help.

971
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:14,831
I can't see Beryl anywhere.

972
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,500
I am going to go find her.
No, no, no.

[Growls]

975
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,924
I have an idea.

976
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:48,432
Can you hook this
to the generator...

977
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,867
Get some kind of current.

978
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,702
Yeah, yeah.

979
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,906
I can, uh...

980
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:02,879
Splice this extension cable
to the tech cable.

981
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,380
Give him the shock
of his life.

982
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,652
Rachel, find me
some tape, okay?

983
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:28,804
Give me the tape,
let's see.

984
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,640
This is what we're going
to do.

985
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:33,041
You get it hooked up.

986
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:36,580
I am going to throw it up
to the roof to distract it.

01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,019

991
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:39,509
I knew you'd come.

992
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:43,580
He'd done the same for me.

993
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:47,050
Help me take him home.

994
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:50,587
Of course I will.

01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,758

1002
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,184
I got you.

1005
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,560
Don't talk like that.

1006
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,797
It's what he would want.

1007
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,998
Beryl, you're going
to be up

1008
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:14,303
And making your trucker's
special before you know it.

And shot of whiskey...

1012
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:31,720
Try to relax, okay?

1013
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:35,023
Don't let the Wentshu
take us.

1014
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,093

1015
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:39,027

I promise, I promise.

1017
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,910

01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,957
Neil?

1022
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,327
What??

1023
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,898
Without your trucks you
lose all your courage?

1024
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:26,002
Rachel, there is nothing
left to do.

1025
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,971
There is no cavalry coming,
it's just us.

1026
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:34,342
So you just want
to give up?

1027
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,279
I believed in you, Jack.

1028
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:39,047
We can't give up now.

1029
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:43,219
What happened
to all that talk

1030
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:46,722
About having something
to live for.

1031
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,026
I don't have anyone
to live for

1032
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,896
But I am not going
to die here.

1033
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:54,230
We have to do something,
maybe radio.

1034
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:55,264
Rachel...

1035
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:59,869
Rachel!

1036
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:01,838
Doc... the generator's dead.

1037
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:03,773
Lowman's truck is
too far out there.

1038
01:19:03,807 --> 01:19:07,243
What the hell do you
expect from us!!!!!!!

1039
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,251
Rachel, there is no way to keep
this thing out.

1040
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:21,791
Well, maybe we're thinking
about it all wrong.

1041
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:24,493
Maybe we shouldn't try
to keep it out.

1042
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:42,912
Did anyone ever tell you
you have a crazy streak?

1043
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:45,080
You think it will work?

1044
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:48,317
It might.

1045
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:49,819
What the hell am
I missing here?

1046
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:52,455
What?!

1047
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,557
We aren't going to be able
to stop it from getting in.

1048
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,826
But if we make this place
hot enough, smoky enough

1049
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,462
It may not be able to see us
when it does get in.

1050
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:01,430
It's too big to turn around.

1051
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,532
It will give us time to get out
and get to the truck.

1052
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,976
It's time to heat things up.

1053
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,918
I knew we brought you
along for a reason, Doc.

can do!!!!

Get in the truck!
Start it up!

I am going to break
the tire loose, alright?

1081
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,046
Yeah.

01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:13,489
Come on, come on,
come on!!!!

Come on!

1092
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:54,530
We gotta make a run
for it!!!
There's nowhere to run.

1093
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:57,100
What do we do?

1094
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:58,167
