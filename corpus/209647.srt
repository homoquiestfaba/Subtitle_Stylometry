1
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:36,051
Always late

2
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,114
With your kisses

3
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:45,390
Won't you come to my arms,
sweet darlin'

4
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,956
And stay?

5
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,766
Always late

6
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,139
With your kisses

7
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,877
Why, oh, why do you
want to do me this way?

8
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:10,285
How long do you think
I can wait

9
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,757
When you know
you're always late

10
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,762
Always late

11
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,028
With your kisses

12
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:32,978
Why, why, why do you want
to do me this way?

13
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:39,950
That was Lefty Frizzell's
"Always Late with Your Kisses."

14
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,045
Before that,
we heard Buck Owens.

15
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,350
Get your waders out.

16
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,884
It's seven days before the state
officially drowns Northfork.

17
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,592
It's sunny skies
with the highs being 51...

18
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,965
"To the loving O'Brien family.

19
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,867
"It has been brought
to our attention

20
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,842
"that the remains
of a Mrs. Patricia O'Brien

21
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,709
"have yet to be excavated.

22
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,185
Please make arrangements
immediately."

23
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,959
The hardworking citizens
of Northfork

24
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,859
will be able to have
their much-needed power...

25
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,955
as well as...

26
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,331
the pleasure of the recreation
that this body of water

27
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,065
will provide.

28
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,902
Let me add this:

29
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,134
the good people of Northfork

30
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,543
will be able to have their cake
and eat it, too.

31
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,878
Two, three...

32
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,927
Where are we going to start...
right in here?

33
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,927
Where should we start?

34
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,928
Let's start right in here.

35
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,775
Then the water
shall become a flood

36
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,648
and destroy all flesh...

37
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,918
and the bow
shall be in the cloud,

38
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,087
and I will look upon it,
and I will remember

39
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,892
the everlasting covenant

40
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,423
between God
and every living creature...

41
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,268
of all flesh
that is upon the earth.

42
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,706
And that's what we have here.

43
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:20,212
Our town is dying.

44
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,339
I have seen the concrete

45
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,213
monument...

46
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,983
the headstone
for the town for Northfork.

47
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,316
This dam gate will close...

48
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,420
the water will rise

49
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,465
over the plains,

50
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,261
and cover our businesses...

51
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,065
our homes...

52
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,834
and our well-being.

53
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,437
We have lost Northfork.

54
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,211
We will be losing
our dear son...

55
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,756
but we will gain the hope,

56
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,724
the courage...

57
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,420
to move

58
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,223
to a higher ground.

59
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,103
We're all angels.

60
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,405
It is what we do

61
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,811
with our wings

62
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,681
that separates us.

63
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,807
What are we waiting for?

64
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,183
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield.

65
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,780
Father, his health
isn't getting any better.

66
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,552
Rose has had to stay
by his bed.

67
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,289
All the doctors
have left Northfork.

68
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,297
You're returning him then?

69
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,303
He's a very ill child.

70
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,738
We cannot make the journey
with him in this condition.

71
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,470
We apologize, Father.

72
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,843
We appreciate your honesty,

73
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,075
and will ask for forgiveness.

74
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,616
Forgiveness?

75
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,912
Let's be honest, Father.

76
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,183
You gave us a sick child.

77
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,917
I gave you an angel.

78
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,619
You're misunderstanding us.

79
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,560
We love Irwin.

80
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,233
Halo Home is deeply regretful

81
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,965
about the grief

82
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,237
Irwin has brought
to your family.

83
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,210
God bless.

84
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,143
Have a nice journey.

85
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,962
This is wrong.

86
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,233
This is just downright wrong.

87
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,434
When did you get this letter?

88
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,773
I received the final
notice yesterday.

89
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,915
I don't like this damned cake.

90
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,009
This is wrong on every level.

91
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,748
Yeah.

92
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,226
Where did my parents go?

93
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,901
We don't want to go
where they're going.

94
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,906
You rest now.

95
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,829
Father, everybody's leaving.

96
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,934
Oh, I know.

97
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,933
I know.

98
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,471
Oh, let's stay here.

99
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,807
Huh?

100
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,671
You're the caretaker?

101
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,907
Yes?

102
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,612
Cookie takes care of the yard.

103
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,793
Maybe you can help me?

104
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,179
Who are you looking for?

105
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,412
A relative.

106
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,453
Hold still.

107
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,511
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.

108
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,242
Walter, Willis,

109
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,580
Eddie, Arnold.

110
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:38,021
Walter, Willis, Eddie, Arnold.

111
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,254
Walter, Willis, Marvin, Matt.

112
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,852
Marvin, Matt, Walter,

113
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,364
Willis.

114
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:53,736
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.

115
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,066
Anybody voted for him

116
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,501
voted themselves
right out of Northfork.

117
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,706
Have a good journey.

118
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,437
Nice concrete cork.

119
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,142
I have done countless evacs.

120
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,205
And as long as
I've been doing this job,

121
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,547
it is never come down
to 48 hours before.

122
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,984
That's two days,

123
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,577
and by the time I'm through
with you, it's gonna be 47.

124
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,179
So you'd better listen up.

125
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,817
And remember
one very important thing.

126
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,622
Despite the tertiary
inconveniences

127
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,127
we're putting
these people through,

128
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,893
we're giving them new power.

129
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,436
All right.

130
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,492
Matt...

131
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,970
Marvin.

132
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,435
Please go pay a visit
to the Youngs.

133
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,980
Eddie, Arnold.

134
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,920
Arnold.

135
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,930
I want you to get down
to Hungry Horse Road,

136
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,092
and I want you to nail Jigger,
do you understand?

137
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,863
You betcha.

138
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,035
Now, you can't go into this
treating it like

139
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,234
you're throwing out
homesteaders,

140
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,709
poor old homesteaders.

141
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,938
Look at it like you're saving

142
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,274
some poor dumb son of
a bitch from drowning.

143
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,372
Mr. Rudolph.

144
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,251
It says here that,
uh, there has been

145
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,453
some previous attempts
at evacuation.

146
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,528
Walter,

147
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,763
Willis.

148
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,137
Stallings. Highway 93.

149
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,542
Remember, the one single
most important thing:

150
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,978
it is not our business

151
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,674
to tell anybody else theirs.

152
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,742
You just come in like
you're their guardian angel.

153
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,082
You give them wings

154
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,714
and then you move'em on up
into higher ground.

155
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,587
Good luck now, gentlemen.

156
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,833
In the early 1800s,

157
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,536
European settlers
named Northfork

158
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,945
after the river
that embraced their town.

159
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,748
Word traveled
around the world

160
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,295
that angels roamed
these plains like bison.

161
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,660
that angels roamed
these plains like bison.

162
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,260
I find the humor quite parched.

163
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,531
19th century.

164
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,596
A remarkable piece.

165
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,972
Artist used the finest oils.

166
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,744
Organic pigments.

167
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,615
Magnificent.

168
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:06,920
The artist has
a religious vocabulary.

169
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,483
He used the luxuriantly
white wings of the swan.

170
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:15,022
Fascinating representation
of the angelic messenger.

171
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,365
Lovely bird.

172
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,496
If I do recall correctly,

173
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:26,841
the Celts employed the majestic
swan as their sacred symbol

174
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:32,179
and messenger
to the other world.

175
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,653
Their link that existed
between the realm of their gods

176
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,623
and the realm of humans.

177
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
Very relatable.

178
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:47,529
I can only speculate...

179
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,262
that the man with swan wings,
or in this painting,

180
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,804
the wild bird man,

181
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,863
is a creation

182
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,739
of the overtaking
by Christianity.

183
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,837
Bless the imagination.

184
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,176
Walk, walk, walk

185
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,208
Walk, walk, walk

186
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,584
- Just a closer walk with Thee
- It's wrong.

187
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,351
It's just downright wrong.

188
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,517
702.

189
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,857
For Thou art strong

190
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,920
Departed.

191
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:27,096
Jesus keep me from all wrong

192
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,936
It's wrong,
and I'm not gonna do it.

193
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,770
And neither should you.

194
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,606
It's death till you part.

195
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,940
She's your mother.

196
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,677
I'll be satisfied as long

197
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,219
- As I walk
- 705.

198
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,189
- Let me walk close to Thee
- Departed.

199
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:55,922
Just a closer walk with Thee

200
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,300
Just a closer walk with Thee

201
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:08,678
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea

202
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:13,878
Daily walking close to Thee.

203
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,790
Have you ever smelled death?

204
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't recall smelling it.

205
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,935
Death smells like

206
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,630
nothing you've ever
smelled in your life.

207
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,301
What does it smell like?

208
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,148
You know when
you've smelled death.

209
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,786
'Cause when you smell it...

210
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,828
you say to yourself, "Damn.

211
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,688
Something die?"

212
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,509
Anything?

213
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,212
Does it say anything
about a child?

214
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,453
No. Not specifically.

215
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,562
There was a small child

216
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,189
roaming the garden.

217
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,460
Oh, Flower,

218
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,525
it said nothing about children.

219
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,796
Wait.

220
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,140
Narrator fluctuates between
the first and third person.

221
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,369
Quite interesting.

222
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:50,403
I would have to say that
he's above the age of a child.

223
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,712
Flower,

224
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,811
every town you go scurrying off
looking for offspring.

225
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,487
Wait.

226
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,096
Would you like a cup of tea?

227
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,399
One lump or two?

228
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:16,313
My name is Cup of Tea.

229
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,473
To my right,

230
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,312
as you may already know,

231
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,511
is Flower Hercules.

232
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,417
To my left, Cod.

233
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,183
And behind us all,

234
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:29,249
but in front of you, Happy.

235
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,956
And you are?

236
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,591
Irwin.

237
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,865
Hello, Irwin.

238
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,838
And your surname?

239
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,840
Sir Irwin.

240
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,935
Well, Sir Irwin

241
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,639
of Northfork,

242
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,375
my family and I have traveled

243
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,508
a long way,

244
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,816
and we are having trouble
finding a loved one.

245
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,482
Are you familiar
with the unknown angel?

246
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,524
Yes.

247
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,219
Now...

248
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:08,528
this is where we can be
of help to each other.

249
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,830
What could we offer you?

250
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,496
When you leave,
just take me with you.

251
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,038
No.

252
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,573
Never.

253
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,302
We do not
take children.

254
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,139
Then I can't help you.

255
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,406
Now, Sir Irwin...

256
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,573
you're being unreasonable.

257
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,673
Where we're going,

258
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,581
we can't take you with us.

259
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,382
Then take me a thousand miles.

260
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:35,984
A thousand miles
in anybody's book is a long way.

261
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,859
How about a hundred miles?

262
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,193
- A thousand.
- 200.

263
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,358
- A thousand.
- 300.

264
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,400
A thousand.

265
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,060
400, and that's it.

266
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,570
A thousand, and that's it.

267
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:54,210
Do you know how far that is?

268
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:02,152
A thousand miles
is a far, far, faraway place.

269
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,121
500 miles.

270
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,124
A thousand.

271
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,125
All right.

272
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,560
We'll take you
a thousand miles

273
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,655
if you bring us
the unknown angel.

274
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,929
In the morning?

275
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,833
Deal?

276
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:39,049
You the pain livin'
of a heart full of shame

277
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,318
You broke the law...

278
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,620
Ursula.

279
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,721
- Of God and man
- You have two customers.

280
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:53,567
You stole from me the one whose
ring was on my hand

281
00:32:53,638 --> 00:33:00,271
I'd say that you...

282
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:07,979
But through that came livin'
with a heart full of shame...

283
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,494
Oh, I tell you,

284
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:22,056
these sons of bitches
are harder to yank

285
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:27,070
than a tick on the touch-hole
of a chicken.

286
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,938
I hear ya.

287
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,202
Ursula...

288
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,404
Good morning.

289
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,745
You have six customers...
now seated.

290
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:49,086
Well, if it ain't
the bottom feeders.

291
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,589
Go ahead, Willis.

292
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,870
Eggs?

293
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,010
Bacon?

294
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,519
Mm-mm.

295
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,283
Sausage?

296
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,761
Mm-mm.

297
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,323
No meat?

298
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,097
Mm-mm.

299
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,099
Potatoes?

300
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,008
Mm-mm.

301
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,114
Soup.

302
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,783
Mm!

303
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,919
Uh-huh.

304
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,898
Chicken?

305
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,298
Mm-hmm.

306
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,471
Broth?

307
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,876
Cup or bowl?

308
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,005
Yeah!

309
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,480
Good work, boss.

310
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,846
Nice work, Walter.

311
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,509
Nice work, Walter.

312
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,110
Thank you, boys.

313
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,882
I'll have a bowl.

314
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,651
Same.

315
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,217
Same.

316
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,592
Same.

317
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,096
Same.

318
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,291
Okay.

319
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,590
Dent.

320
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,921
It's only dirt.

321
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,551
Afternoon, boys.

322
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,822
Good afternoon,

323
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,659
Father.

324
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,232
Walter.

325
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:47,499
Your wife, Patricia...

326
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,304
Henry...

327
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,415
Irwin's still sick.

328
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,610
I'm sorry, Father.

329
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,551
Mm...

330
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,213
Well, you got anything

331
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,985
that'll keep his spirits up
and his fever down?

332
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,290
If I was those parents,
I'd be ashamed.

333
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:15,196
Well, most parents
can't see their child ill.

334
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,359
So they throw him in a lake.

335
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,893
All depends, Henry,
on how you look at it.

336
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:25,136
Either you're halfway to heaven
or halfway to hell.

337
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,734
Here we go, Father.

338
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,746
It's an antibiotic.

339
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,805
Inject five cc's
of this into his arm.

340
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,814
Okay.

341
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,316
All right?

342
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,751
Bless you.
Have a safe journey.

343
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,913
Thank you, Father.

344
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,149
All right.

345
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,451
We thank you in advance

346
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:44,324
and hope you have...
a pleasant journey.

347
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,549
Pop?

348
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,084
Yeah, son?

349
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,381
You suppose he's got two
of everything in there?

350
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,985
I suppose we'll find out.

351
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:27,394
Now, I don't care

352
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,228
If I'm not the first...

353
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,392
Damn it.

354
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,060
That you picked...

355
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,228
I know.

356
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,999
Darlin', I'll never ask...

357
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:39,509
Not one, but two Chevys.

358
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,568
Yesterday's gone...

359
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,737
I know.

360
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,246
...from now on

361
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,577
They heard of me...

362
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,583
This is going
to be difficult.

363
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,915
...about the past

364
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,420
Yep.

365
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,923
Now I don't care if I'm...

366
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,621
Ever since we started
moving folks out...

367
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,095
we've never done well

368
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,756
with people
that owned Chevrolets.

369
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,764
...I'll be the last.

370
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,357
Matt...

371
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,298
...this country is being divided
into two types of people...

372
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,940
Chevy people...

373
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,580
...and Ford people, Matt.

374
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,314
Yep.

375
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,457
Now, I don't care

376
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:40,971
If I'm not the first love
you've known

377
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:46,305
Just so I'll be the last

378
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,403
Now, I don't care...

379
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,416
Looks like he got
some kind of hammer.

380
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,644
...that you picked

381
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,413
Darlin' I'll never ask...

382
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,355
No, it looks more like a...

383
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,890
I think
he was holding a shotgun.

384
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,135
I think you're right.

385
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,848
Every town we come to,

386
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,443
you want a child.

387
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,921
Once again, selfish.

388
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,855
How observant.

389
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,485
The noble Englishman.

390
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:41,292
How I longed to be Earl Grey.

391
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,198
The wit that got us here.

392
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,964
It's a splendid
acquisition.

393
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,436
Unknown architect.

394
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,565
Probably owner-builder.

395
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,235
A true visionary,
I might add.

396
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,242
Jesus.

397
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,716
No, no, he was a carpenter.

398
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,977
We-we-we're searching
for the unknown.

399
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,919
The unknown doesn't just
come knocking on your door.

400
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,926
If it is unknown, how would you
know if it did come knocking?

401
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,496
Well, it won't be
in the shape of a child.

402
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,929
I would have to agree.

403
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,499
Happy.

404
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,263
Do you ever disagree?

405
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,069
I disagree with
the Englishman's use of starch.

406
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,409
What do the Scriptures say?

407
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,717
"Temperature, 105 degrees.
High.

408
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:39,483
Please look after him
when I leave."

409
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,400
What do you suppose we do?

410
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,464
We're going to wing it.

411
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,953
It appears they've...

412
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,656
worn out their welcome.

413
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,835
Good afternoon, Mr. Stalling.

414
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,101
My name is Walter O'Brien.

415
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,403
This here's my son, Willis.

416
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,104
We're with
the evacuation committee.

417
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,645
It's been brought
to the state's attention

418
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,044
that you are seeking
some assistance.

419
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,605
I'm not going anywhere, son.

420
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,911
We're aware of that, sir,

421
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,076
that's why the state has
asked us to come to your aid.

422
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,552
The state understands
your difficulty

423
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,918
with moving on.

424
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,854
The state
will not hurt, destroy,

425
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,793
nor harm you physically
in any way.

426
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:31,392
It is our civil duty to assist
you in making this transition

427
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:35,370
as easy and pleasant
as possible.

428
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,748
Your agreement is this...

429
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:50,048
you will each be assigned
65 households to depart.

430
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,214
Having fulfilled
said obligation,

431
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,249
you will then
each receive 1.5 acres

432
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,423
of prime, lakefront property.

433
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,830
Your lot size
will be increased

434
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,369
by one fifth of an acre
for every additional household

435
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,066
that you assist in evacuating
beyond the initial 65.

436
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,234
Have I made myself clear?

437
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,551
I will take your vacant
stares as a yes.

438
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,318
I could live
with an acre and a half.

439
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,020
Okay by me.

440
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,091
May we, sir?

441
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,911
So...

442
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,623
...the prodigal son returns.

443
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,889
Already packed.

444
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,261
A little ahead of yourself.

445
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,391
I've brought
what you're looking for.

446
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,594
You have?

447
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,933
Outside.

448
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,478
I don't see anything.

449
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,479
We still have a deal?

450
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,139
Yes, yes, yes.

451
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,739
We have a deal.

452
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,912
Yeah, we still have a deal.

453
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,650
Where is it?

454
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,827
Oh, my.

455
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,844
Hello.

456
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,881
We'd appreciate it

457
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,780
if you both would stop

458
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,944
screwing around.

459
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,786
Well, what do you want to do?

460
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,026
The Youngs are going
to have a moving sale.

461
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,964
Perfect.

462
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,037
Now, all I need is a pair

463
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,404
of sinners like yourselves

464
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,407
to mount up there now.

465
00:47:59,476 --> 00:47:59,942
We appreciate

466
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,169
very much your giving us

467
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,236
this time to discuss
this matter.

468
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,009
A pair of wives?

469
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,175
At least they're not mounted.

470
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,183
You know,

471
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,685
it appears to me
that you folks

472
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,153
are preparing for a flood
in Biblical proportions.

473
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,553
You got that right, son.

474
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,024
A flood is going to wipe
through this place,

475
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,754
cleansing the soil of all sin.

476
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,557
Understandable.

477
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,257
When God tells us
to get a move on,

478
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,424
we're gone at the first holler
of a rooster.

479
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,365
We ain't needing the State
to come in here

480
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,335
and tell us when
to pick up and get going.

481
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,371
That's God's doing.

482
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:32,898
This is God's land,
and by God,

483
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:38,004
we ain't movin' until we get
that sign from above.

484
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
Yes, sir, uh...

485
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,513
we aren't telling you
to pick up and get going.

486
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,643
No, sir.

487
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,914
Look at us as your
life preservers.

488
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,478
You can use us if you want,

489
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,488
or not at all.

490
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,922
We give you that choice.

491
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,550
We're all in the same boat.

492
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,561
So, sir, if you
don't mind, sir,

493
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,291
I'd like to bend you
and your wives' ear a bit

494
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,390
and tell you
about the signs of God

495
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,492
that we are familiar with.

496
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,071
This could be

497
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,805
that sign.

498
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,403
A what?

499
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,744
He said he was a relative.

500
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,374
To us?

501
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,579
Yes.

502
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,647
You're the unknown angel?

503
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:22,749
Yes.

504
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,659
The one you're looking for.

505
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,661
Optimistic.

506
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,789
He is unknown.

507
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:29,797
The angel part's

508
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,128
questionable.

509
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,828
Very.

510
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,503
How romantic.

511
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,879
There's a novel about you, too.

512
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,658
I started to collect these.

513
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,497
This is the first one I grew.

514
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,129
Now I'm not saying
that this boat

515
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,935
you have built isn't worthy.

516
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,406
From the looks of it,

517
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,808
you've done a mighty fine job.

518
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,075
But for the sake of my job,
let's just say

519
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,082
it doesn't.

520
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,311
Doesn't what?

521
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,479
Your boat doesn't float.

522
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,953
Imagine this, if you will.

523
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,387
One day,

524
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,221
a town on the plains,
let's say Northfork,

525
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,727
was hit by a catastrophic flood,

526
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,128
similar to
the days of Noah,

527
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,529
and you husband
and yourselves

528
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,228
are standing out there on
the roof waiting to be rescued.

529
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,394
A friendly neighbor

530
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,598
comes paddling by in
his little wooden boat,

531
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,504
and he yells, "Hey, there,
Mr. and Mrs. Stalling,

532
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,065
"and... uh, Mrs. Stalling,

533
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,374
jump on in
and I'll take you to dry land."

534
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,705
What do you say?

535
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,410
I don't know.

536
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,508
The water's rising.

537
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,677
You shout back,

538
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,414
"No, thank you,
thy friendly neighbor.

539
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,946
I'm waiting
for a sign from God."

540
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:02,923
No, thank you.

541
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,518
I'm waiting for a sign from God.

542
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,563
Yes, exactly.

543
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,099
And your friendly neighbor
paddles away.

544
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,237
A few days later

545
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:19,264
a state rescue team
comes by in a larger boat.

546
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,572
And let's just say

547
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,944
me and Willis are on board.

548
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,313
And we offer you the same deal.

549
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,114
"Jump on in,

550
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:34,624
"and you, Mrs. Stalling
and... Mrs. Stalling,

551
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,420
will be saved."

552
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:41,055
And you say...

553
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,689
No, thank you.

554
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,099
We're waiting
for a sign from God.

555
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,263
A few more days pass,

556
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,831
and the water level has risen.

557
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,140
It has risen above the roof.

558
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,647
And unfortunately,

559
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:03,482
you and Mr. Stalling
have drowned

560
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,284
and now are in heaven
in front of God.

561
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,357
Dear, we died.

562
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,726
What about our belongings?

563
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,338
We died?

564
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,901
Oh, yes, you three have died

565
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,107
because you waited
for a sign from God

566
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,309
and it never came,
and you three died.

567
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,579
But why?

568
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,282
That's the exact question
you would ask God.

569
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:46,762
You would say, "We waited for
the sign and it never came."

570
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,267
And you and she...

571
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:58,365
and Mr. Stalling... died.

572
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,877
Now what
do you suppose

573
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:07,906
God is going
to say to you both?

574
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,475
I don't
know.

575
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:14,547
Mr. Stalling?

576
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,058
I'm dead, remember?

577
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,560
May I?

578
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:19,925
Yes.

579
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,759
I'll tell you
what God will say.

580
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,822
"I sent you two boats...

581
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,162
"Two boats.

582
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,930
...to save your lives."

583
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,632
What more of a sign
did you three want?

584
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,337
May I?

585
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,109
Fascinating.

586
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,410
You have a lovely

587
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,212
collection of feathers.

588
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,253
Thank you.

589
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,152
And your halo.

590
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,493
Where's that?

591
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,429
They took it off
when I was little.

592
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,660
I didn't need it anymore.

593
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,934
And these must be your wings.

594
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,423
Oh, mighty.

595
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,926
Look at this.

596
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:29,361
And where did we get this?

597
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,230
These are quite stunning.

598
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,236
The grace of God.

599
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,236
Yes, they are.

600
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,863
We're offering you
a pair of something

601
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,101
that only the man upstairs
is willing to give you.

602
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,268
Where'd you get these boys?

603
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:42,276
Born and raised

604
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,937
right here in Northfork.

605
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,537
Dear, what
are you thinking?

606
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,641
I'm thinking,
what bird suffered this?

607
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,650
Oh, there's nothing

608
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,743
fowl about these wings.

609
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,651
I understand your initial doubt,

610
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,917
but how many times
have you seen wings

611
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,960
of this size and beauty?

612
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,663
This is what

613
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,062
most of us were shot with.

614
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,624
Tranquillity at its finest.

615
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,170
This could make
an elephant fly.

616
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,796
It stuck in me

617
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,932
right here.

618
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,608
May I look?

619
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,281
Appears to be lengthy
needle of some sort.

620
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,685
Five years, maybe
six years of age.

621
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,019
Used numerous times

622
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,683
for injection.

623
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,852
You were shot with
this rifle?

624
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:32,895
Yes.

625
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,827
I was running with my flock

626
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,456
and they shot me.

627
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,331
You were running
with your flock?

628
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,369
Yes.

629
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,029
Flock of what?

630
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,939
Doves? Geese? Seagulls?

631
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,566
Angels.

632
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,304
Angel wings, huh?

633
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,474
I'm here to tell you
these wings is worthless.

634
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,847
And to remove all doubt,

635
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,443
we included this certificate
of authenticity.

636
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,186
Signed, sealed and blessed
by your own Father Harlan.

637
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,420
"Found near the glaciers,

638
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:06,757
these wings, blah, blah, blah."

639
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,888
From what they could tell,

640
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,090
this particular pair were
detached from a juvenile

641
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,828
who probably strayed
from the flock.

642
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:16,030
"Perhaps no wiser
than four years of age.

643
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:19,405
"The abbreviated
wingspan reveals to us

644
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,172
"that he weighed
no more than 25

645
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,942
to 30 pounds
before they were removed."

646
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,712
A bit too disturbing for me.

647
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,050
Happy...

648
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,115
are you looking at this?

649
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,235
Would you say amputated?

650
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,568
Yes. Amputated.

651
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,437
Fascinating.

652
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,704
Angel. Huh.

653
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:55,938
Aren't we all?

654
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,809
I'd say quite the opposite.

655
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,873
Probably a little devil,

656
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,076
and daddy gave him
a good strapping.

657
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,052
There's a back
story for you.

658
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,715
Does this cause any pain?

659
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:08,883
No.

660
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,516
This would be
recognized

661
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,289
as a highly dangerous

662
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,456
procedure without
anesthesia.

663
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,591
Some people would just

664
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,100
bite a bullet.

665
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,433
A highly

666
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:25,133
skilled surgeon
was overly concerned

667
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,937
with muscle stabilization.

668
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,808
There's no evidence of
curvature of the spine.

669
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,146
You're discovering

670
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:42,282
feathers in this area?

671
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,656
Yes.

672
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,285
What time of day?

673
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,920
Morning.

674
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,794
Can you run your fingers

675
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,959
through his hair?

676
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,674
What can you tell us
about your relatives?

677
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:05,236
My mother and father were
12th generation angels.

678
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,441
My great grandpa

679
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,882
and grandma
had wings the size

680
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,681
of bombers and would
glide the plains

681
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,381
of Northfork.

682
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:16,391
Come on, you ladies,

683
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,723
can't you just smell
the bird shit?

684
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:22,026
I mean, I'd like to believe
these wings is authentic,

685
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,122
but the feathers,

686
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,690
they ain't attached
to anything.

687
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:29,568
You take those moose antlers
back there.

688
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,867
Oh, dear.

689
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,703
Yeah, it's a fine

690
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:36,233
set of antlers, but it's more
than just a rack of horns

691
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,405
attached to a piece of board.

692
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,779
That wouldn't be enough.

693
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,819
It's an okay place
to hang your hat,

694
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:47,516
but there ain't no pride in it.

695
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,185
What you need is the whole
head hanging up there.

696
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:55,391
And these marble eyes just
a-staring on down at you.

697
00:58:55,465 --> 00:59:00,232
Then you know you've got
something really worth having.

698
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,396
We're still not leaving.

699
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,805
I've got a thousand-dollar
check from the state,

700
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,371
or would you rather use that
for your funeral services?

701
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,307
No.

702
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,718
Then you best get the hell
out of here right now.

703
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,351
Use these to fly
the hell out of here.

704
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:28,828
Wow.

705
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,321
Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

706
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,456
I think Jigger's asleep.

707
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,912
Let's go.

708
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,304
Jesus Christ.

709
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,159
The scars on his forehead

710
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,932
tell me he did

711
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,439
have a halo.

712
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,633
Most likely metal.

713
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,698
To stabilize his...

714
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:56,206
Oh.

715
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,270
Everything all right?

716
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:02,374
Dankish, beetle-headed
foot-licker.

717
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,511
What is wrong with you?

718
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,918
Happy?

719
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:13,860
You should be asking yourself
that question.

720
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,455
Fired from a long barrel rifle.

721
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:17,931
Ten feet away.

722
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,194
Needle meant

723
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:22,203
to penetrate two
to three inches of skin.

724
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,172
Perhaps the hide
of a herbivore.

725
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,506
Beast of a hallucinogenic.

726
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,637
Would you like a cup of tea?

727
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,271
This isn't tea time.

728
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,043
Given my weight,

729
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,677
calculated dosage...

730
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,050
this could be a lengthy trip.

731
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,058
Moist.

732
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,356
Mother...

733
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,690
may I?

734
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,253
No.

735
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,662
Yes.

736
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,364
Plenty more
where that came from.

737
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,768
Here.

738
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,240
Shoot me, shoot Cod.

739
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,798
And then shoot yourself

740
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:01,809
in the foot.

741
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,038
No!

742
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,808
You saucy, sheep-biting,
flat-mouthed dewberry.

743
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,008
This could be a family...

744
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,382
Oh.

745
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,799
Santa's everywhere.

746
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,232
I'm happy.

747
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,949
This should back off
some evil spirits.

748
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,080
Hmm?

749
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,488
Oh.

750
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,494
Hmm.

751
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,315
Two out of three ain't that bad.

752
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,476
Damn it. I say

753
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,281
we hook that thing up
to our bumper

754
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,878
and drag it out ourselves.

755
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,548
What are you talking about,
Willis?

756
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:22,921
You know why?
I'll tell you why.

757
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:23,923
That there was number

758
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:24,924
65.

759
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,289
I know that, Willis.

760
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,727
I'm marking them down
as departed.

761
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,822
We can't.

762
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,766
The state makes their
final pass-through,

763
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,826
and they find that Mr. Stalling
locked up in that

764
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,064
boat with his

765
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,435
moosehead.

766
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,440
It's our butt.

767
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,442
It's our job
to move them out of Northfork.

768
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,307
It's not our job
to know where they go.

769
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,313
Willis...
it's our job

770
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,372
to move people,

771
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,917
not change their beliefs.

772
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,179
What more

773
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,120
could we have said?

774
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,349
Without the proper words,

775
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,086
this is just a man, nailed

776
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,128
to two pieces of wood.

777
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,334
Oh, he's cute.

778
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,370
Father?

779
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,608
Yes, son.

780
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,610
I don't think they want me.

781
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,543
Oh, no, they do.

782
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,080
They do, son.

783
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,173
They came a long way for you.

784
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,376
Then,

785
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,545
can I go with them?

786
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,920
I will still have to speak
with them.

787
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,616
Then,

788
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,662
can you tell them I'm an angel?

789
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:37,926
I will.

790
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,625
I will.

791
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,398
Because I want them
to see my wings.

792
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,632
Do you have wings?

793
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,902
Yeah? Me, too.

794
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,445
But mine got old and fell off.

795
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,778
You get some sleep now.

796
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,874
All right.

797
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,985
Mr. and Mrs. Hope?

798
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,254
Yes.

799
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,590
I'm Father Harlan.

800
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,594
Father.

801
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:08,595
Thank you

802
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,894
for coming on short notice.

803
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,227
Irwin is

804
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,667
a good boy.

805
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,535
I could go on, but

806
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,666
that would seem
like I'm selling him to you.

807
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,405
And I'm not.

808
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,503
What?

809
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,706
You're not...

810
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,908
Well, given the chance,
I'm sure Irwin

811
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,918
would do a better job
at selling himself...

812
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,078
- Oh.
- than me.

813
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,515
Can we meet him?

814
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,751
Unfortunately...

815
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,590
you will have to make a decision

816
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,755
before you can meet him.

817
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,066
But, Father, it says right here

818
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,694
that we can spend
the afternoon with him.

819
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,896
Yes, I know. I...

820
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,939
I'm sorry. I apologize.

821
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:54,099
But Irwin is a fragile boy.

822
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,304
I can't let him
get his hopes up too high

823
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,816
only to have them diminished.

824
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:05,582
His health can't afford
that kind of a disappointment.

825
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,122
Oh, Father, we can't
make a decision

826
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,091
based upon viewing
him from a window.

827
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,998
I'm sorry.

828
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,995
Why don't you go
wait in the car?

829
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,782
Father, we come here
attempting to adopt a child,

830
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,013
and you turn it
into window shopping.

831
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,112
He's not a puppy.

832
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,316
Oh.

833
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,483
Well, maybe that's

834
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,995
what you and your wife
should be considering.

835
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,026
I'm sorry

836
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,626
if I have wasted your time.

837
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,966
Have a pleasant journey.

838
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,047
Many townspeople have speculated

839
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,107
that the body of Jimmy Miller,

840
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,676
son of Doris and James Miller,

841
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,881
still lays in the Northfork dam.

842
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,116
One worker has said,

843
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,387
"There is a slight lump
in the interior wall

844
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:22,397
that will hold back
19 million acres of water."

845
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,696
Another worker said,
"Yes, Jimmy is in there.

846
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,100
"They never could retrieve him
from the dam.

847
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,367
He is resting in peace."

848
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,568
Tom Johnson, a fisherman,
put it this way,

849
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,771
"Heck, you can't exactly
troll a hundred feet

850
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,305
of just-poured concrete
fishing for a body."

851
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,180
Marvin. Matt.

852
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,810
Walter. Willis.

853
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,412
Tours of the Northfork dam,
and possibly Jimmy Miller,

854
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,152
will be starting in January.

855
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,693
For more information,

856
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,787
please contact Montana's
Water and Power.

857
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,197
Somebody is laying there.

858
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,437
You feel a heartbeat?

859
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,167
No.

860
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,175
You can figure...

861
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,269
a death of a person is
still considered progress.

862
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,080
Son of a bitch is getting
the biggest headstone

863
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,119
this side of Rushmore.

864
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,188
Yeah.

865
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,629
Congratulations.

866
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,791
65 residents departed.

867
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,425
Good job.

868
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,436
You sign on that bottom line,

869
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,598
1.5 acres will be transferred
into your name.

870
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,350
Hmm.

871
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:00,827
Well, your log reads
64 residents departed.

872
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:02,056
Is this correct?

873
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,223
Well, sir...

874
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,358
Yes, sir, it is.

875
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,070
Well, you know what?

876
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,628
I'd like to thank
you personally

877
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,298
for your hard work
and dedication

878
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,841
in the evacuation
of Northfork,

879
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,469
and hope to see you boys
out there enjoying the lake.

880
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,342
Wait a minute.
That's it?

881
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,541
We get nothing?

882
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,551
That's correct.

883
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,383
Sir, there...

884
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,752
there is another house

885
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,950
that we did not confirm
their departure.

886
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,549
Well, then, you best
go out there

887
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,595
and get it confirmed, huh?

888
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,271
Duck.

889
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,083
Duck.

890
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,055
Goose.

891
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,033
Boy was a tad pigeon-toed.

892
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,930
What do you think?

893
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,941
For most, Vincent Van Gogh
was a fine artist.

894
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,066
To some, he lacked technique.

895
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,112
Paint straight
from the tube,

896
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:25,271
very heavy-handed.

897
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,121
How Van Gogh cut off his ear

898
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,393
is what is most intriguing
to folks.

899
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,730
In each piece I've ever
appraised, the story

900
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:51,239
is always more fascinating
than the actual piece itself.

901
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,899
And?

902
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,967
It's a fantastic yarn
the boy has spun.

903
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:58,639
Unfortunately...

904
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:03,617
the story is more valuable
than the actual piece.

905
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,488
What about his collection
of feathers?

906
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:09,546
Perhaps...

907
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,458
from the stork
that dropped him.

908
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,622
Feathers are inconsistent.

909
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,188
I couldn't find
any connection

910
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,665
in the scriptures.

911
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,326
And that spleeny

912
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,495
ill-nurtured gnat.

913
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,766
Are you positive?

914
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,503
Oh, Flower, please,
be open to inconsistency.

915
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,006
What did the feathers
come in?

916
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,073
A book.

917
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,309
The book

918
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,851
was in a pillowcase.

919
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,511
I presume that the pillow
that the boy

920
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:41,613
lays his head on
is stuffed with feathers.

921
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:46,450
He is not
what we are here for.

922
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,827
La Fleur
was touched by an angel.

923
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,854
Is it snowing?

924
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,099
Can I go?

925
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:45,784
You're not mine anymore

926
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,412
This is it, son.

927
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,250
Looks pretty vacant.

928
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,122
Indeed it does.

929
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,649
If you don't ever
change your mind

930
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,903
Trick or treat.

931
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,778
Smells like something
died in here.

932
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,975
That is precisely why
we're not going to get mother.

933
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,380
Willis, you smell that?

934
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,355
Yeah, it smells
like something died.

935
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,704
Go upstairs and check
all the rooms.

936
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,069
Then we'll leave.

937
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,067
What?

938
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,741
You're kidding.

939
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,282
You go upstairs
and check everything out.

940
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,408
Willis, go upstairs,

941
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,953
and see if anyone
is up there.

942
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,184
I'm personally not ready
to face death.

943
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,250
This is number 65.

944
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,354
Go upstairs, check it out,

945
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,628
and let's get this over with.

946
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,692
I'm checking out
the other side.

947
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,261
Willis.

948
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,328
Willis!

949
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,127
Hello?

950
01:17:04,985 --> 01:17:06,077
Hello there.

951
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,603
Pop.

952
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:35,342
Pop!

953
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,884
Do you see anything?

954
01:17:48,395 --> 01:17:50,363
No.

955
01:17:51,465 --> 01:17:53,831
Come on. Jump.

956
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:54,833
It's about

957
01:17:54,968 --> 01:17:56,936
five feet, come on.

958
01:17:57,004 --> 01:17:58,494
You can make it.
Jump.

959
01:18:00,974 --> 01:18:02,874
Come on.

960
01:18:04,044 --> 01:18:06,535
Pop, come on, jump!

961
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:08,740
You can make it. Come on.

962
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,686
Are you okay?

963
01:18:23,764 --> 01:18:26,756
Would you like a cup of tea?

964
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:28,767
I would qualify this

965
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:31,201
in the area
of concussion.

966
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:33,637
A frothy, clay-brained snapper.

967
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:36,073
Let's help you get up
onto your feet.

968
01:18:40,347 --> 01:18:41,439
Definitely

969
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:43,244
going to feel that
in the morning.

970
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:48,314
Willis, let's go.

971
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:49,685
Did you see anyone?

972
01:18:49,756 --> 01:18:50,745
Nope.

973
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,492
Come on!

974
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,092
Come on!

975
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,099
Get in the car!

976
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:03,093
Get!

977
01:19:04,504 --> 01:19:06,563
What's got you
so spooked?

978
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,507
If you don't ever
change your mind

979
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:10,770
To take me back again

980
01:19:10,844 --> 01:19:11,776
Grab the book.

981
01:19:11,845 --> 01:19:12,777
Pop...

982
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:14,005
Just do it!

983
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:17,310
Mark them down as evacs.

984
01:19:17,384 --> 01:19:18,544
Evacuated.

985
01:19:19,586 --> 01:19:20,518
Do it!

986
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:21,781
Okay, I will.

987
01:19:21,922 --> 01:19:24,083
Since the day you say
we're through

988
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:28,423
I'm even more
in love with you

989
01:19:28,495 --> 01:19:30,588
And it's my fault that
you're not mine anymore

990
01:19:30,664 --> 01:19:33,633
And I think we should
go get your mom.

991
01:20:00,527 --> 01:20:02,495
These have the same texture

992
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:04,962
as the feathers that were
in the boy's book.

993
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:13,506
Mm-hmm.

994
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:17,409
Mm-hmm.

995
01:20:17,477 --> 01:20:20,708
No more than four years of age.

996
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:22,373
Weighed no more than 30 pounds.

997
01:20:24,684 --> 01:20:27,346
These were attached
to something very young...

998
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:31,548
I'm going to have
to evaluate the other side.

999
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:34,526
Fascinating.

1000
01:20:36,163 --> 01:20:38,996
Oh, Lord...

1001
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,057
Let the holy angels come

1002
01:20:41,134 --> 01:20:43,659
to Irwin.

1003
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:46,968
And carry him
to your heavenly city.

1004
01:20:50,544 --> 01:20:52,637
Free his spirit...

1005
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:57,747
from the prison of his body.

1006
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:56,741
Fascinating.

1007
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:00,305
No.

1008
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:03,273
Please, no.

1009
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,114
I'm sorry.

1010
01:23:14,421 --> 01:23:16,651
I'm a man of faith.

1011
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:22,662
Forgiveness is my job.

1012
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:28,830
But right now,

1013
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:33,338
I can't forgive my faith.

1014
01:23:38,378 --> 01:23:39,675
Hmm.

1015
01:23:43,883 --> 01:23:45,350
Here.

1016
01:23:47,387 --> 01:23:50,686
He grew two inches this summer.

1017
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,781
- Pop.

1018
01:24:23,857 --> 01:24:25,950
Still stacking wood?

1019
01:24:28,028 --> 01:24:29,996
Yep.

1020
01:24:42,876 --> 01:24:44,844
Pop?

1021
01:24:49,549 --> 01:24:52,109
Yeah?

1022
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:55,177
You're not even close
to what death smells like.

1023
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:26,652
I'm sorry.

1024
01:25:31,191 --> 01:25:33,318
I'm coming to get you.

1025
01:25:35,195 --> 01:25:36,662
I'm sorry.

1026
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:46,164
I didn't forget you.

1027
01:25:54,214 --> 01:25:56,182
I'm sorry.

1028
01:26:01,554 --> 01:26:03,283
I'm sorry.

1029
01:26:15,802 --> 01:26:17,929
Pop.

1030
01:26:18,004 --> 01:26:19,801
Come here.

1031
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,364
What?

1032
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:29,440
Can you see?

1033
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:30,505
What?

1034
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:32,278
Look closer.

1035
01:26:32,352 --> 01:26:33,410
No, I can't see anything.

1036
01:26:33,486 --> 01:26:34,453
What am I looking for?

1037
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:36,113
There's a nick in my paint.

1038
01:26:36,189 --> 01:26:38,089
There's a nick in my paint!

1039
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:42,627
Don't make it worse.

1040
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:44,390
- Don't make it worse.
- It's only dirt.

1041
01:26:44,464 --> 01:26:45,396
I was rubbing it off.

1042
01:26:45,465 --> 01:26:47,456
- What color is dirt?
- Brown?

1043
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,297
If Marvin weren't blind,
he would see

1044
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:51,360
that it was gray...
the color underneath my paint.

1045
01:26:51,438 --> 01:26:52,803
Willis, the speck is brown.

1046
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:55,466
Look.

1047
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:57,476
Brown after Marvin's
filthy hands rubbed it.

1048
01:26:57,544 --> 01:26:59,171
Well, I can't see
how you'd think

1049
01:26:59,245 --> 01:27:01,645
you could keep your car perfect
the way you drive anyway.

1050
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:02,738
It hurts.

1051
01:27:02,816 --> 01:27:05,080
The first one... hurts.

1052
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:07,016
You just never know
when it's going to come.

1053
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:09,111
You know,
that's fate for you.

1054
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:10,781
A little rock.

1055
01:27:13,026 --> 01:27:15,119
You do not have a say
in the matter.

1056
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:24,299
Now that you've gotten
the first one...

1057
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,808
...the rest comes easy.

1058
01:27:30,343 --> 01:27:33,107
You spend all your time...

1059
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:34,612
polishing your car,

1060
01:27:34,681 --> 01:27:37,616
making everything perfect.

1061
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:39,447
Then this rock...

1062
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:41,783
flies out of nowhere,

1063
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:44,983
and puts all your
hard work to shame.

1064
01:27:52,365 --> 01:27:54,333
Nothing you can do about it.

1065
01:27:59,038 --> 01:28:01,666
Absolutely nothing.

1066
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:12,982
- Holy cow.
- Oh, my God.

1067
01:29:09,475 --> 01:29:11,500
...into the hole... take that...

1068
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:13,408
...soft, so when you get
down in there,

1069
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:16,448
you just thread this rope
through the top handle.

1070
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:20,252
What?

1071
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,788
You jump down there and do it.

1072
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:24,584
- Willis.
- No more. No, no, no, no.

1073
01:29:24,657 --> 01:29:25,646
This is downright wrong.

1074
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:27,920
Once something's buried,

1075
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:29,086
it should stay buried.

1076
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:32,131
I can't show no more respect.

1077
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,995
You know,
when this small town

1078
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:38,902
becomes the biggest lake
this side of the Mississippi,

1079
01:29:38,972 --> 01:29:40,667
your mother will be
the catch of the day!

1080
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,435
Then throw some rocks on her.

1081
01:29:42,508 --> 01:29:43,805
That should keep her down.

1082
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:53,819
Where you going to take her?

1083
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,480
What about California?

1084
01:29:57,857 --> 01:29:59,449
What's there?

1085
01:29:59,525 --> 01:30:01,186
I heard in California

1086
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,057
they're serving cheeseburgers
and a soda

1087
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:05,290
in less than two minutes flat.

1088
01:30:05,365 --> 01:30:06,457
Wow...

1089
01:30:06,532 --> 01:30:09,695
That's fast food.

1090
01:30:22,382 --> 01:30:25,510
I know you've been praying.

1091
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,346
Not to worry.

1092
01:30:29,889 --> 01:30:32,687
A family will come soon.

1093
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:42,363
You may be an orphan...

1094
01:30:45,405 --> 01:30:49,205
but you're still a child of God.

1095
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:55,176
We must go get him, Flower.

1096
01:30:55,248 --> 01:30:56,510
If I didn't know your voice,

1097
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:59,210
I would think it
was my subconscious.

1098
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:04,652
Could he be?

1099
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:09,154
He is.

1100
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:18,161
You don't want to believe him,
do you?

1101
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:21,502
You do?

1102
01:31:29,549 --> 01:31:32,143
He's just a child.

1103
01:31:32,218 --> 01:31:34,277
I can't accept that.

1104
01:31:34,353 --> 01:31:35,285
Yes,

1105
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:36,821
I know.

1106
01:31:36,889 --> 01:31:39,153
We can't.

1107
01:31:39,225 --> 01:31:40,852
We have to.

1108
01:31:42,562 --> 01:31:44,689
You have to.

1109
01:31:46,032 --> 01:31:46,964
Don't let

1110
01:31:47,033 --> 01:31:47,965
your motherly nature

1111
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:50,525
cost you your manhood.

1112
01:31:52,472 --> 01:31:55,168
He prayed for us.

1113
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:29,741
1.5 acres
of lakefront property.

1114
01:32:29,809 --> 01:32:30,969
Hmm.

1115
01:32:31,043 --> 01:32:33,409
Northern Pike?

1116
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:34,810
Might be.

1117
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:36,542
Pike's not a fish.

1118
01:32:36,616 --> 01:32:38,140
It's a dog.

1119
01:32:38,217 --> 01:32:40,481
Skull full of teeth.

1120
01:32:40,553 --> 01:32:42,783
Pick those suckers up
by their eye sockets.

1121
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:45,483
Weapons of massive destruction.

1122
01:32:45,558 --> 01:32:46,547
They drop that

1123
01:32:46,626 --> 01:32:48,389
pike's milt into this lake.

1124
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:50,122
You can forget
all about the fish

1125
01:32:50,196 --> 01:32:51,993
living in peace and harmony.

1126
01:32:52,064 --> 01:32:55,295
Pike eat their children.

1127
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:57,393
What they should do
is introduce a nice game fish

1128
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,664
like the Muskie.

1129
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:00,501
Now, that's a fine species.

1130
01:33:00,573 --> 01:33:01,699
- Mm.
- No fish

1131
01:33:01,774 --> 01:33:03,435
from Minnesota
should be allowed to swim

1132
01:33:03,509 --> 01:33:05,443
past the Missouri.

1133
01:33:05,511 --> 01:33:07,103
The fine citizens
of Northfork knew

1134
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,774
that Muskie was swimming
through their houses,

1135
01:33:09,849 --> 01:33:11,817
we would've never been able
to get'em to leave.

1136
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:12,976
Canada ought to claim

1137
01:33:13,052 --> 01:33:16,419
that bug-heap they
call Minnesota.

1138
01:33:16,489 --> 01:33:18,957
Throw in Wisconsin for free.

1139
01:33:26,499 --> 01:33:28,729
You have to think
that this must have been

1140
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:31,133
his last day on the job.

1141
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,440
You ready?

1142
01:34:49,515 --> 01:34:52,780
1,000 miles?

1143
01:34:54,053 --> 01:34:55,850
Farther.

1144
01:34:55,955 --> 01:34:58,014
You're a relative.

1145
01:35:03,829 --> 01:35:06,195
Hercules...

1146
01:35:06,265 --> 01:35:10,793
the strongest man
ever to wear a skirt.

1147
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:14,601
Are you going to be my mother
or my father?

1148
01:35:14,674 --> 01:35:17,302
I'm both.

1149
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:22,341
Considered the perfect soul,

1150
01:35:22,415 --> 01:35:24,042
I search for no one,

1151
01:35:24,116 --> 01:35:25,640
and no one looks for me.

1152
01:35:25,718 --> 01:35:26,742
Whatever

1153
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:29,117
I need I look
within myself to find.

1154
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:30,120
I am

1155
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:31,588
complete.

1156
01:35:31,657 --> 01:35:35,787
I am not king nor queen,
yet I am both.

1157
01:35:35,861 --> 01:35:38,659
A mother and a father.

1158
01:35:38,731 --> 01:35:41,928
You prayed to be this way?

1159
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:44,663
Isn't that
what Father Harlan says?

1160
01:35:44,737 --> 01:35:46,432
"Pray and you shall receive?"

1161
01:36:21,474 --> 01:36:24,238
Would you like a cup of tea?

1162
01:37:22,902 --> 01:37:24,802
Irwin?

1163
01:37:26,472 --> 01:37:28,201
Well?

1164
01:37:43,489 --> 01:37:45,650
There you go, son.

1165
01:38:07,379 --> 01:38:11,110
And in that journey of dying,

1166
01:38:11,183 --> 01:38:14,084
you see many things.

1167
01:38:14,153 --> 01:38:18,180
But all issues I had passed.

1168
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:21,749
Because I was to be a witness.

1169
01:38:21,827 --> 01:38:25,024
A helper.

1170
01:38:25,097 --> 01:38:28,464
And that's the thing, I think,

1171
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:31,594
is important about death,

1172
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:34,230
is the ability for us

1173
01:38:34,306 --> 01:38:36,137
to be witnesses.

1174
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:40,304
Not only for our births
of coming in,

1175
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:43,143
but going out.

1176
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:46,480
And that's what we have here.

1177
01:38:46,552 --> 01:38:48,713
We've lost our town. It's gone.

1178
01:38:48,787 --> 01:38:51,779
But maybe there's

1179
01:38:51,857 --> 01:38:54,951
a birth someplace else.

1180
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:57,325
Maybe there's a blessing

1181
01:38:57,396 --> 01:39:00,661
from that experience.

1182
01:39:00,733 --> 01:39:03,702
I'm no longer afraid of death,

1183
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:05,862
but it's a lesson
that's taken me

1184
01:39:05,938 --> 01:39:08,372
60 years to learn.

1185
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:34,972
As you stroll around Northfork,

1186
01:42:35,047 --> 01:42:37,948
take your last walk
down the dirt road

1187
01:42:38,016 --> 01:42:40,280
that leads to where
your house may have been,

1188
01:42:40,352 --> 01:42:44,152
and look at the trees
that you once climbed.

1189
01:42:44,223 --> 01:42:49,456
Smile, and remember those trees
for what they will become:

1190
01:42:49,528 --> 01:42:53,020
future snags
for fishing tackle.

1191
01:42:53,098 --> 01:42:56,261
As you continue your walk,
think to yourself,

1192
01:42:56,335 --> 01:43:00,795
"This is the only time
I will ever be able

1193
01:43:00,873 --> 01:43:03,569
"to walk
on the bottom of a lake

1194
01:43:03,642 --> 01:43:06,509
without having
to hold my breath."

1195
01:43:06,578 --> 01:43:09,911
Remember when you leave
to pack all your good memories.

1196
01:43:09,982 --> 01:43:13,383
No one else will pack them
for you.

1197
01:43:13,452 --> 01:43:15,079
Good night to you all.
