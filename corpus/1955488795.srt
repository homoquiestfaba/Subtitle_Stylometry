1
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,561
Elinore: Night light,
night bright,

2
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,464
shine for me
with all your might.

3
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,800
Night light, night bright,

4
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,369
watch over me
'til morning sight.

5
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,493
You'll be safer here,
Mr. scribbles.

6
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,719
What's going on in here?

7
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,189
Something's in my room.
Oh, elinore...

8
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,459
We should wake up daddy.

9
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,128
No, you know he has
to work early tomorrow.

10
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,397
Sweetie, we can't
do this tonight, okay?

11
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,666
There's something here.

12
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,535
There's nothing here.

13
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,403
Don't you remember
what the doctor said?

14
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,505
There's no such thing as ghosts.

15
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,009
The doctor's full of shit,
wake up daddy!

16
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,177
Okay.

17
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,180
Show me. Where?

18
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,851
All right, let me
see the flashlight.

19
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,294
Elinore, I don't see anything.

20
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,931
Hey, what happened
to Mr. scribbles?

21
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,035
Elinore, did you take my brush?

22
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,840
Oh!

23
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,143
Elinore, help me!

24
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,214
Elinore! Elinore!

25
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,784
Elinore: Daddy,
daddy, wake up!

26
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,048
Well, fancy meeting
you here, man.

27
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,983
I was beginning to think
that you were flaking...

28
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,921
Nick: Tim?

29
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,724
Tim?

30
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,771
Hey, Tim, I didn't
mean to scare ya.

31
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,810
Okay.
I'll come back later.

32
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,573
Automated voice: <i>You have reached
the office of Dr. piccault.</i>

33
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,442
<i>No one is available to take
your call at the moment.</i>

34
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:01,446
<i>If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 9-1-1.</i>

35
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:05,383
<i>Otherwise, leave a message and we'll
be in touch as soon as we can.</i>

36
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,419
<i>Thank you and have a good day.</i>

37
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,991
No, no, oh...

38
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,731
Nick: Hey!

39
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,067
Twice in one week,
I might have to call CNN.

40
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,771
Yeah, so I was wondering
where that was.

41
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:03,775
I'm just gonna go knock it
out now, if that's okay?

42
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,279
So, I guess you can just give
it to me since I'm here.

43
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,584
You know, I got
a couple minutes.

44
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,419
Why don't you just
tell me what's on it?

45
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,224
Well, it's the beginning
of the week, um,

46
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,926
so let me guess.

47
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:25,297
I'm gonna go with tp,
ultra soft of course...

48
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,665
And...

49
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,100
Mouthwash.

50
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,040
Okay.

51
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,341
Uh...

52
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,344
It was nice talking to you too,

53
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,947
and we should definitely do
this again when I get back.

54
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,156
Thank you.

55
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,571
Yes?

56
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,407
Distorted voice:
<i>You can't hide anymore.</i>

57
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,842
Excuse me, who is this?

58
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:36,681
<i>We regret to inform you,
you have 45 days to vacate.</i>

59
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,684
How do you know that?

60
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,254
<i>What's going to happen when
you have to go outside again?</i>

61
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,257
Nothing.
<i>Nothing never happens.</i>

62
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:51,062
<i>Something bad always does.</i>
Not this time.

63
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,432
I can do it. <i>That's
not what she thinks.</i>

64
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,769
Who?
<i>Turn around.</i>

65
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,051
Carri?

66
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,620
Distorted voice: <i>Ask her
what's going to happen.</i>

67
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,721
No.

68
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,592
Leave me alone.

69
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,195
<i>You are, but not for long.</i>

70
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,203
Mary: <i>Tim?</i>

71
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,372
<i>It's Mary, can you hear me?</i>

72
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,342
<i>Tim?</i>

73
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,944
Mary?

74
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,313
<i>Yes, couldn't you hear me?</i>

75
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,084
Uh, no, no, I didn't.

76
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,053
<i>Strange, I could hear you.</i>

77
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,325
Sorry, I thought it was a prank.

78
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,127
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

79
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,900
Dr. piccault missed
the appointment today.

80
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,870
<i>I know, I'm sorry
I couldn't call you sooner.</i>

81
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,506
<i>There's no easy way
to say this...</i>

82
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,475
<i>Dr. piccault
had an accident.</i>

83
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,644
Accident, what kind of accident?

84
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,946
<i>Tim, I need you to stay calm.</i>

85
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,582
<i>It's okay if you want
to take some medication.</i>

86
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,885
Is he going to be okay?

87
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,587
<i>Well, we're not sure
at this point.</i>

88
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,623
<i>You've been transferred to a
new doctor for the time being.</i>

89
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,862
New doctor, no, no, no, I can't.

90
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,998
<i>Tim, we just want you
to be calm.</i>

91
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,168
<i>Can you do that,
or should I send some help?</i>

92
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,748
<i>Tim...</i>

93
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,952
<i>Tim?</i>

94
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,889
No, you don't need
to send anyone.

95
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,759
<i>What's important is that we have
a new doctor for you, okay?</i>

96
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,130
What's his name?

97
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,598
<i>Dr. sephton.</i>

98
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,977
Tim:<i> But I don't know him.</i>

99
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,180
Mary: <i>Dr. piccault has worked
with him before, he's excellent.</i>

100
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,715
<i>His office is going to call you,</i>

101
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,985
<i>but I wanted you
to hear it from me first.</i>

102
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,754
Tim:<i> Sure, okay.</i>

103
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,184
Nick: <i>Oh, wake up, man,
please don't be dead.</i>

104
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,055
Nick: Tim!

105
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,925
Tim: Whoa, how did
you get in here?

106
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,594
I came back with the thing,

107
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,629
and the thing is like this, and
you're laying here not breathing!

108
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,831
Man, I was gonna call 9-1-1!

109
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,934
Excuse me, I have to...

110
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,237
Would you mind
locking up when you leave?

111
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,141
Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to snoop.

112
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,545
Um, I should probably get going.

113
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,914
I forgot to, uh,
give you your money.

114
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,317
Oh... deliveries on me,
get me next week.

115
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,956
Do you need any...
Any help?

116
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,724
I mean, with the letter.

117
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,626
No, thank you, though.

118
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,797
How long have you lived here?

119
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,733
Almost 20 years.

120
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,771
And when was the last time you,
like, went past that door?

121
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,807
Thirteen months.

122
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,912
Do you miss the outside
world, just a little?

123
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,715
I can see it from here.

124
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,283
Do you ever get lonely?

125
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,521
No.

126
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,590
I would.

127
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,459
I mean, I don't think we're
supposed to be alone.

128
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,727
Do you?

129
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,403
All right, well,
I'll see you next week.

130
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,042
Automated voice: <i>We're sorry, please
consult your directory and dial again.</i>

131
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,125
Nick: Tim?

132
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,864
Hey, hey, hey it's Nick.

133
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:20,998
Tim.

134
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,800
Tim, it's Nick.

135
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,107
Tim: Earthquake?

136
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,309
Yeah, what did
you think that was?

137
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,145
That can't be right.

138
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,680
Why... why not?

139
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,749
Did you see anybody else?

140
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,553
Do you mean besides me and you?

141
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,889
No I, I thought I heard
something, like growling, but...

142
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,359
Oh, yeah, Brett's dog got loose.

143
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,128
Brett's your neighbor and he
can't keep his dog on a leash.

144
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,863
Dog?
Yeah.

145
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,936
I'm not crazy.

146
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,806
Oh, no. Who's saying
anything about crazy?

147
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,541
A little buzzed up, maybe.

148
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,943
Did you, uh, open this tonight?

149
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,379
I had one glass.

150
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,848
Well, I don't think the
bottle would re-seal itself

151
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,617
after the, uh,
the wine leaked out.

152
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,555
Look, man, I'm not
passing judgment.

153
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,590
If I was you
and I got that letter,

154
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,258
I'd be pretty freaked out too.

155
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,862
Oh, there you go.

156
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, I guess
I'm gonna head out, um...

157
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:35,406
You're okay, right?
Yeah.

158
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,612
I could use some help.

159
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,883
I mean, with the letter.

160
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,953
If you haven't found anything
better to do with your free time.

161
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,727
How do you feel about
having some company over?

162
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,870
Nick: You know, Joan, I'm glad you
talked me into helping with him.

163
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,205
You ready to head to his place?

164
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,740
Shouldn't you be helping me?

165
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,843
Okay, I'm here, let's just
talk about this for a second.

166
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,579
I think I took it out too soon.
You didn't.

167
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,681
What if he has allergies?
He doesn't.

168
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,885
What if he doesn't like it?
He will.

169
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,686
What if he doesn't like me?

170
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,657
He probably doesn't even like
me, so it'll make two of us.

171
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,293
All right, nervous Nelly, what did
you do with my girlfriend this time?

172
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,961
I am not nervous Nelly.

173
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,663
Okay, you're not.

174
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,367
He's been living
an anchoritic lifestyle,

175
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,769
and I don't want to be the
reason he regrets his decision.

176
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,572
Is that even a word?

177
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,308
Reclusive.
Okay.

178
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,481
The food's perfect,
you're perfect,

179
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,983
and he's gonna wish
he did this six months ago.

180
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,386
You think so?
Absolutely.

181
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,423
All right, what do you
want me to do?

182
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,495
Tupperware?
Yeah.

183
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,067
How you doing over there?

184
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,102
Joan: Good,
just sauteing the garlic.

185
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,539
You're not gonna
eat that, are you?

186
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,177
Mmm, nice!

187
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,114
Is that the stuff with the
sesame, the, uh, the bernero?

188
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,817
<i>Cavolo nero,</i> also called Kale.

189
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,220
Oh, this looks really good.
Thanks.

190
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,034
Joan: You don't
like it, do you?

191
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,137
My wife used to make Kale.

192
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,241
Oh, uh, I hope I didn't...

193
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:55,112
No, they're just,
um, something th...

194
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:59,383
I'm her... uh, I'm sure
hers was much better.

195
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:02,753
Couple episodes of<i> top chef</i>
doesn't make me erudite.

196
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,689
Nick: Okay,
that's not a word.

197
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,994
I'm just saying.
Really, now?

198
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,764
It's a word.
Yeah, I don't think so.

199
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,232
What do you think?

200
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,539
Means, um, having
great knowledge.

201
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,010
Joan: Thank you.

202
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,479
Okay, merriam Webster,

203
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,548
I'd like you to meet
encyclopedia britannica.

204
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,920
I knew that one.
Yeah, right.

205
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,164
What?
Nothing.

206
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,370
So, that animus earlier
about the food situation.

207
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,873
Seems like wasted energy.

208
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,375
Did you just use
"animus" in a sentence?

209
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,110
I did, and correctly,

210
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:03,547
and I kinda think you want to
make out with me right now.

211
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,883
You think three syllables
is all it takes?

212
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,052
I think it's
a pretty good start.

213
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,520
I'm not that easy.

214
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,789
You're gonna have to come
up with something bigger.

215
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,925
Oh, you don't think I can?
I'd like to see you try.

216
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,228
A star?

217
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,731
Batman.

218
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,998
Oh!

219
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:00,070
Yeah, you're not gonna
get this one either.

220
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,373
That was a terrible Batman.
That was the Batman.

221
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,610
Mmm...

222
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,112
Peace sign?

223
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,714
Whoa, look at you,
one for two, huh?

224
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,153
It's so sad.

225
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,423
Are you still
thinking about that?

226
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,126
He was married, had a family.

227
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,027
Now he's all alone.

228
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,263
Not if we can help it.

229
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,299
Can we?
Yeah.

230
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,801
Look what we just did.

231
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,672
Go to sleep, all right?
Okay.

232
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,487
Joan: Nick?

233
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,261
Nick?

234
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,157
Oh, my god! Nick, Nick!

235
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,025
What's going on?
Something's grabbed my arm!

236
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,794
What do you mean?
Something's grabbed my arm!

237
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,028
Nick: What?

238
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,431
Whoa!

239
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,368
Is there... is there
somebody in there?

240
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,903
I don't know.

241
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,439
Get back, get back, get back.

242
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,532
You gotta be kidding me.
What?

243
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,935
It's the luggage.

244
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:27,771
You just had a bad dream,
and you were sleepwalking.

245
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,373
We both know that's
nothing new for you.

246
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,708
This was real.
No, it wasn't.

247
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,810
It seemed like
it was real, but it wasn't.

248
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,178
You thought someone
was in there.

249
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,847
That's because you did!

250
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,382
Look, we just had an earthquake,

251
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,784
all that stuff got tossed
around and it fell.

252
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,019
That's it.

253
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,525
Can I have some wine, please?

254
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,234
How about a hug,
can I have a hug?

255
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,443
Can I get a kiss?
No.

256
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,752
Tim doesn't know we were working with Dr.
Piccault, now with you.

257
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,587
Well, I don't think it's a
good idea to change that,

258
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,825
especially since you made, what
sounds like, pretty good progress.

259
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:26,063
I know you've consulted with
Dr. piccault in the past.

260
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,900
So, do you think Tim's case
is more my area of expertise?

261
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:33,770
I think your expertise is a
perspective that can only help.

262
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,705
And what does
Dr. piccault think?

263
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,843
He felt that Tim
was a unique case.

264
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,847
You do know that
a vast majority of the cases

265
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,283
have nothing to do
with the paranormal?

266
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,553
I mean, have there been events
that point to the paranormal?

267
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,621
Joan: No.

268
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,990
Well, it's basic.

269
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,827
You have Sage to burn, or osha?

270
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,225
Elinore?

271
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,764
Elinore!

272
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,953
Dr. sephton: <i>Look, I know an
abrupt change in therapist</i>

273
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,621
<i>can seem overwhelming.</i>

274
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,624
<i>So let's just start slow,
and we'll build from there.</i>

275
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:14,231
There's this feeling, rolling
around in the back of my head.

276
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,334
I can't quite place it.

277
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,402
And it never seems
to go away either.

278
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:24,608
Kind of like dread, maybe.

279
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,612
Existential dread is common
in cases like yours.

280
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,748
I'm not so sure about
the existential part.

281
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,484
So, you believe in destiny?

282
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,419
I believe decisions
are mine to make.

283
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,421
Like going outside?

284
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,789
You decide it.

285
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,225
Yes.

286
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,927
What if you had been locked out?

287
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,463
It didn't occur to me.

288
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,897
Consciously.

289
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,469
Anyway, still not
sleeping well at night?

290
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,004
Bad dreams?

291
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,605
Yes.

292
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,177
Being evicted
is traumatic for anyone.

293
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,015
For you, it's bound to wreak
havoc with your subconscious.

294
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,716
Manifesting your dreams.

295
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,956
And sometimes, I'm awake.

296
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,259
I'm not at all puzzled that
you're having anxiety attacks.

297
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,629
I...

298
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:24,934
I feel like things are really
happening that I know can't be.

299
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:30,940
Anxiety, and phobia, fear, stress, panic
are all rooted in the unconscious mind.

300
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,543
And they can project
themselves in many ways,

301
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,745
whether you are awake or asleep.

302
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,948
So it's normal?

303
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,485
Normal for you may not be
normal for someone else.

304
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,458
But this is
a good starting point.

305
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,405
Hey.

306
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,308
Well, I figured the sooner we
started, the sooner we can finish.

307
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,779
I'm not ready.

308
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,053
You're gonna have to
come outside eventually.

309
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,756
So I think we should just
peel the band-aid off, okay?

310
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,791
Can you do me a favor?

311
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,393
I want you to look
at me right here,

312
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,762
that's the bull's-eye
right there, okay?

313
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,798
Give me your hands.

314
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,835
Come on, I'm not gonna bite
you, give me your hands.

315
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,137
You can do it.

316
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,174
That's it.
Okay, all right, okay.

317
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,176
I just want you to put one
foot in front of the other,

318
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,711
just take one step.

319
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,647
Just like when you were a
kid, just give me one step.

320
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,083
All right, now give
me another one.

321
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,285
That's it.
Okay, come on.

322
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,354
Watch the step here,
give me one more.

323
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,522
Okay?

324
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,057
Come on, that's it.

325
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,392
One more.

326
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,094
You can do it, one more.

327
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,130
Look at the bull's-eye,
one more.

328
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,933
You're outside.

329
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,502
You did it.

330
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,593
One...

331
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,281
Hello?

332
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,150
Distorted voice:
<i>Joan can't help you.</i>

333
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,085
<i>Help you.</i>

334
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,753
What about her?

335
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,355
You leave her alone.

336
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,224
Distorted voice: <i>She
doesn't know what I know.</i>

337
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,658
What?

338
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,994
<i>Hindsight hasn't
taught you anything.</i>

339
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,020
Hey.

340
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,627
What are you doing back there?

341
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,133
I don't know that one.

342
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,304
Ow, not so hard.

343
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,405
Ow! Stop...

344
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,707
Oh, come on.

345
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,843
Oh, come on, come on.

346
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,102
You got me.

347
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:08,805
Well, how did you two
end up together?

348
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,074
Well, she has pretty good taste,

349
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,276
and I've got pretty good luck.

350
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:15,111
Mmm.

351
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,013
Yeah, she reminds me
of my wife, uh, carri.

352
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,148
Oh, how'd you meet her?

353
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,351
Uh, a styx concert, uh,
she passed me a joint.

354
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,420
No way, stoned
at a styx concert?

355
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,823
Any other way to see
styx in 1979?

356
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,424
Well, I guess not.

357
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,560
What happened to her?

358
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,533
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry,
man, I didn't...

359
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:40,670
Oh no, no it's okay, I've had more
than enough therapy, it's just...

360
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:44,407
After, uh, my wife
was taken, um,

361
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,641
my daughter, elinore...

362
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,478
Hit her hard.

363
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,246
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

364
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,650
Yeah, after my wife,
well, elinore...

365
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,120
Um...

366
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,790
Well, she ran away.

367
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,926
I don't blame her.
I wasn't exactly fit.

368
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,028
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

369
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,264
You're getting there.

370
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,873
Didn't mean to be a buzz kill.

371
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,207
No.

372
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,780
Uh...

373
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,783
Uh...

374
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,117
I'm probably going to turn in.

375
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:33,156
Oh, yeah, right, um...

376
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,527
Do you mind if I crash?

377
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,396
Sleep?

378
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:41,831
Here?

379
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,599
Yeah.

380
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:48,204
Joan and I, we kind of got into it
earlier and I just need some space.

381
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,812
Okay.

382
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,482
Thanks, man.

383
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,221
Goodnight.

384
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,088
What are you doing?

385
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,723
There's something in my room.

386
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,191
What? Now?

387
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,321
Tim!

388
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,089
Tim!

389
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,661
Tim? Tim.

390
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,564
Tim, Tim.

391
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,600
What the fuck are
you doing in here?

392
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,101
Tim.

393
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,202
Can you hear me?

394
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:02,238
Tim, wake up, are you...

395
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,773
What the...

396
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:07,109
Tim, wake up, Tim, Tim...

397
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,716
Jesus.

398
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,520
Are you all right?

399
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,426
And?

400
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:24,827
Nothing.

401
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,162
Nothing was there.

402
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:29,432
Makes me feel stupid
just talking about it.

403
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:32,368
Has he ever mentioned
seeing anything?

404
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,170
What do you mean?
What kind of things?

405
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,572
He's having severe
anxiety attacks, right?

406
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:39,275
Which is why I like to
give him a sleep test.

407
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,743
Something very simple.

408
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:43,312
You know, just to be able
to rule things in or out.

409
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,215
I would call someone and
have them come to him.

410
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,384
You think you could get
him to go for that?

411
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,058
Anna: This is the easiest
test you'll ever take.

412
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,095
All you have to do, is sleep.

413
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,735
What's this for?
Oh, really basic.

414
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:08,137
It remotely monitors
heart-rate activity.

415
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,541
That... that's all
you need to tell?

416
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,276
Oh, no.

417
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:17,947
This is just a simple way to see
if we need to do a full exam.

418
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,949
Okay.

419
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,885
Snoring a problem for you?

420
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,820
Depends on who's doing it.

421
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,994
You know, I don't mean to be
difficult, but I'm not tired.

422
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,929
Me neither.

423
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,031
How about we chat a bit?

424
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,433
Tim: I have a song.

425
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:38,601
Anna: Okay.

426
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,369
Tim: It's from
when I was a kid.

427
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,861
Joan: Anna!

428
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,935
Nick: You see?

429
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:18,874
I don't think he's breathing.

430
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,010
See, this is what
I was telling you about.

431
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:37,359
Nick: Luke, I am your father.

432
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,561
Did you see that movie?

433
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,029
Yeah. Yeah, do you
like science fiction?

434
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,597
I do, yeah.

435
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,898
I'm a big geek that way, let
me just see this for a second.

436
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,300
Is that too tight?

437
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,734
That's okay, it feels okay?

438
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,536
So that's it, it's sleep apnea?

439
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:51,373
Well, the c-pap should be
effective, but I'll be honest...

440
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,843
This is definitely outside
of the realm of normal.

441
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:55,945
Even for a sleep apnea.

442
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:58,147
We need to run
a full examination on him.

443
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,551
You're good at picking
up on things.

444
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:03,752
What do you think it is?

445
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,355
We know, through
scientific research

446
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:10,426
that the cerebellum is the part
of the brain that reduces dreams.

447
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,995
It's the very seat
of our unconscious mind.

448
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:16,065
Phobias, repressed feelings,
darkened thoughts.

449
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:19,902
The unconscious mind is a
powerful repository for them all.

450
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,471
So is it that much
of a leap to theorize

451
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,108
that paranormal phenomena would
manifest itself there first,

452
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,943
when we sleep?

453
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:30,946
Now you have quietly

454
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,316
led us all down this path.

455
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,418
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

456
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,356
Mmm.

457
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,528
Tim?

458
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,032
How did you get here
by yourself?

459
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,101
It's not that far.

460
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,403
What are you doing?

461
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,806
I wanted to say something.

462
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,809
Are you awake?

463
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,245
Does that change anything?

464
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,382
I don't know.

465
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,554
Have you ever done anything that at
the time seemed like a good thing

466
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,524
at hindsight proved you wrong?

467
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,628
Yes.

468
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,104
Hindsight.

469
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,274
Sorry, I liked you.

470
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,993
Nick:<i> I guess I can take
him back in the morning.</i>

471
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,772
Do you want to
talk about before?

472
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,710
Look, you said that
things were evolving.

473
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,379
Well, maybe they are.

474
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:46,582
But I'm not letting you
do this by yourself.

475
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:50,152
Whatever happens,
we're in this together.

476
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,753
You have anything
to say about that?

477
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,558
What if the sleep clinic
doesn't work out?

478
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,260
Why wouldn't it work out?

479
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,228
It's a simple question, Nick.

480
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,831
Why don't we deal with
that if we have to?

481
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,768
Look, it's been a long day.

482
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,705
Why don't you get some sleep?

483
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,507
Aren't you coming?

484
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,310
No, I better keep an eye on him.

485
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,245
I'll be okay, you go ahead.

486
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,692
Anna:<i> He should be dead.</i>

487
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:33,495
Normal, then an erratic beat,

488
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:36,498
then here. This is
a massive fibrillation.

489
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,367
And then...

490
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:40,435
He's... his heart just stops.

491
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:41,603
Joan: You mean
a heart attack?

492
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,605
No, that's not what a
heart attack looks like.

493
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,241
Can sleep apnea cause it?

494
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:50,746
Apnea causes a lack of oxygen, which
can cause your heart to stop.

495
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,315
So, how come, if he has
apnea, he's not already dead?

496
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,484
It's rare. Most of the
time, people wake up

497
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,551
when they can't breathe.

498
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,120
Then go back to sleep.

499
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:00,656
Just like you wake up when you
have to go to the bathroom.

500
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,958
People can drift in and
out of apnea all night

501
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,260
and never really
get a night's sleep.

502
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,296
Well, how long can someone
live after their heart stops?

503
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:11,566
In this scenario,
three or four minutes.

504
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,368
But it was stopped for longer.

505
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,671
If he wasn't dead, I don't
know how he could be alive.

506
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,473
Especially with no brain
damage, no side effects.

507
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,875
Joan: How does that happen?

508
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,243
That's what we're gonna
find out tomorrow night.

509
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:23,645
Shall we?

510
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:25,914
So, you're both free, and Jonathan too?
Nick: Mmm-hmm.

511
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,950
Joan: Yep. Nick: So,
how does this work?

512
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:32,888
We sold him on coming here, but Tim's
been asking me a lot of questions.

513
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,226
We wire him to more advanced
diagnostic programs

514
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,928
that monitor brain functioning.

515
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,863
Eeg, emg,

516
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,800
and then the data's transferred
back to my office computer.

517
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:45,967
So he just sleeps here?

518
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,436
He just sleeps here.

519
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,137
We can hear him through a
two-way intercom monitor,

520
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,507
so if he needs anything,
he just lets us know.

521
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,976
Look, I've done this more
times than I can count.

522
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,712
There's nothing
to be worried about.

523
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,148
Well, thanks, doc.

524
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,216
Thank you.

525
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,085
Thank you.
Thanks, see you soon.

526
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,098
Joan:<i> Did you tell him?</i>

527
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,333
Nick:<i> Yeah, I did.</i>

528
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,837
Joan: <i>How long is he
gonna hide in there?</i>

529
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,038
<i>Maybe he'd like
to come down here</i>

530
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,507
<i>and explain what's going on.</i>

531
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,509
Nick: <i>You know, Joan,
this agro-attitude</i>

532
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,743
is not gonna help.

533
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,474
Do you know anything
about what happened to Anna?

534
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,959
Nick said she had an accident.

535
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,428
Joan: Besides that?

536
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,564
No, how could I?

537
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,334
So much for your test.

538
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,202
Pretty bad timing
for you, right?

539
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,038
Bad timing for Anna too.

540
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,206
She comes in, tries to help

541
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,674
and something happens to her.

542
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,644
What about your wife?

543
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,614
You don't remember anything?

544
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,285
I was asleep when it happened.

545
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,520
That's it?
That's your story,

546
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,122
sleeping while your wife dies?

547
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:55,757
Of a stroke, right?

548
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:57,792
Did she scream for help?

549
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,939
I don't know what
you want me to say.

550
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,009
How about the truth,
for starters?

551
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,578
You must have heard
her scream something,

552
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,746
why can't you remember?

553
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:18,813
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

554
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,749
We're all
on the same team, right?

555
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,589
I'm sorry.

556
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,129
Hey, whoa, where are you going?

557
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,797
Wait, wait, where you...

558
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:37,799
Where are you going?

559
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,571
She's just a little strung out.

560
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,254
Dr. Andre: <i>This is Dr. Andre
piccault to patient Tim liston,</i>

561
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,023
<i>October 13th.</i>

562
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:17,492
<i>I've gotten very close
to Tim in recent months</i>

563
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,427
<i>and I've had a breakthrough.</i>

564
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,330
<i>When Tim sleeps, he
experiences an apnea state.</i>

565
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:25,333
<i>Uh, something supernatural
manifests.</i>

566
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:28,136
<i>It's like
he becomes like a bridge,</i>

567
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:30,505
<i>uh, that allows him
to cross over.</i>

568
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,143
<i>Tim.</i>

569
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,579
<i>Tim, what are you doing?</i>

570
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,655
<i>There's something in here.</i>

571
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:50,525
<i>You can hear it,
listen, right now.</i>

572
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,529
<i>Bad things always happen,
I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

573
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,412
What happened
to Dr. piccault?

574
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,616
He's in a coma.

575
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,088
Why do you have this?

576
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:32,100
You, and Dr. piccault,
and Dr. sephton.

577
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,669
Just one big lab rat,
aren't I, buddy?

578
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,938
No, no, you're taking
this the wrong way.

579
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,306
Does it even matter?

580
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,108
Do you see what's
happening right now?

581
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,845
Matters to me.

582
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,181
Yes.

583
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,349
In the beginning, it was work.

584
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,984
We could have left at any point,

585
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:54,155
and we didn't because of you
and how we felt about you.

586
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:57,258
Tim: That supposed to make me feel better?
Yeah, it should.

587
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,661
I put myself out there for you.

588
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,663
Now we're all in,
all three of us.

589
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,668
You're not afraid to
go outside, are you?

590
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,939
You're afraid of what happens
when someone comes in.

591
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,909
That's why you don't
have any family...

592
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,644
Or friends...

593
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,279
Or anyone.

594
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,614
You knew.

595
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,552
No, I coped.

596
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,721
Why?

597
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,389
Why didn't you say
something, or do something?

598
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,757
You could have stopped it.

599
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,062
Stop something I'm not aware of?

600
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,766
I've been through therapy,

601
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,235
drugged up,

602
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,137
institutionalized,

603
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,940
harassed by police.

604
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,545
What else is there
besides being alone?

605
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,282
Okay.

606
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,318
What do we know?

607
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:01,823
There's this thing, this dread.

608
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,525
And when you go to sleep,

609
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:08,129
this apnea happens and you
become a bridge for it.

610
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,200
I don't want to be
a bridge anymore.

611
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,670
Nick: So how do we
blow up the bridge?

612
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,506
Jonathan would know.

613
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,447
So what do we do
in the meantime?

614
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,249
We just gotta
keep you breathing.

615
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,586
I'm taking first watch.

616
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:26,974
Nick...

617
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,710
Nick, Nick!
Nick: What?

618
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,511
What, what, what? Tim: She's
right in front of me, Nick!

619
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,647
Where? Who? She's right in front...
Do something!

620
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,315
Where, where, where?
Anna, she's right there!

621
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,250
I don't see her, where is she?
There, there, there!

622
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:37,952
There's nothing there,
there's nothing there, man,

623
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:39,020
there's nothing there!

624
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,630
Tim: <i>Bad things always happen,
I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

625
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,550
Mmm.

626
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,255
I...

627
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:16,124
I don't know what to say.

628
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:17,859
How about you can help us?

629
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,397
Look, this...

630
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,233
You've got to understand
that there's no precedent

631
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:26,501
for this.

632
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,737
Maybe a few days.
Days?

633
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,006
We're not gonna
make it a few more days.

634
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:35,643
Yes, I need time to work
through this, process it...

635
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,578
How much time
do you think we have?

636
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,547
I have no idea.

637
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:43,017
I just don't want to end up
like what you just showed me.

638
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:46,821
I won't let that happen to Nick.

639
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,956
Not because of you or me.

640
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,594
You should have thought about
that before you started this.

641
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,035
Hey.

642
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:02,537
What did Jonathan say?

643
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,407
Did you get any sleep?

644
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,843
No, not really.

645
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:10,878
What did he say?

646
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,885
You do look tired, are you okay?

647
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,620
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

648
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:24,659
Nick, I'm sorry.

649
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:26,694
No, I'm sorry.

650
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,696
I should have listened
to you sooner.

651
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,166
I'll stay with Tim tonight.

652
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,334
No, that's on me.

653
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:35,136
Nick, I can do it, it's okay.

654
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,804
I don't want you
over there with him.

655
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,739
All I have to do
is keep him awake.

656
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,342
No.

657
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,644
It doesn't matter
if I'm here or there.

658
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:46,948
You said we'd take shifts.

659
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,250
I'll start tonight and
when you get some sleep

660
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,485
you can come over.

661
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,555
All right.

662
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,791
I'll set my alarm for midnight.

663
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:58,326
What did Jonathan say?

664
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,529
He said tomorrow
he'd have a plan.

665
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,432
Oh.

666
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,074
Oh, shoot.

667
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,059
Joan: <i>Hey, it's Joan.
Leave a message.</i>

668
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:14,061
What?

669
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,287
Daddy, daddy, wake up!

670
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:41,889
Daddy!

671
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,778
Bad dream.

672
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,288
I have something for you.

673
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,367
Mmm.

674
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,541
Mr. scribbles.

675
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,578
You forgot him when you left.

676
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,850
You knew?

677
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,724
I never stopped
thinking about you.

678
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,726
I never stopped
caring about you.

679
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,728
Elinore.

680
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,666
Never really was an
eviction, was there?

681
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,936
You needed a little push.

682
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:04,772
And Dr. piccault?

683
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,410
Getting him to take you on
was the real challenge.

684
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:15,549
I wanted to come back sooner,
I'm sorry it took me so long.

685
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,885
No.

686
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,923
I'm so sorry I wasn't
there for you.

687
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,626
I don't blame you.

688
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:27,928
I hope you know that.

689
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:30,898
I do.

690
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,601
I'm glad.

691
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,507
I wish I could have been stronger...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

692
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,277
You're stronger now.

693
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,616
So beautiful.

694
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,154
Proud of you.

695
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,069
Carri:<i> Help me!</i>

696
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,373
<i>Help!</i>

697
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:10,224
Where did this come from?

698
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:17,231
I found it at Tim's.

699
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:28,008
A lot of these seem like they're
Latin, like quorum, quota...

700
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,843
Now here's one, "quotidian".

701
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,346
Recurring daily.

702
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,082
Huh.

703
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:36,951
I'm not keeping you up, am I?

704
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,652
Mmm-mmm.
Okay.
