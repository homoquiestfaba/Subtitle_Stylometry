1
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,159
Thank you.

2
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,193
I got this.

3
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,496
I get it every year.

4
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,363
Remember you can't touch
anything until we get home.

5
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,136
You know it's not
that bad tonight.

6
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,939
I mean, how is it not raining.

7
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,307
Yeah, while I'm still
freezing my tits off.

8
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,543
You should worn a coat.

9
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,310
Why not wear something warmer?

10
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,513
Because it would
ruin my costume.

11
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,415
Oh, things we
sacrifice for beauty.

12
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:02,884
Girl you are too much.

13
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,355
Come on let's go across.

14
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,357
Wait it could be an animal.

15
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,792
What if it's a kitten?

16
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,193
Yeah, or maybe it's
a mountain lion

17
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,928
waiting to rip your face off.

18
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:14,160
Let's.

19
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,497
Go

20
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,465
Lily please It might
need your help, OK.

21
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,408
Oh, man I got you good.

22
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,845
You should see your face.

23
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,079
Nice run Rod.

24
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,514
You little buggers.

25
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,882
Nancy, were you in on this?

26
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,085
No, I swear it wasn't me.

27
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,921
How long were you in there?

28
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,823
Long enough.

29
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,691
Nice hair.

30
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:44,424
Thanks.

31
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:44,659
I like your hook.

32
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:50,196
Where are you supposed to be?

33
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,732
Isn't it obvious.

34
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:52,633
Oh, a prostitute.

35
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:59,305
Hey, bitch.

36
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,042
Girl tonight is going
to be lit as hell.

37
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,710
Are you ready?

38
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,011
Yeah, we just have
a few more blocks.

39
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,516
Believe me I am ready
to get a fucked up.

40
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,316
We can spell you know.

41
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,553
And we're so proud of you.

42
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,755
Girl, no we've got to go now.

43
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,289
Peter's already been
asking about you.

44
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,559
Wait, what?

45
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,193
Amy you said Alpha
Sigma rose party didn't

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,295
start until later tonight.

47
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,898
Yeah, I thought so too, but you
know how these frat bros are.

48
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,569
I promise, Nancy I
would take her trick

49
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,370
or treating all night.

50
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,140
Oh, no one's stopping them.

51
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,242
I took Tina Halfway, let
them finish on their own.

52
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,079
They're practically grown.

53
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,447
Yeah, please.

54
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:40,581
We'll be good.

55
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,615
Please.

56
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,985
Please, we'll be good.

57
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:50,323
OK, OK, OK, but stay clear of
weirdos and stick together.

58
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,260
There's safety in numbers,
and be home in an hour or mom

59
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,197
will kill us both.

60
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,465
OK.

61
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:57,799
Come on let's go.

62
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,540
Awesome tonight is
going to be legendary.

63
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,276
I'm going to eat
everything in sight.

64
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:10,978
Let's go there.

65
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,244
Yeah.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,679
OK.

67
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,491
Well, that's been poisoning.

68
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,458
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,660
We got so much candy.

70
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,462
Yeah, but nothing
scary happened.

71
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,031
No pumpkin smashing or anything.

72
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,067
I just wanted to do
something amazing.

73
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,469
Like what?

74
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:35,903
Boy like that.

75
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,981
No, way that's
scary Mary's house.

76
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,482
Whose scary Mary?

77
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,018
She's the town's oldest secret.

78
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,688
An old witch that
never leaves her house.

79
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,792
They said whoever came
up to her doorstep

80
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,896
she poisoned them, and
boiled them into stew.

81
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,665
And she ate them.

82
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:08,301
So many people would go
missing mostly kids like us,

83
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,907
girl scouts, paper boys anyone
who came knocking at her door.

84
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:16,076
They said she's horribly
mangled, and older

85
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,078
than the town itself.

86
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,115
The last people that
I came up missing

87
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:25,753
were one to two years before
you and your family moved in.

88
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,056
They said she's still there
waiting for her next victim.

89
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,825
Well, why didn't the
police just arrest her?

90
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,126
No, proof.

91
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:35,563
No, bodies left to identify.

92
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, well, it is just a story.

93
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,036
It's not like anyone
who know has seen her.

94
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:42,803
Then let's go.

95
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,270
What?

96
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,506
No.

97
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,508
No, one would answer
if it's just a story.

98
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,311
What if it isn't just a story?

99
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,947
Then maybe she has
some good candy.

100
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,114
I don't know.

101
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,883
Come on.

102
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,018
Imagine everyone's
face at school

103
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,721
when they hear we knock
on scary Mary's door.

104
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,756
We'll be legendary.

105
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,238
Well?

106
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,404
What?

107
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,840
Why me?

108
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:20,574
It's your idea you knock.

109
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,552
Well, it looks like
there's nobody home.

110
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,519
I'll be right there.

111
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,488
Holy shit she's real.

112
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,090
You think it's her?

113
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:36,991
Guys, we should go.

114
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,499
Oh, sweeties.

115
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,436
Aren't you just darling.

116
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,171
What are you
supposed to be dear?

117
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,244
Sorry, to bother you ma'am.

118
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,047
We were just trick or treating,
but it's getting late so

119
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:00,981
we should get and be--

120
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,549
Oh, of course.

121
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,317
No, no, no, dear.

122
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:03,817
Here.

123
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:04,018
Here.

124
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,724
Wow.

125
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,161
That looks amazing

126
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:17,798
And I can assure you it
tastes as good as it looks.

127
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,701
I don't get too many
visitors this time of year.

128
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,337
I bake so many goodies,
but all the stories

129
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,205
seem to keep many people away.

130
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,975
Stories.

131
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,611
Oh, yeah.

132
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,247
Not what you expected huh?

133
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:37,051
Not some scary hag
of a witch after all.

134
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,153
No, that's--

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,256
It's OK no harm, no foul.

136
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,224
Why don't you come in?

137
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,426
There's plenty more
where this came from.

138
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,728
Oh, no.

139
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:48,796
It's really getting late.

140
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,065
We should really go.

141
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,567
People love the
old woman company.

142
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,202
Otherwise it'll just
all go to waste.

143
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,066
Here we go.

144
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:34,541
Thank you so

145
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,811
You have an amazing home miss--

146
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,748
Mary, Mary Frederick.

147
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,683
Yes, not far from
scary Mary is it.

148
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:52,659
So are all of you lovers
of the arcane and occult.

149
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,895
What's that?

150
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,164
Arcane and occult oh it's
part of the inspiration

151
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,767
of Halloween.

152
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,270
Mystery and Lore that many
have been inspired by.

153
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,906
Do you know every
story you've ever heard

154
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,042
has its roots in the occult?

155
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,843
Do you know this kind of story?

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,614
Oh, I know all kinds of stories.

157
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:17,251
Many about the
wonders of the world.

158
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:20,154
Wonders that sometimes
cause great pain.

159
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:14,308
April I'm so sorry to
hear about you gene.

160
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,877
Your grandfather was one of the
nicest people I've ever met.

161
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,745
And he always had a
great story to tell.

162
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:19,813
Thank you.

163
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:19,980
That means so much.

164
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,898
Now watch the table I
have to go get more papas

165
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,234
things from the attic.

166
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:40,701
Now Matty.

167
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,948
Where did your grandfather
get all this stuff?

168
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,785
He used to be in a circus.

169
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,321
Are you talking about the big
giant tent with the flying

170
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,390
monkeys type circus?

171
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,994
No, the real kind.

172
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,329
Grandpa used to
tell me about how

173
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,132
you'd roll into town on the back
of his favorite elephant man.

174
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,338
And all the kids
would love to get

175
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,943
tickets to see him perform
tricks, jump the plane circled.

176
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,411
Balatine abuzz where
everyone cheered them on.

177
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,117
Hey, check this out.

178
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:36,957
The petrified boy.

179
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:44,131
See the bow of the
terrifying child of the devil

180
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,468
up close, but beware we
can't go to leave the soul.

181
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,170
Leave their soul?

182
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,441
This is clearly fake why
would anyone pay to see this.

183
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:53,774
It's true.

184
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:05,018
1873 is one they found him.

185
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:09,723
After the war they used
slaves to build the railroad

186
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,195
from New York to San Francisco.

187
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:19,766
Used to use Negro children to
take messages above ground.

188
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:25,973
One day freight train with too
much speed jump the tracks.

189
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:37,117
Barren, the most notorious great
master of his day found him.

190
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,529
All burned up and left
him dead by the railroad

191
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:49,096
workers and the union leaders.

192
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,169
Underneath mounds of
coal from the trains

193
00:13:56,236 --> 00:14:00,874
love screaming, while
slowly burning alive.

194
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:48,221
The most mysterious and
devious of them all.

195
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:56,096
Her name it's so gruesome, so
evil, so absolutely petrified.

196
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:07,442
Folks he cannot be viewed
outside the safety of these

197
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,878
very walls because if only
a slither of daylight were

198
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:16,484
to enter this very
room he would awake,

199
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,385
and he would punish those who
dare disturb his eternal rest.

200
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:32,166
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the petrified boy.

201
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,143
Ben traveled around the
country with his misfits

202
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,714
of bearded ladies,
and six legged tigers,

203
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,150
but the petrified boy was
always his main attraction.

204
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:30,585
For years his caravan grew in
size in his name and stature.

205
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:34,555
Sold out shows far beyond
their wildest imaginations.

206
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:37,123
People were so afraid
of the petrified boy

207
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,359
that the very
mention of its name

208
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,261
would scare the
patrons wallets thin.

209
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:04,444
Then one fateful morning
tragedy befell the circus.

210
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:18,760
What happened?

211
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,533
No, one knows what
really happened

212
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,537
to Ben, and his
masquerade of performers.

213
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:32,673
But your grandpa,
your grandpa believed

214
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,446
the workers exposed the boy
to sunlight in transport.

215
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:41,849
And the legend goes
whoever disturbs

216
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:46,988
the petrified boys
eternal rest while face

217
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:50,156
his wrath of vengeance.

218
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:59,634
Vengeance he can never be cured
for he must punish those who

219
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:00,868
left him dying in the darkness.

220
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:09,443
Thought there'd be
more of his stuff here.

221
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,751
Patty, I almost forgot
go back to the shed

222
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,452
and bring the rest
of papas things.

223
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:18,986
Make sure you bring your friend.

224
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,634
The windows.

225
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,602
There's lots of newspapers.

226
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:38,773
Whoa.

227
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,200
Whoa, that was creepy.

228
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,402
Yeah, it was.

229
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:14,642
Well, it is just a story.

230
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,342
You know, I never got
any of your names.

231
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,611
Oh, I'm Nancy.

232
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:20,213
This Tina, and that's Rod.

233
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,215
Pleasure to meet you.

234
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,452
You might want to take it
a little slow there honey.

235
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,087
There's plenty more to try.

236
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,188
Wow.

237
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:28,622
You make so much.

238
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:31,692
Well, like I said
I like to bake.

239
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,428
Cooking and baking is
a of a hobby of mine.

240
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,765
Just don't have many people
to cook for these days.

241
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,901
Well, we'll be back for sure.

242
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,938
Oh, aren't you the
sweetest thing.

243
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:47,908
So what do you do
all day besides bake?

244
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,243
Do you have a job?

245
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,050
I used to a long time ago,
but I was smart with my money.

246
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:59,720
I saved enough to last
my whole lifetime.

247
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,387
If you're not good
with saving you

248
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,257
could find yourself
desperate for work,

249
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,627
and sometimes even
the right work

250
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:07,628
can bring the wrong results.

251
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,742
As we gather here today still
reeling from the tragic death

252
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:21,976
of Gordon Rose.

253
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,618
We seek to make sense of
this to understand why?

254
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:31,052
Why this happened.

255
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:39,126
Why a young man was
ripped from us so early.

256
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:43,531
Unfortunately there
are no easy answers.

257
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:48,235
While God may know his
plan we certainly do not.

258
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,738
As difficult and
painful as it is we

259
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:54,407
must accept that Gordon is gone.

260
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,081
They're great.

261
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,018
I was a new kid at a new school.

262
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,721
I got beat up a lot.

263
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,462
But there was one kid who stood
up for me that was Gordon.

264
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,834
We've been best
friends ever since.

265
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:24,538
Follow me.

266
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,073
I'm sorry.

267
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,275
You're Carter here for the job.

268
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,543
Yes, yes, I am.

269
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,011
Follow me.

270
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:47,094
So you're an editor, right?

271
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:53,701
What school did you go to?

272
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,604
Well, I'm from Kansas
originally so I didn't exactly

273
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,839
go to a film school.

274
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:01,542
I mostly made my own
movies, learn by doing.

275
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:11,018
What kind of movies did you do?

276
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:11,886
Horror mostly.

277
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,391
Do you have any idea
what we want from you?

278
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,426
Yeah, to make the
funeral videos.

279
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:24,430
Life celebrations.

280
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:29,203
Life celebrations.

281
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,575
Here at Evergreen Cemetery we
are proud of our commitment

282
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:40,981
to help the living to blossom,

283
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:41,749
Right.

284
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,417
Gotcha.

285
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:52,192
We need you to make videos of
those who have crossed over.

286
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,497
OK and what turnaround
are you thinking for this?

287
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,065
From the time I take
the hard drive home

288
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:01,502
to editing to giving
you the final video.

289
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:06,774
You be doing the work
on site overnight.

290
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,310
If that's OK with you.

291
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,979
Yeah, that should be fine.

292
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,815
Can you make a
commitment Mr. Carter.

293
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:17,651
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

294
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:19,286
The young man that
was here before you,

295
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:24,758
Derek left us too soon.

296
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:30,898
We don't want someone that
will move on within a month.

297
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:40,975
We want someone that will
call Evergreen their home.

298
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,244
Would you mind if I ran all
this by my girlfriend first.

299
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:48,916
You go right ahead, but remember
there is a lot to be done.

300
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:52,953
And we would like you
here tonight if possible.

301
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,721
Oh, great.

302
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:55,222
Thank you.

303
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,958
Thank you, for your time.

304
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:58,692
I'll let you know
she was possible.

305
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:10,170
Fried tofu and a
beef and broccoli.

306
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,706
Here you go.

307
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:14,375
Are you serious?

308
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,010
What?

309
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:18,278
I can't leave you
forgot, Carter.

310
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:21,483
Oh, the chili garlic sure.

311
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,551
Oh, if I've only had some
of the back here for you.

312
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:24,785
Such a tease.

313
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,527
So.

314
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:36,030
So you should have
seen this guy who

315
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:38,899
I swear was creepier that
creepy smelled like him too.

316
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,134
Well, that's perfect.

317
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,902
It's your favorite show.

318
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:45,072
Yeah, but it's not why
we came out here is it?

319
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:46,474
I mean, we're supposed to be
here making our own films,

320
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:46,707
right?

321
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,147
How far can we stretch
your dad's inheritance?

322
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:05,659
Do you regret
following me out here?

323
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:09,630
Hey, no.

324
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:15,402
Baby, we're chasing our
dreams and this is what

325
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,337
your dad would have wanted.

326
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:19,640
He'd be proud of you.

327
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,842
I'm proud of you, and you're
going to be the next Alfred

328
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,446
Hitchcock, remember?

329
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,713
And you want to be [inaudible].

330
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,582
Grace Kelly, she
was his favorite.

331
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,183
I know.

332
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,719
I know.

333
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:36,056
Besides think of all the
great horror movie ideas

334
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:36,891
you're going to get
working at a cemetery.

335
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:45,399
I'm glad you came back.

336
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:49,703
I had a feeling that
it was meant to be.

337
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,207
Your first assignment
is Lorraine.

338
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:56,110
She was a sweet
old lady, and I'm

339
00:27:56,177 --> 00:28:00,814
sure that you will do
her memory justice.

340
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,351
The hard drive is in
your inbox on the desk.

341
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:08,255
Thank you.

342
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:21,869
Nice.

343
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,908
Stay up, stay awake Carter.

344
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,392
Oh, my God, I need a break.

345
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:18,792
Yeah.

346
00:29:52,893 --> 00:30:01,168
How

347
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:02,035
Hey, babe.

348
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,804
How's your new job?

349
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:05,640
Why did you send me that video?

350
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,241
What video?

351
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:08,909
Of Lorraine check your text.

352
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:13,880
I don't want you talking about.

353
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,349
I've just been here on packing.

354
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,416
Who's Lorraine?

355
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:16,984
Wait, wait, a minute.

356
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:17,217
Wait, wait.

357
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,194
Yeah, never mind.

358
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,530
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:32,299
I'm just pretty shot right now,
so I just need some coffee.

360
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,502
I'll be fine.

361
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:37,871
OK, well, why don't you come
home, and have a big sleep

362
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:41,141
with me, hitchie baby.

363
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,577
I just have to
export this video,

364
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:43,910
and then I'll be on my way OK.

365
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:44,512
OK, I'll see you soon.

366
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:09,437
Derrick, Derrick, How do I--

367
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:10,571
Oh shit.

368
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:10,971
The last editor.

369
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:16,611
This guy was my age.

370
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:55,082
OK, James.

371
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:02,256
Nice to meet you.

372
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:08,663
I've seen that picture before.

373
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:39,993
Hey, baby.

374
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,328
Who the hell is Derrick?

375
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,896
Who?

376
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,865
You know what I'm talking about.

377
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,099
Don't play dumb.

378
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,835
Baby, I don't know what
you're talking about.

379
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:49,604
What kind of sick games have
you been playing at, Heather.

380
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:50,872
I'm looking at a picture of you
two right now on my monitor.

381
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,906
I don't know who Derrick is.

382
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,374
He was the editor
here before me,

383
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,076
and now you've been
cheating on me with him.

384
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,479
I know you're scared.

385
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:01,915
You will be OK.

386
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,719
Heather, Heather, are you there?

387
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:05,787
Heather?

388
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:05,687
Stay with me.

389
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:13,427
You're dead.

390
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,127
You always dead.

391
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:55,603
As we gather here today still
reeling from the tragic death

392
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,439
of Carter Lamb.

393
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:01,776
We seem to make sense of
this, to understand why?

394
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:04,579
Why this happened.

395
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:07,080
As difficult and
painful as it is we

396
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:13,353
must accept that Carter is gone.

397
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,322
Well, I hope that
little yarn didn't

398
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,225
scare you too much my darlings.

399
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:22,395
Not for Rod apparently.

400
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:25,398
Luckily we don't have to
start working any time soon.

401
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:27,702
I'd hate to have to
work someplace scary.

402
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,837
Yeah, that's why I want
to be a fashion designer.

403
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:32,105
No, scary places for me.

404
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:34,074
Yeah, I would never
work at a morgue

405
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,878
no matter how much they pay me.

406
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:39,680
It's not like he wanted to
he just needed the money.

407
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:43,116
Yeah, well, I would never
need the money that bad.

408
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,887
You know your dad's not going
to pay for everything you know.

409
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,287
We're only kids for so long.

410
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:49,624
I'd rather steal for a living.

411
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:53,226
Oh, my dear.

412
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,830
There are many
repercussions of thievery

413
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:59,834
more beyond just the
risk of jail or prison.

414
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:02,470
Rod, was just joking ma'am he
wouldn't have the guts to steal

415
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:06,273
a penny from his grandma.

416
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,376
Well, thievery is
no laughing matter.

417
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,913
People take stealing
too lightly.

418
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,915
They are not aware of
the dangers they're

419
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,551
putting themselves in and
police the least of your worries

420
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,853
if you steal from
the wrong person.

421
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,455
Not everyone suffers
because of the law

422
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,558
some suffer different
consequences.

423
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:37,772
Are we really doing this?

424
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,542
Sure, why not we said we
wanted adventure, right?

425
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:43,310
I mean, they're place in town
we would go if you really

426
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,546
want to get your fortune read.

427
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:49,215
You're not got to do it
here to carnival weird tent.

428
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:54,455
Hello, anybody here?

429
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:55,455
Yo you've got customers
you want our money or what?

430
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:05,332
Come on let's go we can
do this another day.

431
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,333
Hold your horses.

432
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,902
Hold your horses.

433
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:08,368
I'll be right with you.

434
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,777
Well, now what have we here?

435
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,713
Aren't you a wonderful
looking young couple.

436
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,880
Yes.

437
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,214
Thank you.

438
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,083
Sit.

439
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,482
Sit.

440
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:34,495
So what can I do to young
folks for this evening?

441
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:37,098
We want to get
our fortunes read.

442
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:40,034
Well, you've come to the
right place for that my dear.

443
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,167
What about you?

444
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:43,904
Me?

445
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:47,340
Are you here for a reading
as well or just along

446
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,110
for the ride?

447
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,544
I--

448
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,145
He wants one as well.

449
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,781
Excellent.

450
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:55,181
Well, let's not
waste any more time,

451
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,485
and get started then, shall we?

452
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,152
Wow.

453
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,056
Your crystal ball is beautiful.

454
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:04,125
Well, thank you.

455
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,225
How old is that?

456
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,629
Oh, hundreds of years.

457
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:11,866
It's been in my
family for generations

458
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,233
ever since we first ventured
into the mystic arts.

459
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:21,142
Everything all right, dearie?

460
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:24,210
Yeah, I'm fine.

461
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:26,212
Excellent.

462
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:28,181
So let's begin, shall we?

463
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:28,716
Yes, please.

464
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,990
No, where are my plastic cards.

465
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:39,760
Must have left them in the back.

466
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:42,697
Forgive me sometimes I swear
if I didn't have my head

467
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:45,032
attached it would go missing.

468
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:45,265
Be back in a jiffy.

469
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,236
You OK?

470
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:50,638
Perfect.

471
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,750
What are you doing?

472
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:06,120
We said we wanted
adventure, right?

473
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:07,521
Come on let's take it.

474
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:09,355
Come on let's go, go, go, go.

475
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,025
What are you doing with that?

476
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:12,493
You hear me?

477
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,896
You get back here this instant.

478
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,665
You'll rot in hell
for what you've done.

479
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:25,072
Oh, my God can you
believe we did that.

480
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:25,640
What a rush huh?

481
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:31,244
And why did you do that?

482
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,447
What do you mean?

483
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,916
To spice things up that
was the whole point, right?

484
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:39,252
In fact I'm feeling
a little frisky so.

485
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,054
I think you're--

486
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,421
What do you say?

487
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,557
--missing the point.

488
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,726
I'm missing the point.

489
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,862
Yeah, Abby.

490
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,164
When we said we need
to switch things up.

491
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:53,968
I mean, doing stuff like
this take things like that.

492
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:55,936
That's not what we
were talking about.

493
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,105
No, that's not what
you were talking about.

494
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:01,041
So tell me Jonas what does
excite you these days, having

495
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,309
a Manhattan rather than a beer.

496
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:04,645
Because that's going real big
especially considering what

497
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,247
you've already done.

498
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:07,380
Because on a scale
from one to 10

499
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:08,549
I think you've broken the scale.

500
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,718
Abby, let's not go there.

501
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,520
Oh, you don't want
to go there huh?

502
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,121
Well, I don't want to find
out that my husband had

503
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,356
to find excitement by
going to another woman.

504
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:21,028
I said don't we've already
done that and work through it.

505
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:21,461
At least I thought we did.

506
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,571
I don't even know you anymore.

507
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:33,373
Ditto on that front.

508
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,109
I'm going to bed.

509
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,844
Sure.

510
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,445
Walk away just
like you always do,

511
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,280
but you know what even
after everything you

512
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,715
did I'm still here.

513
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,450
You got do this shit like that
again to spice up our lives.

514
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:47,121
Do me a favor don't include me.

515
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:47,121
Fine.

516
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,993
Don't touch me.

517
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,128
You ruined our lives.

518
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:01,161
How'd you do that?

519
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,964
What?

520
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,733
Nothing.

521
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,167
I'm going to go back to bed.

522
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:28,389
You're not yourself you know.

523
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:30,157
What?

524
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,894
I said you're not yourself.

525
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:34,895
I haven't been in a while.

526
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:45,039
I'm going to go get dressed.

527
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:49,643
What about breakfast?

528
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,044
You eat it.

529
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:18,072
Jonas.

530
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,566
What happened?

531
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:20,167
What happened?

532
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:21,769
What is it?

533
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,537
He was there.

534
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:24,038
Who's here?

535
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,072
The man.

536
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,407
Who?

537
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:27,509
The man from the carnival.

538
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:28,443
The old guy from the carnival.

539
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,411
The fortune teller.

540
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:31,612
Honey, there's no way
that man will come here.

541
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,546
I swear.

542
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:33,814
I just saw him.

543
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:34,381
He was right in our bedroom.

544
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,250
Baby, come on.

545
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:39,487
I'm telling you.

546
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:40,654
We're taking the
fucking thing back.

547
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,790
No, we can't.

548
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:43,991
I've had enough of this.

549
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:47,194
No, we're not taking it back.

550
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:49,830
We're not keeping it.

551
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:50,764
No, no, we're not
taking it back.

552
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:51,499
No, Jonas.

553
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:51,732
No.

554
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,805
I'm sorry.

555
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:58,772
I didn't mean--
I didn't mean to.

556
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,945
We're getting rid of this now.

557
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,421
What the hell?

558
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:17,991
Where did they go?

559
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,594
There's no way they could
have backed up this fast.

560
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:20,861
No, way.

561
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,899
I guess it's ours now.

562
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:26,200
We're keeping it.

563
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:36,911
Just trying to explain.

564
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:34,468
We want our lives.

565
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:40,340
I'm just trying to explain.

566
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,075
Don't touch me.

567
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:04,164
She never let me have anything.

568
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:05,633
What?

569
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,468
She never let me have anything.

570
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:10,370
Do you know that?

571
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:13,907
Not the clothes I want, not the
food I want, not the friends I

572
00:46:13,974 --> 00:46:17,044
want to be with,
not even happiness.

573
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:18,546
I thought you did once, but
you took that from me too.

574
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:22,282
You ruin everything.

575
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,885
And how could you?

576
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:27,821
And all this time with her.

577
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,289
I wanted us to say
something and I did.

578
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,190
About what?

579
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:32,125
You were scared?

580
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:35,463
You ruined our lives,
my life, and for what?

581
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,263
No, no, for what?

582
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,197
Abby, please.

583
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:39,333
A corkscrew?

584
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,267
Abby, please.

585
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:43,671
Don't touch me.

586
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:44,071
I'm just trying to explain.

587
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:55,550
I hate you.

588
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:10,665
Oh, my God.

589
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:11,932
What did you do?

590
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,340
I didn't do.

591
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:20,708
I didn't Do.

592
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:24,111
I'm sorry.

593
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:25,179
Ma'am, did you
kill your husband?

594
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:36,390
Miss Frederick.

595
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:37,725
Oh, please dear.

596
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,727
Mary is just fine.

597
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:42,362
Oh, sorry.

598
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:47,234
Mary, you sure know how
to tell a scary story.

599
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,970
Well, it wouldn't make
much sense for people

600
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:55,342
to call me scary Mary if
I wasn't somewhat scary.

601
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:58,178
So why are so many
people afraid of you?

602
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,346
Oh, Rod.

603
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,516
What?

604
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,051
It's just that there's
so many stories about it.

605
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:04,985
Yeah, no, shame in asking
an innocent question.

606
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,859
This town has always had a
certain way of doing things.

607
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:15,162
What do you mean?

608
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:21,301
Oh, I just prefer
to stay by myself,

609
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:22,903
and the more I stayed alone
the more they resented me

610
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,406
for my solitude.

611
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:28,942
So I guess making up stories
was the only thing they

612
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:32,680
could do to make me stay alone.

613
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:35,650
Well, that's rude of everyone.

614
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:38,686
Yes, it is.

615
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:41,855
What about the missing kids?

616
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:45,425
Now that I can't explain.

617
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:49,329
Every town has its secrets I
guess that just rather blame me

618
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,099
than take responsibility
themselves.

619
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:56,437
Well, I for one
never believed it.

620
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:58,238
What?

621
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,107
Is just a bunch of
dumb crazy rumors.

622
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:04,077
And crazy is the word, isn't it?

623
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:07,482
That reminds me
of another story.

624
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:11,719
A story about just how crazy
someone may or may not be.

625
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:30,505
I hear you.

626
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,476
I said I hear you.

627
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,214
What do you need
from me this time?

628
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,257
OK, but I have
nothing against Frank.

629
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:58,065
You would know best.

630
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,653
Sorry, friend.

631
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,854
Sorry, friend.

632
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:20,320
Let him go Gerald.

633
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:22,355
I have my orders.

634
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:22,989
Oh, man.

635
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:23,925
Let the man go.

636
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:25,125
I have my orders.

637
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:25,992
I have my orders.

638
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:26,861
Let him go Gerald.

639
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:29,196
I have my orders.

640
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:31,164
Don't worry about me, Dave.

641
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,468
I'm protected by God.

642
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:35,368
Blast me.

643
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:36,871
God must be on lunch
break because, Gerald

644
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,906
here almost squashed your ass.

645
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,140
No, one loves you.

646
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:42,443
Gerald is mentally ill.

647
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,477
There's a lot of that go
around here lately, huh?

648
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,883
You're going to be a
good boy now Gerald.

649
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,117
I am a servant of God OK.

650
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,119
Let's move out of the way OK.

651
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:55,456
Let me go, and
finish his doings.

652
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:58,091
How is it that God told
you to choke Frank,

653
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,293
and Frank said God protect him.

654
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,195
This man is crazy.

655
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:03,029
He is crazy I tell you.

656
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:03,798
He's crazy.

657
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:05,298
No warnings.

658
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:06,667
One more time in
the rubber room.

659
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:07,602
It wasn't me.

660
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:08,034
I like Frank.

661
00:51:08,101 --> 00:51:09,369
He's my friend.

662
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,304
Frank tell them I'm a friend.

663
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:13,474
You know what I
[inaudible] you did, Frank.

664
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,309
God doesn't speak
to either of them.

665
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:19,514
They're schizophrenic
living in a dream.

666
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:24,117
How do you know you're
not living in a dream?

667
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:26,654
I know what's real
and what's not.

668
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:30,825
You people who collect
souls and torment

669
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:34,261
cast them together with
visionaries and prophets.

670
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:37,297
You are the ones
that confuse reality.

671
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:40,066
You don't hear when
God talks to you.

672
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:43,270
And you hear, you listen.

673
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:47,040
And understand.

674
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,876
If Jesus were to walk in here
and proclaim his divinity

675
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:51,512
what would happen?

676
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:54,949
He'd be called schizophrenic
dosed with Dorsey.

677
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:57,919
If you'd been living in
Brooklyn for 15 years working

678
00:51:57,986 --> 00:52:01,054
in an insurance office
without ever mentioning

679
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:06,293
the minor fact that he was the
Son of God until two weeks ago.

680
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,064
Yeah, we'd naturally
be skeptical.

681
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:15,703
Up until two weeks ago you've
never claimed to hear God,

682
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:20,106
and you had killed your
wife or your children.

683
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:23,243
It was a test.

684
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,881
God was testing me.

685
00:52:26,948 --> 00:52:28,816
Why would God want you to
kill the people you loved?

686
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:36,122
He told me he would destroy
the world if humanity

687
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:40,494
continued to ignore him.

688
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,763
That I had to be the
instrument of his will.

689
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:49,302
Oh, OK.

690
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:49,804
I didn't ask for
this responsibility.

691
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:58,713
How do you know you're no
different than Gerald or Frank?

692
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:08,656
I don't hear a voice
when God speaks to them.

693
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,493
Who else hears God
when he speaks to you?

694
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:19,634
Everyone.

695
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,742
When God speaks to
you everyone hears.

696
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:30,578
Of course, if I was
the only one who heard

697
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,379
I would consider the idea
that I might be crazy.

698
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,184
Did anyone else hear God when
he spoke to you in the police

699
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:39,987
station?

700
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:42,456
No, he whispered.

701
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:45,826
Oh, yeah, he whispered.

702
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:49,396
Did your wife hear God when
he ordered you to kill her?

703
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:53,868
No, she wasn't in the room.

704
00:53:53,935 --> 00:53:57,203
What if God chose to
speak to you right now

705
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,107
will I hear his voice?

706
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:00,541
Yes.

707
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:22,963
Well, I guess God doesn't have
anything to say at the moment.

708
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:29,570
Perhaps he is meditating or he
is busy or he's on a journey.

709
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:32,540
But perhaps he's sleeping
and needs to be awakened.

710
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,909
Kings chapter 18 verse 27.

711
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:42,717
You tell me, Elijah
how do you know it's

712
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:45,453
God that's speaking to you?

713
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,589
It sounds like the voice of God.

714
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:54,729
So does James Earl Jones,
but that'll make him Jehovah.

715
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:58,833
Doctor, God talks
to me and you hear

716
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,335
that would mean I wasn't
psychotic wouldn't it.

717
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:04,739
Or that I am.

718
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,541
And if everyone hears
it mass hysteria.

719
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,446
Let's cross that bridge
when we get to it.

720
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:15,281
That's a deal.

721
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:15,583
A covenant.

722
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:23,057
We'll talk again soon, Tom.

723
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:23,291
Elijah.

724
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:28,596
Yeah, Elijah.

725
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:46,881
Elijah is here.

726
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:25,820
There's a cloud as
is a man's hand.

727
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,422
Rise Arvis.

728
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:32,893
Elijah, is here.

729
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,131
Go up to Ahab and say
prepare your chariot,

730
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:40,366
and go down before
the rain stops you.

731
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:42,002
But Judge Judy's on.

732
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,304
No, you must.

733
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:46,372
You must.

734
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:47,575
Come on relax.

735
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:50,343
It's Judge Judy time.

736
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,814
Yeah, hear oh Lord.

737
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:56,584
Hear me that this is people may
know that you are the true Lord

738
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:01,488
God, and that you have turned
their hearts back to you

739
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:03,724
once again.

740
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,359
What are you doing, Elijah?

741
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:08,863
Did you hear that?

742
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,233
It's probably somebody
just messed with the PA.

743
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:12,600
Yes, Lord.

744
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:23,777
I have been very jealous
for the Lord God of hosts,

745
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:27,380
for the children of Israel have
forsaken your covenant torn

746
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,216
down your altars and killed
your prophets with the sword.

747
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:39,260
I alone am left, and they
seek to take my life.

748
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,630
Go out and stand on the
mountain before the Lord.

749
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,201
Yes, Lord.

750
00:57:47,268 --> 00:57:48,435
I hear your Lord.

751
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,504
I hear you Lord.

752
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:53,374
You've come back Lord.

753
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,643
You heard it to?

754
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:01,382
I heard something.

755
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:04,051
Me too.

756
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:04,484
This is crazy.

757
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:17,498
It's not crazy neither
am I. Come near me.

758
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:21,568
He's a prophet of God.

759
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,137
What's going on?

760
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:23,904
Tom, what are you doing?

761
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:33,380
Seize the prophets of Baals.

762
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:34,181
Let not one of them escape.

763
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:43,557
I am not troubled the house
of [inaudible] It's you

764
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:46,327
and your father have.

765
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:49,596
And that you have forsaken
the commandments of Lord.

766
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:53,367
Tom, Elijah.

767
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:56,870
I can help you This is
just a psychotic episode.

768
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:59,506
Is it?

769
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:02,743
Hear the voice of the Lord.

770
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:05,913
I am almighty God.

771
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,116
Walk before me and be blameless.

772
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,750
Doctor what is it?

773
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:14,755
It's the voice of God.

774
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:27,801
Is that you, my Lord Elijah.

775
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:35,142
It is I. Go tell your
master Elijah is here.

776
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,608
How is he doing?

777
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:09,676
It's getting crowded in there.

778
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,545
He's speaking and
responding as up

779
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,048
to eight separate individuals.

780
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:17,384
Is he still maintaining the
delusion about hearing God?

781
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,421
Yes, doctor although now
all eight personalities

782
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:20,754
can hear the voice.

783
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:30,532
We are together now is one
for the Lord speaks to us all,

784
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,735
and we hear and we obey.

785
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:35,903
And we understand.

786
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:42,209
What are you doing, Elijah?

787
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:52,853
Awaiting your word oh,
Lord for Elijah is here.

788
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:07,334
Whoa.

789
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:13,173
Are you OK?

790
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,208
Maybe the story
upset his stomach.

791
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:19,447
I feel funny.

792
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:23,551
Oh, my, my, my I
told you to take

793
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:25,986
it slow with the sweet honey.

794
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:29,857
I guess I did overdo it.

795
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:31,291
Oh, it's OK.

796
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:32,926
The sweets are fine.

797
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:35,530
It's just Rod here
didn't pace himself.

798
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:38,732
Now all that sugar
is catching up.

799
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,436
I think I need to
use the bathroom.

800
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,303
Oh, of course, you do.

801
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,772
It's all the way
down the back there.

802
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:45,873
Go on, dear.

803
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:51,412
Right up the stairs.

804
01:01:57,918 --> 01:01:59,386
Maybe we should get
going Rod should really--

805
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:01,922
Oh, no need.

806
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:05,826
Oh, Rod is a big boy and
the night is still young.

807
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:06,894
He just needs to settle
his stomach that's all.

808
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:15,135
Oh, it must be the bathroom
door it sometimes gets stuck.

809
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:17,738
Now how about another
story to pass the time.

810
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:18,472
I'm sure Rod won't mind.

811
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:24,478
This one is about
a great artist.

812
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:43,498
Killing him was easy, getting
away with it was murder.

813
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:46,501
I never should have trusted her.

814
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:49,403
I never should have trusted
any woman even one as beautiful

815
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:49,837
as Ruby.

816
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:07,321
I don't usually do
this in the first date.

817
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:08,855
Do what?

818
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:09,456
Come back to some dude's pad.

819
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,564
OK, I feel special.

820
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:18,332
Yeah, you're special.

821
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:18,899
Very special.

822
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,571
So you're an artist.

823
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:31,646
I'm trying to be.

824
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:36,083
Right now I'm a starving
artist, but when I'm dead

825
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,220
all these paintings
will be worth millions.

826
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,890
I noticed you like to use a
lot of red in your paintings.

827
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:46,694
Well, there's a reason for that.

828
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:50,430
I mixed my own blood
with the paint.

829
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:54,401
It's my signature.

830
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:55,503
My old man is a painter.

831
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,970
Your father?

832
01:03:57,037 --> 01:04:00,274
No, my old man.

833
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:00,207
My husband.

834
01:04:03,545 --> 01:04:05,345
You're married.

835
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:06,813
You didn't think I'd
be available did you?

836
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,551
I was amazed at my good luck.

837
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:13,521
Well, it's about to get better.

838
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:20,227
My husband is Oliver Prairie

839
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:25,966
Oliver Prairie Oh, my
God, I love his work.

840
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:27,535
He's my biggest inspiration.

841
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:27,502
So I noticed.

842
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:35,976
And I copied his style.

843
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,178
I actually started by
making exact replicas

844
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:41,882
of his early work
just for practice.

845
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:43,984
I didn't try to sell
any of them, though.

846
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:46,754
That would be
forgery wouldn't it?

847
01:04:46,821 --> 01:04:49,156
Yes, it would.

848
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:54,328
And that would be
bad wouldn't it?

849
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:58,599
Yes, very bad.

850
01:04:58,666 --> 01:04:59,266
You have something
against being bad?

851
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:06,340
It depends.

852
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,042
On what?

853
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:09,910
I know who I'm being bad with.

854
01:05:25,794 --> 01:05:30,698
I think we should slow down a
little, so I get to know you.

855
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:32,933
Sure.

856
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,802
I'm sorry to hear.

857
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,970
You're so beautiful.

858
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:40,207
I'd love to paint you.

859
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:44,211
Artist always say the word
paint as if it was fuck.

860
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:47,582
It can be even more
intimate sometimes.

861
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:52,252
Oliver's painted me although
he stopped recently.

862
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:56,022
In fact he stopped
painting altogether.

863
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:56,524
And I am saying the
word as if it was fuck.

864
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:07,468
Look I have to
tell you something.

865
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:17,244
I met Oliver, I showed
him my paintings.

866
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:21,081
He was very effusive
with his praise.

867
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,383
He bought a shitload of them.

868
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:28,589
He told me one day I'd
be famous like him.

869
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:32,392
You'd better hope not like him
his paintings aren't selling.

870
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:34,896
Except to sell off
almost everything.

871
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:38,800
He is broke and
seriously in debt.

872
01:06:38,867 --> 01:06:43,170
Oliver Prairie is broke.

873
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:44,971
I find that hard to believe.

874
01:06:45,038 --> 01:06:48,275
It's true, flat
broke, desperate.

875
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,948
And I feel even
worse about this.

876
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:55,415
You shouldn't be here with me.

877
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,657
I came home with
you for a reason.

878
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:05,560
What reason?

879
01:07:05,627 --> 01:07:08,496
You know what you
said before about how

880
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:11,632
your paintings would be worth
millions after you were dead.

881
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:12,533
I was joking.

882
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,101
I'm not.

883
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:18,071
Oliver's paintings
would be worth millions

884
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:19,607
after he dies, tens of millions.

885
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:25,713
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

886
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,079
I think I am.

887
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:33,019
I think you're crazy.

888
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:35,490
Why would I even consider?

889
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,892
Because you did sell some of
your early copies of Oliver's

890
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:38,425
of his paintings, didn't you?

891
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:49,871
Yes, yes, I did.

892
01:07:49,938 --> 01:07:52,507
OK, I admit it.

893
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:56,644
I was flat broke, and I'm
sorry now that I did it.

894
01:07:56,711 --> 01:08:00,815
But times were hard, and
I didn't have a choice.

895
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:03,316
So I figured that you
might be interested in not

896
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:05,920
being flat broke,
and interested in not

897
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:08,255
going to jail for forgery.

898
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:10,123
Are you blackmailing me?

899
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:13,494
Absolutely.

900
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:17,832
And all you have to do is commit
one little very profitable

901
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,300
murder.

902
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,102
Why don't you do it yourself?

903
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:24,672
You're the artist.

904
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:26,206
So you write that you should
make Oliver's of his paintings

905
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:27,609
immortal and invaluable.

906
01:08:31,012 --> 01:08:33,413
I never killed anyone.

907
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,882
Your paintings are
filled with bloodshed.

908
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:36,182
That's art.

909
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:38,019
But you paint with blood, Terry.

910
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:41,221
My own.

911
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,356
Artist evolve, don't they?

912
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:57,337
How would we do it?

913
01:08:57,404 --> 01:09:00,173
Let's talk about that after.

914
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,009
After what?

915
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:02,376
After we do it.

916
01:09:34,307 --> 01:09:35,241
Right there.

917
01:09:35,308 --> 01:09:35,843
Right there.

918
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,055
You did it.

919
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:51,726
I did.

920
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:56,998
Soon, baby very soon your
money troubles will be over.

921
01:09:57,065 --> 01:09:58,466
Oh, this works.

922
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:02,302
It will, you'll see.

923
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:05,873
Wait, what?

924
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,676
Yeah, look who's awake
not yet lover boy.

925
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,803
What's happening?

926
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,438
What's happening?

927
01:10:37,505 --> 01:10:39,940
What's happening?

928
01:10:40,007 --> 01:10:43,444
You're about to paint your
masterpiece my young friend.

929
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:45,446
I don't understand.

930
01:10:45,513 --> 01:10:48,849
And you are correct.

931
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,484
My paintings will be more
valuable once I'm gone

932
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:56,490
but you see so will yours.

933
01:10:56,557 --> 01:11:02,228
Much, much more valuable
because you're a genius.

934
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:07,200
Unappreciated now of course,
but the legend surrounding

935
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:11,939
your suicide, and the painting
you left behind is your legacy

936
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:15,776
will cement your place in the
hierarchy of the art world.

937
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:17,712
You're insane.

938
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:20,147
You're insane.

939
01:11:20,214 --> 01:11:20,915
Almost definitely.

940
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,588
How can you do this to me?

941
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:31,992
I'm an art lover
get it over with.

942
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:32,059
No.

943
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,968
Now I will have
you sign your work.

944
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,368
Stop please.

945
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,138
Stop.

946
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:44,539
No.

947
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:31,752
It's done.

948
01:12:35,723 --> 01:12:38,859
It's greatest work
in my opinion.

949
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:41,095
He was a genius.

950
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:44,698
I just murdered a great artist.

951
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:48,334
And helped him
achieve immortality.

952
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:51,772
It also doesn't hurt that you
own so many of his paintings,

953
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:54,875
and I own so many of yours.

954
01:12:54,942 --> 01:13:00,981
Oh, sorry, Oliver.

955
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:03,617
So sad.

956
01:13:03,684 --> 01:13:07,555
Two artists one
young and unknown.

957
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:10,291
The other older
and past his prime

958
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:12,358
we're in love with
the same woman,

959
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:16,630
and they mad at each
other violently.

960
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:17,131
I wish I'd been
there to stop it.

961
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,570
You fooled me.

962
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:25,873
How could you?

963
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:30,277
Oliver darling you
never appreciated me.

964
01:13:30,344 --> 01:13:30,878
I'm an artist too.

965
01:13:59,907 --> 01:14:00,841
I call this my red period.

966
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:33,707
That story a bit too
much for both of you.

967
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:37,645
No, I think I ate too much.

968
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:41,448
Oh, it's the sugar rush.

969
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:44,952
You've had the ups and now
you're feeling the downs.

970
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:45,152
Here.

971
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,424
Thank you, Ms--

972
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:52,860
I mean, Mary.

973
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:56,030
You're very welcome dear.

974
01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:57,198
Now make sure you
drink that right up.

975
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,406
You know we should
really get Rod.

976
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:12,112
No, I mean, I'll
go check on him.

977
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,481
Now you just make sure
you drink that right up,

978
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:15,816
Oh you'll need
all that hydration

979
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:18,085
to even out the sugar.

980
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:18,953
Just wait there
I'll be right back.

981
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:26,126
I don't feel too good Nancy.

982
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:28,696
Do you think Rod's OK?

983
01:15:28,763 --> 01:15:31,231
Yeah, he just ate too much.

984
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:34,001
You know how much
Rod likes to eat.

985
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:37,271
What's wrong?

986
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:40,341
I think we should get out
of here as soon as we can.

987
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:43,410
Where are you going?

988
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:46,280
Oh, we were just
going to get Rod.

989
01:15:46,347 --> 01:15:49,116
Oh, sweetheart he just left.

990
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:50,551
What?

991
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:51,819
What do you mean he just left?

992
01:15:51,886 --> 01:15:52,987
Why would he just leave?

993
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,322
It's OK.

994
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:57,691
He just felt like he
needed to go home and rest.

995
01:15:57,758 --> 01:15:59,860
I let him out the back.

996
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:04,264
No, we need to leave.

997
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:10,004
Oh, Nancy dear you can
barely hold yourself up.

998
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:15,976
Oh, you need all hydration
you can get come on drink up.

999
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:18,946
Just relax and then after
this last story both of you

1000
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:20,114
will be as right as rain.

1001
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,229
You asked for it.

1002
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:38,332
I'll wait for you to go to sleep
so I can get Santa to give all

1003
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,600
your present.

1004
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,201
Shut up.

1005
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:43,237
All the presents.

1006
01:16:43,304 --> 01:16:45,139
Mom.

1007
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:46,673
Mom.

1008
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,443
Get off of me.

1009
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,144
Hey, what's going on here?

1010
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:52,613
Hey, hey, boys.

1011
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:52,847
But mom.

1012
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,152
It's all make believe anyway.

1013
01:16:58,219 --> 01:16:58,786
No, it's not.

1014
01:16:58,853 --> 01:16:59,521
Take it back.

1015
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,121
Make me.

1016
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:04,725
You two bed now.

1017
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:11,365
Can you tell us a
Christmas story.

1018
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:12,467
Yeah, a Christmas story.

1019
01:17:12,534 --> 01:17:13,133
Please.

1020
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,936
Please.

1021
01:17:16,003 --> 01:17:18,205
OK, all right, but after this
no more messing around OK?

1022
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:29,216
I think it's time for me to read
you all the true story of how

1023
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:29,850
Christmas came to be.

1024
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:42,429
The story begins as all do,
but on this particular day

1025
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:46,468
of Christmas another
tale was meant to be.

1026
01:17:46,535 --> 01:17:51,672
It's a story about how the
day of giving came to be,

1027
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:54,408
and it began with the
Krampus earth elf.

1028
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:04,519
A tale of two brothers
one from the light

1029
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:09,356
and the other of the dark.

1030
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:12,893
The elf was hard at work on a
special tour for a little girl.

1031
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:19,233
Knowing that if the
children around the world

1032
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,136
awoke to a tree
without gifts and home

1033
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:26,206
without love but
the evil Krampus

1034
01:18:26,273 --> 01:18:30,310
would finally have this way
and punish all the naughty kids

1035
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:33,647
who misbehave.

1036
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,015
It was then that
Krampus appeared.

1037
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:06,447
You had to think quick.

1038
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:23,497
The Krampus and the
elf fight to the death.

1039
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:47,482
Well, that's enough for tonight.

1040
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:48,616
Now you go to sleep.

1041
01:20:48,683 --> 01:20:49,149
We have a big day tomorrow.

1042
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:08,869
I see your stomach couldn't
take another story, could it?

1043
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:10,638
That's what happens when you
take candy from strangers.

1044
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:25,185
Well, story time is over, but
there's still time for dessert.

1045
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:27,789
I'm not eating
anything else from you.

1046
01:21:27,856 --> 01:21:33,327
Oh, it's not for you little
sweetie desserts for me.

1047
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:40,167
Oh, the instincts of a child
are so pure and innocent.

1048
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:43,471
If only you had the maturity
to listen to them well.

1049
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:44,605
What have you done?

1050
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:46,741
What did you do to us?

1051
01:21:46,808 --> 01:21:50,043
Nothing more than you asked for.

1052
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,912
You wanted a night
of adventure did you?

1053
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:55,349
Something legendary.

1054
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,983
Tonight's going to be legendary.

1055
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:59,554
Will be legendary.

1056
01:21:59,621 --> 01:22:00,053
How did you--

1057
01:22:24,512 --> 01:22:27,280
Rod.

1058
01:22:27,347 --> 01:22:31,552
I just hope I lived up to all
your little hearts desired.

1059
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:38,158
So tell me is poor
old Mary truly Mary?

1060
01:22:50,070 --> 01:23:00,481
Oh, oh, just right.

1061
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,027
I'll be right there.
