1
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,795
Yes, it is fact. I've been living my
whole life in this area, honest!

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,275
It's strange, I'm
came out here before.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,678
I would like to Paris.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,754
I've been out there.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,830
Really?

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,191
They had determined
a lovely time.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,474
Drink champagne, yes.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,154
Thanks again for coming
to my side of town.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,425
It's my pleasure.

10
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:51,290
I know I told you I hadn't had
much luck with these internet dates.

11
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:53,441
After our phone conversation, I thought

12
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,700
meeting in person
would be a good idea.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,473
A very good idea.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,372
Usually people lie about what
they look like, but you didn't.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,988
Neither did you.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,231
Mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,034
We shouldn't ...

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,911
Sorry, I got to cut
things short, but I ...

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,519
I ... I got to go.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,188
What do you mean?

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,448
It was really nice to meet you.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,434
Can't stay and
talk for a while, huh?

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,352
I really have to go.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,795
This is Jessica, leave a message.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,608
Hey, it's me. Call me.  I like
this one. We need to talk.

26
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,691
<i>Searchers found the body
of Shania D. Dishonavish</i>

27
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,966
<i>who vanished last week.</i>

28
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,967
<i>... continued have the end,</i>

29
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,568

30
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,502
<i>with the letter "E".</i>

31
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,692
<i>... broke their story,
got to up to one ...</i>

32
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,231
<i>and new details
appear to be coming.</i>

33
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,926
<i>It seems right now the witnesses
were from surveillance video...</i>

34
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,185
<i>All the victims seem
to have met the killer</i>

35
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,239
<i>in online chat-rooms
and dating sites.</i>

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,119
<i>These women are very vulnerable to</i>

37
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,889
<i>online predators and

38
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>... received several

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,450
<i>profile of the branding killer

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,906
<i>The investigation is ongoing.</i>

41
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,551
I thought our date
was going so well.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,075
We should continue,
don't you think?

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,318
Where are you taking me?

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,637
Some place nice.
I think you'll like it.

45
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,749
Here we are.

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,552
Ha, ha, where are you going?

47
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,959
Are you going to kill me?

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,516
What?  What kind of
person do you think I am?

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,350
I thought you'd like
to see some of my work.

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,574
I ... pulled that
one from the river.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,294
The woman's body had
been submerged for weeks.

52
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,676
It is said that her husband
tried to bury her in the mud.

53
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,749
How awful that
must have been for him.

54
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,832
Hey, ever seen what
water does to a body?

55
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,783
No! No! No!

56
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,272
Hey! Hey! Hey!

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,414
Do not make me
do it again, okay?

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,595
Okay.

59
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,079
Alright now!  Okay, listen!

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,875
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,193
I think you'll
really going to like it.

62
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,910
No!

63
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,833
I'll be right back.

64
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,272
I'll give you anything you want!
Just let me go!

65
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,752
Anything?
You don't even know me!

66
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,355
I don't even know
your favourite colour!

67
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,688
Hey! Don't blow the
moment for both of us, okay?

68
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,894
I like green.

69
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,855
Here we go, come on.

70
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,449
Stupid, I don't think ... stupid!

71
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,515
Hell ... Hello?

72
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,619
Where you think you're going, huh?

73
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,534
Help!

74
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,275
Help! Please!

75
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,956
Oh shit!

76
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,949
Fucking door!

77
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,159
Julia!

78
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,169
Stop it!

79
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,950
Here you go!

80
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,151
I've really been
enjoying our time together.

81
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,993
Want some tea?

82
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,393
I know you'd prefer coffee,
but I don't have that.

83
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,709
I have a confession to make.

84
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,797
At least we don't have girls here.

85
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,319
That really makes you vulnerable,
sharing spaces, you know?

86
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,815
How can you trust these days?

87
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,979
One minute you're having coffee

88
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,811
and in the next minute
your heart is broken.

89
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,510
I shouldn't be so insensitive.

90
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,139
It's a little late for that now.

91
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,729
You are right.

92
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,674
My manners are not
what they used to be.

93
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,555
But it's stupid cunts like
you that make me like this.

94
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,972
That was uncalled for.

95
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,415
Fuck you!

96
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,970
You're not running the show,
yeah, you're not that special.

97
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,815
You actually have a fucked up,
excuse me, screwed up smile!

98
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,039
You've got that one,
teeth like that, not straight.

99
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,957
You'd better
just fix some of it now.

100
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,450
I've had prettier dates than you.

101
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,534
This is my show,
I'm running this!

102
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,395
Told you that?

103
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,209
Coward!

104
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,536
What?

105
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,273
If you're going to kill me,
just go ahead an do it.

106
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,867
We're having such a good time.

107
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:06,313
You want to leave.  I know ...

108
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:07,753
What?

109
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:10,895
Escape.  You're mapping a way out.

110
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:17,088
I'd be careful.  It's a
dangerous road out there.

111
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,890
Julia!

112
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,548
Julia, there's no place to go!

113
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,197
Julia!

114
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:04,580
Come out, come out!
Wherever you are.

115
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:17,635
Julia!  You are a bad, bad girl!

116
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,435
Fuck you!

117
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,823
Funny girl!

118
00:30:49,552 --> 00:30:52,786
What took you so long?
I started to get worried.

119
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:54,947
I'm fine.

120
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:56,431
You don't look fine.

121
00:30:56,713 --> 00:31:00,852
He just caught me off
guard a little, that's all.

122
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,570
I wasn't expecting
it to go this far.

123
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:05,130
Jules, are you sure
what we are doing?

124
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:08,306
Enough, Jessica.
I've got it under control.

125
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,643
Just help me
put him in the trunk.

126
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:26,923
Are you ready?

127
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,803
Yeah!

128
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,131
How you really pissed him off.

129
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:12,968
Just help me get
him out of the trunk.

130
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,205
I'm not sure
about this thing, Jules.

131
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,207
What are you not sure about?

132
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:26,713
You don't fucking move unless
I tell you to!   You got it?

133
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,310
It looks like we got
a real nasty one, Jules!

134
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:34,015
He's a real peach, alright!

135
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:36,789
What happened?
- Hey!

136
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:41,574
Help me get this
piece of shit inside.

137
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:48,711
He's heavy!

138
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,024
Oh! Fuck!

139
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,755
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
- Fine.  Just get him inside.

140
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:14,705
Sleep tight!

141
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:10,613
Just get it over with.

142
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:18,432
Oh my God!

143
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,251
Found our next guy.

144
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,714
What?

145
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:28,571
After we get rid of this one, I get
someone new to take his place.

146
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,318
Got him in a chat room.

147
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,670
You know, we don't do that.

148
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:35,329
He sent me a picture of his dick.

149
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:38,479
So?  It always happens.

150
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,249
Yeah, but you didn't see it
though.  It was so wrinkled

151
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,531
and he was wearing a dress.

152
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,957
That's disgusting.

153
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,649
Here.

154
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,215
Watch it!

155
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,251
I was just trying to help.

156
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,257
You can't go after every guy,

157
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,336
who says something sexual
to you in a chat room,

158
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,557
or sends you a
picture of his penis.

159
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,614
I thought we were
going get rid of their kinds.

160
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,290
Get up!

161
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:28,956
I said, get up!

162
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm going to
fuck you up, man!

163
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:35,119
I'm looking forward to it.

164
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:45,614
Oh!  Fuck!

165
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:49,143
Hey asshole, looking for something?

166
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,599
How about a hammer?

167
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,696
I thought you wanted to play?

168
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:51,898
Who's your little friend?

169
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,084
Did you kill him?
- No.

170
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,499
Why not?

171
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,385
Because he doesn't
deserves a quick death.

172
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,902
Okay, fine, but then
I want to kill him.

173
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,176
You're not killing him.

174
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,513
I have just as much
right to this, as you do.

175
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:21,397
- This is such a bull shit.
- Deal with it.

176
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,539
Jessica!

177
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,338
Fuck you!

178
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,069
Good, you're awake!

179
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:17,041
Hell of a situation you
got yourself into here.

180
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:24,211
I wonder what you thought
you were going to do with me.

181
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:26,386
You're fucking stupid!

182
00:41:29,331 --> 00:41:32,628
I didn't catch that.

183
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:42,006
Maybe you were going to
break me, huh?  Torture me.

184
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:44,050
Me me your trophy?

185
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:54,203
Is this the best shit
you can come up with?

186
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,262
You are all the same.

187
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:04,608
Just because a
woman smiles at you

188
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,525
or says hello, doesn't mean
she wants to fuck you!

189
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:12,481
You don't own her
and you don't own me!

190
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,809
Interesting music choice.

191
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,963
Oh, I like it.

192
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:46,004
When I say I'm going
to fuck you up, I mean it!

193
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:50,631
Watch him for a minute.

194
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,744
I know you want to touch me.

195
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:28,813
You want to have me, don't you?

196
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:45,812
Now, you are thinking very
dirty thoughts about me!

197
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:57,666
Do you wanna taste me?

198
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,108
Do you wanna fuck me?

199
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,695
But you won't kill me.

200
00:44:16,856 --> 00:44:18,150
What are you doing?

201
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:24,389
That's my bra!

202
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:28,115
Yeah, well, it looks better on me!

203
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:29,988
Stop being so childish!

204
00:44:31,696 --> 00:44:33,375
Cover yourself up!

205
00:44:35,437 --> 00:44:37,892
What?  Do my tits bother you?

206
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:46,352
Please let her continue.

207
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:57,366
What the fuck was that about?
I'm talking to you.

208
00:44:57,497 --> 00:45:00,086
Why can't we just
get rid of him already?

209
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:03,109
Soon, okay?

210
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:06,733
When do I get to
be the bait for once?

211
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,993
You know how
I feel about that.

212
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:12,833
I can take care of myself.

213
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:16,637
I made a promise to
myself a long time ago,

214
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,836
that I would never let
anybody hurt you again.

215
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:21,916
You can't always be
there to take care of me.

216
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:25,528
You have to trust I
can take care of myself.

217
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:31,349
It's not about trust,
you're my baby sister.

218
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:35,933
You have to stop
treating me like I'm a baby.

219
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,550
I'm tired of it.
Stop worrying about me.

220
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:49,148
I can't.  Look, I don't want
to fight right now, Jessie.

221
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:51,062
Too tired.

222
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,469
Hello.

223
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:58,120
How can I help you?

224
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,919
I live  in the house
across the street.

225
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:02,609
Yeah, I've seen you before.

226
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:06,757
I think, maybe, you could
help me out with something.

227
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:12,894
What were you looking for?

228
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:16,080
It's my bike,
I'm having trouble with it.

229
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:18,192
I thought maybe you
could take a look at it.

230
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:20,479
Yeah, a bike?

231
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,637
That, I  mean,
if you're not too busy.

232
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:30,370
Yeah, I think I could
spare a few minutes.

233
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:34,205
What seems to be the problem?

234
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:41,371
Some days I just
can't even get it started.

235
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:47,593
And I, crank it and crank
it, and it just sits there.

236
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:52,601
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

237
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,561
I think you are doing just fine.

238
00:47:55,942 --> 00:48:00,853
It sounds like the gasoline is turning
into varnish inside the carburetor.

239
00:48:00,854 --> 00:48:02,356
Boring stuff, but

240
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:05,083
isn't a problem.

241
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:07,876
That's really sweet of you
to help me out like this.

242
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:11,711
Maybe there's
something I can do for you?

243
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,116
What do you have in mind?

244
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,094
Maybe we could play a game.

245
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:24,460
Yeah?

246
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:26,142
Do you like games?

247
00:48:29,003 --> 00:48:30,641
I do now.

248
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:38,234
Come here.

249
00:48:42,884 --> 00:48:44,119
Turn around.

250
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:57,316
What's going on?

251
00:48:57,544 --> 00:49:02,154
Just playing.
Don't you trust me?

252
00:49:04,304 --> 00:49:06,320
I don't even know your name.

253
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:08,837
What do you want it to be?

254
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:12,557
Wow!  You playing like that, huh?

255
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:20,557
Rose.  Always liked that name.

256
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:23,605
Whatever you say.

257
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,082
So listen.  You be a good boy.

258
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:31,800
Rose has some surprises.

259
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,154
Yeah?

260
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,317
Let the games begin!

261
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:42,083
Just a little bit further.

262
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:46,322
Okay, oh.

263
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,441
Okay.

264
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:56,396
Okay.

265
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,225
Hold still.

266
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:17,675
I've never done this before.

267
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,858
Sure you'll be great at it.

268
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:48,483
Now you stay right here,
Rose is gonna be right back.

269
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:54,737
I'll be waiting.

270
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,327
Obviously.

271
00:51:07,888 --> 00:51:10,104
Strange girl.
- Oh Shit!

272
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:14,984
What the fuck man?
Who's there?

273
00:51:15,268 --> 00:51:16,717
What's your name?

274
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,766
Sam, what's yours?

275
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:22,767
You going to have sex with her?

276
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:25,263
What?  What's going on here, huh?

277
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:30,683
Well, Sam.  We're tied up.

278
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:34,468
We're sitting in the kitchen
of a sexually active girl.

279
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:38,703
So, what do you
think is going on here?

280
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,500
Look man.  I'm not
into this kinky shit, huh.

281
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:44,561
I was just trying to
help a girl fix her bike.

282
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:47,906
You wanted to give her engine
a little crank then, huh?

283
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:50,300
Yeah, something like that.

284
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:52,245
I wonder what they
gonna do with you.

285
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:53,206
They?

286
00:51:54,689 --> 00:52:00,845
There's more than one girl, Sam.
And they have a lot of energy.

287
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,249
Okay, well, you sound like
you know what's going on.

288
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,017
What ... what are
they gonna do, huh?

289
00:52:07,118 --> 00:52:09,139
What are they gonna do, man?

290
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:15,239
Well, if you're lucky, maybe
they'll have their way with you.

291
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,525
They would have
shown me a good time.

292
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,567
You had sex with both of them?

293
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:27,408
Oh, Sam, I've done things with these
girls that you won't even believe.

294
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,603
Okay, okay, it's ...
I just, you know, I've ...

295
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,187
I've never been with two girls.

296
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:40,209
Well then maybe,
this is your lucky day.

297
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:54,501
Jessica?

298
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:57,100
Still worth listening?

299
00:52:57,531 --> 00:53:04,821
Yeah, are you gonna be joining us?

300
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:07,863
I don't know.
Is that something you want?

301
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:12,808
What?  No, no, God,
no!  I  just ... no!  It's ...

302
00:53:14,772 --> 00:53:19,766
No offense, but I ...
you know I don't do guys.

303
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,130
Well, it doesn't sound
like you doing anybody.

304
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,130
I do fine, thank you very much.

305
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:31,727
You see all these women that you've
been with, they wanna choke them.

306
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:34,725
Like, during sex?

307
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,470
Whenever ..

308
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:39,950
Wait, is that what they
want me to fucking do here?

309
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:42,400
Some girls are into
that sort of thing.

310
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:47,946
Look man, I don't know
what kind of girls you date

311
00:53:48,113 --> 00:53:50,581
but this is some weird ass shit.

312
00:53:50,653 --> 00:53:54,163
Depends on your point of view.

313
00:53:56,473 --> 00:53:57,608
Jessica.

314
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:02,167
What are you doing?

315
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:05,381
I'm really sleepy, I
want to go to bed now.

316
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:08,610
Why are you dressed like that?

317
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:14,501
Answer me!
Why are you dressed like that?

318
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:23,643
Rose!  Hey, Rose!  Listen.

319
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:27,574
I don't know what you
have in mind here, but

320
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:30,229
this is starting to
freak me out, okay?

321
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,005
I am not into this kind of shit, just

322
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:35,639
... if you could just
let me go, I swear to ...

323
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,008
Who the fuck is this?

324
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:39,125
I don't know,
I didn't get his name.

325
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:40,607
It's Sam.

326
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,985
Shut the fuck up, I wasn't talking
to you.  What is he doing here?

327
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,394
Apparently, he's here
to fix her motorcycle.

328
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:49,871
Speak again and I will staple
your fucking mouth shut!

329
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:55,905
Get in the hallway.
Get in the fucking hallway!

330
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:03,411
Who the fuck is that, man?

331
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,528
That was the other girl.

332
00:55:06,695 --> 00:55:10,026
Look at you.  Fucking stupid.
Who is this guy?

333
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:14,000
I do not know.  I found him in
the garage across the street.

334
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:17,426
You brought a local here?
Are you completely fucking insane?

335
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:19,170
It's so fucked!

336
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:24,814
You headed somewhere?

337
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:26,288
Did anybody see you?

338
00:55:26,736 --> 00:55:28,125
I don't know.

339
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:36,714
Damn it Jessica, what were
you planning on doing with him?

340
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:41,769
Killing him.

341
00:55:42,296 --> 00:55:43,875
How did you end up here?

342
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:48,151
I am on a date with Rose's sister.

343
00:55:48,276 --> 00:55:49,529
This is a date?

344
00:55:49,736 --> 00:55:53,695
Yeah, so far it's been
a pretty decent good one.

345
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,349
You gotta bring him back.

346
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:57,011
I'm not doing that.

347
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:58,404
Yes, you are!

348
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,177
Stop telling me what to do.

349
00:56:01,237 --> 00:56:03,373
Okay, I can make my own decisions!

350
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:08,048
I don't know who's crazier.
The people that are doing this to us,

351
00:56:08,437 --> 00:56:10,289
or the people who fell for it.

352
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:14,629
I like you, Sam.  You're smart.

353
00:56:17,997 --> 00:56:19,350
Too bad.

354
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:23,465
What?   No, why did
you say, "too bad"?

355
00:56:25,017 --> 00:56:26,072
Hey?

356
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:27,628
What does that mean, too bad?

357
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:30,327
You meant something by that!
What does that mean?

358
00:56:30,337 --> 00:56:32,767
You know something,
I know you know something!

359
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:34,933
You know something, tell me!

360
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:36,995
Are you mad that I
brought home my own kill,

361
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:40,795
or you're just jealous because
I did it without any of your help?

362
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:44,853
Oh, you can't be serious.
Grow up!

363
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:48,971
I'm trying to,
but you won't let me.

364
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:55,333
Oh God, stop!  What are you
going to do?  What's going on?

365
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:59,634
Hey, what's going on?  Please, please,
whatever you're going to do, don't do it!

366
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:06,176
Here, you want blood so bad.
You got it.  Here you go.

367
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:09,690
No! No. No, no, no, no.
No blood!

368
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:11,655
No blood, no blood, please!

369
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:13,898
Please, no blood!
What is going ...?

370
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:16,055
What's going on?
What are you doing?

371
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,487
I'm killing.  You shut up.

372
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,218
No, no, no, please, Rose!
I beg you.

373
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:23,855
My name is not Rose!

374
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:27,655
That's a fat chicks name!

375
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:36,918
What's so funny?

376
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,217
You don't got the guts.

377
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,908
Well, maybe I should
just start with you then?

378
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,195
Holy shit!

379
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,077
Oh! You fucking bitch,
I'm going to kill you!

380
00:58:14,278 --> 00:58:15,865
Fucking kill you.

381
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:21,855
Okay.  Fucking kill you!
- Okay, you can stop now.

382
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:24,449
- Just let go of me!
- Don't proof anything to me!

383
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,420
Can't you see I'm working here?

384
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:29,940
Jessica, enough.

385
00:58:31,461 --> 00:58:32,689
Get out of my way!

386
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:37,638
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

387
00:58:37,741 --> 00:58:41,814
Yeah, you too.
I'm just like you.

388
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:47,482
Look, you let me take care of them.
You go relax.

389
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,533
Look alive, Sam.

390
00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:55,557
Leave him alone!

391
00:59:00,902 --> 00:59:02,540
Yeah, leave me alone!

392
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:08,999
Help! Help!

393
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,300
Shut up!
If you scream again,

394
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,100
I will fucking cut your tongue out!

395
00:59:12,102 --> 00:59:15,212
Why are you doing?
What did I ever do to you?

396
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,380
No, no, no, no.
I ask the questions!

397
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:20,259
Just kill the poor kid, already!

398
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,591
Fuck you, man!

399
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:28,894
Oh, no, no.
No, that won't be fun. No.

400
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:32,093
No, we want to take
our time, don't we, Sam?

401
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:05,314
My sister may be done
playing with you, but I'm not!

402
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:37,413
Can't breathe.

403
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:47,024
Hey, man, you okay?
Are you fucking alive?

404
01:00:48,505 --> 01:00:49,974
Are you even alive?

405
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:53,515
Oh, thank God!

406
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:59,979
Okay, listen, man.  Listen.
I can't move.

407
01:01:00,105 --> 01:01:04,940
So maybe you can make
your way over to me.  Okay.

408
01:01:05,185 --> 01:01:08,187
Just ... just stroot over to me,
and you can get me undone,

409
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:09,974
and then I'll fucking
get you undone, man.

410
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:17,779
Come on, come on!  Just stroot
over to me, just stroot over!

411
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:27,697
What?

412
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:32,475
Come on.

413
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,799
I don't want anything to
do with this.  Just let me go!

414
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:55,004
Yeah, yeah, here come on!

415
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:27,077
What is that?

416
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:34,517
Hey man, are you free?

417
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:38,820
Hey, what are you doing?

418
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,856
Holy shit, you're free., man.
You are free!  Come on!

419
01:02:43,088 --> 01:02:45,477
Okay, okay.
Now let me go!

420
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:48,367
Let me go, man!  Come on.
They're gonna come back!

421
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:51,220
Look, I'll just fucking
walk out, okay.

422
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:52,980
I swear to God, I'll just walk out.

423
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:54,980
I'll let you get back to your date,

424
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:56,500
or whatever the
shit you're doing here.

425
01:02:56,509 --> 01:03:00,360
Just ... just untie me!  Come on,
please and just fucking let me go!

426
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,345
Man, I swear to God,
I'll just walk out of here

427
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:03,982
won't ask any questions!

428
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:07,580
Come on, man!
What is that?

429
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:09,784
What is that?
What are you doing?

430
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:13,424
Come on, man, come on, please.

431
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:15,301
I swear to God, please.

432
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:18,666
Please!  Just untie me, man.
Untie me!

433
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:22,140
You can have both of them, man.
Come on, just let me go!

434
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:28,579
What is that?

435
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,741
What is that?

436
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,589
What's going on?
Just let me go, man!

437
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:41,640
Just ... just let me go!

438
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,460
Yeah?

439
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,585
Please!

440
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:58,078
Oh my God!

441
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,830
Take care, Sam!

442
01:05:55,314 --> 01:05:56,906
How the hell did he get free?

443
01:05:57,074 --> 01:05:58,427
How should I know?

444
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:00,113
You were the last one with him.

445
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:05,373
Where is your friend?

446
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:06,828
I do not know!

447
01:06:11,354 --> 01:06:12,682
What's this?

448
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:14,249
Wire cutters.

449
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:16,929
Yeah, I know what they are.
How the fuck did he get them?

450
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:22,130
My sister asked you a question!

451
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:27,324
I don't fucking know.
He just walked out.

452
01:06:35,015 --> 01:06:38,329
I'm going to have to rip out that
fucking, lying tongue of yours!

453
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:44,106
I don't give a fuck about him!
We need to find our friend.

454
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:52,332
Fine.  I'll cut it out later.
Lucky Sammy!

455
01:07:10,076 --> 01:07:12,246
I don't know how
this could have happened.

456
01:07:13,336 --> 01:07:17,588
Well, it obviously did,
so we'll just find him, okay?

457
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:24,371
He's probably half
way down the block.

458
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:27,053
Oh, he didn't leave.

459
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:29,495
How do you know?

460
01:07:30,757 --> 01:07:32,210
Because I do.

461
01:07:57,717 --> 01:07:59,828
You think this is
my fault, don't you?

462
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:02,048
What?

463
01:08:02,118 --> 01:08:04,274
You don't believe me,
you never believed me!

464
01:08:04,398 --> 01:08:06,614
Be quiet!  I believe you!

465
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,367
Do you see him?
I told you he left.

466
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:27,228
No, he wants to stay for the
same reason we want him here.

467
01:08:28,298 --> 01:08:29,467
Well.

468
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,808
Want to come play in my room?
Will be more fun, don't you think?

469
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,871
Oh, oh, please, don't kill me!

470
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,355
Just leave.

471
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:52,740
You like that, you fucker?

472
01:10:55,943 --> 01:10:58,712
Oh, God it's so good!

473
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,876
- It takes treat all your needs?
- Only the ones that get laid!

474
01:11:13,963 --> 01:11:18,534
Oh, what are we now?  But you
don't even know anything about me!

475
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:20,595
Where do I begin?

476
01:11:20,763 --> 01:11:23,596
I bet you didn't know
my favorite color was pink!

477
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,593
Let's just keep
this physical, okay!

478
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:31,857
It is rude to interrupt a girl
when she has a window to do!

479
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:35,821
I've stopped listening to
bitches like you a long time ago!

480
01:11:36,164 --> 01:11:39,461
Excuse me, I wasn't
done talking yet!

481
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,154
So pink is your
favourite colour, huh?

482
01:11:59,944 --> 01:12:02,240
I always pegged
you for a yellow girl.

483
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:04,694
Shut up.

484
01:12:15,925 --> 01:12:18,016
You're not the first
asshole I have killed.

485
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:19,519
I'm not dead yet!

486
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:22,676
I want to be rescued by "Mr.Right"!

487
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:26,805
I want the bad stuff to
go away and get fixed!

488
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:29,562
I want someone who gets me!

489
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,804
I want to sing in the rain

490
01:12:36,566 --> 01:12:39,182
and be with someone who does too.

491
01:12:49,546 --> 01:12:51,582
I just want my soul-mate.

492
01:12:53,926 --> 01:12:58,044
I just want someone to
tell me that I'm beautiful,

493
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,700
inside or out.

494
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:10,765
You know what, though?

495
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:15,543
You really are pretty.
And I love Mexican food.

496
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:25,338
You no one will ever get you.

497
01:13:26,047 --> 01:13:27,500
But only me!

498
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:33,223
You're not my first
either, but you're my ...

499
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:42,722
I'm sorry.  Did that hurt?

500
01:13:52,868 --> 01:13:54,786
Shall we continue?

501
01:13:55,788 --> 01:14:00,086
I love "The Sound of Music",
but hated "Mary Poppins"!

502
01:14:01,528 --> 01:14:04,586
Andrews was such a
brat in that movie!

503
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:11,261
Julie Andrews is a
national fucking treasure?

504
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:19,328
Is that all you've got?

505
01:14:19,349 --> 01:14:21,300
Oh, I thought you were
going to fuck me up?

506
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:22,696
Ah, I never wanted to fuck you up,

507
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,540
I just want to fucking kill you.

508
01:14:51,389 --> 01:14:53,625
Just playing with you, old man.

509
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,802
Date's over.

510
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,329
How could you?

511
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,750
Come here, come here!

512
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:28,487
Oh God! Oh God!

513
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,570
You won't listen!
Now be silent!

514
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:33,807
I told you, you
gotta listen!

515
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:35,828
Why don't you listen?
Shut up!

516
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:48,524
Come on, come on!
Shut up!

517
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,469
A little help here, Jess!

518
01:15:57,431 --> 01:15:58,520
Jessie!

519
01:16:19,772 --> 01:16:21,261
Jess.

520
01:16:48,173 --> 01:16:49,701
Why?

521
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:52,786
It's my turn.

522
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:42,291
The best date I ever had.

523
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:38,368
Goodbye.

524
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:03,431
For you.

525
01:22:05,022 --> 01:22:06,396
Thanks for coming here.

526
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:07,637
Thank you.

527
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:12,394
I haven't had much luck
with these internet dates.

528
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,858
It just seems like
everybody's out to fuck me.

529
01:22:16,193 --> 01:22:18,954
Or maybe I'm just being paranoid.

530
01:22:20,223 --> 01:22:24,149
I know what you mean.
So tell me about yourself.

531
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:26,394
There's not really much to say.

532
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:32,553
Julia Y.   So, what
does the "Y" stand for?

533
01:22:32,783 --> 01:22:36,419
Oh, that's for me to know,
and for you to find out.

534
01:22:37,783 --> 01:22:40,338
Well, I look
forward to finding out.

535
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:54,013
You want to fuck with Daddy?

536
01:22:58,524 --> 01:23:00,460
Ah, you like it
rough, don't you?

537
01:23:00,644 --> 01:23:02,362
Yeah, you like it, don't you?

538
01:23:04,944 --> 01:23:08,570
Yes, he does like that shit, too, Babe!
Give it up for him!

539
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:12,639
Get over there, bitch!

540
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,597
Ah, that's what you want,
eh you slut?   Ain't it, slut!

541
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,776
You want that chocolate
stick, don't you, huh?

542
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,749
Huh you little slut, huh?
You like that don't you?

543
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,705
Inside your ass, pussy ...

544
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,615
Yeah, alright!

545
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,000
Excuse you.
