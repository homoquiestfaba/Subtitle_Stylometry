2
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,301
Ow!

3
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,669
Damn it!

4
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,580
Rachel, I don't think...

5
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:46,618
It's not like,
you know... You're...

6
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,951
Car's ready.
Are you ready to go?

7
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:23,255
Ready to go, pal?

8
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,756
Come on. Let's go.

9
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,225
Come on, Bernie.
Let's go.

10
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,361
Come on, Bern.
Car's leaving.

11
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,829
Come on.

12
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,032
Come on, Bernie.
Come on.

13
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:38,769
I'll just get him later.

14
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,504
Okay.
Yeah.

15
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,647
This is the last box here.

16
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:56,954
All right.

17
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,690
Let me know if I leave
anything behind.

18
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:00,858
Sure.

19
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:17,941
Oh!

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,415
Fuck!

21
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,649
Jesus!

22
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:29,953
Fuck!

23
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:38,786
Hey.
Hey.

24
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,188
Thanks so much for
letting me crash here.

25
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,356
Yeah, of course,
come on in.

26
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:49,664
Just got to the point
where I guess she...

27
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,365
She lost faith in me.
She lost faith in...

28
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,969
In our relationship. She lost
faith in any possibility

29
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,572
that we might be able
to resolve this somehow.

30
00:03:57,574 --> 00:04:00,007
And she lost faith.
Wow.

31
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,309
What was Mom's
take on all this?

32
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,377
Mom, you know...

33
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,414
You know, she was drunk,
she was angry at me.

34
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,818
She blamed me for everything,
basically.

35
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,687
Yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,989
And called me a pussy,
in her own way.

37
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:18,692
Yeah, I can't say
I'm surprised.

38
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:21,027
Is that my shirt?

39
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,429
This? What, the V-neck?

40
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,665
No, the shirt underneath.
The white shirt.

41
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,733
What, with the...

42
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,501
I think Rachel got me this.
The button-down?

43
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,270
I've been looking for that shirt
for, like, two years.

44
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:34,708
Honey? I cleared out the...
The right hand side of the basement,

45
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,345
the far right hand side by the boiler,
for all of Alex's stuff.

46
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:39,778
So, okay.

47
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,714
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,415
Thanks. I really appreciate it.
Yeah.

49
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,221
So what about the tour? Are you
still going to go out by yourself?

50
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,290
I have to.
You can't cancel?

51
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,893
I can't cancel it, no.
I need the money, you know.

52
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,695
I need to start chipping away
at this debt.

53
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,164
Unless... Unless you and Clay want to
lend me $4,000.

54
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,239
And you know, I think, you know,
maybe just being on the road...

55
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,875
You know, just alone with
my thoughts for two weeks.

56
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:13,379
Maybe that's a good thing.
You know, it'll give me...

57
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,780
Give me an opportunity
to reflect on things.

58
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,783
Maybe give me a little bit
of perspective.

59
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:18,950
You know,
in the whole situation.

60
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,353
And you know, maybe
that's a good thing.

61
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:27,458
So what do you think?
You want to come with me?

62
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,228
All right.

63
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,098
No, I...
I have Pete's number.

64
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,301
Petey! Pistol Pete!

65
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,970
When did people
stop calling you that?

66
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,307
Oh, okay. I didn't...

67
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,575
Wesley! What's
shaking, brother?

68
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,511
Listen, I know this might seem
out of the blue,

69
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,247
but, um, do you remember that
movie I made a few years ago,

70
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,581
<i>called Woodpecker?</i>

71
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,817
This is the movie that was about
these two birdwatchers

72
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:58,322
looking for this elusive woodpecker
which is on the brink of extinction.

73
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,424
It starts tomorrow.
It lasts two weeks.

74
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,326
There's 12 screenings
in two weeks.

75
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,261
And I was going to
do it with Rachel but...

76
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,930
...unfortunately, she couldn't
make it because, um...

77
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:10,267
She's actually working
on a job in... In Miami.

78
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,970
I forgot the name of the city.
I think it's in Western Poland.

79
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:17,107
And so unfortunately, she's not going to be able
to come with me on the tour,

80
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:20,477
so I'm just calling to see if maybe you want to,
kind of, just take an impulsive,

81
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,380
crazy adventure with me
through the south.

82
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,451
Totally, man,
I understand. I mean...

83
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,186
The little ones
need their father.

84
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,789
I thought I did invite you
to my birthday party.

85
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,725
Okay, is it still...

86
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,127
Did you switch to Gmail
or are you still Yahoo!?

87
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,995
Say hi to Leslie.

88
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,464
Lisa!

89
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,699
Say hi to Lisa.
Okay, bye.

90
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,116
Fuck!

91
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:05,721
Alex?

92
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,325
Yeah?

93
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:11,327
Doing okay in there?

94
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,163
Uh, hold on a second.

95
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:20,101
Hey.
Hey.

96
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:21,669
Uh...

97
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,506
What's up?
Oh, I don't know.

98
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:27,008
Are you okay? I...
Yeah.

99
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,111
...heard some racket
and some yelling in there.

100
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:35,417
Oh yeah, that was me.
I was making some phone calls.

101
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,019
Calling my buddies.
Yeah.

102
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,422
I'm sorry if I was making too...
Was it too loud?

103
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:42,557
Well, no, no. I just, uh...
I was just...

104
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,859
I'm just worried
about you.

105
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:47,262
Going through
a rough time, right?

106
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:51,399
I, uh... I don't want
to intrude, okay,

107
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,967
but I did read somewhere

108
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,204
that we form
neurological associations

109
00:07:57,206 --> 00:08:01,108
between swear words
and stress anxiety.

110
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,812
And we make those stress
words very powerful.

111
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:06,780
One way to maybe
help that out

112
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:11,552
is to replace the swear word
with a normal, ordinary word.

113
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,721
And maybe the swear words
can kind of lose their power.

114
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:15,823
Um, and...

115
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,425
And then maybe
later on down the road,

116
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,394
you're going to have to replace
that word with another word,

117
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,062
and then maybe that word
with another word,

118
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:26,567
but it might be a good way to, you know,
help with your stress management, you know.

119
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,735
Right? Yup.

120
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:33,506
Clay, that is the dumbest, retarded thing,
I've ever heard in my life.

121
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:37,743
Yeah. There you go.

122
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:38,878
Yeah.

123
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:49,155
You're a good person,
you know that?

124
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:55,495
You're a very good person and
I appreciate you trying to help.

125
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,932
I appreciate
your act of kindness.

126
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:03,135
I wish there was more
kindness in this world.

127
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:08,107
Do you guys, maybe,
want to come down to Atlanta?

128
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:10,843
Tomorrow? Join me for the first
few days of the tour?

129
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,512
No.

130
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,539
<i>Behind me,
that's a Pileated.</i>

131
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,309
<i>So we're going to stay
right here, Wes.</i>

132
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,846
<i>That's not the bird
I'm looking for.</i>

133
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,204
<i>As you know,
how this works...</i>

134
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:51,774
<i>We are very pleased to have the
filmmaker with us this evening,</i>

135
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:56,879
<i>and Alex Karpovsky is selected
as one of 25 new faces</i>

136
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,782
<i>in independent film
by Filmmakers Magazine.</i>

137
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,553
<i>Not only is he a filmmaker,
but he's also an actor.</i>

138
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,655
<i>And in this past year,
he played the voices</i>

139
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:09,257
<i>of several Russian gangsters
in  Grand Theft Auto IV.</i>

140
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,459
<i>His newest film...</i>

141
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,164
In the early 1940s,

142
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,300
this beautiful creature,

143
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,968
the most colorful,
the largest woodpecker

144
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,239
to ever fly in the American skies,
was declared extinct.

145
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:25,741
Because of our deforestation,
our negligence,

146
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:30,245
we lost another glorious creature
on this planet.

147
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:32,581
Um... Or so we thought.

148
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,985
A few years ago, hikers,
kayakers started spotting what they thought

149
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:42,257
was the elusive, and long forgotten
Ivory-billed Woodpecker.

150
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,593
And as word grew
and people started

151
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:47,095
to flock down there to the
swamps of Eastern Arkansas,

152
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:50,765
hoping to grab definitive
evidence, proof of this bird,

153
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,667
it became sort of
a national story.

154
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,002
But proof was elusive,

155
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:56,470
no one could get that photo.

156
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:58,506
And if they could
get that photo,

157
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:02,043
then maybe its habitat
could be preserved.

158
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,645
Legislation could be passed,
and it could be a protected area,

159
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:07,815
and these two or three woodpeckers,
or however might still be out there,

160
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,617
could be allowed to flourish.

161
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,486
So, this notion
of a second chance,

162
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:16,123
in every sense of that phrase,
was very interesting to me,

163
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,293
in a driving source of enthusiasm,
throughout...

164
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,729
Throughout this process
of working on the film.

165
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:25,132
And something that on a personal level,
especially recently,

166
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:29,969
is something that I can relate to,
you know, in many...

167
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:32,706
Well, in one specific aspect
of my life, anyway, I wish...

168
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,476
I wish I also was given
a second chance.

169
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:39,512
And I think maybe some of
the people in this room,

170
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,916
maybe could relate
to that notion. So...

171
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,184
That's all the time
we have tonight.

172
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:47,153
Thank you so much for coming out
to check out the film,

173
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:49,189
especially on
Valentine's Day.

174
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:51,424
I really appreciate it, and maybe
I'll see you down the road.

175
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,426
Good night.

176
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:58,998
All right.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,767
Thank you.

178
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:03,369
Thank you very much.

179
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,572
All right, happy Valentine's Day.
Thank you, you too.

180
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,679
All right. Thank you very much.
Happy Valentine's Day.

181
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,055
Hey, guys.

182
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,526
Ahem! Guys?

183
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:04,228
Guys!

184
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,065
Guys!

185
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,659
<i>Fallen tree is right there.</i>

186
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,795
<i>This is the spot.</i>

187
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:15,698
<i>The Ivory-billed was counted
out of existence.</i>

188
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,169
<i>If it can make a comeback,
anything can make a comeback.</i>

189
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,137
<i>I mean,
that's just a...</i>

190
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:26,075
<i>It's actually just
one of the few</i>

191
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:29,144
<i>pleasures of life
that we have,</i>

192
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:31,981
<i>while we're here,
is making a comeback,</i>

193
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,382
<i>when you're called
down and out,</i>

194
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:35,484
<i>when you're
called extinct.</i>

195
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:39,655
<i>Well, we're a...</i>

196
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,056
<i>You can see
something over there.</i>

197
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,426
Henry, what's up, man?

198
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,828
<i>Alex, what's
going on, baby?</i>

199
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,063
<i>What you up to,
you son of a bitch?</i>

200
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,733
Not much, I'm just doing
a tech check

201
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,168
<i>before one of our
Woodpecker  screenings.</i>

202
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,537
<i>Well, listen, I've been
thinking about your offer</i>

203
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,373
<i>and if your offer
still stands,</i>

204
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,576
<i>I'm gonna come down and join
you on the tour if it's possible.</i>

205
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,113
<i>Yeah, yeah, I just think
it will be really inspiring.</i>

206
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,915
<i>That's great.
As long as I'm not imposing.</i>

207
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,517
No, no, no.
That's great news.

208
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,085
<i>Cool, awesome.
I'm really excited about it.</i>

209
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,787
Yeah, I'm so glad
you reconsidered.

210
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,390
<i>I've been sitting in my shitty apartment,
drawing shitty illustrations,</i>

211
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,593
<i>thinking about Shel Silverstein,
feeling slightly suicidal.</i>

212
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,295
<i>I just got to get
the fuck out of here.</i>

213
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:26,533
But in all honesty, there was this
media blitz, uh...

214
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:30,537
They were all, sort of, blasting us with this
incredible, strange story

215
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,907
about a strange woodpecker.
It's a beautiful story.

216
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,444
It's a story about Americana,
about second chances.

217
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:45,085
I wanted to kind of dive into this very new,
rich, unfamiliar place.

218
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,987
Because it's so
free of associations

219
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:51,058
and so full of wonder, and that's a huge
part of the magnetism as well.

220
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:56,897
This is a great, like, charismatic,
megafauna kind of story,

221
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,266
and you seem like
a very charismatic megafauna.

222
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,934
So I hope we see more of you
and more of your work,

223
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,469
and I don't really
have a question,

224
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,770
I just wanted
to say that.

225
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:07,106
Thank you very much,
that's very sweet. I appreciate it.

226
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,742
Charismatic megafauna was actually
a working title for the film.

227
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:15,581
I've had a wonderful time talking to
you in this beautiful theater.

228
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,816
I'll see you down the road.
Good night.

229
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,924
It's Tricia.
T-R-I-C-I-A.

230
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:27,793
- T-R-I...
- C-I-A.

231
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,996
C-I-A. Like that.

232
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,264
Are you guys bird watchers?

233
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,599
- Pardon me?
- Are you bird watchers?

234
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,601
I'm more of a hunter.

235
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,169
Thank you for coming
and watching the film.

236
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,637
- Okay, see you.
- Thank you very much.

237
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,171
Hey, how's it going?
Good, good, how are you?

238
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:42,340
Those were really sweet things that
you said in there.

239
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,708
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

240
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,844
You were great. It was such a good movie.
Thank you so much.

241
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,278
And you were so funny.

242
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Thank you so much.
And you're really talented.

243
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,526
Oh, fuck!

244
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,379
There's a maple tree
on one side of my lawn

245
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,214
that has, like, a really
high vibration,

246
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,917
but then there's a cypress tree
on the other side,

247
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,653
and it has the most
mellow vibration

248
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,155
and I can't
figure out why.

249
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,924
I'm thinking because it's older,
you know?

250
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,432
Left here?

251
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:42,566
Yes.

252
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,776
This was so great.
It was really fun, yeah.

253
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:54,178
Yeah, I loved it.

254
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,679
Good night.
Yeah, it was a fun night.

255
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,780
Hmm.
Yeah.

256
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,516
So, it was great
seeing you. Mmm!

257
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,720
All right.
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,622
Cool.
Mmm-hmm.

259
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,391
Yeah.

260
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:09,959
So...

261
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:15,531
All right, Riv. Well,
I'm sorry you got to go.

262
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,533
Yeah, it's just...
It's work.

263
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,869
PF's and stuff.

264
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:21,204
Well, maybe I'll see you
down the road.

265
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,206
Yeah, yeah.
I would like that.

266
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,608
Yeah, that'll be fun, right?
Yeah.

267
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,044
Take care.
Okay. I love your work.

268
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,612
Bye-bye.
See you later.

269
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,900
<i>That means good night.
Good night.</i>

270
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,737
<i>Put that hat on.
Rachel. The one...</i>

271
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,672
<i>Yeah, put that one on.</i>

272
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,816
<i>I'm just studying.</i>

273
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,421
<i>...I'm gonna be a nurse.
Do you like nurses?</i>

274
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:16,023
<i>Is this my nurse fantasy
or is this your nurse fantasy?</i>

275
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,264
<i>All right, Ma, okay.</i>

276
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,084
Henry. Henry!

277
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,953
Alex!

278
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:56,221
How's it going?
Great.

279
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,356
Good to see you.
Good to see you too.

280
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,458
They lost my bag.
They did?

281
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,526
Did you...
This isn't even my flight.

282
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,195
Everybody who was on my flight has
come and gone.

283
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,431
Yeah, they said they're going
to call me when it's ready, so...

284
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,933
What a bummer!
I'm sorry to hear that.

285
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,234
Oh, it's all right.
It's just stuff.

286
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:10,736
It's just stuff. Good seeing you.
You look great.

287
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:13,537
Good to see you too, yeah. I've
never seen you with long hair before.

288
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,206
Oh, yeah? What do you think?
You like it?

289
00:22:20,212 --> 00:22:21,746
All right. Well, how much
are you taking off?

290
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,381
It's just cutting,
it's tough cutting.

291
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,116
Fucking bullshit.

292
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:28,286
Give me those
fucking scissors.

293
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,724
It's looking good.
Uh-huh, yeah.

294
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:36,727
I think so. This is what
I'm talking about.

295
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:38,963
Some Thomas Dolby shit.

296
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,168
Rachel asked me to
move something from, uh...

297
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,837
This old TV, it doesn't even
really work that well.

298
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,240
She asked me to move it from the
living room to the dining room.

299
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,675
And I think, I just... You know
how you're supposed to bend your...

300
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:53,910
...bend your knees. Did you
actually bend over and do that?

301
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,478
I always do that.
I always bend my knees,

302
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,414
but this one time
I spaced out and...

303
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,581
How is she?

304
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,683
Rachel?
Yeah.

305
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,484
She's doing well. Yeah.
Yeah?

306
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:04,754
You guys have been
together for four years?

307
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,923
Four and a half years now.
Four and a half years.

308
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,526
Yeah.
That's incredible.

309
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:11,928
That's amazing. I mean, that's great.
You guys are great together.

310
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,998
So I'm really happy for you.
I mean... Yeah.

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,001
Yeah.
I wish I could do that.

312
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:19,169
So how many people
did you call

313
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:20,470
before you called me
to come on this trip?

314
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,139
I know I wasn't
the first person.

315
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,642
You're not the
first person I called.

316
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,377
I didn't think so.
I'll admit that.

317
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:32,548
I'm gonna have to get some work done
in between your screening.

318
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,782
I'm not going to make
all the screenings.

319
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:35,984
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
You don't... I mean...

320
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:37,052
I only expect you
to make one.

321
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,387
And you only have to go
to the first one.

322
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,289
Well, you know... No, I'm
looking forward to seeing it.

323
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,624
I'm just going to have to stay at
the motel certain nights

324
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:43,959
and get some work done.
Of course, of course.

325
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:45,494
I have to, so...

326
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:47,696
You got to work
on your illustrations or...

327
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:48,964
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

328
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,133
So how's all that going?
What's the latest?

329
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:53,001
It's going well, yeah.
I got a children's book deal.

330
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:54,136
Oh, you did get a deal?
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:55,371
That's great, because
last time we spoke,

332
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,139
you said you were maybe
about to or something,

333
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:58,807
but you got it... Hey, I found out
about a month ago

334
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,908
and I didn't
want to jinx it.

335
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,243
But you know,
now it's pretty official,

336
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,644
so I'm starting
to tell people.

337
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,813
There's a book I started
about eight months ago,

338
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:06,749
<i>called  Henry
and the Haunted Piano.</i>

339
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:10,651
And I sent you a PDF for that
a while back.

340
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,854
Never heard from you
about it and so... Right.

341
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:14,155
I don't know if I got it.
Did I get it?

342
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:15,556
Yeah, you got it.
You were busy.

343
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:17,692
And it's a big commitment to read
a children's book, so...

344
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:22,363
You weren't the first person
I sent the PDF to, either.

345
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,133
Fair enough.

346
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,504
<i>Henry and the Haunted Piano.</i>

347
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,506
Little boy named Henry,

348
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,741
walking home from
school one day,

349
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:37,612
He hears this music,
piano playing coming from the cemetery,

350
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:39,080
goes to the cemetery.

351
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:42,183
Discovers a piano haunted
by a ghost there, all right?

352
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:44,452
Gets terrified, runs away,

353
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:46,454
and continues
to hear the music

354
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:48,855
because he lives very close to
the cemetery, right.

355
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:51,358
And later that night,
he can hear the piano playing

356
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
while he's doing
his homework,

357
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:54,461
while he's taking a bath,
while he's trying to sleep.

358
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:57,364
He gets pissed off when he's trying
to sleep because he can't sleep.

359
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,899
He goes back
to the cemetery,

360
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:00,400
confronts the ghost
for a final confrontation.

361
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,536
That's where it gets
a little bit dark.

362
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:04,905
And the publishers are a
little concerned about that.

363
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:08,708
They think the ending is...
The ending is too dark, so...

364
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,478
Well, why? What happens
in the ending?

365
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,280
Henry dies.

366
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:14,881
The ghost kill him?

367
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,216
Well, that's interpretive.

368
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:17,818
The children can
interpret that.

369
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,920
But they think it's a little too dark.
Well, I...

370
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:22,756
I don't want to take sides,
but I can see where they're coming from.

371
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:26,659
Right! No, so I'm trying
to find a way to change it.

372
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,894
If I get published by this company,
it's pretty good.

373
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:31,230
It'll be good for my,
you know, burgeoning...

374
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,232
Well, non-existent career,
but it could lead to things.

375
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:36,769
So, I wanted to make sure
they're happy and...

376
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:40,606
Seems like you're very ready to
compromise your artistic vision

377
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,141
to get published by
a medium-sized publisher

378
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:44,076
rather than preserving
your integrity and your vision

379
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:47,146
and going to a slightly smaller,
fringe, edgy, publisher.

380
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:49,849
Absolutely, I'll do whatever it takes
to get this thing published.

381
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:52,251
So, rape me,
here's the lubrication.

382
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,519
Rape me, here's
the lubrication.

383
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,753
You're allowing
them to rape you.

384
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:55,788
You're easing the process.
Oh!

385
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,989
In this case,
I want to get raped.

386
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:59,558
I want to make a living,
having sodomy.

387
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:04,129
Can you get some more nach...
Uh, the chips?

388
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,930
You want me
to get them?

389
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,199
No, no, I'm looking
for the guy.

390
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,776
<i>Front desk. This is Alan.</i>

391
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,112
Hey, Alan, this is Alex
calling from room 106.

392
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,282
Um, I have a little
bit of a back pain

393
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:26,684
and it's making it really difficult for
me to sleep at night.

394
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm doing a lot of...
Kind of tossing and turning.

395
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,956
And I was wondering if it'd be possible
to maybe get a late checkout.

396
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,191
<i>Oh!
Tomorrow morning.</i>

397
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,392
<i>You're out of luck,
I'm sorry.</i>

398
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:36,294
<i>It's not in our policy
to allow late checkouts.</i>

399
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:40,698
<i>It's the hotel's policy to not allow
late checkouts.</i>

400
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,645
How was the call?

401
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,813
It was good. Sorry I was
on the phone so long.

402
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,181
Oh, that's okay.

403
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,516
How are you?
You all right?

404
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,218
Yeah, yeah. Good.

405
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,920
How's your back?

406
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:08,492
I feel like for the past little while it
was getting better and better and then...

407
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,193
These little...
Just sharp little...

408
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,564
I was in the bathroom a little while ago
and just felt this, like,

409
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,265
jolt of pain go up my spine.

410
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,101
I know this guy
who's a reflexologist

411
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,905
and he... He fixes backs,
by, uh...

412
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,374
You know, reflexologists?
The... The foot?

413
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,510
Yeah, he massages
pressure points in the feet

414
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,513
and he actually fixes
back pain that way.

415
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,516
So you might have to think about
looking up a reflexologist tomorrow

416
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,285
and checking that out,
because it could help.

417
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,287
I doubt there...
I doubt there are reflex...

418
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,591
You shouldn't dismiss it. I think there's
Africans, when they get circumcised,

419
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:46,028
African women, who wanna have their
clitoris reattached, they...

420
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:50,866
Plastic surgeons would take the tip of their toe,
they'll sever the tip of their toe

421
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,935
and reattach it
to their vagina.

422
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:57,540
If there's a connection between the
tip of the toe and the vagina,

423
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:02,078
there's probably a connection between
pressure points in the foot and, like...

424
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,579
The energy that resides
at the base of the back.

425
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:08,049
The kundalini, which is... Sounds
like yours is out of whack and...

426
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:10,652
So, I think it's worth
checking into, Alex.

427
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,685
Like, I'm really sensual
in the sack.

428
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:47,254
I like to kiss, I like to cuddle,
I'm affectionate.

429
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:48,422
Mmm-hmm.
Kissing's big.

430
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:50,190
And kissing's not easy
when you're having sex.

431
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,660
Yeah, I hear girls love it when you
kiss them during sex. Mmm-hmm.

432
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:55,963
Rachel! Do you guys kiss
when you...

433
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:58,832
Sure. Sure. Yeah, yeah.

434
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,702
Girls must love the beard when
you go down on them, right?

435
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:04,872
'Cause then... Have they ever told you that?
'Cause of the bristles.

436
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,307
Um... 'Cause I had a goatee once,
right after college...

437
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:09,309
Remember when I had a goatee,
right after college? Yeah, yeah.

438
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,978
You looked... And I went down
on a girl and she said,

439
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,815
"I love the fact that you have these
sort of sharp, bristly things..."

440
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,884
Oh, they like that? The girls hate...
This one girl did.

441
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:19,887
My... The girls that I get with hate
it when I have a really short one,

442
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,454
when it's this really
short and bristly.

443
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:22,722
They like it when
it's soft, 'cause it's...

444
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:24,190
When it's long and soft.
Right, right.

445
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:27,226
Yeah, it's like a cat's tongue, you know?
Yeah.

446
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:31,230
I've only been with a few girls that have
actually had a cat go down on them.

447
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,866
I've heard that cats
have dicks that hook back

448
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:38,137
and so, when they latch on,
it's harder for the female to escape.

449
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:40,473
Have you heard this? I don't know
if it's just like a horned dick.

450
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:43,342
No. Like with a curve at the end,
like hooks them in.

451
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:44,844
And you think
that's brilliant

452
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:47,647
'cause basically all animal sex is rape,
I think. Right?

453
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,482
Oh, right! 'Cause they don't really
ask for permission.

454
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:52,318
But that... Why haven't we all
developed the hook dick?

455
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,721
It seems obvious.
That's interesting. Right.

456
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,860
Now this is
an interesting... Ohh!

457
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:05,163
This is an interesting connection.
This is your neck.

458
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:07,265
And that can be
both physical,

459
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,502
in terms of a crick in the neck,
whiplash, whatever.

460
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:13,538
Or... I know, sweetie...
It can be, um...

461
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,609
Tied to a... Someone who's being
a pain in the neck.

462
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:22,547
Quite often your mother, although certainly,
potentially a female person.

463
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:24,316
I know, sweetie.

464
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:33,859
Basically, your neck just said,
"Hey, they're all pains in the neck."

465
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,696
No gender specificity here.

466
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:40,698
It's all a pain in the neck.

467
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,968
Yeah, yeah, you got a point there,
buddy. You got a point there.

468
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,537
I heard that in Africa,
you know there's...

469
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:49,440
In some cultures there's a strange
tradition of circumcising

470
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:52,042
women's genitalia.
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:55,246
And sometimes they have these
Doctors Without Borders or whatever,

472
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:58,149
and they actually try to
correct the surgery later on.

473
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:59,817
Yes, yes. I don't know if you've
heard about this.

474
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,420
They actually... What they do sometimes
is that they take a part of their toe

475
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:06,123
and put it where the clitoris
used to be. Yes, yes.

476
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,961
So is there, anatomically, a part of
the foot that has a sexual center?

477
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:16,000
Because it is the end of a digit,
for all practical purposes,

478
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,269
my guess would be...

479
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:21,137
Chances are good.

480
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,140
So, 50-50
would be my thought.

481
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,911
Ohh!

482
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:35,151
<i>Would it be possible to, like,
sell some DVDs here or somewhere too?</i>

483
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,419
Put up a little table
or something?

484
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:38,121
Let's go in here,
we'll talk about it now.

485
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:40,123
I'm gonna stay out here.
Can we eat? Can I eat this?

486
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,791
No! You have to just
stand here and look at it.

487
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,626
Oh, I can eat this.
Don't eat. Don't eat.

488
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:45,295
We haven't had dinner yet.

489
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:47,797
It's so pretty... Well, what do you need...
Are we gonna go in there?

490
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,366
Just... Just...
Let's go this way.

491
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:54,704
<i>Did you hear that? It's coming from
over there, behind me.</i>

492
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:59,474
<i>That's a Pileated. So we're
going to stay right here, Wes.</i>

493
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:02,177
<i>That's not the bird
I'm looking for.</i>

494
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,019
Okay. That's good.

495
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,454
Hey, Rachel,
how are you?

496
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:15,190
I'm just calling to, uh...

497
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:18,861
To call and... And...

498
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:23,131
Yeah, if you feel like giving me a call,
I'd love to...

499
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:28,203
To, you know, to see... Just to check
in with you and see how you're doing.

500
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:32,307
So give me a call when you get a chance,
if you feel like it.

501
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:34,810
Okay, I hope
you're well, bye.

502
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,422
Frittata!

503
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:52,493
We have the gate band concert on Saturday
to try to make some more money

504
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:56,764
to help buy this place back from
the bank so we can really own it.

505
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:59,767
We're working
our way there, um...

506
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,269
As you can probably
see on the slides,

507
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,537
we, you know,
have the building fund going on.

508
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,408
We really want to pay off the bank this year,
so fork it over.

509
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:12,113
And keep coming to the movies and all that.
We have, uh...

510
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,016
<i>I Love You Phillip Morris continues
through Thursday, starting Friday.</i>

511
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
- Who wrote that?
- What's that?

512
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:35,702
- Who wrote that?
- The movie? I wrote it.

513
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:37,103
That's clever.
Thank you.

514
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:39,205
It's one of the funniest movies
I've seen in a long time.

515
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:42,208
Oh, that's nice, thank you.
Thank you.

516
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,645
Thank you, we tried to have
some fun with the... Thank you.

517
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,447
Hey, how's it going?
Hi. Good, how're you?

518
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,382
All right, nice to see you again.
Great to see you.

519
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:52,118
So, what made you
come out here?

520
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,054
I... You know, it's just better
the second time.

521
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:56,889
Oh, thank you
very much. Yeah.

522
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:58,791
Congratulations! You just...
Well, thank you very much.

523
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:02,227
You keep getting better with age.
I bought my DVD already.

524
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:05,297
Just... I don't know. Can I
talk to you for one second?

525
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,700
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
'Cause I just... I wanna...

526
00:34:08,902 --> 00:34:10,002
One second.

527
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,571
- Yeah.
- Hey.

528
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:13,806
Hi.
How are you?

529
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:16,308
I'm doing well. It's good.
Oh, sorry!

530
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,277
What's going on?
What're you doing here?

531
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,346
I just... I wanted
to surprise you.

532
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:23,282
Well, it's a surprise,
it's a surprise. Surprise.

533
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,985
What's going? Why'd you come here?
Because I just...

534
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:29,254
I thought that we should
be together, right?

535
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:30,656
I mean, I thought
you would like it.

536
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,457
I just wanted to make you happy.
You thought I'd like it?

537
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:36,427
You thought I'd like it for you to follow me
to the next town that I'm in?

538
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,096
Yeah.
How did you get here?

539
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:39,364
I took the bus.

540
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:41,799
You took the bus all the
way out here? Yeah.

541
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:42,934
Okay.

542
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,342
River, that night
was just that night.

543
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,810
I'm sorry I have to be
so direct with you.

544
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,013
But we... That's it. Okay?
That's it.

545
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:57,048
That's... That's it.

546
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,182
Okay?

547
00:34:58,184 --> 00:34:59,517
Wait, I don't know what you're saying.
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,785
I don't mean to be a dick.
I don't understand.

549
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,987
I don't know how to be any
more clear about this.

550
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,890
Look, I think it's really cute and romantic
and fun that you came here.

551
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:09,127
But there's no chance we're hooking up
again tonight. Okay?

552
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:11,328
Okay, that was a mistake,
I regret...

553
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,563
I don't mean to be rude,
but I regret it.

554
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:15,632
I had... I had
a break in something...

555
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:18,035
What? A break? ...and I got something
out of my system.

556
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:20,637
I just... I can't... I have to go
sell some DVDs.

557
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,839
I can't really spend time
with this, right now.

558
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:25,308
Wait. I don't... I don't know
what you're saying,

559
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,010
I don't understand.
Hey, hey, go home.

560
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,178
Go home.
What do you mean?

561
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,846
How can I be any more clear
to you? Go home.

562
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,848
It's fucking over, okay?

563
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,183
It wasn't any...
There's nothing even to end.

564
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:34,918
What do you mean,
"It's over"?

565
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,225
What do you mean? Keep your voice down.
Keep your voice down.

566
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,827
Don't fucking touch me.
I wanna touch you.

567
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:45,028
Shh!

568
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,064
Just relax. Okay, look,
I'll be back in one minute.

569
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:49,132
Okay? I'll be back
in one minute.

570
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,603
<i>So, she followed
you out here?</i>

571
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:59,842
I think she researched the next stop
on the tour and she just showed up.

572
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,677
Did you fuck her?

573
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,547
No, no! We talked very briefly for like,
10 minutes

574
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:07,349
after one of the screenings we
had a few days ago and like...

575
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,219
She thought there's
a brief connection.

576
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:11,921
We talked about birds for like
10 minutes and the movie

577
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:14,356
and she thought there's this connection
and now we're like soul mates.

578
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,526
She never would've followed
someone out to another city

579
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:19,962
because of a conversation
about birds. Okay, I don't...

580
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:22,731
She thought we're meant for each other,
she thought it was destiny

581
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:27,103
and she thought it'd be this really grand
romantic gesture for her to just surprise me.

582
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,204
She's really cute.
Yeah.

583
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:30,371
We should take
her for a drink.

584
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:31,773
We should go have
a drink with her.

585
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,541
You know, if she's upset,
you know, she...

586
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:34,642
It's the least
you could do.

587
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:35,977
I don't want anything
to do with this girl.

588
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:39,814
She's clingy, she's needy,
she's unstable, trust me.

589
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:44,486
I mean, she came all the way out here
and she's feeling a little bit out of it.

590
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:48,323
So we should, you know...
One drink. She's really cute, man.

591
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,401
What I love about this place is that it's haunted,
there's an actual ghost here.

592
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:03,404
Don't you think there's something
going on here? Kismet?

593
00:37:03,406 --> 00:37:04,906
That's like my favorite word.
That's a Turkish word.

594
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:06,574
Kismet?
Mmm-hmm.

595
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:09,743
It's like fate, it's destiny.
How do ghosts fit in that?

596
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:13,247
Well, you know, two spirits,
two lost spirits, having spirits

597
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:15,182
at a place that's
haunted by things.

598
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:17,284
You know,
everybody's got a ghost.

599
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,919
A skeleton
in the closet, right?

600
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,655
But the third and the most important S...
You're so wise.

601
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,124
The most important S...
Thank you, so are you.

602
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:27,027
...is to celebrate your life.

603
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,762
But celebrate with an "S".

604
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:31,265
Not a "C", right?
Sounds crazy!

605
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:34,968
it's not just important that you
spell things differently

606
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,037
and that you see
things differently,

607
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,172
and that you live
things differently...

608
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,373
You live your
life differently.

609
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,008
That's so brilliant!

610
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,944
Isn't it? So brilliant!
You're so brilliant.

611
00:37:43,946 --> 00:37:47,780
I am going to go celebrate
in the ladies room.

612
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:49,115
I'll be back.

613
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:53,352
She's fantastic.
Yeah.

614
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,221
You guys are really clicking.
I love her.

615
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:56,522
What's the problem?

616
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,658
Maybe there isn't a problem.
There's no problem at all.

617
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,026
You should go back
to the hotel

618
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,063
and I'll stay with her and you know,
we'll just continue talking.

619
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,999
Oh, really? Yeah? Yeah, I mean, yeah.
This'll be great.

620
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,402
You sure?
I'll take a taxi back.

621
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:12,205
You know, you shouldn't worry
about it, it's totally cool.

622
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,472
Really?
Yeah, go back.

623
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:15,675
Yeah, it's fantastic,
I mean, this is great.

624
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:17,810
Okay, sounds great. Well,
good luck! Yeah, hopefully...

625
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,045
I don't think you
need it though.

626
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,479
Hopefully
I'll see you tomorrow.

627
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,048
Okay.
Yeah?

628
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:13,130
<i>Hey, Rachel, it's me. Just calling to see
if you wanted to chat.</i>

629
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,869
<i>As the days go on here on the road,
I have more time.</i>

630
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:20,871
<i>It's given me...</i>

631
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:25,075
...a little bit more
perspective on things,

632
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:28,045
and I'm slowly,
sort of, you know...

633
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:32,216
I'm sort of looking back on the...
On what happened, what went wrong and...

634
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:34,318
I feel like, you know,
I've had...

635
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,888
I've needed to have this, sort of,
vision of myself

636
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,725
as a more successful and more
established and more secure person.

637
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,161
I've been sort of fixated on the future,
you know what I mean?

638
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:48,298
And I felt... I've always felt like marriage
would maybe compromise

639
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,001
that possibility for growth,
if not annihilate it, you know?

640
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,437
I felt like marriage
was like...

641
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:57,907
Those amber drops
that they put on insects,

642
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,742
to make them specimens,
you know, that...

643
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,745
That was sort of
my fear of marriage.

644
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:07,583
It would sort of make me freeze...
Make me plateau.

645
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:10,119
So what
underlies that?

646
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,089
What underlies that
fear of stagnation?

647
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:17,026
What underlies... What underlies
that fear of stagnation?

648
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:19,028
What...

649
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,763
It doesn't...

650
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:48,957
<i>Hello, front desk.</i>

651
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:53,495
Yes, hi, would it be possible to get
a late checkout tomorrow morning?

652
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:54,696
Maybe an extra hour?

653
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:56,164
<i>Sorry, sir,
we cannot do it.</i>

654
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,299
Why not?

655
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,474
And ever since
that incident...

656
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,776
...the piano
playing ceased...

657
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:13,080
And as for
little Henry Holiday...

658
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:15,149
...he was allowed
to rest in peace.

659
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:19,019
And then his glasses are there
in front of the tombstone.

660
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,921
He's dead.
He's dead.

661
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:23,090
He's dead.
It's stupid.

662
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:25,726
Oh, no, it's actually
brilliant because... No,

663
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:27,561
it's too dark.
When do... No.

664
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:29,997
When do you ever see a kid die
in a children's book?

665
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:32,833
It's great, I mean,
I love that he's dead.

666
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:34,769
Really? I mean, not that I
wanted him to die

667
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,837
because he's a great
protagonist but, like,

668
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,572
kids never get
to see people die

669
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:43,343
and you know they get told all these lies,
like, their grandma went to the farm

670
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,545
or something... No, their dog
went to the farm,

671
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,013
and that's just not true.

672
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:49,015
I appreciate that,
I agree with that completely.

673
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:51,718
I think that the reason why I want
there to be death in a children's book...

674
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,587
I've never seen death so ostensibly
portrayed in a children's book...

675
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:56,389
Is so that kids
can be exposed

676
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,893
to bad things early in life so they're
more prepared to deal with it later.

677
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,795
You know? Yeah, no,
it's a public service.

678
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:04,531
This is really...
This is a good education.

679
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:07,200
Good heart inside
your chest, I can feel it.

680
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:11,070
It's bleeding right now, you probably
need a tampon for your heart.

681
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:42,401
Hey.

682
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,103
How'd you sleep?

683
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,605
I slept well.
How'd you sleep?

684
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,806
I slept really well.

685
00:42:49,576 --> 00:42:51,577
Yeah, River, she stayed
here last night.

686
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,345
Guys stayed here last night?
Yeah.

687
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:54,780
When did you guys get in?

688
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:56,849
Just a couple of hours ago.

689
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:58,317
I haven't even been
asleep yet. I actually...

690
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,751
Let's talk outside
for a second.

691
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,653
I don't want
to wake her up.

692
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:07,425
I had one of the greatest nights of my life
with her last night!

693
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:10,094
I mean, we just... We just connected.
It was incredible.

694
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:12,430
I've never had an experience
like this before.

695
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:14,665
It's like looking in a mirror
and seeing myself.

696
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:18,169
She's like the perfect height,
perfect intelligence.

697
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,538
It's hard to explain,
man, I would never

698
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,274
in a million years say
the word soulmate, but...

699
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:24,876
I think we're soulmates.

700
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:27,478
And she's got friends
in Shreveport

701
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,615
and I was thinking that she would
ride along with us

702
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:31,782
and we could stay
with her friends.

703
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:34,552
And you know, save money on the motel,
and you know...

704
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:36,621
You want her to go
on the tour with us?

705
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:38,622
Not the whole tour, just...

706
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:42,359
That's the thing, I feel like we've known
each other our whole lives.

707
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:45,996
I feel like this instant
kinda...connection, you know?

708
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,498
I've never had this happen before.
It's amazing.

709
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,400
You really
like this girl, huh?

710
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:55,572
Yes... I like her a lot.
It's incredible.

711
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:57,574
You know.

712
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,444
You know, what...
What does that mean?

713
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:04,814
That's what it is,
I think, you know?

714
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:08,418
And then an infinity symbol,
like the heart.

715
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:14,024
There's so many symbols and logos going
through my head right now, thinking of her.

716
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,759
Let me... Let me just
have a cup of coffee.

717
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,662
Let me wake up a little bit

718
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:23,232
and we'll go from there, let me just
think about it for a second, okay?

719
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:24,400
Yeah.

720
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:29,772
<i># If you want me,
you can have me</i>

721
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:33,409
<i># Sideways, upside down,
any way you want</i>

722
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:36,745
# Put it in all the way

723
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:41,250
# Put it in all the way

724
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:45,554
# I love you and
I know you love me back

725
00:44:45,556 --> 00:44:48,057
# Let me slide it in

726
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,192
<i># All the way
to your crack, is that?</i>

727
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:54,530
<i># If you want me,
you can have me</i>

728
00:44:54,532 --> 00:44:58,032
<i># Sideways, upside down,
any way you want</i>

729
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:01,035
<i># So come on</i>

730
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:03,204
<i># Baby, come on</i>

731
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,139
Alex, you know this shit.
One, two, three!

732
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:08,242
<i># Come on!</i>

733
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:10,945
<i># Baby, come on!</i>

734
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,113
<i># Stop! </i>

735
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:16,284
We are gonna totally
start a fucking band.

736
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,653
It's gonna be awesome!
That was so good.

737
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:21,589
My heart was feeling a totally
different number, not 28.

738
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:25,093
I was feeling 33, that was the age
Jesus Christ was when he died.

739
00:45:25,095 --> 00:45:27,061
That was the age of Chris Farley
when he died.

740
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:29,464
And I should have gone with that,
because Chris Farley's image...

741
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,265
His face just
popped in my head.

742
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:35,035
But 28 is what
I was feeling as well.

743
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,171
But 33 ultimately is what
I should have chose.

744
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:42,009
You got close, though. Do you think
the source that's telling you 33

745
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:43,577
is the number
you should have drawn

746
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:46,446
is the same source that told you initially
that 28 was the right number?

747
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:47,648
You never know.
I feel like...

748
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,916
Now I'm thinking
the source is 33.

749
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:51,251
No, now you think it's 33?

750
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:53,920
But what was the number?
It landed on 30,

751
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:57,257
which is between 28 and 33 almost,
so I should have chose 33.

752
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,159
You know what, stop the car...
What are you doing?

753
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,961
...because I'm going to do it again.
Close the door.

754
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,929
I think you guys stay in the car
this time.

755
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:05,265
Because I think you were distracting me,
because you're gorgeous.

756
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:06,433
Henry, please get in the car.

757
00:46:06,435 --> 00:46:07,868
You were distracting me
because you're defeatist.

758
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,003
I'm going to do what I should
have done with all this money.

759
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:11,772
Henry! Rest of the money
I have, by the way...

760
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:13,939
What're you doing? ...on the age
of Jesus when he died, 33.

761
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,709
Your credit card debt, say goodbye to it,
because it's going to be gone.

762
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:19,779
You're going to thank me when
I come back! Henry, Henry!

763
00:46:29,222 --> 00:46:31,991
Last night, did you guys...

764
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:35,194
When you were hanging out
last night, did you...

765
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,930
Does he know how we met?

766
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:40,866
Does he know
that we had sex?

767
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,038
No, he doesn't know.

768
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,740
You guys didn't
talk about it?

769
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:49,642
It hasn't come up. He doesn't know
that we hooked up?

770
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:55,980
a lot of fascinating, wonderful,
personal, intellectual ideas.

771
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:57,816
We haven't talked
about you, I'm sorry.

772
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,951
Mr. Self-involved filmmaker.
Okay, so...

773
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:04,622
Though he did mention that you
have a girlfriend back home.

774
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:09,661
So he doesn't know
we had sex on the beach?

775
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,097
No, he doesn't.

776
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,501
If it did come up, if he asked you,
would you tell him?

777
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,938
Yeah, I would tell him.
If he asks me, I will tell him.

778
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,574
Why? Because I don't lie,
I'm not a liar.

779
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:28,880
I don't lie to people, I don't lie to
them and take advantage of them.

780
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:31,682
You know, like some people...
Like some people who...

781
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:33,684
You know, they seem like
charismatic megafauna

782
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:36,420
and then you realize that they're
not really charismatic at all.

783
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:39,289
Nor are their films even that good
when you watch them a second time.

784
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,925
How did it go?
How'd it go?

785
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:46,463
Was Jesus 32
or 33 when he died?

786
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:47,965
Because I thought
he was 33,

787
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,535
but then, I read somewhere about the
Christian calendar being...

788
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:54,538
You know, the Christian calendar
is totally off...

789
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:09,110
Okay, so River has to go back to Jackson,
Mississippi, tomorrow

790
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,046
for her thesis class,

791
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,114
or she has to teach a TA class
or something like that.

792
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,116
Okay. I think I'm going
to go with her.

793
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,053
Back to Jackson? Yeah, I'm going to
get on the bus with her and go back.

794
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,555
And I don't want to leave you hanging,
'cause I know this is your trip,

795
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,124
and, well, we're doing this together
and I've had an amazing time.

796
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,459
It's been so amazing.

797
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,394
But I have to go with her,
I have to.

798
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,464
I keep thinking about Shel Silverstein
and the way he died.

799
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:31,699
You know who Shel Silverstein is?

800
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,200
Yeah, the comic.

801
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:35,302
No, he was...
The illustrator.

802
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:37,972
<i>He was an illustrator, and wrote
children's books. A Light in the Attic.</i>

803
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,174
<i>Where the Sidewalk Ends,
The Giving Tree.</i>

804
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:42,042
All these great children's
books that he wrote, amazing.

805
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:46,580
But when he died, he died alone,
of a heart attack, in his bedroom.

806
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,315
No one discovered him
for two days.

807
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:50,317
He was discovered
by his maid.

808
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,420
I keep thinking about that,
I don't want to be that person.

809
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:54,722
All the great children's books
that he wrote,

810
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:58,592
stories that he wrote, all the joy that he
brought to children's lives.

811
00:49:58,594 --> 00:50:02,529
Ultimately, I'm just haunted by this
image of him dead alone in his bedroom.

812
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:04,832
I don't want that
to be me, you know?

813
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:08,568
I want someone to discover my body
relatively early after I die.

814
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,471
I think River could be
that person. You know?

815
00:50:13,407 --> 00:50:16,342
I love her. And I'm lonely, man.
It's like, it's...

816
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:18,211
I've been waiting my whole life
to meet someone like this.

817
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:19,779
All the relationships
I've gone through,

818
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:22,382
they just don't work out,
you know, six months in, year in.

819
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:25,518
It's not the person for me. I get terrified
of the thought of being with someone.

820
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,688
After just a couple of days, I really think
I can spend the rest of my life with her.

821
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,357
You don't know what I'm talking about
'cause you have Rachel in your life.

822
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,362
You probably forgot what it's like to...
To be isolated or to be alone.

823
00:50:36,364 --> 00:50:38,765
And I've always had my work to
fall back on, my illustrations,

824
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:40,199
but I want
something more now.

825
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:42,936
And I feel like she
could be the person.

826
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:44,470
If I don't go with her,
I'm just gonna be thinking

827
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,372
about her
the whole time anyway.

828
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:49,708
So, when she takes
that Greyhound bus tomorrow,

829
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,743
I wanna be sitting
next to her.

830
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:53,578
Mmm, I think
you should, man.

831
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,449
I think, you know... I think you should
be sitting beside her in that bus.

832
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:59,084
Yeah. Yeah, and I'm really
happy for you.

833
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:01,453
Like this is... And I don't wanna
leave you...

834
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:03,989
You don't have to ask my permission,
of course I understand.

835
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:09,294
Yeah. So, tomorrow night,
you're going to Jackson.

836
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:10,629
Go comb your hair.

837
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:14,199
What do you mean?
Go comb your hair, it's a...

838
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:17,269
It's a Johnny Cash song.

839
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:18,503
Oh, really?
Yeah.

840
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:21,173
<i>Shel Silverstein wrote
A Boy Named Sue.</i>

841
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:23,241
Shel Silverstein wrote that song?
Yeah, he wrote that.

842
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,309
Really?
Yeah.

843
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:27,611
There is a parade in
Baton Rouge in an hour.

844
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:28,813
It's a pre-Mardi bra.

845
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:31,248
Mardi Bra?
Mardi Gras parade.

846
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,086
She just told me. Let's go. Why don't...
Can we go? Can we go?

847
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:37,288
I don't know.
I'm not really a...

848
00:52:00,812 --> 00:52:02,346
Oh!

849
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:12,422
Hey! Oh!

850
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:15,692
Fuck!

851
00:52:17,328 --> 00:52:19,796
Easy!

852
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:45,771
Alex, you gotta stop
calling me.

853
00:54:45,773 --> 00:54:47,873
<i>Yeah, I know. But, look.
I really need to talk to you.</i>

854
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:49,642
Okay, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

855
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:51,277
I've had a lot of time
on the road

856
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,778
to just kind of look back
on our relationship.

857
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,713
It's given me a lot of
perspective on things and...

858
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:57,383
And I'm beginning to sort of see...
I'm beginning to sort of see,

859
00:54:57,385 --> 00:54:58,951
you know, I'm beginning
to make sense of things.

860
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:01,153
Okay, now when I used to,
like, look up at the night sky

861
00:55:01,155 --> 00:55:03,055
I used to kind of just see,
like, these little dots.

862
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:05,357
These little, like, points
of disagreement, and...

863
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,193
And the arguments
that we had.

864
00:55:07,195 --> 00:55:10,296
But now I feel like I look up
and I see a constellation.

865
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:13,799
I'm trying to make sense of it,
so it's a constellation.

866
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:15,534
<i>You know what I mean?
Does that make sense?</i>

867
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:18,871
Look, Alex. I'm not ready
to talk about this stuff yet.

868
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:21,206
No, I know. But listen,
just hear me out here. I just...

869
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:25,310
I'm realizing that I've been really
sort of fixated on this future self.

870
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:29,013
Like a future version of myself,
a more successful, and established and...

871
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:32,483
A secure version of myself. I need that
just to make sense of myself, in a way.

872
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:34,485
And I've always feared
that marriage would somehow

873
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:37,155
just compromise that
possibility for that growth.

874
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:38,923
You know, so really,
there is a...

875
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:40,992
There's a fear of
stagnation in place.

876
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:43,194
But what underlies that
fear of stagnation? Right?

877
00:55:43,196 --> 00:55:47,332
<i>What's beneath it, what are
the roots of it? You know?</i>

878
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:50,501
Death! Death is the
underlying root of all this.

879
00:55:50,503 --> 00:55:52,403
This fear of commitment,
this fear of marriage,

880
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:55,073
it's a reverberation
of my death anxiety.

881
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:57,775
Okay, that's what's going on. It's
all around us. Death is everywhere.

882
00:55:57,777 --> 00:56:00,844
<i>It's the underlying fear and
that's the most... It's ridiculous.</i>

883
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:02,613
There is no way
to stop death.

884
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:05,249
There is no way to really postpone
it for very long.

885
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:08,085
So if you realize the absurdity of the
underlying fear,

886
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:10,854
then, you know,
any reverberatory fears,

887
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:14,124
<i>you know, quadruply,
astronomically more ridiculous.</i>

888
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:15,626
Where are you going
with all this?

889
00:56:15,628 --> 00:56:20,530
<i>That's what I'm saying. We all are,
we're all gonna die, okay?</i>

890
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:23,533
<i>By denying that, we misdirect
our search for happiness.</i>

891
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:27,037
I'm ready to die. Which means
I'm ready to live.

892
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,207
And I'm ready to love you. Which is
actually why I need you to fly down

893
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,309
to Louisiana
tomorrow afternoon.

894
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:35,479
So I can ask you something in person.
So I could ask you something

895
00:56:35,481 --> 00:56:38,047
I really, really, really don't
wanna ask you on the phone.

896
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:40,549
What are you
talking about?

897
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:42,885
You want me to drop everything,
get on a plane,

898
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:44,787
and fly halfway
across the country?

899
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:47,423
Yeah, just come down
for 12 hours.

900
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:48,824
I don't care
how much it costs.

901
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:52,795
I'm just begging you, please,
please, please, come down.

902
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:55,298
I'm on my knees. Okay, look,
I'm on my knees.

903
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,334
I just... I'm begging you
to please come down.

904
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:01,070
Alex, I'm tired.

905
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:06,242
I'm just driving back from work.
I've had a really long week.

906
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:08,911
Maybe this is something we can talk about
when you get back. Okay?

907
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:11,080
<i>No, look. There's a moment
happening here.</i>

908
00:57:11,082 --> 00:57:14,083
<i>Okay, there is a moment that
I cannot risk evaporating, okay?</i>

909
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:15,451
<i>And I need to seize
the moment.</i>

910
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:18,353
Okay? Please. Look,
I'll fly you in,

911
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,156
spend one night,
and then you can fly back.

912
00:57:21,158 --> 00:57:23,258
Rachel, come on!
I'm begging you.

913
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:29,497
I see the constellation, okay?

914
00:57:29,499 --> 00:57:32,033
<i>Just give me
a second chance.</i>

915
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,269
<i>Okay, I'm begging you.</i>

916
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,271
<i>All right? I...</i>

917
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:38,840
<i>Just... Just get
on the fucking plane.</i>

918
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:59,827
I don't understand the rush. I mean,
why don't you just ask her when you're back...

919
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:02,363
I don't know. I just thought it'd
be romantic and...

920
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:04,498
You know, spontaneous,
impulsive...

921
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,066
Impulsive...
You know what I mean?

922
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:07,401
Yeah!
Impulsive, you know?

923
00:58:07,403 --> 00:58:08,635
I don't think
it's that impulsive.

924
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:10,070
He's been dating her...
It's a little impulsive.

925
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:11,572
...for three, four
and a half years.

926
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:13,340
Constantly? Perpetually?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

927
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:15,576
Alex is not a compulsive person.

928
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,878
Impulsive and spontaneous.
What have you done impulsive?

929
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,813
Oh, I don't know, but...
This week, what have you done...

930
00:58:19,815 --> 00:58:22,349
I just think it would be nice,
if you know, I can tell my kids

931
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:24,718
down the road, "Hey, guess how I proposed
to your mother?" You know?

932
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,820
On a whim, I just called her up.
It'll be a nice story.

933
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:28,856
That's cool, because we're part
of the story, you know.

934
00:58:28,858 --> 00:58:30,824
And you guys
are part of the story.

935
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:32,693
On the southern director's tour and...
Yeah.

936
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:35,561
And 80 years from now,
when you're on your third marriage,

937
00:58:35,563 --> 00:58:38,331
and you talk to your grandkids about
your first wife, you know.

938
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,833
We'll be part of that, part of the story.
That'll be amazing.

939
00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:42,702
That's great!
That's fantastic, man.

940
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:44,604
<i>Congratulations.  Kanpai!
Kanpai!</i>

941
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:46,672
<i>Kanpai!</i>

942
00:58:46,674 --> 00:58:49,008
Empty. Sorry, bad luck.
Oh, okay.

943
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:56,215
Would you guys mind if I dropped
you off a little bit early

944
00:58:56,217 --> 00:59:00,787
at the bus station tomorrow,
like, around 2:00 or 2:15?

945
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:02,722
That way I can get to the airport
without being late.

946
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,857
Yeah, that's fine. No problem.
All right.

947
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:07,026
Oh!

948
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:09,862
It's not letting me click on 3:00.
I think it's actually...

949
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:14,099
On a Tuesday, they're sold out
at 3:00 already, really?

950
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:16,768
Strange. There's another
bus at 8:00.

951
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,271
Going to Jackson,
we could do that.

952
00:59:19,273 --> 00:59:21,706
You think it allows you to click
on the 8:00 but not the 3:00?

953
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,608
Yeah, it does, it's weird.

954
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:55,739
So, how much
is this one here?

955
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:58,843
This one here
is sold for $8,550.

956
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,516
The only thing that
I can think of that we have

957
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,420
that will go in that price range
will be maybe this, I mean...

958
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:12,923
It's emerald, as far
as your color.

959
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:16,126
The stone itself,
I think it's...

960
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:18,529
A gem stone, but...
Okay. Okay.

961
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,931
So I mean, if that's her birthstone,
I think that would be nice.

962
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:23,434
Okay, yeah. And how much
does this go for?

963
01:00:26,938 --> 01:00:28,439
$24.99.

964
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:30,174
And the box is included?

965
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:31,875
I got it. Let's see it.
Let's see it.

966
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:33,877
Check it out. You guys ready?
Yeah.

967
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:36,779
Oh, look at that.
Ah!

968
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,648
That's pretty. That's nice.
You guys don't like it?

969
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,885
I like it.
No, it's very green.

970
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,653
So, that's something.

971
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:45,455
I mean... Well...
What does that mean?

972
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:48,324
Well, it's a green box
and a green stone.

973
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:49,959
Like, probably, what?
A gem stone.

974
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:51,027
It's an emerald,
it's her birthstone.

975
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:55,331
I think it looks nice. That's not
an emerald, that's a gem stone.

976
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,966
That's like,
that's some kind of...

977
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:58,101
Emerald is a type of gem.

978
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,646
How are you?
Good.

979
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:11,146
It's nice to see you.
You too.

980
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:13,982
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's okay.

981
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:17,085
Thank you so much for coming.
Sure. No problem.

982
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:18,687
You want me to get your bag?
No.

983
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:19,755
I got it.
You sure?

984
01:01:19,757 --> 01:01:21,957
Yeah, no, no. I got it.
I can grab it.

985
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:33,602
You're a wild boy,
you're a wild boy.

986
01:01:33,604 --> 01:01:36,004
All right, so the co-op is...
No, they...

987
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:38,240
Do you like arugula and
quinoa and stuff like that?

988
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:39,942
Hey, guys.
They have all that kind of...

989
01:01:39,944 --> 01:01:41,109
How's it going?

990
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:42,544
Rachel...

991
01:01:42,546 --> 01:01:45,847
What's up? You look great.
I'm good.

992
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:48,450
And this is River. Rachel, River.
Hi.

993
01:01:48,452 --> 01:01:49,684
Hi.

994
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:53,688
Hey, so you guys
want to get going?

995
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:57,391
I got a studio space,
but I don't really use it that much.

996
01:01:57,393 --> 01:02:00,127
I try to go on location as much
as possible when I'm working.

997
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:01,696
Like I actually went,

998
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:03,864
believe it or not, to a graveyard when
I was doing a lot of

999
01:02:03,866 --> 01:02:05,766
the conceptual sketches
for the book.

1000
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:07,201
Actually, it was there,

1001
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:09,604
around, surrounded
by death constantly

1002
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:11,372
to the right of me, to the left of me,
in front of me.

1003
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:15,076
It was cool. I actually was inspired.
I could see, I've never...

1004
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:17,378
Draw the... I drew the graveyard,
of course,

1005
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,147
when I saw it was great from 360 angles,
and that kind of thing.

1006
01:02:20,149 --> 01:02:23,050
But there's something else, something morbid,
that kind of seeped into me.

1007
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:25,486
I felt like I was possessed or something
while I was writing.

1008
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:27,887
Do you think it's that building?
That kind of looks like...

1009
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:29,956
I can't see.
Oh, Atkinson, this is it.

1010
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,459
It's Atkinson. See, it's on the inside.
Okay.

1011
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,395
Okay, all right.
This is it, Atkinson Hall.

1012
01:02:35,397 --> 01:02:37,063
All right! So...

1013
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:41,101
You know, intro is gonna be a few minutes
of Q and A. You wanna meet here...

1014
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,736
What time?

1015
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:45,071
Let's meet here at 4:30.
Okay.

1016
01:02:45,073 --> 01:02:46,172
Does that work for you?
Yeah.

1017
01:02:46,174 --> 01:02:48,008
You guys know where you are?
Uh-huh.

1018
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,909
You're not gonna get lost?
No.

1019
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:51,277
See you later.
Okay.

1020
01:02:51,279 --> 01:02:54,414
I'm gonna go introduce the movie.
You wanna come in or...

1021
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:55,582
Uh, yeah.

1022
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:56,683
You sure?
You don't have to.

1023
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:59,085
No, no, no. I'll come in.
Okay.

1024
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:01,755
<i>Okay, class. We're going to watch
the  Woodpecker,</i>

1025
01:03:01,757 --> 01:03:05,191
and as an added treat,
we have the writer and director,

1026
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:08,460
Mr. Alex Karpovsky,

1027
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:11,497
here to watch it with us and answer any
questions afterwards.

1028
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:14,700
So everybody give him
a round of applause.

1029
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:18,337
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

1030
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:23,609
All right. Well, thank you. Thank you very
much for coming here, for watching my film.

1031
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:26,478
I really appreciate it.
Most of the venues

1032
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,348
where I've been showing my film
on the tour

1033
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,650
have been little
art house theaters

1034
01:03:31,652 --> 01:03:34,553
and auditoriums
in college campuses,

1035
01:03:34,555 --> 01:03:36,121
where we show
the film at night.

1036
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:38,057
So, it's kind of a...
It's a treat for me.

1037
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:39,224
It's nice to do
something different,

1038
01:03:39,226 --> 01:03:41,460
to show the movie
in a classroom environment.

1039
01:03:41,462 --> 01:03:42,961
With a production class.

1040
01:03:42,963 --> 01:03:46,698
But I hope you enjoy it. I'll be here
for a Q and A after the film

1041
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,802
where maybe we can get into some of the
details about the film and the process.

1042
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:54,205
Okay, enjoy the film. And I'll see you
soon. Bye-bye.

1043
01:03:58,143 --> 01:04:01,813
Did you get the sense that everyone
in that classroom was high?

1044
01:04:01,815 --> 01:04:04,716
There was this look in their eyes
where they all just seemed

1045
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:06,984
totally glazed over
and baked.

1046
01:04:06,986 --> 01:04:10,288
Or maybe that's just an old
man looking upon the youth.

1047
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:17,328
I kind of almost even think
of those as sister

1048
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,996
anxieties,
or companion anxieties,

1049
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:20,865
because one, like,
ricochets off the other.

1050
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:23,067
When one is affected, there's
kind of a ripple or trickle down.

1051
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:25,102
And in a way, I kind of
think of those two

1052
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:26,937
as almost like
a binary star system.

1053
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:30,340
It's like one kind of just orbits the other.
But there's still a kind of...

1054
01:04:30,342 --> 01:04:32,175
They're still part of the
constellation as a whole.

1055
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:35,378
You know, they're still part of the
whole framework. You know what I mean?

1056
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,750
I don't care about constellations
and reverberations

1057
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,786
and ricocheting.

1058
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:44,755
How do you expect me
to believe that after

1059
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,224
seven years of being
in a relationship,

1060
01:04:47,226 --> 01:04:51,361
that you've had these epiphanies
and you've become this new man?

1061
01:04:51,363 --> 01:04:52,863
You're telling me
that all of your fears

1062
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:55,465
that have fully informed
you and your personality

1063
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:58,335
are now just
completely gone?

1064
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:03,406
That now you're just ready to just
jump back into the relationship

1065
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:05,207
as this new person?

1066
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:06,575
Yeah, epiphanies happen.

1067
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:09,645
You know, sometimes I think,
especially in extraordinary situations,

1068
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:11,280
you know, you can have
real breakthroughs like...

1069
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,617
Look, the last week, for better or for worse,
has been, you know...

1070
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,985
In a way, it's been
an extraordinary week.

1071
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:18,420
We've never fully properly
broken up before.

1072
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:19,655
You know, and it's
forced me to think

1073
01:05:19,657 --> 01:05:22,057
in a very unfamiliar,
unexplored place

1074
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:23,392
that has turned over
a lot of stones for me.

1075
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:25,294
It's been very
illuminating, you know...

1076
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,495
It's been a week.

1077
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:28,430
Look, I'm not saying
Rome was built...

1078
01:05:28,432 --> 01:05:31,834
Okay, I know Rome wasn't built in a day.
I know it's gonna take time.

1079
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:36,238
I feel like I'm making very significant
insight that's gonna lead to very...

1080
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,074
You know, various...
Significant progress.

1081
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:41,477
But, look, I also think
you know, if you...

1082
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,845
If you really just sort of...
Spotlight...

1083
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:46,781
Put all the spotlight
and focus on certain fears,

1084
01:05:46,783 --> 01:05:50,018
then they can evaporate,
you know...

1085
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,288
I don't care about
any of that stuff.

1086
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,356
Do you love me?

1087
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,760
Do you wanna spend the rest of your
life with me?

1088
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:02,096
Are you gonna be
fully honest and open?

1089
01:06:02,098 --> 01:06:03,765
Am I gonna stifle you?

1090
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:09,437
I love you with every part of my heart,
every part of my being.

1091
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:12,340
Okay?

1092
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:14,776
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

1093
01:06:14,778 --> 01:06:17,645
I think being with you will be
the opposite of stifling.

1094
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:20,315
I think it will open up a whole new
world to explore.

1095
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:25,219
And that's why I wanted to fly you down here.
Okay, to tell you all this.

1096
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:29,456
And also to ask you, you know,
a very important question, which I didn't...

1097
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,259
Kind of wasn't preparing
to do it anyway.

1098
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:36,563
Just... So I wanna
ask you something.

1099
01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:38,799
I don't want you
to answer now.

1100
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:42,169
'Cause I don't wanna put
that pressure on you.

1101
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:44,938
Within the next few days.
Whenever you're ready.

1102
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:49,576
I'm glad you flew down.
I'm glad you're here.

1103
01:06:49,578 --> 01:06:53,180
It means so much to me. I'm glad
I was able to tell you this in person

1104
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:55,415
and finally ask you
this question.

1105
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:56,617
So...

1106
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:02,288
Rachel, will you marry me?

1107
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,259
Okay?

1108
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,196
Is it too tight?
Yeah.

1109
01:07:10,198 --> 01:07:12,231
I don't think it's gonna...
Well, if you...

1110
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:13,733
Does that hurt?
Yeah.

1111
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:16,502
That's good.
It's...

1112
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:18,504
It's fine, it's fine.

1113
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:20,606
It's emerald,
it's your birthstone.

1114
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,745
Matches your eyes nicely.
It looks really nice.

1115
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,514
I think if you...

1116
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,349
If you actually
hold it the other way...

1117
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,518
What's wrong?

1118
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,788
It's just a spasm.
All right, it'll go away.

1119
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,423
Since when do you get
back spasms?

1120
01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:38,791
I hurt my back.

1121
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:39,958
Actually I hurt it...

1122
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,394
Oh! I better just try sitting
somewhere. There's...

1123
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:45,530
There's, like, scratches all over your back.
Is that where it's from?

1124
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:47,799
Scratches?
Yeah.

1125
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:49,634
They're all over
your back.

1126
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:51,236
Well, I don't
really see them.

1127
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,404
Oh, I see them
a little bit.

1128
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,039
No, I mean they're
like all over.

1129
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:56,374
Oh, in the back.
Yeah. I wonder...

1130
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:57,943
Oh, you know what?
I think me and Henry were...

1131
01:07:57,945 --> 01:08:01,212
We were driving and we pulled off on
the side of the highway to try to pee.

1132
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:04,149
But we pulled in this terrible spot,
there was all these...

1133
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:07,085
...bushes, like these scratchy bushes,
and I think I kind of...

1134
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,820
I had to get in there
to get out of the highway

1135
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:11,222
so people wouldn't
see my dick, you know, so...

1136
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,258
Got all scratched up.

1137
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,793
I mean, you can't
even see it though.

1138
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:17,495
Have you been with anyone since
you moved out?

1139
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,698
Have I been with anyone?

1140
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:25,069
Like, have I hooked up
with someone else?

1141
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:28,005
Yeah.
Or anything like that.

1142
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:29,239
No.

1143
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:38,816
You promise?

1144
01:08:40,752 --> 01:08:41,885
Yes!

1145
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,627
Okay.

1146
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:53,764
It looks really nice on you.
It matches your eyes.

1147
01:08:59,837 --> 01:09:02,605
<i>Does  Cat in the Hat... Like, was that
a euphemism for something?</i>

1148
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:04,507
How is it disgusting?
You're wearing...

1149
01:09:04,509 --> 01:09:06,609
Hey, guys, how's it going?
...new dresses...

1150
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:07,810
Good, how are you?

1151
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:09,012
All right, we've got
a few minutes.

1152
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,480
Yeah? Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

1153
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:13,549
Let me talk to you for a second.
Come here, come here.

1154
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:16,219
For a second. I'll be right back.
What?

1155
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:17,954
- What did she say?
- What's that?

1156
01:09:17,956 --> 01:09:19,288
What did she say?
Did you ask her?

1157
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,857
She said, uh...

1158
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:30,967
Hmm.

1159
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:32,468
You're so pretty.

1160
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,406
And you look beautiful
with that ring on and...

1161
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,474
Congratulations.

1162
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:41,209
Uh...

1163
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:43,278
It's a little complicated.
Hmm.

1164
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,815
But I asked her not to answer
the question.

1165
01:09:46,817 --> 01:09:48,316
But she allowed me to put the ring
on her finger.

1166
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:49,985
She's wearing the ring?
She's wearing the ring right now.

1167
01:09:49,987 --> 01:09:51,820
That's great. You're engaged!
Yeah, it's like a soft yes.

1168
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:53,488
That's awesome.
Give me a hug. Yeah.

1169
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,490
That's fantastic. Congratulations.
You're a husband.

1170
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:57,893
Well, yeah!
She is... This is...

1171
01:09:57,895 --> 01:09:59,261
It's exciting in a lot of ways.
It is exciting.

1172
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:00,829
Tragic too, in some ways.
Yeah.

1173
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:02,998
But there's a 50% chance
it's gonna work out for you.

1174
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,766
You know, that's
really great!

1175
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:07,669
So you've been
traveling with them long?

1176
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:10,472
Like three days.
Few days, few days.

1177
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,809
Like a lifetime though,
you know.

1178
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,451
You're having
a good time?

1179
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,619
Um, it's a little...

1180
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,423
It's interesting.

1181
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,624
Hmm.

1182
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,594
Good.

1183
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,972
Do you know anything about
scratches on his back?

1184
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,942
Is that a band?

1185
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,710
No, like...

1186
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:53,747
Like scratches. Like, Alex has scratches
all over his back.

1187
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,582
Do you have any idea
what that's from?

1188
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,550
I don't know,
they could be from anything.

1189
01:10:57,552 --> 01:10:59,119
You have no idea?

1190
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:01,554
Hey, I mean,
I have a few ideas.

1191
01:11:01,556 --> 01:11:03,623
I always have
ideas about things.

1192
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,658
Like, I have a very vivid imagination.
Well, I mean...

1193
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,594
I can imagine a lot of things.
I know.

1194
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,996
But do you know
where they're from?

1195
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:20,240
I was thinking maybe I would do
the invitations to the wedding.

1196
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,741
Oh, that's a great idea.
The illustrations.

1197
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:25,578
Maybe do art cards. Maybe do like
an actual... That's a good idea.

1198
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,482
Look, I'm asking you, do you know
about the scratches on his back?

1199
01:11:29,484 --> 01:11:31,584
Do you know
where they're from?

1200
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:33,019
Why can't you
just answer me?

1201
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:36,488
I don't know where
they came from exactly.

1202
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:37,789
I can't be sure.

1203
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:39,591
Because I haven't seen them.

1204
01:11:39,593 --> 01:11:40,692
Did you fuck Alex?

1205
01:11:42,095 --> 01:11:44,296
You're asking me that?

1206
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:46,365
You just got engaged.
Okay?

1207
01:11:46,367 --> 01:11:48,433
You don't wanna ask me
something like that.

1208
01:11:48,435 --> 01:11:50,502
That's not what a person
who's just got engaged...

1209
01:11:50,504 --> 01:11:52,804
Did you fuck him?
Did you fuck my boyfriend?

1210
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:54,306
So, this is awesome, man.

1211
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:55,674
Yeah, I'm really excited.

1212
01:11:55,676 --> 01:11:57,609
She doesn't look
excited, though.

1213
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,711
What's going on over there?
Is she excited?

1214
01:11:59,713 --> 01:12:00,846
Why would you ask me...

1215
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:02,948
Why won't you answer me?
Did you fuck Alex?

1216
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:05,884
Yes, I fucked him, okay?
And he fucked me right back.

1217
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:07,019
That's what happened.

1218
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:08,887
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1219
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,656
Relax. What's wrong with you?

1220
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:13,124
You couldn't keep your mouth shut,
you fucking evil witch!

1221
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:16,928
You fucked her?

1222
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,295
Okay, well, it looks like
Alex isn't here yet.

1223
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:56,466
Does anybody have anything
they want to mention?

1224
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:06,643
Hey, Rachel.

1225
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:11,748
Rachel, could you
stop, please?

1226
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:12,949
Rachel?

1227
01:13:14,252 --> 01:13:15,518
Hey!

1228
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,620
Where are you going?

1229
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:19,022
Open the car and get my bag.

1230
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,157
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.

1231
01:13:22,526 --> 01:13:24,227
You going to the airport
and you're gonna fly away?

1232
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,029
Yeah.

1233
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,497
Open the car.

1234
01:13:32,636 --> 01:13:34,270
Look, I'm sorry.

1235
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:37,473
Okay?

1236
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:38,707
I'm sorry.

1237
01:13:41,578 --> 01:13:44,446
In the grand scheme of things,
I didn't think it mattered.

1238
01:13:44,448 --> 01:13:45,948
Okay?

1239
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,249
You asked me if
I hooked up with anyone.

1240
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:48,450
In the grand
scheme of things,

1241
01:13:48,452 --> 01:13:49,952
in terms of what I was trying to
communicate to you

1242
01:13:49,954 --> 01:13:53,088
in the moment, in terms of our plans
for our future together,

1243
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,458
my hopes for my future with you,
it did not matter.

1244
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,861
And I still feel
like it doesn't matter.

1245
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:07,303
Just give me my bag.

1246
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,674
You're sick.

1247
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,810
You're sick.

1248
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:22,984
<i>Here you have this incredible,
glorious creature,</i>

1249
01:14:22,986 --> 01:14:27,989
<i>one of the most beautiful birds
to ever fly in North America.</i>

1250
01:14:27,991 --> 01:14:31,025
<i>And then, because of
our own stupidities,</i>

1251
01:14:31,027 --> 01:14:33,528
deforestation,
our negligence,

1252
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:37,465
it was allowed
to fade away.

1253
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:39,767
It disappeared,
it went extinct.

1254
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:43,338
And then we find out
60, 70 years later,

1255
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:47,642
that, perhaps it's been
miraculously revived.

1256
01:14:47,644 --> 01:14:49,609
And, uh...

1257
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:53,213
Here we have an unbelievable
opportunity to...

1258
01:14:55,316 --> 01:14:57,050
To learn from our mistakes.

1259
01:14:57,052 --> 01:14:59,486
To find the bird,
to protect its habitat,

1260
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:01,922
and perhaps, set an example
for other endangered species.

1261
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,293
However, more recently,

1262
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:09,796
I realized that there's no such thing
as second chances,

1263
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:13,300
because we're gonna make
the same mistakes again.

1264
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:15,369
Sooner or later,
it's gonna happen.

1265
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:19,306
<i>And if we're doomed to make
the same mistakes again,</i>

1266
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:21,808
<i>then in principle,</i>

1267
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:26,146
<i>we can't really have a true
and free second opportunity.</i>

1268
01:15:26,148 --> 01:15:30,483
<i>And the reason we're doomed to
make the same mistakes again is...</i>

1269
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,218
<i>Is because we don't change.</i>

1270
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,221
<i>Fundamentally, we'll never
be able to change.</i>

1271
01:15:35,223 --> 01:15:38,991
<i>We're all going to make the same
mistakes again in one form or another,</i>

1272
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:39,358
<i>until we die.</i>

1273
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:48,234
<i>A great poet once said,
"Hope is the thing with feathers."</i>

1274
01:15:48,236 --> 01:15:52,171
<i>A great, glorious thing
that allows us to fly</i>

1275
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:55,674
<i>high above the thought
of our imminent extinction.</i>

1276
01:15:56,877 --> 01:15:59,412
<i>Now, my feathers
have been plucked,</i>

1277
01:15:59,414 --> 01:16:01,414
<i>my feathers
have been scattered.</i>

1278
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:03,716
<i>But maybe one day
they will find me again.</i>

1279
01:16:03,718 --> 01:16:08,253
<i>Somehow, somewhere down this lonely
American road.</i>

1280
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:10,455
<i>I understand,
but I still can't give you</i>

1281
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:11,956
<i>a late checkout
tomorrow morning.</i>

1282
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:13,725
Why not? After everything
I've told you.

1283
01:16:13,727 --> 01:16:18,229
After explaining to you that my heart
has been ripped out of my chest, okay?

1284
01:16:18,231 --> 01:16:20,131
I've been abandoned
by everyone I know,

1285
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:24,536
that I'm gonna have to continue the
rest of this frittata tour all by myself.

1286
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,806
My back is
raging with pain.

1287
01:16:27,808 --> 01:16:29,374
Okay, I'm not gonna be able
to sleep comfortably

1288
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,309
for more than 20 minutes
in a row tonight, okay?

1289
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:34,579
You can't give me one extra hour
to lick my wounds?

1290
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:36,981
<i>That's correct, sir.
Those are the rules.</i>

1291
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:38,383
Right.

1292
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:42,120
Right, rules are rules, right?
Gotta follow the rules, right?

1293
01:16:42,122 --> 01:16:44,088
Gotta follow the rules, right?

1294
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,389
Rules and regs.

1295
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:48,725
What's the point of living
in a world that's this cold,

1296
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:52,396
this unforgiving,
this harsh. Hmm?

1297
01:16:52,398 --> 01:16:55,466
What happened to a random
act of kindness to a stranger?

1298
01:16:55,468 --> 01:16:58,502
<i>What's the point?
Look, if you wanna stay an extra hour</i>

1299
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:01,605
<i>tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
charge you for an extra day.</i>

1300
01:17:01,607 --> 01:17:03,507
Okay. Well, you know, I...

1301
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:06,243
I guess I'll take my
pain killers and hope,

1302
01:17:06,245 --> 01:17:10,180
you know, my back pain isn't
too terribly excruciating.

1303
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:13,784
And, you know, if I end up needing
an extra, you know,

1304
01:17:13,786 --> 01:17:16,086
half an hour or hour
of sleep tomorrow morning,

1305
01:17:16,088 --> 01:17:20,491
you can go ahead and charge me for the
whole day rate, just charge it on my card.

1306
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:23,093
Go ahead, use the card.

1307
01:17:23,095 --> 01:17:24,427
<i>Okay.
Mmm-hmm, yeah.</i>

1308
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:26,095
Charge...
Put it on the card.

1309
01:17:26,097 --> 01:17:28,631
<i>Yeah, charge it up. Okay, sir,
you have a great night.</i>

1310
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,600
All right,
have a better night.

1311
01:17:31,602 --> 01:17:32,935
Okay.

1312
01:17:43,981 --> 01:17:46,148
<i>Thank you for calling
Bank Of America.</i>

1313
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,618
<i>This is Barbara,
how may I help you?</i>

1314
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,689
Hi, Barbara. I seem to have
misplaced my credit card.

1315
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:58,861
And I was wondering if you could
maybe freeze it, you know.

1316
01:17:58,863 --> 01:18:02,131
Put a freeze on it and
maybe send me a new one?

1317
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:05,600
"Goodbye, everyone.

1318
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:08,203
"Some of you

1319
01:18:10,506 --> 01:18:12,974
"will remember me

01:18:12,976 --> 01:18:15,377
"as a kind friend,

1321
01:18:17,313 --> 01:18:19,080
"a caring brother,

"or a..."

1323
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:25,053
Something filmmaker.

1324
01:18:36,098 --> 01:18:39,000
What kind of a filmmaker?

1325
01:18:39,002 --> 01:18:40,335
"Gifted."

1326
01:18:41,904 --> 01:18:43,270
"Adroit."

1327
01:18:47,509 --> 01:18:52,079
"Or as an adroit
filmmaker.

1328
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:54,949
"But most of you

1329
01:18:57,752 --> 01:19:00,588
"will remember me as..."

1330
01:19:03,692 --> 01:19:06,060
As what?

1331
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,063
<i>Global network that supports our lives
can act as a conductor.</i>

1332
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:49,002
...240 nano-Tesla is going
to be mind-boggling,

1333
01:19:49,004 --> 01:19:52,005
leaving us fully exposed
to the fury of the sun.

1334
01:19:53,474 --> 01:19:57,243
<i>A nano-Tesla is a measure
of electro-magnetic power.</i>

1335
01:19:57,245 --> 01:20:00,312
The biggest solar storm
recorded in 1859

1336
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:03,949
is estimated to have been
around 200 nano-Teslas.

1337
01:20:03,951 --> 01:20:07,052
<i>The one now moving towards Earth
is unprecedented.</i>

1338
01:20:14,293 --> 01:20:16,261
Housekeeper.

1339
01:20:20,099 --> 01:20:21,500
Housekeeper.

1340
01:20:31,144 --> 01:20:32,778
It's 12:30.

1341
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,014
Housekeeper.

1342
01:20:38,284 --> 01:20:40,685
Housekeeper.

1343
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:43,721
Sir, checkout time is 12:30.

1344
01:20:43,723 --> 01:20:45,790
It's 12:30 now?

1345
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:47,792
Yes.

1346
01:20:47,794 --> 01:20:49,694
Am I dead?

1347
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:52,630
Get out of here. Because
the police is on its way.

1348
01:20:52,632 --> 01:20:54,899
I told you,
you couldn't do it.

1349
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:20,590
Hey, excuse me.

1350
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:22,325
Excuse me.

1351
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:25,161
You forgot something.
This is yours.

1352
01:21:25,163 --> 01:21:27,731
What's that? This is yours.
You left this.

1353
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,467
Oh, yeah. I was...

1354
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:35,638
I was writing down
some notes last night.

1355
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:40,110
It's for a project.

1356
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:42,545
Internet was down,
so I had to...

1357
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:44,180
Mmm-hmm.

1358
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:52,522
Do you know why they never
give people late checkouts?

1359
01:21:52,524 --> 01:21:54,858
Rules are rules.
Applies to everybody.

1360
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,426
Even for adroit
filmmakers like yourself.

1361
01:22:01,865 --> 01:22:02,965
Got it.

1362
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:07,536
Is everything okay?

1363
01:22:08,805 --> 01:22:11,173
Yeah, everything...
Everything is fine.

1364
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,778
Things are horrible.

1365
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:24,119
Do you need a hug?

1366
01:22:25,588 --> 01:22:27,122
Do you want a hug?

1367
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:32,795
Okay.

1368
01:22:50,078 --> 01:22:52,480
Do you wanna come
to Shreveport with me?

1369
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:57,819
How long are you going for?
