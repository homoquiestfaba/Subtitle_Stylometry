2
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,532
Action.

3
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,301
Okay, great.
Now maybe above your head?

4
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,603
Yeah, perfect.

5
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,636
Great.

6
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,245
Okay, all right.

7
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,389
Are we done yet?
Can I get back to work now?

8
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,515
Just a couple more.

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,825
Maybe one
where you don't look so...

10
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,284
Constipated?

11
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:51,685
Nauseated?

12
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,255
Try smiling with your eyes.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,657
Yeah, Zach,
smile with your eyes.

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,690
Make 'em twinkle.

15
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,727
Okay, that's enough.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,129
I think I'm done.

17
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,864
Come on, Zach, it's Christmas,
it's for charity.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,099
You love helping kids.

19
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,101
All the other guys did it.

20
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:08,178
You're going to be on the cover.

21
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,604
I don't want to be on the cover.

22
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,439
Let Rey be on the cover.

23
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:12,706
Really?

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,875
How many calendars you think
Rey's going to sell?

25
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,312
That's a good point.

26
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,515
Let's go!

27
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,650
Let's go, let's go!

28
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,720
Come on, move it!

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,728
If you want to
go over the pictures,

30
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,731
or grab a coffee sometime
or anything, call me.

31
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,765
Great, thanks.

32
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,139
Seriously?

33
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,209
What's with you and the women?

34
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,310
It's the uniform.

35
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,711
I'm wearing the same one.

36
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,680
Yeah, but you're married.

37
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,382
Come on, man.

38
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,617
They don't know that.

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,650
That's true.

40
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,339
Feline dilated cardiomyopathy

41
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,741
and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

42
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,212
are both common in many species.

43
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:28,949
Your pussycat patient
may present with...

44
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,418
Miss White?

45
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,553
Can you tell us
some of the symptoms

46
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,955
a cat with cardiomyopathy
might present with?

47
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,460
Miss White?

48
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,662
Feline heart disease.

49
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,663
Can you tell us
some of the symptoms...

50
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,907
a low-pitched cough,
breathing difficulties,

51
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:44,798
noticeable weight loss or gain,

52
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,834
reduced mobility,
swelling in the abdomen.

53
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,402
Thank you, I...

54
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,513
Heart disease typically causes
the heart to enlarge,

55
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,705
and this enlargement causes
the loss of efficiency...

56
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,874
Very good, miss White.

57
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,610
You may go back to sleep.

58
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,549
You need some balance
in your life.

59
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,951
I mean, you're
clearly exhausted.

60
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,386
All you do is work and study.

61
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,288
You need to relax,
have some fun.

62
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,622
It's Christmas.

63
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,291
Go get a Mani/Pedi,

64
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,760
watch television, go to a movie.

65
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,364
I haven't been
to a movie in years.

66
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,565
Exactly my point.

67
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,933
I just joined this dating site

68
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,335
called "Just Dessert".

69
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:22,470
You should sign up.

70
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,272
I don't have time to date.

71
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,273
After I graduate,
I'll figure out...

72
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,907
you fill out a questionnaire,

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,909
they put a group of potential
soulmates together,

74
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,019
and you meet
at a catered party for dessert.

75
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,755
I mean, even if you don't
make a love connection,

76
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,614
at least you get cake.

77
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,815
Have you met anyone yet?

78
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,486
No, and I've gained,
like, six pounds.

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,721
I'm 79 years old,

80
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,423
and I'm going to die fat,
old and alone.

81
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,991
Please, you are not fat,

82
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,794
and you need to stop
counting your age in dog years.

83
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,363
I'll see you Monday.

84
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,364
Yeah.

85
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,398
Bye.

86
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,635
Alright...

87
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,404
Okay.

88
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,839
Okay.

89
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,289
Increased thirst,

90
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,958
frequent urination, vomiting.

91
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,293
Poor coat appearance,

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,395
depression, shock, trauma.

93
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,396
That's it.

94
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,664
That's exactly

95
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,399
how I feel today.

96
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,776
You are going to be
a very good doctor.

97
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,769
Lucy, I'm sorry,

98
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,472
but you may have
feline kidney failure.

99
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,607
Or too many
margaritas last night?

100
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,921
First holiday party of the year.

101
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,447
She's back.

102
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,487
Marilee, could you please

103
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,589
work some of your magic
on Mrs. Smith?

104
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,891
Sure, I'll take care of her.

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,394
Mrs. Smith!

106
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,062
Oh, Marilee.

107
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,064
Hello, Bootsey.

108
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,867
Bootsey has been
a little anxious lately.

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,469
He wakes up in the night

110
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,137
worried about our visit
to my daughter's house.

111
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,643
My daughter has a very
judgmental cocker spaniel.

112
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,347
Well, the holidays
can be hard on all of us.

113
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:17,451
You've come to the right place.
Huh, Bootsey?

114
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,019
Maybe a new outfit
would help Bootsey

115
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,921
feel more comfortable, huh?

116
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,923
We are having
a Christmas Special

117
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,959
on canine leisure wear.

118
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,678
Hey!

119
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,614
Hey, come on,
leave the cat alone.

120
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,581
Hey...

121
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,649
Leave the cat alone!

122
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,017
Come on!

123
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,051
Hi.

124
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,521
Come here.

125
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,922
Okay...

126
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,424
You're okay.

127
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,894
You're safer now, all right?

128
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,362
Just run home
before it comes back.

129
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,765
There you go.

130
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,131
Hi.

131
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,400
How did you get in here?

132
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,837
Ambrose?

133
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,706
What kind of name is "Ambrose"?

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,610
I work 24-hour shifts,
then I come home and crash.

135
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,479
I don't do commitment.

136
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,184
All right.

137
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,188
All right.

138
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,222
There's the door.

139
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,745
I'm serious.
I'm serious, you have to go.

140
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,797
What are you doing?

141
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,565
I live alone.

142
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,033
I don't even own a plant

143
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,243
because they require
too much care.

144
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,903
I said, you have to go.

145
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,707
Really?

146
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,482
One night, but that is it.

147
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,124
I'll feed you, but that's it.

148
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,892
I've had a long day,

149
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,694
so stay in here
and don't bug me.

150
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,774
Fine, you can come in here,

151
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,876
but stay off my chair.

152
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,509
It's the one place
I absolutely insist...

153
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,786
All right, move over.

154
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,961
One night, that's it,
then you're gone.

155
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,738
Mrs. Winnamucker.

156
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,206
Hello, miss White.

157
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,041
You scared me.

158
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:33,113
Vilma Tuttle thought
she heard a cat this morning.

159
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,314
Have you heard anything?

160
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,949
No.

161
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,152
No, but we're surrounded
by other apartments,

162
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,229
so maybe one of them have...

163
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,221
she distinctly heard it

164
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,091
as though it was coming
from this building.

165
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,030
Well, I'll keep my eyes open.

166
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,067
But I can't imagine anybody
would want to break

167
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,805
the Angel Arms' sacred
no pet policy.

168
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,941
It would mean
immediate eviction.

169
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:01,974
Of course it would.

170
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:18,991
Yes.

171
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,264
Hi, Queenie!

172
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,167
How are you?

173
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,969
How was your day?

174
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,973
Wow, that good, huh?

175
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,008
Well,

176
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:39,747
my day was pretty ordinary.

177
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,215
I fell asleep in school,

178
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,618
I almost got hit
by a fire truck,

179
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:48,789
and then I went to work and
got slobbered on by a bulldog.

180
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,824
Well...

181
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:55,362
All in all, a pretty good
start to the holiday.

182
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,998
I'm going to get going.

183
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,234
I left them right here.

184
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,070
I'll check your equipment.

185
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,271
Have you seen my keys?

186
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,773
No, sorry.

187
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,641
Hi, yeah, this is Zachary Stone
calling again.

188
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,918
I left you a message last night.

189
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,077
I found your cat, Ambrose.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,845
And this number
was on his collar.

191
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,813
Nothing in here.

192
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,749
I'm sorry to hear that.

193
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,885
Yeah, thank you.

194
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,352
Hey, what's up?

195
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,664
Well, I found
this cat yesterday,

196
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,423
and he followed me
into my house.

197
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,901
Turns out his owner's
this elderly woman

198
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,126
who died last week,

199
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,328
and she doesn't have any family.

200
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,797
Do you know anyone
who wants a cat?

201
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,932
Not me, I'm a dog guy.

202
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,300
I don't understand cats.

203
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,368
That's probably because
you've never had one.

204
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,737
Hey, check this out,

205
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,738
there was this dog on you tube.

206
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,372
He got separated from his owner

207
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,108
and walked
over a thousand miles,

208
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,375
using only scent to find him.

209
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,177
A thousand miles?

210
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,013
How bad did the guy smell?

211
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,981
All right, maybe I got
the actual distance wrong,

212
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,082
but that's not the point.

213
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,184
The point is, dogs are loyal,

214
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,285
I get that.

215
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,320
Cats,

216
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,022
they're mysterious.

217
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,232
Not once you get to know them.

218
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,759
Actually, cats are
very intuitive.

219
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,103
They feel earthquakes
before they happen,

220
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,161
they smell smoke

221
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,096
long before the fire alarm.

222
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,097
They save lives.

223
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,198
Great.

224
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,166
You want to take him?

225
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,467
Harriet's allergic.

226
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,170
Hey, how does the gorgeous
dental hygienist feel

227
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,138
about cats?

228
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,172
Melinda?

229
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,109
I'm not seeing her anymore.

230
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,077
Yeah, he's dating Blair now.

231
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,078
She's a model.

232
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,213
Of course she is.

233
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,991
You know, it's like
this magical revolving door

234
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,051
of beautiful women.

235
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,019
And seriously, I don't know
what they see in you.

236
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,055
Women like the challenge.

237
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,125
He tells them he's not
interested in a commitment,

238
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,937
and they think they're the one
that's going to change him.

239
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,296
Zach, she's a model.

240
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,431
Come on, would it really be
that hard

241
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,933
waking up next to her
every morning?

242
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,902
She does not want to
get married,

243
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,803
and neither do I.

244
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,804
One of these days,

245
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:44,914
you're gonna
meet the right girl,

246
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,107
settle down, get married.

247
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,041
It'll never happen.

248
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,277
You don't believe in
happily ever after?

249
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,012
I believe in happy right now.

250
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,484
Ever after never works.

251
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,920
Keep the model,
don't keep the model,

252
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,421
but the cat stays.

253
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,108
No.

254
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,542
Off the bed.

255
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,177
I'm serious.

256
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,488
Sorry, man, I've got to
draw the line somewhere.

257
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,210
No? No good?

258
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,112
Not-not good.

259
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,114
I'm new at this.

260
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,415
What kind of cat do you have?

261
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,218
Well, he's sort of orange-ish

262
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,552
with stripes.

263
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,522
That's a very rare breed.

264
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,925
You should take
extra special care of him.

265
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,993
He's not mine.

266
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,060
It's a temporary thing.

267
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,395
I rescued him from this dog,

268
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,898
and he sort of
attached himself to me, and...

269
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,332
His name is Ambrose.

270
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,278
Cats have very good
intuition about people.

271
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,412
You should take it
as a compliment

272
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,305
he wants to live with you.

273
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,916
Well, he doesn't really have
much of a choice.

274
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,208
His owner died,

275
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,177
so he's stuck with me
until I find him a new home.

276
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,013
I volunteer at the shelter,

277
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,148
and cats rarely make it
out of there, so...

278
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,382
You're a hero.

279
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,253
I mean, obviously,
you're a hero,

280
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,022
with the...

281
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,557
You're a double hero.

282
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,497
The cheap dry food
can be hard on their kidneys,

283
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,966
and if you have a male cat,

284
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,343
they have a tendency
towards prostate problems.

285
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,601
I'd go with this dry food,

286
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,037
and alternate it
with the canned.

287
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,683
Well, I gave him milk,
and he wouldn't drink it.

288
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,309
Yeah, no, milk's
not good for them.

289
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,378
They can't process
the sugars in it.

290
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,214
It gives them horrible diarrhea.

291
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,085
Are you a vet or something?

292
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,619
Almost.

293
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,288
I have another year
of school left.

294
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,959
Right now, I work at
Bosley's pet supply.

295
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,426
I know the family who owns it.

296
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,527
Eggshell, right?

297
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,564
You're painting?

298
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,969
I only ask

299
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,446
because I just finished
my living room.

300
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,371
I painted it pearl.

301
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,440
I couldn't decide
between eggshell, ecru,

302
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,242
or butter cream.

303
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,577
It's stupid, sorry.

304
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,112
No, no, not at all.

305
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,347
I have six shades of white
on my wall,

306
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,315
and I can't decide
which one to use.

307
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,550
Is your house
more traditional or modern?

308
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,186
Definitely more traditional.

309
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,720
I'd go with more...

310
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,157
Creamier, yellowish tones,

311
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,458
those whites, they're warmer.

312
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,060
Like your eyes...

313
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,094
For...

314
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,064
...instance.

315
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,734
Y-You having a party?

316
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,403
No.

317
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,537
Why?

318
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,671
Just...

319
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,345
Right.

320
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,648
That... is going to last me

321
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,250
a really long time.

322
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,487
Good luck with the cat.

323
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,574
Pathetic.

324
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,350
Hey.

325
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,651
You're the guy!

326
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,287
You're the guy
who saved my life!

327
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,590
I'm gonna have to
come around here

328
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,292
and give you a bear hug.

329
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,593
That's...

330
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,727
Yeah, that's not necessary.

331
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,596
This guy,

332
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,740
this guy climbed
through my kitchen window

333
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,733
and saved my life

334
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,302
when my oven exploded.

335
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,403
Just doing my job, ma'am.

336
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,710
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

337
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,512
That's what counts.

338
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,059
Forget it.

339
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,660
I don't have time to date,

340
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,329
and even if I did,

341
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,330
guys like Mr. Brown Eyes

342
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,467
don't date girls
that talk about cat diarrhea.

343
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,602
What was I thinking?

344
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,324
Thank you.

345
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,425
No problem.

346
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,792
Yeah.

347
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,461
Well, I just...

348
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,163
Yeah.

349
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,233
Merry Christmas.

350
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,113
See?

351
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,182
I'm watching T.V.

352
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,184
I do have balance in my life.

353
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,154
...She has a mate,
a companion...

354
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,422
Hey...

355
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,193
You're missing the best part.

356
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,595
These are your
ancestors, Queenie.

357
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,233
Are you looking for a new house?

358
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,547
Christmas is
a great time to buy.

359
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,375
Hey, Jaclyn!

360
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,442
I'm watching you
on T.V.

361
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,278
Take my hand
and I'll walk you through it...

362
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,482
Jackie, just a sec.

363
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,559
I thought you were my landlord.

364
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,396
Hi.

365
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,506
You forgot about
your birthday dinner.

366
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,733
I didn't forget,
you're early, right?

367
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,868
I'm always early.

368
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,548
I have to show a house
on the way to dinner,

369
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,742
and Kyle is double parked,
so let's go.

370
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,677
Wait.

371
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,616
You stay here
and watch the house,

372
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,418
I'll be right back.

373
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,486
I'll grab my jacket.

374
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,955
I wish I could
take you home with me,

375
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,490
but my four dogs
would eat you alive.

376
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,658
Four?

377
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,768
I thought you and Kyle
had three dogs.

378
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,694
We took in another one.

379
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,763
You sound like mom.

380
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,565
I know.

381
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,834
Let's go.

382
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,372
Which ones seem creamier
or yellowish to you?

383
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,511
Yeah, I agree.

384
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,347
None of them are right.

385
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,355
Don't get too comfortable.

386
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,689
I'm still looking for
a new home for you.

387
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,297
Blair,

388
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,731
that's some kind of dress.

389
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,333
I'm glad you like it.

390
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,601
It's Gucci.

391
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,513
I wore it for an editorial
in vogue,

392
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,474
and they let me keep it...

393
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,477
At least they didn't
say anything when I took it.

394
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,378
What was the ad for?

395
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,812
Toothpaste...

396
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:13,946
I think.

397
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,750
Well, you look amazing in it.

398
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,419
Well, amazing is what
I was going for,

399
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,521
so mission accomplished.

400
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,797
It doesn't look like
you've made much progress.

401
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,401
Well, I haven't had
a lot of time to work on it.

402
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,369
Here, help me pick a color.

403
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,737
They're white.

404
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,507
No, that's the eggshell,
that's ecru,

405
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,841
that one's butter cream...

406
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,676
they're all white.

407
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,747
What's that?

408
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,317
You got a cat?

409
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,552
You didn't tell me
you got a cat.

410
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,585
Well, he kind of got me.

411
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,589
I rescued him from a dog,

412
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,858
and now he's
stuck to me like glue.

413
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,362
I've been looking for
a family to adopt him.

414
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,463
Good.

415
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,397
Just put it on craigslist
or pet finder.

416
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,765
Get rid of it.

417
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,769
I'm kind of surprised
you don't like cats.

418
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,738
I thought you'd be
more of an animal lover

419
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,806
since your father owns
a pet supply store.

420
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,676
A cat's a nuisance.

421
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,811
You have to clean up
after it, feed it.

422
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:19,646
What if you wanted to
go to Italy for Christmas

423
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,547
on a whim?

424
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,724
You're going to
have to find somebody

425
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,750
to look after it.

426
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,752
It's like having a kid,
only worse,

427
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,820
because it never
grows up and moves away.

428
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,088
He's only here

429
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,790
until I find him
a new home anyway.

430
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,594
That's why I like you so much.

431
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,363
Good times, no strings.

432
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,998
Now, please go get dressed.

433
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,401
I made us reservations
at Mangiamo.

434
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,703
Oh, fancy.

435
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,081
I want you to meet my friends.

436
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,542
I just know you'll love them.

437
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,685
Buonasera!

438
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,520
And happy holidays.

439
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,589
I saw you on the TV
again last night.

440
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,490
Hello, Ellio.

441
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,600
Happy holidays to you, too.

442
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:05,592
Hi, Ellio.

443
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,126
May I take your...

444
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,961
Puffy coat?

445
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,564
Oh, yeah.

446
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,538
Right this way, please.

447
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,807
For you, we have reserved
a beautiful table.

448
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,714
So, for your birthday gift,

449
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,157
I'm taking you on Sunday
for a day of pampering.

450
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,384
Oh, Sunday?

451
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,985
I can't.

452
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,721
Monday's my anatomy final.

453
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,064
It's the last final
of the semester.

454
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,624
It's worth 60% of my grade.

455
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:38,791
So I gotta...

456
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,427
so bring your books.

457
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,861
You never do anything
for yourself.

458
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:42,862
We're going,

459
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,531
end of story.

460
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,665
Now catch us up.

461
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,534
Everything's really good.

462
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,803
Yes, school's great.

463
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,138
Work's great.

464
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,673
I can't believe

465
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,543
I'm going to be
calling you "Dr. White" soon.

466
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,480
Mom and dad would be so proud.

467
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,516
Are you getting out at all?

468
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,551
Have you met someone?

469
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,554
No, I really,
I don't really have time.

470
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,088
After I graduate and...

471
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,157
Marilee still has
this silly rule.

472
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,559
No love life till she graduates

473
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:13,860
and starts her practice.

474
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,795
It's not a silly rule.

475
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,864
I just want to finish
what I started.

476
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,832
I can't afford
any distractions right now.

477
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,637
No.

478
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,639
Kyle has this friend, Brad.

479
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,840
He's a dentist.

480
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,976
He's really handsome.

481
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:30,943
You don't have to marry him,

482
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,111
but just go on one date

483
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,613
and see what happens.

484
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,481
Do you remember what happened

485
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:35,691
the last time you set me up
on a date

486
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:36,683
with one of Kyle's friends?

487
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,184
That was not our fault.

488
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,762
How were we supposed
to know he was married?

489
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:40,953
He wasn't wearing a ring.

490
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,021
You ask.

491
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:45,124
Well, Brad is not married.

492
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,702
He's never even had
a serious girlfriend.

493
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,227
Why?

494
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,562
What's wrong with him?

495
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,897
Nothing.

496
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,231
We could double date.

497
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,535
We just want you to be
as happy as we are.

498
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,038
I'm calling Brad
tomorrow morning.

499
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:02,609
Actually,

500
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,943
I'm seeing someone.

501
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,177
What?

502
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,647
He's a-he's a firefighter.

503
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,549
Yeah, he saved the life

504
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,183
of this woman
who works in my market.

505
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,820
Her...

506
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,122
Her oven exploded.

507
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,089
It was...

508
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:20,960
it was just...

509
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:21,861
Why didn't you tell us?

510
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,163
Because of this.

511
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,933
You guys get so excited.

512
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,067
I didn't...

513
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,202
We just started dating, okay?

514
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,172
I don't even know
if it's going to work out.

515
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,173
It's great news.

516
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,107
We have to meet him.

517
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,208
No!

518
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,510
Yeah.

519
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:38,244
Not yet. Not yet.

520
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,145
When?

521
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,880
Soon.

522
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,282
He's just, he's...

523
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,286
he's really busy, you know,
with fires and stuff.

524
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,989
Tell us everything,
leave nothing out,

525
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,658
speak slowly.

526
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,693
Ellio, we need more champagne!

527
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,272
Craig's in the stock market

528
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,698
and he made a bundle last year.

529
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,742
I manage a private hedge fund.

530
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,234
Blair tells us you're a fireman.

531
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,771
Must be a lot of fun.

532
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,775
Yeah, it's a blast.

533
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,076
I admire you.

534
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,811
I want you to know that.

535
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,245
Thank you.

536
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,715
Zachary buys
and restores homes, too.

537
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,683
He's in real estate.

538
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,085
How exciting.

539
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,588
A man of hidden talents.

540
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,223
Yeah, I'm not at all
what I seem.

541
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,758
You know what,

542
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,693
Kyle and I are invited to
this big Christmas party

543
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,227
on December 23rd

544
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,262
at the mayor's house.

545
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,998
Yeah, it's a fundraiser

546
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,666
for the children's hospital,
and...

547
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,134
We just happen to have
four tickets.

548
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,038
You two will come with us.

549
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,148
That's more than two weeks away.

550
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,283
I don't even know if we're still
going to be dating.

551
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,242
I mean, it's so early in our...

552
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,275
what's his name?

553
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,080
His name?

554
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,114
Is...

555
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,986
I call him...

556
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,222
"Brown Eyes".

557
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,202
Just a silly little nickname
that we have for each other,

558
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,094
and...

559
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:06,899
He calls me...

560
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,335
"Marilee".

561
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,084
Hi.

562
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,154
Hi.

563
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,288
The...

564
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,289
From the grocery store.

565
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,858
Yeah.

566
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,194
How's Ambrose?

567
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,729
You remembered his name?

568
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,197
Of course.

569
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,866
Have you found him a home yet?

570
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,169
No. No, not yet.

571
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,304
Who are you hiding from?

572
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,674
I'm not hiding.

573
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,242
I'm just getting
some fresh air.

574
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,054
Now, what does it say
about the people we're with

575
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,313
if we have to escape them
to catch our breath?

576
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,151
You love them too much?

577
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,386
Or too little.

578
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,792
I'm here with my little sister
and her husband.

579
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,427
I love them a lot, but she's
a little overprotective.

580
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,664
I'm here with a date
and her friends.

581
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:12,899
You have a girlfriend?

582
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,302
Well, "girlfriend" implies
a possible future.

583
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:20,673
She's someone I'm dating.

584
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,143
I don't really believe in

585
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,247
the whole happily-ever-after,
fairy-tale ending thing.

586
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,083
Well, I believe in true love.

587
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,785
Are you married?

588
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,121
No. No, I'm focused on
my education right now.

589
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:40,727
I'll think about dating
after I graduate and get a job.

590
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,204
Well, what if you meet him
before then?

591
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,197
You can't find
what you're not looking for.

592
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,366
That's true.

593
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,102
You know what I just learned?

594
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,440
Mountain lions actually take
a leap of faith in love.

595
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,407
They do?

596
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,976
Yeah.

597
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,145
When a male finds a female
that he's attracted to,

598
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,081
he jumps in front of her,
stopping her in her tracks,

599
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,817
and then he climbs
to the highest peak he can find,

600
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,787
and starts howling,
and professing his love for her.

601
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:13,125
Yeah. If she joins him
at the top of the mountain,

602
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,362
they'll be together for life.

603
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,766
It's... very romantic.

604
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,433
How do they know who to choose?

605
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,203
Instinct.

606
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,205
What if I don't trust instinct?

607
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,375
What if I need a guarantee?

608
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,011
I don't think love has
any guarantees.

609
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,380
I think you just
have to have faith,

610
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,749
and believe it'll last.

611
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,153
Well, I should probably
get back to my date

612
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,197
and her pretentious friends.

613
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,090
Yeah.

614
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,224
Wish me luck.

615
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,527
Good luck.

616
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,263
Bye, Brown Eyes.

617
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,034
I just said that out loud,
didn't I?

618
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,435
You kind of did.

619
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,310
Could I be any more embarrassed?

620
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,963
I saw Brown Eyes today.

621
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,531
Yeah.

622
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,567
We talked for a long time.

623
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,204
Don't look at me like that.

624
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:35,875
I'm not even interested.

625
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,210
Even if I was,
he has a girlfriend,

626
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,947
or rather somebody
that he's dating.

627
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,049
He doesn't believe in love.

628
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,585
No.

629
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,022
It's just you and me.

630
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:56,829
And that's all I need
for Christmas.

631
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:59,131
Yeah.

632
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,453
Hey, Blair.

633
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,922
Good morning.

634
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:23,923
Did I wake you?

635
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,158
No, I slept in.

636
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,060
My shift doesn't start
till this afternoon.

637
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,630
Is that the cat I hear?

638
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,583
You're not letting it
sleep in your bed, are you?

639
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,469
Absolutely not.

640
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,570
Sometimes.

641
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:39,939
Yes.

642
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:43,209
Zachary, that is just too much.

643
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,176
You know what, tomorrow,
we're going to take it

644
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,079
to my father's pet supply store
to find someone to adopt it.

645
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,881
It's either that,
or it goes to the shelter.

646
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,084
He's pretty easy
to take care of.

647
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,619
I pretty much just feed him.

648
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,355
What if we want to go
to mount Everest on a whim?

649
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,624
Or go skydiving, or parasailing?

650
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,667
Who are we going to find
to watch it?

651
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,626
You want to do those things?

652
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,229
No.

653
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,497
I don't have a death wish.

654
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,935
I'm just saying,
do we really want to be tied down?

655
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,370
I told my sister
and brother-in-law

656
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,472
that I would bring him
to a holiday Christmas party

657
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,942
on the 23rd
so they could meet him.

658
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,176
That's not a problem.

659
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,179
We have two weeks
to find you a date

660
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,647
who has Brown Eyes.

661
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,459
I'll make you a profile
on "Just Dessert".

662
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,384
No, I could never do that.

663
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,419
Do you want to get
your sister off your back?

664
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,689
Then sign up,
go to a "Just Dessert" gathering,

665
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,559
find a date for your sister's party,
then shut down the profile.

666
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,294
I don't know.

667
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,329
Do you want to die
old, alone, in a housecoat,

668
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,363
surrounded by cats, and dogs,
and shattered dreams?

669
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,502
I'm sorry,
it's what my mother says to me.

670
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,038
Anyway.

671
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,173
Name, Marilee White.

672
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,110
Age...

673
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,011
26.

674
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,145
I'm 29.

675
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,113
Same thing.

676
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,281
Work?

677
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:59,151
Student and pet supply store employee.

678
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:00,219
Veterinarian,

679
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,589
loves animals, red wine,

680
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,024
and long walks on the beach.

681
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,658
I like white wine.

682
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,627
What are you looking for
in a man?

683
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:15,534
A nice guy who likes animals,
and understands

684
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,736
that I just want a date
to a party.

685
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,707
Looking for a professional man

686
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,644
who loves animals,
is handsome,

687
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,346
athletic,

688
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,215
sexy...

689
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,249
And has Brown Eyes.

690
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,417
Don't write that.

691
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,121
What did you just do?

692
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,388
You'll thank me

693
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,000
when you're happily married
to a sexy lawyer,

694
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,911
and you have three children,
and a house full of animals.

695
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,334
What?

696
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,602
You already have
three happy cupcakes.

697
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,749
That means that there are
three guys that want to meet you.

698
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,575
You have to go
to the next party.

699
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,278
It's a holiday mixer this Friday
at a member's house.

700
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,113
I'll text you the address.

701
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,147
Promise me you'll go.

702
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,185
Promise!

703
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,219
Fine.

704
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,323
Morning.

705
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,458
Hey.

706
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,726
Hey, I'm glad to see
you're still around.

707
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,062
Yeah, not for much longer.

708
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,472
I'm taking him to get
adopted tomorrow.

709
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,564
That's a shame.

710
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:19,798
It is, actually.

711
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,633
I really kind of
like the little guy.

712
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,369
Why don't you
just keep him, then?

713
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,437
Well, Blair
isn't too fond of him.

714
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,140
Blair, huh?

715
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,541
Well, you do
what you want, but me?

716
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,278
I don't trust a woman
who doesn't like cats.

717
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,250
Just put him in
the back of the truck.

718
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,119
No, I would never do that.

719
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,054
He can ride
in the front with us.

720
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,722
But you have to
hold him, please.

721
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,291
Hold him?

722
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,592
Me?

723
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,295
Yeah, make sure he's safe.

724
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,097
He's not really used to
the cat carrier.

725
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm beginning to think

726
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,643
you don't want to
get rid of that cat.

727
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,270
He deserves
a better owner than me.

728
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,344
Someone who's around more
and can hang out with him.

729
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,543
My father will find him
a new home.

730
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,178
I'm really glad
we're doing this.

731
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,788
Look what the cat dragged in
for you on your birthday.

732
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:17,822
The Blair Witch Project.

733
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,859
Oh, man, what is she doing here?

734
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,861
She never comes here.

735
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,865
Maybe she needs to be declawed.

736
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,335
You work here, right?

737
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,536
Yes, Blair,

738
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,403
I've worked here
for three years.

739
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,738
You think my name is Lynn.

740
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,173
I remember.

741
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,108
You have to help me
get rid of this cat.

742
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,143
Find him a home.

743
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,678
What a sweet cat. Hi.

744
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,746
Ambrose?

745
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,414
You know its name?

746
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:48,187
It says it right here
on his collar.

747
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,297
It belongs to my boyfriend.

748
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,721
We have to
get rid of it right away.

749
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,226
You take it.

750
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,295
Actually, if you do,

751
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,405
I'll have my father give you

752
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,864
all the cat food
and kitty litter

753
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,232
you'll ever need.

754
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,203
- Hi, daddy!
- Hi, sweetie.

755
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,737
Sorry, are you following me?

756
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,241
Actually...

757
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,878
I work here, so...

758
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,281
Technically,
you're following me.

759
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,782
So, how's school?

760
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:20,319
It... it's finals now, so...

761
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,487
Just really busy studying.

762
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,756
It's all settled.

763
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,592
Lynn is going to take the cat.

764
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,594
I'm sorry, I can't.

765
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,363
My apartment building
doesn't take cats.

766
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:33,699
Fine, we'll give it
to a shelter.

767
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,733
No!

768
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,637
Did you see that?

769
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,272
It has to go.
It's dangerous.

770
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,374
He was just playing.

771
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,276
He wasn't trying
to hurt you, Blair.

772
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,945
You call that vicious swipe
it took at me "playful"?

773
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,316
It wasn't a vicious swipe,
it was a playful gesture.

774
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,618
Excuse me?

775
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,961
What do you think you are,
a cat whisperer?

776
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,787
Cats are like people.

777
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,556
They can sense
when they're not wanted.

778
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,260
We're leaving.

779
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,230
Daddy!

780
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,532
Well, I guess we're leaving.

781
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,200
Sorry, I didn't
realize she was so...

782
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:09,268
Psychotic?

783
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,302
Sensitive.

784
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,336
She'll be all right.

785
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:16,708
Let's go!

786
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,176
Right, well.

787
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,546
Yeah.

788
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,947
Thank you.

789
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,216
By the way, my name is Zachary

790
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,460
in case you continue
to stalk me.

791
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:28,387
Well, Marilee,

792
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,457
in case you continue
to stalk me.

793
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,395
Come on, bud, let's go.

794
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,770
That woman is such a...

795
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,338
Marilee?

796
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:49,741
Can you come to the office?

797
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:51,919
Called into the boss' office?

798
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,579
You think he knows
it's your birthday?

799
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,582
Well, I got a raise last year
on my birthday, so...

800
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,602
Feliz cumpleanos!

801
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:20,972
What's wrong?

802
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,777
I just...

803
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,979
I just got fired.

804
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,015
What?

805
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,048
Why?

806
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:38,790
Blair told her father
that I was rude to her.

807
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,961
But she's obnoxious.

808
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,994
Everyone's rude to her.

809
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,666
Well, I think
he's scared of her.

810
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:52,638
What does Zachary see in her?

811
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,071
Hey, leave a message.

812
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,006
Hi, Sarah.

813
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,576
Sorry, I'm not going to
be able to make it

814
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,645
to the mixer tonight.

815
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,449
I'll see you in class.

816
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:45,524
I read that petting a cat
lowers your cholesterol.

817
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,594
You know, it's crazy,

818
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,671
but I actually think
that I sleep better

819
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:50,729
when he's in the house.

820
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,799
No adoption?

821
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,702
No, not yet,

822
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,705
but Blair's still determined
to get rid of him.

823
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,140
You know, you're going
to have to choose

824
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,442
between her and that cat.

825
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,476
Well, I say,

826
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,811
keep the cat

827
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,112
and give Blair my number.

828
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,382
So we are going to
take him on calls with us?

829
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,583
We can't be seen with a cat.

830
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,885
I like having a firehouse cat.

831
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:14,959
Every firehouse has a dog.

832
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,688
Ambrose makes us unique.

833
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:17,889
Yeah.

834
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,958
All right, you're the chief.

835
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,428
So...

836
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,431
What are you going to do?

837
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,438
Hi.

838
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,481
I was in here the other day,

839
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,305
and I'm looking for the woman

840
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,707
who was working
with you that day.

841
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,808
Marilee.

842
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,076
Yeah, Marilee, is she here?

843
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,645
No, she no longer works here.

844
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,646
She was fired.

845
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,147
What? Why?

846
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,849
Your girlfriend, Blair,

847
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,717
made a complaint to her father.

848
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,094
I'm sure he didn't
want to fire Marilee,

849
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,454
because she's our best employee,

850
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,590
but his daughter is
a very beautiful,

851
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,125
but horrible, superficial,

852
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,202
nightmare of a human being.

853
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,528
Yeah, I get it.

854
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,464
She's putting herself
through school.

855
00:39:58,497 --> 00:39:59,598
She needed this job.

856
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,033
I'm so sorry to hear that.

857
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,173
Do you have her phone number
or home address?

858
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,708
Why?

859
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,042
You want to burn down her house?

860
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,646
What? No.

861
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,082
I would like to apologize.

862
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,863
Look, I had no idea
that Blair got her fired.

863
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,054
If I had,

864
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,856
I promise you,
I would have stopped her.

865
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,095
Please, I feel awful about this.

866
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,666
White.
Her last name is White,

867
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,602
and that is all
I'm going to tell you.

868
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:38,904
Any progress?

869
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,205
No.

870
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,908
She's not on Facebook,
or LinkedIn, or anything.

871
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,577
And I can't believe
Blair had her fired.

872
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,812
That is cold.

873
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,247
You know, maybe I don't want her
to have my number after all.

874
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,728
You barely told us
anything about this woman.

875
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,887
What's she like?

876
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,122
Well...

877
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,557
She's wicked smart.

878
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,558
Probably gets straight "a" s.

879
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,627
Yeah, but more importantly...

880
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,761
What does she look like?

881
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,797
What?
What, I'm curious.

882
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,067
She's really pretty.

883
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
But she doesn't know it.

884
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,580
That's the best kind of pretty.

885
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,573
Is she nice?

886
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:15,874
Unbelievably.

887
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,084
She's got a really big heart,
she's sweet,

888
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,044
she loves cats.

889
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,147
Wicked smart, beautiful
but not full of herself,

890
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,750
heart of gold, and sweet.

891
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,184
What are you saying?

892
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,055
Sounds like a special person.

893
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,957
She is...

894
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,193
Guys, could you finish

895
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,095
that equipment inventory?

896
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,064
Right after I beat Mark

897
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,899
for a record
fifth straight game.

898
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,200
How about now?

899
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,637
Now would be good.

900
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,710
Don't be looking
at my cards either.

901
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,150
So, Marilee?

902
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,887
She doesn't want to date

903
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,990
until she finishes school
and starts her career.

904
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,958
Besides,
she's not the kind of girl

905
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,060
I usually go out with anyway.

906
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,597
She believes in
true love and marriage.

907
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,164
You know,

908
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,734
just because your parents
couldn't make it work out,

909
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,968
doesn't mean you can't.

910
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,704
No, thank you.

911
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,105
And yet,

912
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:24,309
you're here searching
for this very smart, pretty,

913
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,677
nice girl.

914
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,679
Yeah, just to apologize.

915
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,180
Right.

916
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,752
Don't you want to have
a family someday?

917
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,788
Someone you can share
the holidays with?

918
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,590
You and the guys are my family.

919
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,201
Hey, you can't snuggle up
with me and the guys

920
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,593
on a cold night

921
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:42,994
after a long day's work.

922
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,129
So that's a firm no?

923
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,870
Okay, so here's the thing,

924
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,280
looks like we're going to
be stuck with each other

925
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,073
for a little while.

926
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,808
You can stay here
until I sell the house,

927
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,077
but then you're on your own.

928
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,283
New rules,

929
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,185
we come and go as we please.

930
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,262
You're not responsible for me,

931
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,888
I'm not responsible for you.

932
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:45,957
We're just a couple of bachelors
living together.

933
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,927
Good talk.

934
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,829
Let's go watch the game.

935
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,004
Hey... what are
you doing here?

936
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,114
I thought you had
a commercial shoot?

937
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,273
It got postponed.

938
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,775
Surprise!

939
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,110
I made dinner.

940
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,983
Where's Ambrose?

941
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:13,127
I don't know.
I thought he was with you.

942
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,120
No,

943
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,156
and he always greets me
when I come home.

944
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,859
I'm sure
he's around here somewhere.

945
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,428
Ambrose, where are you?

946
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:24,796
Just forget about the cat.

947
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,931
Go get in the shower,

948
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,799
I'm going to
put dinner on the table.

949
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,401
Ambrose? Ambrose!

950
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,806
I wonder if he got out somehow.

951
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,007
I'm going to go find him.

952
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,175
Why?

953
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:41,112
No, he'll be fine.

954
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,093
You really don't get it, do you?

955
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,754
What?

956
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,798
Did you really have that woman
who works at your father's store

957
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,023
fired?

958
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:53,892
Yes, she was horrible.

959
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:54,926
She talked back to me.

960
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,961
She was a total...

961
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:56,995
so you had her fired?

962
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:00,165
You can't do that, Blair.

963
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,133
You can't just have
somebody fired

964
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,401
because you don't like them.

965
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,038
Look...

966
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,140
Everything's okay.

967
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:11,009
She doesn't matter

968
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,443
and the cat is gone.

969
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:16,047
Everything's back to normal.

970
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:20,518
This isn't working.

971
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,387
What?

972
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,455
You and me.

973
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,125
You're kidding me, right?

974
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,860
No.

975
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,829
You're breaking up with me?

976
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,731
That's the way it looks.

977
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,968
I'm a professional model,
and you're breaking up with me?

978
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:42,941
I wasted my entire night
cooking for you.

979
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:44,042
I got my hair done.

980
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,944
These are expensive highlights.

981
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:49,080
I know you didn't cook, Blair.

982
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,457
You left the packages
from Mario's,

983
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,183
they're still in the trash,

984
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,852
right where I can see them.

985
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,453
I also know you didn't cook,

986
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,988
because I just bought
that stove,

987
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:58,824
and it's not connected yet.

988
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:00,892
Trust me,

989
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:03,194
I'm the best thing
that's ever happened to you,

990
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,508
and you're going to regret this.

991
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,165
You're going to call,

992
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,034
and you're going to beg
for me to come back.

993
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,302
Guess what?

994
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:12,871
I won't.

995
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,219
Ambrose? Ambrose!

996
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:30,488
Ambrose, where are you, buddy?

997
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,423
Ambrose!

998
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,059
I can't remember the last time

999
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:36,962
I got a Mani/Pedi.

1000
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,163
That's just the beginning.

1001
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,473
You need to take time
to pamper yourself.

1002
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,233
All you do is volunteer
and work and study.

1003
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:43,902
I should be studying right now.

1004
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,179
No, you need to go
with your little sister

1005
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:46,537
to get your hair and makeup done

1006
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:47,915
and then go shopping
for a new dress.

1007
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,040
That was our deal.

1008
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:49,975
I don't know,
I've already been gone...

1009
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,210
Marilee... stop.

1010
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,080
Breathe. Okay?

1011
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,248
Enjoy the holiday season.

1012
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,451
Better?

1013
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,619
Better.

1014
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,121
Good.

1015
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,555
You deserve this.

1016
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:05,590
Come on.

1017
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:06,824
I deserve this.

1018
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,332
Are you almost done in there?

1019
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,001
Just about.

1020
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,110
This dress is beautiful.

1021
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,078
No, you're beautiful,

1022
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:29,547
and Brown Eyes is going to faint
when he sees you.

1023
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,016
No, no, I can't afford this.

1024
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,050
Not a problem.

1025
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:32,984
I sold three houses this month,

1026
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:34,886
and I want to take
care of you for once.

1027
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,287
It's too much.

1028
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:39,624
Marilee, when mom and dad died,

1029
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,035
you came home
and put your life on hold

1030
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,093
to take care of me.

1031
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,661
You have done

1032
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,197
so much for me,

1033
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:47,999
and the dress is nothing.

1034
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:59,344
You look like mom.

1035
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,546
I do?

1036
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,182
Yeah, you really do.

1037
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:06,684
Pinky swear?

1038
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:13,324
I love you.

1039
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,631
Why are we stopping here?

1040
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,576
You don't think I'm taking
you home looking like this.

1041
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,945
You're going to go in there
and make Brown Eyes faint.

1042
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,303
No, I...

1043
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,371
I'll go in with you.

1044
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,481
I want to meet this guy anyway.

1045
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,316
No! I have to study
for my anatomy final tomorrow.

1046
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,708
I have to go home now.

1047
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,244
If you don't go in there
and show him how you look,

1048
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:34,279
I'm going to drag you in.

1049
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,981
Wait!

1050
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,116
I'll go in. I'll go in.

1051
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:39,217
Good.

1052
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,618
He's going to be so surprised.

1053
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,552
You have no idea.

1054
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:42,988
I want to...

1055
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,301
I need to go in there by myself.

1056
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:46,491
Because...

1057
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:47,458
He's going to want to...

1058
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:49,627
Grab me

1059
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,962
and kiss me all over,

1060
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,563
and it would be awkward

1061
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,432
if you were standing there.

1062
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:56,734
You'll meet him
at the Christmas party.

1063
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,403
Okay, fine.

1064
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,504
Go. I'll wait
for you here.

1065
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,505
No, you just...

1066
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,440
You go home.

1067
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,342
Yeah.
He-he'll give me a ride.

1068
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,111
He's...

1069
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:08,379
Getting off shift right now.

1070
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,314
Are you sure?

1071
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,349
Yes. Yup.

1072
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,351
Have fun.

1073
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,685
Thank you for today.

1074
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:15,620
You're welcome.

1075
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:16,721
Bye.

1076
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,256
Here I go.

1077
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,459
See ya.

1078
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:32,537
Okay...

1079
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,486
Ambrose?

1080
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:52,790
Ambrose...

1081
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:55,626
What are you doing out here?

1082
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,029
Are you lost?

1083
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,664
Oh, babe...

1084
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Okay.

1085
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:15,780
Hi...

1086
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,182
I'm looking for

1087
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,549
the owner of this cat?

1088
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:21,719
He's mine!

1089
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,121
Actually,

1090
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,794
I think he belongs to
a guy named Zachary.

1091
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,125
Zach!

1092
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:28,693
Someone is here to see you.

1093
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:34,432
Okay.

1094
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,301
Hey, it's you.

1095
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,335
And Ambrose.

1096
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,437
I found him wandering outside.

1097
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,306
I thought he might be lost.

1098
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,340
Hey, buddy...

1099
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,408
Yeah.

1100
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:44,409
I've been looking for you guys,

1101
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:45,576
and here you are together.

1102
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,113
You were looking for me?

1103
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,114
Why?

1104
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:50,615
Yeah.

1105
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:51,816
I wanted to apologize.

1106
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,584
I'm so sorry about your job.

1107
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,186
It's my fault
that you got fired.

1108
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,687
You don't have to...

1109
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,256
It's not you,

1110
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,690
it was your girlfriend.

1111
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,292
She's...

1112
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,693
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

1113
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:03,727
That's great.

1114
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,564
I mean, in a...

1115
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,467
In a sad way.

1116
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,535
Well,

1117
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,503
you've got Ambrose
back now, so...

1118
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:13,538
Yeah.

1119
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:20,845
You know, actually,

1120
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,580
I'm getting off work soon.

1121
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,183
Can I give you a ride,
or buy you dinner?

1122
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,617
You don't have to do that.

1123
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:27,652
I'm fine. I can...

1124
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:28,786
I can walk home.

1125
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,421
Let me buy you dinner.

1126
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:31,656
It's the least I can do.

1127
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,458
It's the least he can do.

1128
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:39,197
Well, that's nice of you,

1129
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,332
but only if I can take you
to my favorite place.

1130
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,400
Yeah.

1131
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,834
Should I go home and change?

1132
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:46,337
I know the owner pretty well.

1133
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,051
I think I can get you in
dressed like that.

1134
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,575
What about Ambrose?

1135
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,277
He's used to being here.

1136
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,445
He's the firehouse cat.

1137
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:56,214
He's our mascot.

1138
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:57,682
We're determined to be unique.

1139
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,784
We like having him around.

1140
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,588
Okay.

1141
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,624
Okay, we've got two beef tacos,

1142
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:10,628
one burrito,
and one chicken taco.

1143
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,267
So, this is your favorite place?

1144
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,502
Yes,

1145
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,605
it's like a surprise party
in your mouth,

1146
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,340
and he's open all night.

1147
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:25,710
If I'm studying late,
I usually end up here.

1148
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,911
I'm game.

1149
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,685
You're right, that was amazing.

1150
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,322
I know, right?

1151
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,758
Are you cold?

1152
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,693
No, no, I'm fine.

1153
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:44,395
I'll be right back.

1154
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,699
When I was in college,

1155
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:52,303
my parents died
in a car accident,

1156
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,804
so I went back home

1157
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,673
to take care of my little sister

1158
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:58,643
until she graduated
from high school.

1159
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,686
When she went off to college,

1160
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,412
I went back to get my degree

1161
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:04,715
and started veterinary school.

1162
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:05,983
Why a vet?

1163
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,287
My parents were
huge animal lovers.

1164
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,824
I guess it rubbed off
on me and my sister.

1165
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,793
My mom would take in

1166
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:19,330
every stray she could find.

1167
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,904
When I was seven,

1168
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,906
I was walking home from school,

1169
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,243
and there was this baby bird
in the middle of the road.

1170
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:34,612
He had fallen out of his nest.

1171
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,347
So I picked him up,
I took him home,

1172
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:37,501
I nursed him back to health,

1173
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:44,722
I was there
for his first flight.

1174
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:45,832
God, I totally
forgot about that,

1175
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,258
but you're right.

1176
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,528
That was when I knew
I wanted to be a vet.

1177
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,597
How about you?

1178
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,532
What made you want to be
a firefighter?

1179
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:55,765
What was your defining moment?

1180
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,936
Well, when I was about 14,

1181
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,805
our house caught on fire,

1182
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,807
and I was trapped
in the bedroom,

1183
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,809
terrified,

1184
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,345
until this amazing firefighter

1185
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:08,879
crashed through
my bedroom window

1186
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,981
and saved my life.

1187
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:14,952
That was the moment you decided
you wanted to be a firefighter?

1188
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,454
Well, it was
the moment I decided

1189
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,289
I didn't want
to be angry anymore.

1190
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:21,426
My parents fought all the time...

1191
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,528
they're divorced now...

1192
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,896
and it made me
a pretty angry kid.

1193
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,532
That was the moment I decided

1194
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,900
I wanted to do something
that would make a difference,

1195
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:33,971
so I started focusing on
helping people,

1196
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,374
the way I was helped.

1197
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,908
That's powerful.

1198
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,911
What were your parents like?

1199
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,616
My parents...

1200
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,785
Loved each other so much.

1201
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,820
When my mom
walked into the room,

1202
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:50,921
my dad would just...

1203
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:54,359
Light up.

1204
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:57,862
They met each other
in high school,

1205
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,764
and that was it.

1206
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,600
He stopped her in her tracks

1207
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,993
and she joined him
on the mountain.

1208
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:05,869
Exactly.

1209
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:15,045
This has been really nice,
but I...

1210
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,615
I have an anatomy final
in the morning.

1211
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,717
I should probably go.

1212
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,851
Yeah.

1213
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,753
No problem.

1214
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,355
I'll take you home.

1215
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,599
Thank you for dinner.

1216
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:37,668
Thank you for
accepting my apology.

1217
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:43,474
Well, good night.

1218
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:44,642
Good night,

1219
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:48,546
and good luck on the final.

1220
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,881
Thank you.

1221
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:07,998
That test was so hard.

1222
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,667
I'm sure you did fine.

1223
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,436
At least it was the last one.

1224
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,409
Hi.

1225
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:21,479
How did the test go?

1226
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:24,048
I think I did pretty well.

1227
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,516
Great.

1228
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,785
Can I take you out to coffee
to celebrate?

1229
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,520
That's Brown Eyes?

1230
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:30,521
Okay...

1231
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,056
- Hi.
- Hi.

1232
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:35,460
You know what, dinner-
dinner was enough...

1233
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:36,694
you went to dinner with him?

1234
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,597
Let him take you for coffee.

1235
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,631
Yeah.

1236
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,166
Besides, you still have my coat,

1237
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,734
and, you know,

1238
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:44,935
I kind of need that back.

1239
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,004
Right.

1240
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,573
Go.

1241
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,441
Have fun.

1242
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,479
I love that coffee shop.

1243
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:55,846
I've never been there before.

1244
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,615
Yeah, well,
firemen and policemen

1245
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,059
always know where
the best coffee is.

1246
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,551
Oh, no...

1247
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,753
What is it?

1248
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,422
She found Queenie.

1249
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,665
I knew you were
hiding something.

1250
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:15,876
The plumber came in
to check on the sink,

1251
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,603
and guess what he found?

1252
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,872
Where is she?

1253
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:22,906
I put her in the back.

1254
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,108
Queenie? Sweetie?

1255
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,579
Hey, sweetie.

1256
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,481
Are you okay?

1257
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,618
Were you scared?

1258
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,261
This is a clear violation
of Angel Arms' bylaws.

1259
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,221
It's a class-two infraction,

1260
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:40,190
which is clearly spelled out...

1261
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,892
I assume you gave this tenant

1262
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,227
48-hours' notice

1263
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,805
before a service person
entered the residence.

1264
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:47,765
Well, I'm not sure if...

1265
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,133
what about fire codes?

1266
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,769
Are you up to date
on the 456 city fire codes

1267
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:52,913
pertaining to
apartment buildings,

1268
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,071
and the mandatory bylaws

1269
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,115
stipulated in the state statutes?

1270
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,140
I...

1271
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,174
I'll be back next week

1272
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,175
to make sure
you're in compliance

1273
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,745
with each and every
state and city fire code.

1274
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,547
I hope I won't have to write you

1275
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,749
a 777,

1276
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,222
or shut down
your apartment building.

1277
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,208
Thank you so much.
I can't thank you enough.

1278
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,735
It's not a problem.

1279
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:29,707
Thank you.

1280
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,177
Sorry that I couldn't
keep her from evicting you.

1281
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,880
But I'll make her life
as miserable as I can

1282
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:38,082
for a while.

1283
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:41,552
Well, I guess I could
stay at my sister's house.

1284
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:45,089
I don't know how Queenie will
survive her dogs, though.

1285
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:47,824
I have an idea.

1286
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:49,960
Oh, yeah?

1287
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,168
This house is amazing.

1288
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:01,005
Yeah, it will be

1289
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,807
once I get it painted.

1290
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
Come on.

1291
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,217
The house is great.

1292
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,587
I love the crown molding

1293
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:18,889
and the hardwood floors.

1294
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:22,059
The staircase is beautiful.

1295
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,828
Thank you.

1296
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,062
I built it.

1297
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,364
Really?

1298
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,833
Yeah.

1299
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:32,369
Come on, I'll give you
the two-cent tour.

1300
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,639
There's an apartment upstairs
with a separate entrance.

1301
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,373
It's not much,
but you're welcome to it

1302
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,908
until you find a place.

1303
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,145
Thank you.

1304
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:43,881
But I couldn't do that.

1305
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,382
I couldn't impose.

1306
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,617
No, please, I insist,

1307
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:47,811
I'm the reason you got fired.

1308
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,254
Do you allow cats?

1309
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,889
Allow them?

1310
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,924
We require them.

1311
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,160
You can't stay here unless
you have at least one cat.

1312
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,729
I'm going to pay rent.

1313
00:59:58,763 --> 00:59:59,830
That's not necessary.

1314
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:02,933
But you could, you know,

1315
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,277
help out around the house
if you want.

1316
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,170
Maybe take care of Ambrose

1317
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,872
when I don't take him into work.

1318
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,641
I think he likes her.

1319
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,778
Yeah, Queenie is usually so shy,

1320
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,680
but I think she likes him, too.

1321
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:23,788
I guess it could work,
us living together.

1322
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,365
Well, not living together,
but sleeping together...

1323
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,124
not sleeping together...

1324
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,159
but, you know, under...

1325
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:32,229
Under the-the same roof.

1326
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,263
You know what I mean.

1327
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,732
Yeah, I do.

1328
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,767
I'm going to
stay out of your way.

1329
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,078
You won't even know
that I'm here.

1330
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,713
I should have a new job
and somewhere to live

1331
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:40,671
by the end of the week.

1332
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:43,307
No hurry.

1333
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,875
We should
get your stuff, though.

1334
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,343
I have to go to work soon.

1335
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,616
You just make yourself at home.

1336
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,225
It's perfect.

1337
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,429
It's a layer of eggshell
over ecru.

1338
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,198
It's really
the only way to get pearl.

1339
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:10,234
It's the exact shade of white
that I wanted

1340
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,836
but couldn't find.

1341
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,904
How did you do all this?

1342
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:16,841
School's on Christmas break,

1343
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:19,744
and I don't have a job.

1344
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:21,145
It's the least I could do

1345
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,113
for you rescuing Queenie and me.

1346
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:24,214
Thank you.

1347
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:25,783
It looks really great.

1348
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,484
I'm used to having
so much to do.

1349
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,987
I'm not very good at
doing nothing.

1350
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,856
Well, I appreciate it.

1351
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,524
Look at those two.

1352
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,138
They haven't left
each other's side

1353
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,897
since they met.

1354
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,465
I'm glad
they're getting along so well.

1355
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:43,801
There's chicken
and potatoes on the stove

1356
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:44,735
if you're hungry.

1357
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:45,803
It smells great.

1358
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:46,470
Where did you get it from?

1359
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,905
I cooked.

1360
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:49,082
I hope you don't mind,
I connected the stove.

1361
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:51,075
You...

1362
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,109
Really?

1363
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,744
Yeah.

1364
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:55,445
That's...
That's...

1365
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,148
Well, I'll see you later.

1366
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,853
It was pretty quiet
at the station,

1367
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:04,088
so I'm not tired...

1368
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:07,491
If you wanted to stay
and eat with me.

1369
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:08,793
Us.

1370
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,529
Thanks, I already ate, but...

1371
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,364
Okay.

1372
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:19,804
Bye.

1373
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:28,278
Don't look at me like that.

1374
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,472
It's not my fault they left.
I asked them both to stay.

1375
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:35,019
Oh, sure, blame me.

1376
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:41,358
Of course, we shouldn't have
stayed for dinner.

1377
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,393
He was only offering to be nice.

1378
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,930
He probably has a girl
coming over later.

1379
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:46,963
Yeah.

1380
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:54,038
What are you up to there?

1381
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,505
Curbside value.

1382
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,977
When you're trying
to sell a house,

1383
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,947
Christmas spirit
can go a long way.

1384
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,448
Well, thank you.

1385
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,482
Yeah.

1386
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,484
My sister's in real estate.

1387
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,429
She says the more homey
you can make a house feel,

1388
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,888
the better.

1389
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:11,922
Have a good day.

1390
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:12,923
You too.

1391
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:14,091
Yeah.

1392
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:21,598
I actually have an appointment

1393
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,167
to look at some tile.

1394
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,069
You wouldn't want to go,
would you?

1395
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:27,071
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess I could.

1396
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:28,906
All right.

1397
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,875
There's this other thing
I have to do first.

1398
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,342
It's sort of important.

1399
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:33,543
What's that?

1400
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,012
I have to give a speech

1401
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,446
to a group of
fascinating people.

1402
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,481
You might like it.

1403
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,249
Should I dress up?

1404
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,419
I think I can get you in
dressed like that.

1405
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,194
Did you guys know

1406
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:51,304
that the leading cause
of Christmas tree fires

1407
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,262
is from dry trees?

1408
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:53,864
So remember,

1409
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:55,408
get your parents
to give your tree a drink

1410
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,466
every night

1411
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,577
to keep it from drying out.

1412
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,169
All right?
You guys got that?

1413
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:00,971
Got it!

1414
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,372
Alright.

1415
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,106
Who in their right mind

1416
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,607
barbecues a turkey
in the fireplace?

1417
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:40,010
The holidays make
people do crazy things.

1418
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:41,011
Yeah, I was saying
the same thing to Marilee

1419
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,646
after my talk at the school.

1420
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,148
Wait, what,
you took her with you?

1421
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,149
She's living with him now.

1422
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:46,150
He's falling in love.

1423
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,217
That's not true.

1424
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:48,485
Sorry.

1425
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,455
He's falling in love,
but doesn't know it yet.

1426
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,691
Tell me that's not true, Zach.

1427
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,993
You're my idol.

1428
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,194
Playing the field,

1429
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,262
no commitment,

1430
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,663
no responsibility.

1431
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:00,965
Don't worry, nothing's changed.

1432
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,166
I'm not in love

1433
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,599
and I'm still
never getting married.

1434
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,436
Really?

1435
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,939
Can you say no
to these three things?

1436
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:11,241
You live with her?
Yes.

1437
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,210
You spend all your
free time with her? Yes.

1438
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,345
You think about her
when you're not with her?

1439
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:16,446
No! No.

1440
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,348
I don't live with her.

1441
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:20,560
She's only staying with me
till she finds her a new place,

1442
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,586
and I only spend time with her
because she's there.

1443
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,366
You are five minutes
from marrying this girl.

1444
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,324
Okay, so wait, wait, wait,

1445
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,093
so, what are you saying,

1446
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,327
he's human after all.

1447
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,296
Come on, Zach,

1448
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:33,697
say it ain't so.

1449
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,134
This girl is a temporary
roommate, nothing else.

1450
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,602
Right.

1451
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:47,311
Hey, why don't we
hit the stores tomorrow,

1452
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:48,612
and we don't stop

1453
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,290
until we've found
all our Christmas presents?

1454
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,249
Sure.

1455
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,426
It'll be way more fun
if we do it together,

1456
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,021
and then we can get
a Christmas tree.

1457
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:04,504
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

1458
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,396
What?

1459
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,298
Look at those two.

1460
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:12,002
They make it look easy.

1461
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:12,902
My mother used to say

1462
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,347
falling in love
with the right person

1463
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,240
is easy.

1464
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:19,443
I've never felt that.

1465
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,046
Yeah, me neither,

1466
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,249
but it doesn't mean
it's not true.

1467
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:31,621
I haven't had
a Christmas tree in a while.

1468
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,223
Really, why?

1469
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:34,491
Well, I buy houses,

1470
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:35,792
I fix them up and I sell them.

1471
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,170
I never usually
stay in one long enough

1472
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,762
to care about the holidays.

1473
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,031
I can't imagine
Christmas without one.

1474
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:43,367
It's my favorite part about it.

1475
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,136
So how do you choose which one?

1476
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:49,473
Well, that is pretty scientific.

1477
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:50,807
Okay.

1478
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,179
First, you've got to check
to make sure it's fresh.

1479
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,347
Then you've got to inhale deeply

1480
01:06:57,381 --> 01:07:00,150
to see if the scent
is Christmassy.

1481
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,553
That's not a word.

1482
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:04,654
Yes, it is.

1483
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,156
"Christmassy"
is definitely a word.

1484
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,524
It's an adjective.

1485
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,794
It means to be filled
with Christmas spirit.

1486
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:13,230
Okay, I see.

1487
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,532
Then you're going to
give it the lean test.

1488
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:16,642
You're going to look
straight on at your tree

1489
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,202
to make sure that it's even,

1490
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:21,671
then you've got to
lean to the right...

1491
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:25,175
Then you've got to
lean to the left...

1492
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,212
And then back straight,

1493
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,746
and if it's all good,

1494
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,116
you've found your one.

1495
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:33,350
That is very scientific.

1496
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,486
Yes.

1497
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,621
There it is.

1498
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,090
There's the one.

1499
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:41,691
The one?

1500
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:42,726
There's only one?

1501
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:43,860
How do you know?

1502
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,028
And what if you're wrong?

1503
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,339
What if you commit to it
and realize it's not the one,

1504
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,363
then you...

1505
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:51,568
Yeah, that's a good tree.

1506
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,207
When I was a little girl,

1507
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:59,743
there was always
one Christmas present

1508
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,145
under the tree

1509
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,147
that was unaccounted for.

1510
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,848
My parents said
they didn't buy it,

1511
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:08,352
so that's how
my sister and I knew

1512
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,187
it was from Santa.

1513
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,721
It was always
my favorite present.

1514
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,625
What are your favorite
Christmas traditions?

1515
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,595
I usually end up
working Christmas Eve

1516
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:19,863
and Christmas Day.

1517
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:22,332
The guys with families
really want the time off,

1518
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:25,302
so I end up being the guy
who holds down the fort.

1519
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:26,770
That must be hard.

1520
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:29,406
It's no big deal.

1521
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,408
What do you do for Christmas?

1522
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,444
This year, on Christmas,

1523
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,614
I'm volunteering
at a big pet-rescue adoption

1524
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,217
the shelter is putting on
in the park.

1525
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,770
Then I'll go
to my sister's for dinner.

1526
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,188
You know, I really
want to thank you again

1527
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,861
for all the work you did
around the house.

1528
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,759
I may be able to sell it
sooner than I thought.

1529
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,396
That's great.

1530
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:54,498
You didn't just fix up

1531
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,700
another house this time.

1532
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,435
You built a real home

1533
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,570
for a real family.

1534
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,179
Nothing's happening.

1535
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:10,914
We're just roommates.

1536
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,816
But you're both single
and you like each other.

1537
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:14,684
It's not like that.

1538
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:15,952
He's not even looking

1539
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,722
for a serious relationship.

1540
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,557
He dates models,

1541
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,292
and I am...

1542
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:25,195
I don't have time to date
because I'm busy.

1543
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,730
But you live together

1544
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,441
and you spend all
of your free time together.

1545
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,800
It's not like that.

1546
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:31,735
That's crazy.

1547
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,637
I mean, you're perfect together.

1548
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,605
You enjoy each other's company,

1549
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:37,241
you get along great,

1550
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,376
and your cats are best friends.

1551
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:41,345
I mean, how many more clues
do you need?

1552
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,913
I'm not going down that road.

1553
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:45,515
Okay, I'm not going to
fall for somebody

1554
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,751
who's clearly not interested
in a serious relationship.

1555
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:49,453
You can't decide

1556
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:51,888
not to fall in love
with someone.

1557
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,990
It just happens.

1558
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,759
Do you want to know

1559
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,760
how he feels about you?

1560
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:57,833
You know, test the waters?

1561
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,899
Use this.

1562
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,000
What is that?

1563
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:04,901
Mistletoe.

1564
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,503
That's not mistletoe.

1565
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,771
It's a metaphor.

1566
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,506
Go get some mistletoe,

1567
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,375
put it in the house.

1568
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:12,509
If he stands underneath it,

1569
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,877
gives you a kiss on the cheek,

1570
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,979
then he just
wants to be friends.

1571
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,382
But if he kisses you
on the lips,

1572
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:19,583
then he really likes you.

1573
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,319
That...

1574
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:25,255
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

1575
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,724
I would never do that,
not in a million years.

1576
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,698
It's nothing.

1577
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,766
I'm just decorating.

1578
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:38,967
Don't judge me.

1579
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,397
Hey!

1580
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,365
Welcome home.

1581
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

1582
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,834
How was your day?

1583
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,001
Good. Great. Great...

1584
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,037
How-how was yours?

1585
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,439
Great.

1586
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,341
Good.

1587
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:23,813
Well...

1588
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,949
I'll see you later.

1589
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:29,985
You're leaving?

1590
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:32,556
Yeah.

1591
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,589
Why?

1592
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:38,428
I just...

1593
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,497
I just thought
maybe you could help me...

1594
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,998
Grout the kitchen sink.

1595
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:46,002
Sure.

1596
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,337
Yeah, I could do that.

1597
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,377
Get it down, get it down.

1598
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,024
Sorry.

1599
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,693
I didn't have a choice.

1600
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,827
What?

1601
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:14,330
Mistletoe.

1602
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:20,737
Yeah.

1603
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,139
No...

1604
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,508
This cannot be happening.

1605
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,509
This is...

1606
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:26,576
This is not happening,

1607
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,577
not to me.

1608
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:28,612
Calm down.

1609
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:30,079
It's not such a bad thing.

1610
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:31,815
Answer me this.

1611
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,451
There's a fourth step

1612
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:35,528
before you fall off the cliff.

1613
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:36,553
I thought you said

1614
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:37,521
there were only three.

1615
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,489
It varies.

1616
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,858
Has she asked you
to meet her family yet?

1617
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:44,160
No. Not yet.

1618
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,029
Well, there's that, then.

1619
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,431
Yeah,

1620
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:48,498
but have you kissed her?

1621
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,834
No.

1622
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:51,867
Yes.

1623
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,415
But it was only
because of mistletoe, okay?

1624
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:56,540
I didn't have a choice.

1625
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:57,841
He's toast.

1626
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:08,852
You didn't come home

1627
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,454
till really late last night.

1628
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:12,556
Was everything okay at work?

1629
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:13,823
Yeah, I do that sometimes,

1630
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,459
just kind of go with the flow,

1631
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,994
blow wherever the wind takes me.

1632
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:20,697
So I guess things
are permanent now.

1633
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,965
You have a family.

1634
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,633
What?

1635
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:24,710
Wait a minute, what do you mean?

1636
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,636
You and Ambrose.

1637
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,880
You're not looking for
a home for him anymore.

1638
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,738
He's your family.

1639
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,173
Yeah.

1640
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,206
I guess so.

1641
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:38,848
Are you okay?

1642
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:39,883
Is something wrong?

1643
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,150
No.

1644
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:42,586
Yeah, I'm fine.

1645
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:43,920
I'm good.

1646
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:49,493
There's this thing
I have to do tonight.

1647
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:51,127
Yeah? What's that?

1648
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,361
It's nothing, really.

1649
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:57,767
It's just a party my sister
and her husband invited me to.

1650
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:00,937
I can bring someone if I want.

1651
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,573
You want me to meet your family?

1652
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,578
I just thought it would be
something fun thing to do.

1653
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,155
You'd really like my sister
and brother-in-law.

1654
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,781
They're great.

1655
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:13,483
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1656
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,852
Yeah, I mean, of course.

1657
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:16,986
I mean, it's...

1658
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:17,921
It's totally last minute
and everything.

1659
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,557
No, it's just that
I have this work thing

1660
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,691
that I have to do.

1661
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:24,093
I would like to,
but I just can't.

1662
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,996
I thought you were off tonight.

1663
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,533
I was, but it got changed.

1664
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:30,566
So...

1665
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,038
Man, it's later than I thought.

1666
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,973
I actually have to get to work.

1667
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,875
I'll see you when I get back,

1668
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,009
if you're here,

1669
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:41,545
otherwise I'll see you
when I see you.

1670
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:43,680
Okay.

1671
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:44,953
Are you sure everything's okay?

1672
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,151
Yeah, everything's fine.

1673
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,253
Bye.

1674
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,888
Hi!

1675
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:26,756
Hi.

1676
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,225
You made it.

1677
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:30,927
Hi. How are you?

1678
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,895
You look great.

1679
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,196
Yeah, thanks.

1680
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,998
So, where is he?

1681
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,867
I'm sorry, he couldn't make it.

1682
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:38,902
He had a work thing.

1683
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,038
That's too bad.

1684
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,306
I'm sorry.

1685
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,975
They're clients.

1686
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:47,052
Will you excuse us one second?

1687
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:50,013
Yeah, yeah.

1688
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:50,914
You sure?

1689
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:51,848
Okay.

1690
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,818
I'll just...

1691
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:23,579
I'm sorry.

1692
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,173
- Hey.
- Hey.

1693
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:52,876
I was just writing you a note.

1694
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:55,244
I thought I'd be gone
before you got home.

1695
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,646
Gone?

1696
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,647
How was work?

1697
01:16:57,681 --> 01:16:59,883
It was fine.

1698
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:00,950
Where are you going?

1699
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:04,120
I finally got a job

1700
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:06,956
and found a place
that takes cats.

1701
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:11,761
Thank you so much for letting
Queenie and me stay here.

1702
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:12,762
It was really kind of you.

1703
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:14,831
Yeah. Y-You don't have to go.
You can stay.

1704
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:17,734
I really appreciate everything.

1705
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:19,836
I hope you have
a wonderful Christmas.

1706
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,808
But what about Ambrose?

1707
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:28,311
He's going to miss you guys.

1708
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:29,679
He is?

1709
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:31,047
Yeah.

1710
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,181
Yeah, he has a...

1711
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:33,695
He has a real connection
with Queenie.

1712
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:36,444
Well, maybe I can
bring her by sometime.

1713
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:39,355
That would be great.

1714
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,323
You should definitely do that.

1715
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,158
I'll call you,

1716
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,393
set something up
in the new year.

1717
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:51,801
In the new year?

1718
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:05,081
Hey, buddy.

1719
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:08,284
Hey...

1720
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:20,463
Why are you so sad?

1721
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:26,135
This is what we wanted, right?

1722
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:30,907
Yeah, maybe not.

1723
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,275
She just moved out,

1724
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,409
found a new place to live.

1725
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,453
It's probably for the best.

1726
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:36,045
I don't want to lead her on.

1727
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,114
No, you wouldn't
want to do that.

1728
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,082
I mean, it's not like
I was in love with her

1729
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:40,316
I liked her.

1730
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:41,493
I mean, who wouldn't?
She's wonderful.

1731
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:44,754
Zachary, what are you
so afraid of?

1732
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:46,089
Nothing.

1733
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,826
Harriet and I have been
married for 26 years,

1734
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:51,494
and I don't regret
one day of it.

1735
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:55,064
She and the kids
give my life meaning.

1736
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:56,332
I know,

1737
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,201
and that's a great life for you.

1738
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,536
It's just not for me.

1739
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,938
Because you're different?

1740
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,072
Exactly.

1741
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,174
What about Ambrose?

1742
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,776
Do you care about him,

1743
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:07,987
or have you just gotten used to
him being around?

1744
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:09,212
That's different.

1745
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,446
He's a great cat,

1746
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,948
and he needs me.

1747
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:13,749
But you don't need anyone?

1748
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:17,954
No.

1749
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:20,489
Remember when you were a kid,

1750
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:22,334
and I crashed through
your bedroom window that night

1751
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:24,027
and saved you from the fire?

1752
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,829
Yes.

1753
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,539
You decided that day
to become a firefighter,

1754
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,232
right?

1755
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,533
That was years ago,

1756
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:32,535
you still know it was
the right decision.

1757
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,103
That was a defining moment.

1758
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,807
This, right here, right now,

1759
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:40,844
this is another defining moment.

1760
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:41,954
If you care about that girl,

1761
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:44,113
you need to go find her
and tell her how you feel.

1762
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:46,182
That's great, but I just...

1763
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:47,615
I don't know
where to find her, Sam.

1764
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:50,052
Ambrose...

1765
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:56,359
Where... is Marilee?

1766
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:57,560
He's not Lassie.

1767
01:19:57,593 --> 01:19:58,913
He's not going to
lead you to her.

1768
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:02,007
It's Christmas Eve, though,
a time for miracles.

1769
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:03,900
Maybe...

1770
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,369
Maybe she'll walk right through
that door right now

1771
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,005
and tell you she loves you.

1772
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:16,012
It was worth a shot.

1773
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,049
Thanks for coming down
and hanging out with me.

1774
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,551
Hey, no problem.

1775
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,520
Merry Christmas, Zachary.

1776
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,423
Merry Christmas, Sam.

1777
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:38,201
He told me he didn't want
a serious relationship.

1778
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:40,136
Yes, he did.

1779
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,938
And I told him

1780
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,348
I didn't want to date
until after I graduate.

1781
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,640
Yes, you did.

1782
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,443
And then he told me
he was going to work,

1783
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:48,411
but he wasn't going to work,

1784
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:50,413
he was-he was on a date

1785
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,548
with a...

1786
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,052
With a beautiful woman.

1787
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,253
He lied.

1788
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:58,421
Yes, he did.

1789
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:00,189
But he didn't really lie.

1790
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,091
I'm not even dating him.

1791
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,326
He doesn't owe me anything.

1792
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,328
I...

1793
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,629
But we've been over all that.

1794
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:08,397
He told me...

1795
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:13,669
What's with the kiss?

1796
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,138
See, that was my fault.

1797
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:17,073
The mistletoe-kiss test?

1798
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:18,207
Clearly flawed.

1799
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:19,943
Yeah.

1800
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,310
Yeah...

1801
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:27,250
Will you please answer it
this time?

1802
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:28,684
No. No.

1803
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,386
No.

1804
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:32,188
He's clearly interested
in someone else.

1805
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,422
I'll call him in a few weeks,

1806
01:21:33,456 --> 01:21:37,293
you know, when I'm...

1807
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:38,394
Over him.

1808
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:41,230
You're going to get over him?

1809
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,400
Yeah... yeah.

1810
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:45,468
Okay.

1811
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:50,539
Hi, Marilee,
it's Zachary calling again.

1812
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:52,608
I just wanted to say
Merry Christmas,

1813
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:57,246
and, I hope you're having
a great Christmas Eve.

1814
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,615
Just wanted to call

1815
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:02,418
and say that Ambrose and I
miss you and Queenie,

1816
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:04,988
and...

1817
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,223
Give us a call.

1818
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,025
Merry Christmas.

1819
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,654
Santa!

1820
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,724
Merry Christmas!

1821
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:44,593
Merry Christmas!

1822
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:51,400
Well, we blew it, Ambrose.

1823
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,536
We let them get away.

1824
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,404
Okay, I blew it.

1825
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:57,573
This is
the worst Christmas ever.

1826
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:02,445
What do you want me to do?

1827
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,381
If I knew where she was,
I would go get her.

1828
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:17,326
You're a genius, Ambrose.

1829
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:34,777
And this little guy
is very good with kids.

1830
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,101
What are you doing here?

1831
01:23:58,134 --> 01:23:59,668
Ambrose.

1832
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,037
He reminded me that you
volunteer here for Christmas.

1833
01:24:03,272 --> 01:24:04,707
He did?

1834
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,410
I don't understand
why you're here.

1835
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,088
I thought you'd be
with your new girlfriend?

1836
01:24:09,112 --> 01:24:11,280
What new girlfriend?

1837
01:24:11,314 --> 01:24:14,083
The one I saw you with
at the mayor's Christmas party.

1838
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:15,384
What, you were at that party?

1839
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,553
Yeah, that's the party
I invited you to,

1840
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,355
but you had to work.

1841
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,656
And then you were there

1842
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:23,226
with the woman in the red dress.

1843
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,305
I was there to promote
the firefighters' calendar.

1844
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:27,196
It's something we do
every Christmas

1845
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,332
to raise money
for the children's hospital,

1846
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:32,268
and that woman
was the mayor's wife.

1847
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:37,373
Marilee White,

1848
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,275
you are the smartest

1849
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:40,752
and most beautiful woman
I've ever met,

1850
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:44,847
and I love that you know
the right shade of white,

1851
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,849
I love that you know
how to install a stove

1852
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:49,385
and cook dinner,

1853
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,753
that you love animals,

1854
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,356
and I love that you know
how to buy a Christmas tree,

1855
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:55,558
and I love
that you believe in love

1856
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,426
and made me believe.

1857
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,762
I know you want to finish school

1858
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:02,698
and start your practice
before you find love,

1859
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:04,309
but sometimes, it finds you
when you weren't even looking.

1860
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,202
I want to jump in front of you

1861
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:09,172
and stop you in your tracks.

1862
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:12,608
Mountain lions.

1863
01:25:20,316 --> 01:25:22,451
I'm climbing
to the highest peak I can find,

1864
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:24,220
and if you join me,

1865
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:25,921
I know we will be
together forever.

1866
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:38,450
I love you.

1867
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:46,450
