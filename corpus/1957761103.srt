00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,269
- Yes, yes, Claude, you
don't have to worry.

3
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,994
Have I ever let you down before?

4
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,411
The diamonds are safe and
 sound here at my villa.

5
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,760
Take a hike.

6
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,626
We'll meet at the regular place

7
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,386
as soon as the heat cools down.

8
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:26,629

00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:42,472

 priceless diamond necklace,

11
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:46,925
where would I be?

12
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,375
Oh, darn.

16
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:13,952
- Listen to me, Claude,
there's no reason

17
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,471
to get your panties in a twist.

18
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,335
You want your
 diamonds now, fine!

19
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:19,544
I'll grab them and I'll
meet you in an hour!

20
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,273
- You know, you really
 shouldn't get upset, Rico.

21
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:26,447
You know what the doctor said
 about your blood pressure.

22
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,655
- It's this damned Frenchman.

23
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,657
He's driving me crazy!

24
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,522
- I thought you said
 Claude was Belgian.

25
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:34,386
- He can be from Outer
Mongolia for all I care.

26
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,423
I am never doing
business with him again.

27
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:42,222
- You know what, why don't
 you let me help you relax.

28
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,363
- Sandy, you are too good to me.

29
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,606
What did I ever
 do to deserve you?

30
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:49,539
- Oh, I wonder.

31
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,786
- I am tempted,
 but I've gotta go

32
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:56,166
meet the silly Bulgarian.

33
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,859
- Belgian.

34
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,825
- Whatever.

35
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,068
He wants his stuff now, and,

36
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,759
the sooner I'm done
 with him, the better.

37
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,939
- Sure I can't convince
you to take a break?

[bluesy saxophone music]

39
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,157

40
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:22,641
- That's more like it.

41
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,612
- I do gotta go.

42
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,305
- Not until I help
 you calm down.

43
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,307
Doctor's orders.

44
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,759

disobey the doctor.

 just one more time.

49
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,488
- Listen, Sandy, I appreciate
 your enthusiasm, okay?

50
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:17,420
I gotta go.

51
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,111
That crazy Bavarian won't wait.

52
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:19,905
- Belgian.

53
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,390
- Whatever.

54
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,219
- Hands up, Rico.

55
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,151
- What the?

56
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,670
- Did you get the diamonds, Jas?

57
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,188
- Yep, right here.

58
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,121
- Wait.

59
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,711
Where did you have that gun?

60
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,575
- Wouldn't you like to know.

61
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,336
- Well, well, Rico Martinez,

00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,407
biggest jewel thief on
the western hemisphere,

63
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:39,615
and we caught you.

64
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,031
- Wait, Jasmine,
Sandy, you girls

65
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,413
have been with me
 for over a month.

66
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,656
And, Sandy, we were intimate.

67
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,934
You're saying all
 of this is an act.

68
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:53,698
- When we go undercover, we go
 deep, deep, deep undercover.

69
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,597
- Hands up, dirt bag!

70
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,772
- It's okay, Nikki, we got him.

71
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,567
- Where were you
this whole time?

72
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,707
- You told me to blend in.

73
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,329
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

74
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:07,194
Who the hell are you girls?

75
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:11,129
- [Women] We're the
 Teeny Weeny Bikini Squad.

00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,615
[mysterious, tense music]

77
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,311
- Well done, ladies.

78
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:25,315
Rico Martinez has been taken
 into custody by Interpol,

79
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,663
and the insurance
 company who hired us

80
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,942
has deposited a nice fat check

81
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,116
directly into our bank account.

82
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,912
- Glad to be of service.

83
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:36,775
- Of any kind.

84
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,399
- So, does that
 mean we finally get

85
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,366
to take that vacation,
because there's a beach

86
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,369
in San Trope that's
 calling my name.

87
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,475
- We really could use a break.

88
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,684
We've had four cases
 in as many months.

89
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,480
Sometimes you gotta let
the batteries recharge,

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,378
if you know what I mean.

91
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,519
- I do, I do, and I wish
I could help you ladies,

92
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,833
but I just have one
 small little problem.

93
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,354
You have another assignment,
 and it just can't wait.

94
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,357
- Well, what do
 we got this time?

95
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:09,498
- This one is right
 up your alley.

96
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm sure you've all
 heard of Tony Tefflor?

97
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,124
- Tef, the owner of
 Playpen magazine?

98
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:16,643
- That's the one.

99
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,023
- Oh, boy.

100
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:21,164
I sense a lot of
 nudity in our future.

101
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:22,407
- Are you psychic?

102
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,891
- You don't have to
 be psychic to know

103
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:27,516
that Playpen magazine and
 naked girls go hand-in-hand.

104
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,759
Benny, you have a
subscription, don't you?

105
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,211
- Well, yes, but I
only read the articles.

106
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,350
- There's articles?

107
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:38,319
- Anyway, Tef doesn't
 just own the magazine,

108
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,391
he also has his social
club called the Playpen.

109
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,532
- Okay, Benny, let's
 get to the point.

110
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:46,707
- Well, there's been
 a series of accidents

111
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:48,813
at the club and the magazine.

112
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,160
At first, it was just
 some broken equipment,

113
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,128
a near miss or two, but
it quickly escalated

114
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,753
into the accidental death
 of one of the waitresses

115
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:01,653
at the club and a
 model on the shoot.

116
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:05,001
- Why would someone wanna
 kill some of Tef's girls?

117
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,002
- Tefflor thinks
 that someone's trying

118
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,383
to put him out of business,

119
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,178
and, if these accidents keep up,

120
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,594
that's exactly
 what might happen.

121
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,253
In three days, Tefflor
 is going to announce

122
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:18,290
the Playpen Girl of the Century.

123
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,672
If someone were trying to
 drive him out of business,

124
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:25,574
this would be the
 perfect opportunity
 to sabotage the event.

125
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,299
- Sounds like an undercover job.

126
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,749
- Exactly.

127
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:33,754
Jasmine, you will pose,
literally, as a model.

128
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,723
We have arranged an
 appointment for you

129
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:40,105
with Tef's top
 fashion photographer.

130
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:42,556
- Oh, great, another
 aging shutterbug

131
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,420
who can't wait to get his paws

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,146
on my little flashbulbs.

133
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,319
- Not exactly.

134
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,460
Tef's top photographer
 is a young woman

135
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,463
named Laura, and
she's very good.

136
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:56,121
- Wow, attractive, too.

137
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,020
This might not be
 so bad, after all.

138
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,851
- Nikki, you will go
 undercover as a waitress.

139
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:06,856
Your ample assets make you
 perfect for the topless club.

140
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:07,892
- Got it, chief.

141
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:13,242
- And, Sandy, you will
 be a businesswoman.

142
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,659
Your job will be to find
out if there's anyone

143
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,628
who has a financial
 incentive to try to

144
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:22,562
topple Tef's empire from within.

145
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,633
- Are there any
suspects in that arena?

146
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,704
- One, Frank Devlin.

147
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,533
He not only manages the club,

148
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,915
but also Tef's
 production company.

149
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,986
- Production company?

150
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,990
- Adult videos, late
 night stuff, fairly tame,

151
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,201
by today's standards,
 but some, Frank included,

152
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,341
have tried to get Tef to venture

153
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:47,034
into more explicit films,
 but he's always resisted.

154
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,036
- What a classy guy.

155
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,039
- All right, ladies, you
have your assignment.

156
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,697
Next week, Tefflor will announce

157
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:58,425
the Playpen Girl of the Century.

158
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,290
Let's make sure that that
 goes off without a hitch.

159
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,534
- Girls, this would
 normally be when I tell you

160
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:07,054
to pack your bikinis,
 but, in this case,

161
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:09,298
I think you might
 be overdressed.

[camera clicks]

163
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,818
- Great, great, great.

164
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,371
Hold that.

Good, good, come up.

Pick one knee up.

00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:42,400
Love it.

I love it, I love it.

00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,930
All right, I think we're
good in that outfit.

176
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,896
Let's get you in the next,

177
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,036
and then I'll finish this up.

178
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,141

00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,095
- Thanks, you're really sweet.

352
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,857
- Besides, I can tell
 you're no waitress.

353
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,687
- Oh?

354
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:35,622
- Let me guess, you
 wanna be a Playpen model.

355
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:39,902
- Oh, yeah, you got
 me, what gave it away?

356
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,802
- Well, there's a
couple of obvious clues.

357
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,219
- Oh, [chuckles] yeah, well,
 you know, I always wanted

358
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,877
to model for Playpen
 and I thought

359
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,776
that working here
would give me a leg up.

360
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,193
- You'll definitely have
your legs up all right.

361
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,091
- What do you mean?

362
00:19:57,506 --> 00:20:01,027
- Look, Nikki, you seem
 like a really sweet girl.

363
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,891
I know that being a
 Playpen model seems

364
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,410
like a really glamorous thing.

365
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,239
- You bet!

366
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,379
- However, what you
have to do to get there,

367
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:11,175
well, I'm not really
sure that it's worth it.

368
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,280
- What do you mean?

369
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,419
- Tony Tefflor.

370
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:15,214
- Oh.

371
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,666
- You know, I used
 to be a Playpen mode.

372
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,185
- Really?

373
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:24,637
- Actually, I was the first
 Playpen Girl of the Year,

374
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,501
and that's what
 started the tradition

375
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:29,089
of Tef dating the
 girl of the year.

376
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:30,470
- Oh, you're dating Tef?

377
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,990
So is that why you're
 not afraid of Frank?

378
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,995
- Was dating, but, as
 time goes on, he moves on,

379
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,722
and now he's dating
 some 19 year old

380
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:42,724
while I'm stuck here
 schlepping drinks

381
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,622
for all the pigs
here at Playpen.

382
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,797
- But you're still so beautiful!

383
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:49,489
I mean, you could be
 a Playpen girl now.

384
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:52,423
- You're sweet, but
 I don't think so.

385
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:53,631
- No, seriously.

386
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,910
- Really, you think so?
- Yeah, yes!

387
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:03,538
Look at you, that face,
those eyes, those lips.

388
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:11,304
- Yeah, I should
probably lock that door

389
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:15,584
before you get to my
 milky white thighs.

390
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:20,313
[birds tweet]

391
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:27,734
Laura the photographer,
I'm sure of it.

392
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,806
- No, no, no, it's
 Mo the waitress.

393
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:34,327
She hates Tef for
 what he did to her,

394
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:35,639
and who could blame her?

395
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:39,436
He used her up and
 threw her away.

396
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:43,474
It's just like this plot I
 saw on my soap the other day.

397
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:44,993
- He did the same
 thing to Laura,

398
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:48,099
and she's really, really
 bitter about the whole thing.

399
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,275
- Ladies, ladies, please,
 now, if we're gonna

400
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,451
start accusing every
 former centerfold

401
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:57,005
that Tef dated and
dumped, we're gonna have

402
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:59,904
half the models in this
 town on our suspect list.

403
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,734
- Well, maybe they should be.

404
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,391
- Look, Tef dated
 a lot of models,

405
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,324
and none of those
 relationships ended well,

406
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,051
but only Laura and Mo were
 present at the accidents.

407
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:11,122
- That's true, but they
weren't both present

408
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,572
at all of them.

409
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:16,127
Laura was on the film shoots
 and Mo was at the club.

410
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,543
- She's got a point.

411
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,339
- Maybe they're working together

412
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,826
in some sort of
 evil, twisted plot.

413
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,863
- No, but there was one
person who had access

414
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:29,969
to all the places
 accidents happened.

415
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,419
Frank Devlin.

416
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,042
He manages the club, and
he shoots the videos,

417
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,493
and, if his contract
 becomes voided,

418
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:39,530
he can start his own production
company free and clear.

419
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,776
- All right, we have a
 long list of suspects.

420
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,744
There's nothing to do but
 just keep on investigating.

421
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:49,264
- Absolutely, we're headed
 over to the club right now.

422
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:51,024
I think it's time
 we meet Mr. Tefflor

423
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:53,717
and find out what he
has to say for himself.

424
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,995
- I think that's a good idea.

425
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,203
But be careful!

426
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:03,589
- Do you think maybe there
 could be evil twins involved?

427
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,420
You know, you can never
trust those evil twins.

428
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,181
- Yeah, you should know.

429
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,671
[Nikki giggles]

430
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:22,711
- Hello, ladies,
 I'm Tony Tefflor.

431
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,508
Playpen magazine,
 Playpen nightclub,

432
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,234
Playpen Productions, all part

433
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:32,272
of the Playpen
 Incorporated family.

434
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,033
- Mr. Tefflor, we need
 to make this quick

435
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,690
before Frank
 returns to the club.

436
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,450
- I sent him across
 town on an errand.

437
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,522
We have plenty of
 time, and, please,

438
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,144
everybody calls me Tef.

439
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,219
Ah, I see you've noticed
my trademark PJs.

440
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,739
Oh, it's just part of the image.

441
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,949
You know, sexy man
 about town who spends

442
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:56,780
all of his time in
 bed and seldom alone,

443
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,953
if you know what I mean.

444
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,199
Women find it irresistible.

445
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,027
- Really?

446
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,477
- Oh.

447
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:08,239
- Mr. Tefflor, I'm sorry,
 Tef, let me introduce myself.

448
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,275
I'm Sandy Banner.

449
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,621
This is Jasmine St. James.

450
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:11,760
And Nikki Resnik.

451
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,800
- Such beautiful women
 to be private detectives.

452
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,461
Perhaps I have some privates
 you would like to detect.

453
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,669
- We are not that good.

454
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:28,259
Tef, as you know, we've been
 undercover the last few days,

455
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,607
investigating your operations.

456
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,746
- Yes, how's that going?

457
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,437
Oh, I saw your
 pictures, by the way.

458
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:35,128
They're wonderful,
 just wonderful.

459
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
- Aw, thanks, I think.

460
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,723
- So far we have a
 lot of suspects, but
 not a lot of proof.

461
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,521
- Well, when you're as
 fantastically successful,

462
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:53,526
as filthy rich, and incredibly,
incredibly sexy as I am,

463
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,978
you have a lot of enemies.

464
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:58,186
- Sure.

465
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,982
- So who are your suspects.

466
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,639
- Frank the club manager.

467
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:03,847
Laura the photographer.

468
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,021
And your head cocktail
 waitress Maureen.

469
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,475
- Perhaps you've already
heard I used to date

470
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:14,409
both Laura and Maureen.

471
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,237
- Yes.

472
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:18,862
- They may have cause
to hate me, but kill me?

473
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,209
That's preposterous.

474
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,664
But when you're as
 fantastically successful, as-

475
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:30,356
- Filthy rich and
 incredibly, incredibly sexy,

476
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,909
yes, we know.

477
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:34,118
- So you do find me sexy?

478
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:36,155
Of course you do, my dear.

479
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:39,434
- I'm sorry, Mr. Tefflor, can
 we just stick to the case?

480
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,816
- As I said, Sandy, I
 have a lot of enemies.

481
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:45,060
Any one of the people you
 named could have it in for me.

482
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,924
Tomorrow night, I'm
going to have a ceremony

483
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:50,894
to unveil the Playpen
 Girl of the Century.

484
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:53,828
I can't afford any
 more accidents.

485
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,209
Do you understand?

486
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:58,418
- Oh, yes, sir, we
 will do our best.

487
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:02,250
- I hope that's good enough.

488
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,838
- My best is always good enough.

489
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,771
- I'm sure it is.

490
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:10,810
- Tef, you don't by
 any chance happen

491
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,226
to have an evil twin, do you?

492
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,678
- Oh, come on.

493
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,025
- He might be the evil twin.

494
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,098
- Okay, let's get out of here.

495
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:36,802
Frank.
- Sandy.

496
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:37,734
What are you doing here?

497
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,563
Come back to accept my proposal?

498
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:40,909
- Proposal?

499
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,255
- Business proposal.

500
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:43,429
- Oh.

501
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:44,603
- What are you doing, Nikki?
 - Huh?

502
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,812
- Why am I paying you
 six bucks an hour?

503
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,917
I should have you
arrested for loitering.

504
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,264
Get busy, we open for
dinner in half an hour.

505
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,093
- Yes, sir!

506
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,751
- I better get going, as well.

507
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,235
Big day tomorrow.
 - Bye.

508
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,344
- You know these girls?

509
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,725
- Oh, I'm just trying to
 get to know the business.

510
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:06,625
You know, doing my due
 diligence if I'm gonna invest.

511
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,143
- Still thinking about investing

512
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:10,352
in this old broken down company?

513
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:12,354
- Oh, you know, there is
some name value there.

514
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:14,184
Playpen magazine is
known around the world.

515
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:16,427
- Past tense, baby, past tense.

516
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,983
Devlin Productions is gonna
 wipe them off the map,

517
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:24,090
until Tef is just a distant
 memory in some erotic museum.

518
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,851
- Wow, sounds personal.

519
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:28,577
Is there a problem between
 you and Mr. Tefflor?

520
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,304
- Tef got me started
 in this business

521
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:33,444
when nobody else
would, gave me a break.

522
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,412
- Sounds like you owe him.

523
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:38,449
- Yeah, it's that
 damn contract of his.

524
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,658
He thinks that if
 I work for him,

525
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,935
I'm gonna work for
 a lifetime for him.

526
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:42,350
It's not gonna happen, baby.

527
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,179
I'm gonna break
 free, break free now.

528
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,666
[quiet music]

529
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,785
- What the hell's going on here?

530
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:05,166
- Hello, my dear.

531
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,857
- Get out, now.

532
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,757
- I don't think so.

533
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,000
I found this.

534
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,142
I'm well aware of
 who you really are.

535
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:29,638
- So now that you
 know who I really am,

536
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,675
what exactly do you
 plan to do about it?

537
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:32,538
- Not sure yet.

538
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:36,162
If I tell my boss that you've
 been investigating him,

539
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,372
he's probably not gonna
take that too kindly.

540
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,684
- Do you have to tell him?

541
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:46,000
- Well, maybe I could
 be convinced not to.

542
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:49,003
- What exactly do you
want, do you want money,

543
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:50,349
'cause I don't have any.

544
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,593
- I don't want your
 money, I want you.

545
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:56,182
- You mean?

546
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:01,532
[sultry music]

547
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,192
[Jasmine moans]

548
00:29:06,192 --> 00:29:07,435
- Cut, cut!

549
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:08,263
Cut.

550
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,474
- How was that, Mr. Devlin?

551
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,856
- That was awful!

552
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:16,375
That was horrible!

553
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:20,344
People wanna believe that you
 are in love with this guy,

554
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,484
not that this guy is
 here to do your taxes!

555
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,763
- What do you mean?

556
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,729
- What do you mean
 what do I mean?

557
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,904
Look, you have to be sexy.

558
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:31,770
You have to make
 love to the camera.

559
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,359
- Well, I thought I was supposed
to be making love to Burt.

560
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,742
[Frank sighs]

561
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:40,468
- Ah, why no one
 ever thought to put

562
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:43,195
a brain in a beautiful
 head is beyond me.

563
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,197
- That's not very
 nice, Mr. Devlin.

564
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,646
- Shut up, Burt.

565
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:47,475
- Yes, sir.

566
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,375
- Okay, we're gonna
 do this again, okay?

567
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:54,033
We're gonna do this
 again, all right,

568
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,241
from where we left off, and
 you two are on the bed, okay?

569
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,381
This time with passion,
okay, with passion!

570
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,422
- Don't worry, I've done
 a million of these things.

571
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:06,597
Frank yells a lot, but he
 doesn't mean anything by it.

572
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,426
- I hope so.

573
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,601
- We're gonna do this one great.

574
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,740
- Thanks.

575
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,811
- And action.

576
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:15,848
[dramatic music]

577
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,229
- Jas, look out!
 [Jasmine screams]

578
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,679
[shattering]

579
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,821
- Did you get that?

580
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,721
- [Jasmine] I
 could've been killed.

581
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,757
- Thank God you're okay.

582
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,553
- Well, if it wasn't for that
 hunka hunka horrible actor,

583
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:33,452
I wouldn't have been.

584
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:35,212
- Well, that certainly
 does narrow down

585
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,835
our list of suspects.

586
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,596
- Laura was working with the
 light just before it fell,

587
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:41,046
but that Frank.

588
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,117
- Yeah, he definitely
 has a motive.

589
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:44,670
He thinks Tef is
 holding him back,

590
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,398
and that contract he's under
 is really frying his ass.

591
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,608
- Okay, so it's got
 to be Laura or Frank.

592
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,713
They were the only
 ones who were present,

593
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,129
except for the hunka actor.

594
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,752
- Not quite.

595
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:01,273
Mo didn't show up for work
 today, called in sick.

596
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,895
Very suspicious.

597
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,070
- Great, we're
 back to square one.

598
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,830
- Yeah, it looks like it.

599
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,969
- This is ridiculous.

600
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,315
We're getting nowhere
 with this case,

601
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:10,765
and, tomorrow
 night, Tef announces

602
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,215
the Playpen Girl of the Century.

603
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,838
- Yeah, they were talking
 about it all day at the club.

604
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,357
It's being held there.

605
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:18,462
- Okay, we've really got to
 turn up the heat on this.

606
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,913
You've got to come up with
 something before then.

607
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,260
If ever there was an
 opportunity to drive

608
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,987
Playpen Incorporated
 into the ground,

609
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:29,508
that would be some sort of
 deadly accident at this event.

610
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,923
- You're exactly right, Benny.

611
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,890
We're all gonna be there,

612
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,374
and we've gotta be on our toes.

613
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,308
- I'm telling you guys, I'm
 convinced that it's Frank.

614
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,000
Those beady little eyes
and his furrowed brow?

615
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,899
He just looks like a killer.

616
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,970
- Not exactly evidence that
 will stand up in court,

617
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,903
but your instincts
have been right before.

618
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,043
We're gonna keep a
 very close eye on him.

619
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:50,494
In fact, I think I have a plan.

620
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,532
- Ooh, I love plans! [giggles]

621
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,675
[quiet music]

622
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,990
- Hey, Mo.

623
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,232
- [Mo] Laura.

624
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:06,821
- Getting ready for
 the big night, I see.

625
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,273
Think you got a chance at
 Playpen Girl of the Century?

626
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:13,655
- I was Tef's favorite
once, so you never know.

627
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,590
- [chuckles] Well, we were all
 Tef's favorite at some point.

628
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,523
- What about you, you
think you have a chance?

629
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,147
I mean, it's the girl in front
 of the camera that counts,

630
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:23,838
not the girl behind it.

631
00:32:23,838 --> 00:32:26,047
- Ah, said the girl
behind the bar counter.

632
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,706
- [sighs] Let's face it, Laura,

633
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:31,639
neither one of us have a chance.

634
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,644
I mean, Tef, he used us
up and tossed us aside.

635
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,785
- I know, this whole
 Playpen Girl of the Century

636
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:44,100
is just his last ditch attempt
 to save his crumbling empire.

637
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,274
- Is the company really
in that much trouble?

638
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:47,827
- Would you care if it was?

639
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,381
[chuckling]

640
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,416
- Are you kidding?

641
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:53,937
I mean, let's face it,
 Laura, he screwed both of us,

642
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,077
literally and figuratively.

643
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:59,908
- Yeah, so, you think a little
 payback might be in order?

644
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,395
- Mm, I like the way you think.

645
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:07,123
- Yeah, and you are very
 sexy when you are devious.

646
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:09,677
- I know.

647
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,784
- What is it with me and
Playpen girls this week?

648
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,167
- Ex-Playpen girls.
 - Oh, even better.

649
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:23,553
[soft music]
 [patrons chattering]

650
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,006
- Okay, girls,
 you know the plan.

651
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,731
When Frank gets
 here, we have to keep

652
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,906
him occupied until
 the announcement.

653
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:32,907
- Right.
 - Got it.

654
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:35,910
- My, my, my.

655
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,120
- Hello, Mr. Tefflor.

656
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,125
- Please, call me Tef,
everybody calls me Tef.

657
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,819
Are you to be my bodyguard
 for this evening?

658
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,546
- Oh, no, Jasmine here,
 she'll be your side all night.

659
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:54,204
Nikki and I will be around
 making sure nothing happens.

660
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:59,209
- Jasmine, my latest
 Playpen Girl of the Month.

661
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:01,004
- Well, thank you.

662
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,317
- Oh, no, no, no, no, thank you.

663
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:05,457
Tell me, my dear, do you prefer

664
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,873
the month of
 October or November?

665
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:11,049
- I can see that
 she'll have no problem

666
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,360
staying by his side.

667
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,293
- Yeah, the problem's
 gonna be detaching

668
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,537
herself at the end of the night.

669
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:19,057
- Sandy, how you
doing, good to see you.

670
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,575
I didn't know you were
 gonna be here this evening.

671
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,232
- Oh, you know, I'm
 just keeping an eye

672
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,716
on my prospective investment.

673
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,788
- Oh, still thinking
 about investing

674
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:28,031
in Playpen entertainment?

675
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:31,034
I was hoping I'd
convinced you otherwise.

676
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,830
- Well, maybe I just need
 a little more convincing.

677
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,487
Wanna go to your office?

678
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,109
- [chuckles] That's very
tempting, Miss Banner,

679
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,042
but, unfortunately,
 I've got a ceremony

680
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,458
I must attend to, as I am
 the manager of this club.

681
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,634
- Oh, I know you are
 mighty important.

682
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,912
No, I've just got all this
 money floating around,

683
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,466
I'd really hate to waste
it on a bad investment.

684
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,952
- Yes, well, I don't know.

685
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:57,095
- Well, Nikki here, I
 think she wants to join us.

686
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:03,204
- Okay, all right,
 let's make this quick.

687
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,938
Now, girls, this really
can't take long, okay?

688
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,250
- Frank, look at us,

689
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,804
is this really something
you wanna rush?

690
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,118
- Oh, is this thing on?

691
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:24,881
Hello, everybody, and welcome

692
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:29,886
to the Playpen Girl of
 the Century extravaganza.

693
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:32,682
[clapping]

694
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,826
As everyone know, for
 decades, the dream

695
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:42,761
of every little girl
 in every little town

696
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:46,523
across this great nation
has been to become

697
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:50,700
a Playpen Girl of the Month.

698
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,152
Nothing says success like
 a staple through the navel.

699
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,775
[laughing]

700
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:59,847
And once these fine
 girls have attained

701
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:01,297
Playpen Girl of the Month,

702
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:05,646
the next step is Playpen
Girl of the Year.

703
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:09,374
For years, that has been
 the pinnacle of achievement

704
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:10,685
for a Playpen girl.

705
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:16,484
But, now, by popular
 demand, I introduce

706
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:20,592
the Playpen Girl of the Century.

707
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,870
[clapping]

708
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:28,324
The model that I have
 chosen epitomizes

709
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:33,191
everything that I love
 about a Playpen girl.

710
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,779
And so, now,
 without further ado,

711
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:42,027
I bring you the Playpen
Girl of the Century,

712
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,170
Jasmine St. James!

713
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,171
- [Jasmine] Wow!

714
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,724
[clapping]

715
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:50,829
Wow!

716
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,107
[clapping]

717
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,661
- What?

718
00:36:56,835 --> 00:36:58,561
Wait a goddamn minute, Tef!

719
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:02,910
How, how can she be Playpen
 Girl of the Century?

720
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,775
I only photographed
 her a few days ago!

721
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:08,087
- Yes, and you did
 such a good job.

722
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:11,919
She's beautiful and charming.

723
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:14,093
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

724
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:15,647
- Mo, you, too?

725
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,615
- Yeah, you thought I was
 beautiful and charming

726
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,168
and everything else
 I'm sure you told

727
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:22,585
that little chippy when
you were screwing her.

728
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:25,588
- Ew, I've never had
 sex with this guy.

729
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:27,245
- Like I believe that.

730
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,937
- It's all coming back
 to haunt you now, Tef.

731
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,939
All the sleeping
 around, all the lies

732
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:35,874
to every girl in a skirt who
 dreamed of being somebody.

733
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,259
- Listen, listen to me, I
 never had sex with that girl.

734
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:45,608
- And why would she be
the exception, huh, Tef?

735
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,300
- What would stop you
now from fooling around?

736
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,268
- Listen to me,

737
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:56,274
I haven't been able
 to have sex in years.

738
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,309
- [Crowd] Ew!

739
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,139
- Really?

740
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,900
Oh, how sad for you.

741
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,144
- All right, sister, game's up.

742
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,735
- Where's Frank?

743
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:11,841
- Oh, he's all tied up.

744
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,775
[funky music]

745
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:17,329
- Tef, hello, Tef,
 hello, anybody?

746
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:20,677
Help!

747
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:23,991
Help.

748
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:24,819
Tef?

749
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:26,959
Tef?

750
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm tied up. [cries]

751
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,072
Mo. [cries]

752
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:40,766
- Oh, Jasmine,
 you saved my life.

753
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,183
How can I ever thank you?

754
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,186
- Hands off, creep.

755
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:50,742
This case is over, and,
apparently, so are you.

756
00:38:57,956 --> 00:39:00,786
- Well, girls, we
 did it, well done.

757
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:02,098
- Yay!

758
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:02,926
- Yay!

759
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,695
- Well, looks like another
 successful assignment

760
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,766
for the Teeny
 Weeny Bikini Squad.

761
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,043
- Sure was.

762
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,355
Frank admitted he was
 behind the accidents.

763
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,253
He wanted Tef out of
 business so he could

764
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:21,669
start a competing
 production company.

765
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:24,810
- But what persuaded
 Frank to spill the beans?

766
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,227
- Oh, I can be very persuasive.

767
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,644
[giggling]

768
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:32,646
- Okay, but what about
 Laura and Maureen?

769
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,682
- Oh, just disgruntled
 former girlfriends.

770
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:37,340
Pretty much every girl Tef
 ever dated wanted to kill him.

771
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,100
So, right now, there's
 a booking sergeant

772
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,965
at police headquarters
getting quite an eyeful.

773
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:47,661
- Yeah, well, I guess it
 didn't do Tef much good, huh?

774
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:49,041
- [Women] Aw.

775
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,285
- Yeah, his image was
 that of a virile man

776
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:53,874
who could bed any
 woman he wanted.

777
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:54,806
Now that the truth came out,

778
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,946
nobody really cared anymore.

779
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:58,154
- So I guess that smoking jacket

780
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:01,329
really was a turnon
 for women, huh?

781
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,779
Amazing.

782
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:05,541
- Well, at any rate, now
 that that's all wrapped up,

783
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:08,198
we can finally go
 on our vacation!

784
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:12,513
- About that vacation-

785
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:15,067
- Oh, no, Benny!
- Come on!

786
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:16,483
- Not again!

787
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:20,348
- We have another case,
and it just can't wait.

788
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,833
- Well, what is it this time?

789
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,387
- There was a skydiving
 accident about a week ago.

790
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:25,940
Two people were killed.

791
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,598
They're thinking it
 may be foul play.

792
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:32,706
- Skydiving, what does
that have to do with us?

793
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:34,742
- Well, it's nude skydiving.

794
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:38,436
- Oh, come on, get him, get him!

795
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,367
- Come here!

796
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:42,750
- I wanna go on vacation!

797
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,545
You said you promised!

798
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,619
- Girls, this would
 normally be when I tell you

799
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,139
to pack your bikinis,
 but, in this case,

800
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:54,486
I think you might
 be overdressed.

801
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,868
[soft music]

802
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:04,738
- Do you think maybe there
 could be evil twins involved?

803
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,776
You know, you can never
trust those evil twins.

804
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:11,227
[soft music]

805
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:18,510
- Oh, boy, I sense a lot
of nudity in our future.

806
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,926
[soft music]

807
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,999
- Most of the customers
here, they don't care

808
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,932
about the quality of the service

809
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:30,211
but the quantity of the server,
if you know what I mean.

810
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,698
[soft music]

811
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:37,978
- [Jasmine] Gee, that's
a bit much, isn't it?

812
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:40,498
- Well, it's the winter edition.

813
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,914
[soft music]

814
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:52,268
- Tef, Mo, Tef, Mo, anybody!

815
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:53,925
Help!

816
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:56,790
Help.

817
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,171
[soft music]

818
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,486
- Listen to me, Claude,
there's no reason

819
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,108
to get your panties in a twist.

820
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,525
[soft music]

821
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:13,151
- If I tell my boss that
 you've been investigating him,

822
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,326
he's probably not gonna
take that too kindly.

823
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,296
[soft music]

824
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:30,962
- [Jasmine] You have a
subscription, don't you?

825
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:34,828
- Well, yes, but I
only read the articles.

826
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:37,278
[soft music]

827
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:42,525
- I haven't been able
 to have sex in years.

828
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:46,218
[surf rock music]

829
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:50,628
