- Hmm.

God, I can't believe
that I had sex with you.

surprised by that too.

DARCY: My parents,
they got divorced

870
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,120
when I was in high school,

871
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,200
and my first engagement
was a disaster.

872
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,560
What about you? Are
you dating anyone?

873
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,976
Have you always
wanted to be a pirate?

874

Excuse me, sirs.

Darcy, they're gonna hurt you.

877

I just can't help but notice

878
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,056
that you guys smell
like cigarettes,

879
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,400
and I am loving it.

880
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,760
Is there any way I
could bum a cigarette?

881
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,336
I mean, I think it
might help with the...

882
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,976
the panic and dread I'm
experiencing right now.

883
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,216

smoke cigarettes?

884
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,360
It's...

885
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,256
I just... You don't even
have to untie my hands.

886
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,480
I mean, I... I can
smoke with no hands.

887
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,760
You could just put
it right in my mouth.

888

her a cigarette.

it will shut me up.

Do you remember

995
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
that time that we were
driving down the highway

996
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,480
and you very calmly
told me to pull over?

997
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,120
And you waited
until we pulled over

998
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,800
to tell me that there was
a giant spider on my head?

999
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,640

told me before,

1002
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
I might have panicked
and crashed the car.

1003
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,976
Wait. Is there a
spider on my head?

1004
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,360
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1005
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,320
No, no. I tell you
this story because...

I don't want you to panic

1007
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,480
when I tell you what
I'm about to tell you.

Your grenade doesn't have a pin.

1009

- What does that mean?
- Well...

1010
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,256
Well, is it... is it...
is it gonna explode?

1011

No, no, no, no,
no. No, no, no.

Hold it exactly how you're
holding it. Good. Good.

- Okay. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1014
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,440
That pin holds the handle on.

1015
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,240
But when you let
go of the grenade,

1016
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,560
the handle pops off,

1017
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,280
which lights the fuse, and
the whole thing goes...

1018
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,440
boom.

Should... Should I throw it?

1022

that you won't be able

1023
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,080
to throw it far enough
to not blow us up.

1024
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,280
- No offense.
- God.

1025
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,640
So, what, I just... I just
hold this live grenade?

1026
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,680
This grenade is just
part of my life now?

1027
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
Yeah, for now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1028
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,240

1029
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,440

- I'm gonna cut

through these ties,

1032

of that grenade,

and then we're gonna
head down to the docks.

1034
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,416
We're gonna bum-rush
the pirate guarding it,

1035
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,360
hop in a boat, and head to
the next island for help.

the chances of it happening
again were very small.

- Me and Margy.

1381

We e-mailed a lot,

1382
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,456
and I asked a lot of
tough questions, didn't I?

1383
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,600
How could you not
tell me about this?

1384
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,176
You didn't tell me that
you were having doubts

1385
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,320
about getting married, so...

1386
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,480
Yeah, you're right.

1387
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,400
I didn't. You know why?

1388
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,920
Because all last year,

1389
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,240
you were in your head
about everything.

1390
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,616
You thought my dad
didn't like you,

1391
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,040
so you started acting all weird.

1392
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,920
And now my dad doesn't like you.

1393
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,536
You thought the Robins
were gonna drop you.

1394
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,736
And then you started
playing badly,

1395
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,640
and they did drop
you. You think

1396
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,856
that something bad
is gonna happen,

1397
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,640
and then you make it happen.

1398
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,120
That's called self-sabotage.

1399
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,480
It is. Ace, thank you.

1400

And all you were excited
about was this wedding.

1401
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,160
And I knew that if I told
you that I was having doubts,

1402
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,200
that you would sabotage
our whole relationship.

1403
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,720
Which you did anyway!

1404
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,720
I didn't sabotage anything.

1405

wedding perfect.

1406
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,080
And it all got ruined the
day your boy Sean showed up.

1407
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,800
This has nothing
to do with Sean.

1408
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,560
This is about your insecurities.

1409
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,920
And this whole wedding

1410
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,440
was your way of trying to
get control of your life,

1411
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,776
because you have to
control everything.

1412

get out of the car

1414
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,160
when I can do it
just fine on my own.

1415
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,856

17-point turn "just fine."

from Old Navy last month

in the men's section.

so strong, but you're
just a scared little girl.

1427

You're afraid to go all
in on this relationship

1428
