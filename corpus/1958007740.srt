1
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,304
- Hi, this is Alayna.

2
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,006
I can't come to the
phone right now,

3
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,074
but please leave a message.

4
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,079
Hi, this is Alayna.

5
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,915
I can't come to the
phone right now-

6
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,215
- Any luck?

7
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,885
It just keeps
going to voicemail.

8
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,385
- This is Alayna
we're talking about.

9
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,220
She's the closing act
for tonight's show.

10
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,088
- Yeah, I know.

11
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,189
- Maybe her phone isn't working.

12
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,925
- You think so?

13
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,260
I mean, it's not like
Alayna to miss concerts.

14
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,494
- You know she skipped
school today, right?

15
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,262
- Are you serious?

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,064
- Yep.

17
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,699
- Who'd she go with?

18
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:41,736
- According to my resources,
friend Darla and Jennifer.

19
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,203
- Jennifer?

20
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,372
- Yeah, that crazy punk rocker
chick that nobody likes.

21
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,842
- Okay, let me try her again.

22
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,748
- Hello?

23
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,749
- Alayna?

24
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,683
It's Kara.

25
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,317
Where are you?

26
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,219
The concert's going to
start in like 30 minutes,

27
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,788
and Leslie's been
looking for you

28
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:03,725
to do some warmups
and go over a plan.

29
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:04,993
- I'm going to be there soon,

30
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:06,293
but I'm in the middle
of something right now.

31
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,062
- What are you talking about?

32
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,230
This is the biggest
concert of the year!

33
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,165
There's gonna be recruiters
from all the colleges.

34
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,568
- I know.

35
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,570
- This is the moment
you've been waiting for,

36
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,538
the time for you to
show off your new song.

37
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,806
- Okay, well what time's my cue?

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm gonna try to
be there on time.

39
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,709
- 7:45.

40
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,311
- Okay, I'll see you soon.

41
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,914

someone's ass right now.

- Hey, you!

72
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,694
- Your mom let me in
through the front door.

73
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:20,928
- That's okay.

74
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,429
I'm just glad I don't
have to get a ride

75
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,765
from her every morning.

76
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,399
- You do know what day
it is today, don't you?

77
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,702
- What?

78
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,269
- Why, it's senior skip day.

79
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,973
It's time to loosen
up and meet some boys.

80
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,474
- Yeah, I forgot about that.

81
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,409
I don't think I can miss school.

82
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,246
I have a choir performance,

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,413
and there's no way I'm
missing that recital.

84
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,883
- Why not?

85
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,519
- I'm doing the closing song
for tonight's performance.

86
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,286
This is a big deal for me.

87
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,922
Don't mess it up.

88
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,525
And I have to be at school in
order to go to the concert.

89
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,026
- Chill out.

90
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,293
We're gonna go pick
up Darla right now,

91
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,562
and then we can stop by school

92
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,265
so that you can sign
into your first period.

93
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,399
- I'm not even
cool enough to go.

94
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,736
Besides, the other girls
really don't like me

95
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,436
as much as you think they do.

96
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,739
I'm just a school choir nerd.

97
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,307
I'll probably make
the whole day boring.

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,545
Plus, I've never
skipped school before.

99
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,413
- It's gonna be so much fun,
no matter what we do today.

100
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,448
And no one's even gonna
know you're not at school.

101
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,651
I promise.

102
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,351
- I need to check into
my first period class

103
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,054
so they don't count me absent.

104
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,724
- No one's even gonna suspect
that you're not at school.

105
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,492
Come on. I have the car running.

106
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,061
- Wait.

107
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,597
I'm only in if you
introduce me to Skip,

108
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,465
the student body
president's hottest guy.

109
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,969
- Well, of course. Now come on.

110
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,585
- Jennifer Cunningham!

111
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,622
What do you think you're doing?

112
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,455
What is that?

113
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,524
- What's what?

114
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,160
- What's going on here?

115
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,662
- Oh! Pfft!

116
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:38,431
Well, you see, I was fixing
it, because the computer broke,

117
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,468
and one of the circuits
just totally flubbed on me,

118
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,571
so I was fixing the
computer 'cause it decided,

119
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,908
the circuit decided to
break, so I was fixing it.

120
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,576
That's what I was doing.

121
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,144
- Go have a seat.

122
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:52,079
- I'm serious!

123
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,014
The computer actually broke,

124
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,715
and I'm really trying to fix it.

125
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,651
- It's like the last time,
when you phoned into the office

126
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,352
and you called and
you said aliens

127
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,121
were attacking
the football team.

128
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,389
- That's different.

129
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,590
I really thought
that was happening,

130
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,525
but somebody played
a prank on me.

131
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,593
- Go have a seat.

132
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,438
- Darla, dear, are you
ready to go to school?

133
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,408
Mom, I told you I'm
getting a ride from Bren.

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,576
She's picking up
in five minutes.

135
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,578
- I need you to
understand something.

136
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,580
Those girls are losers.

137
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,550
They will never
amount to anything.

138
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,986
You need friends that
are pretty, like you are,

139
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,754
ones who introduce you to guys,

140
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,726
rich guys, like I
have, men with money.

141
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,194
- Stop, Mom.

142
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,461
- You're a fashion model,

143
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,697
and you only need
what's good for you.

144
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,633
- Mom, I really like
hanging out with Bren.

145
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,734
She stands up for me at school,

146
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,269
and all of the girls
are hating on me.

147
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,671
- Just remember, you
have an image to uphold,

148
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,674
and I expect you to keep
yourself professional.

149
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,474
- I have to go.

150
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,776
- Keep your chin up

151
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,477
and cross your legs
when you take a photo.

152
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,746
- Have a good day, Mom.

153
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,247
- Okay.

154
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,716
- Hi, girls.

155
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:02,783
- Hello.

156
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,118
- Do you wanna sit
in the front seat?

157
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:04,952
- Stop it. No way.

158
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,486
You can ride shotgun.

159
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,296
So are you going to skip
school with us today?

160
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,433
- Yes, but only if you
introduce me to Skip.

161
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:22,536
- We will, don't worry.
That is my specialty.

162
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:37,885
- The motto of this school
is maneat in schola,

163
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,622
which, translated,
means stay in school,

164
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,591
which is appropriate
on a day like today

165
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,626
when so many young
developing minds

166
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,661
are actually tempted
to skip school.

167
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,596
Don't touch anything!

168
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,630
- I was just trying to-

169
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,464
- Stop!

170
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,468
Playing pranks on people and
messing with school property?

171
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,138
That is not going to
get you graduated.

172
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,373
It's like the last time
you got in trouble,

173
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,808
you decided to go upstairs

174
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,377
and flood the second
story bathroom stalls,

175
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,579
causing a major
biochemical hazard,

176
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:10,151
and it still smells in Ms.
Sosa's classroom really bad.

177
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,853
So now this is your last year.

178
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,156
Let's try not to get
into any more trouble.

179
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,691
- But Principal Leigh,
that one wasn't a prank.

180
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,493
School restrooms are disgusting.

181
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,829
I was testing out each
toilet before I used it,

182
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,064
and then I had to run out

183
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,366
before the water
levels got too high.

184
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,368
- And this is why you're
having trouble in school.

185
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,604
You need to learn how to
survive in the real world!

186
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,673
I'm telling you, if you
don't change any this year,

187
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,609
I am not going to graduate you.

188
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:39,480
Show me that you can
do one good thing.

189
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,115
Now get outta my
office. Skedaddle.

190
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,517
Go. Just go.

191
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,350
Goodbye.

192
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,591
- All right, girls.

193
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,861
It's time to steal the
trophy that I deserved.

194
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,399
Keep watch and make sure
Miss Armstrong doesn't come.

204
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,663

Sorry.

- Well, well, well.

213
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,786
Looky who we have here.

214
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,455
It's our favorite
choir school nerd.

215
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,823
- Oh no.

216
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,158
Where are the rest of
your retarded friends?

217
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,826
- They're in the car.

218
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,461
- You're not planning on
doing senior skip day today,

219
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,795
are you?

220
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,064
- Yeah, actually we were.

221
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,734
- Nobody wants to see
a loser skip school,

222
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,802
not even the students.

223
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,439
- What's with the trophy?

224
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,210
- Wouldn't you like to know?

225
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,714
- Bye bye, loser.

226
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:30,659
- Oh no. It's Jennifer,
the school reject.

227
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,560
- Please don't come over here.

228
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:32,726
Please don't come over here.

229
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,827
- Hey!
- She sees us.

230
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,695
- Hey.

231
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,665
Oh.

232
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,398
- Excuse me, Principal Leigh.

233
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,832
- Yes, may I help you?

234
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,768
I seem to be missing my first
place cheerleading trophy

235
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,803
we won last weekend.

236
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,639
- Hey, watch it. That's my car.

237
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,041
- I bet you thought I was gonna
break this, huh?

238
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,475
Well, not me.

239
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,945
- No!
- No! Idiot!

240
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,349
- I can fix this.

241
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,785
- No, I can fix that.

242
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,789
- Of course you
break the mirror, weirdo.

243
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,994
- So, where are we going?

244
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,729
- What are you doing in my car?

245
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,832
- We're waiting
for Alayna. Gosh.

246
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,368
- I really hope the principal

247
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,870
doesn't know that
we're skipping.

248
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,074
Oh no, she sees us. Duck!

249
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,676
- Drive,
drive, drive, drive,

250
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,579
before the principal catches us!

251
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,080
- What the heck?

252
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,921
- Oh my gosh,
oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

253
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,222
- Calm down!

254
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,491
- What up, loser?

255
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,660
- Go, go, go, go, please!

256
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:41,563
Skip Day!

257
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,706
- Wow! That was close.

258
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,240
- I knew we weren't
gonna get caught.

259
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,377
- So, Jennifer, right?

260
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,811
- You know it. Woo!

261
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:03,017
- So, what are you doing
in the car with us?

262
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,653
- Today's senior skip day!

263
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,954
I wouldn't miss it
for the entire world!

264
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,923
- Right, but don't
you have friends

265
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,025
that you could skip with?

266
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,161
I mean, we didn't
really invite you.

267
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,564
- Well, yeah, I've
got lots of friends.

268
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:19,466
I just choose not to
hang out with them.

269
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,603
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

270
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,937
But where are they right now?

271
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,206
- That's not important.

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,443
I told you, I choose not
to hang out with them.

273
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,078
- Aren't you in
my physics class?

274
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:34,014
- Yeah. I am smart, you know?

275
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,416
- Yeah, you're just not pretty.

276
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,353
That's probably why
you don't have friends.

277
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,990
- Hopefully I get
to meet Skip today.

278
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,794
- I hope I meet a hot guy today.

279
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,730
I think my stupid
boyfriend's cheating on me.

280
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:51,733
- I'm sorry, Darla,
but I bet he is.

281
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,935
- And if he does,
he'll regret it

282
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,871
when I become a big
movie star one day.

283
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:02,811
- Um, Jennifer, why are you
skipping school today again?

284
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,945
- Well, since I am a genius,

285
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,515
I do need to take a break
every once in a while.

286
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,584
- Oh really? You need a break?

287
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,451
- Yeah.

288
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,919
- From what, yourself?

289
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,455
And now you're gracing us
with all your presence?

290
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,990
- Okay, everyone. Let's
just be nice, okay?

291
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,793
- So where are we going?

292
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,127
- I know what we should do!

293
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,895
Let's go grab breakfast!

294
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,401
- So whose house is
this party at again?

295
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,604
- It's at Pedro's house.

296
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:30,371
- Pedro's cute.

297
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,840
- Yeah.

298
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,040
- Oh, Mr. Piggy,

299
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,745
you don't understand how
long I've been craving

300
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,581
the touch of your
sweet pork lips.

301
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,851
- Are you all sure
that she's okay?

302
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,451
- Oh, oink, oink!

303
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:46,053
Oink, oink!

304
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,021
Make some bacon out
of me, Mr. Piggy!

305
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,223
Oink, oink!

306
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,359
- She's just into weird stuff.

307
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,828
- I don't know, but she
does stuff like that

308
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,330
all the time in physics class.

309
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,031
- I don't know about
your friend, Alayna.

310
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,601
- Oh, shut up.

311
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:00,901
- I just don't think we should
have let her come with us.

312
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,136
She's just gonna
get us in trouble.

313
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,572
- She's gonna be fine.

314
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:06,541
Let's change the subject.

315
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,543
Darla, when's your
next fashion show?

316
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,944
I saw that your mom was
posting a bunch of new stuff.

317
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,882
- Why does she always push
the fashion show stuff anyway?

318
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,182
- She wants me to grow up

319
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,184
and marry a handsome
man with lots of money,

320
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,952
but I don't even know
if I'm cut out for that.

321
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,053
- Don't even worry about that.

322
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,256
You have so much time
to figure that out.

323
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,758
Let's get the check.

324
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:52,119
- Looks like we're here
at the cool senior party.

325
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:54,889
I'm scared to go in!

326
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,925
- Don't be. This
is gonna be fun.

327
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,058
- Okay.

328
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,326
- Are you excited to see Skip?

329
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,729
- Yeah, but I'm sort of nervous.

330
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,632
- So you like a dude named Skip?

331
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,033
- Yeah.

332
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,902
- His name is really Skip?

333
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,169
- Yeah!

334
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,205
- Sounds like a dog's name.

335
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,173
- But he's so cute.

336
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,076
- Yeah, well, my dog's cute,
but I don't wanna date him.

337
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,412
- Okay, Alayna,
Jennifer and Darla,

338
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,081
this is our senior
skip day, okay?

339
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,183
It only happens once,

340
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,786
so we can't let this
day just go by us

341
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,187
without living it to
the absolute fullest.

342
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,958
It's gonna be the best day ever.

343
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,058
Senior skip day

344
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,596
will be one to remember.

345
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,179
- The
last party I went to,

346
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:56,116
I got kicked out for
drinking all the beer.

347
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,151
- Sure it's not because of
the way you were dressed?

348
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,153
- Uh, Justin Bieber
gave me this jacket

349
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,189
at a Hollywood party, so.

350
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,864
- Can I help you?

351
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,333
Aren't you the girls that
got milk poured on your heads

352
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,802
at the homecoming dance?

353
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:17,471
- Uh, let me handle this.

354
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,507
- Do you really think
we would let you losers

355
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,543
into the cool senior
skip day party?

356
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,546
Besides, nobody even
invited you all here.

357
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,179
You all need to leave now.

358
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,314
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

359
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,183
We know the secret
password. Just, um...

360
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,021
The password is, oh,

361
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,088
one.

362
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,091
Probably higher
than you can count.

363
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,160
- Really? You girls are a joke!

364
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,361
- You know what?

365
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,897
Just let us in before
I kick your ass, okay?

366
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,699
Pedro invited us over.

367
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,199
- Whatever, losers.

368
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,471
- Did you see what I got?

369
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,340
It's because I earned
it, not Coach Armstrong.

370
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,642
It was me.

371
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:57,077
I finished in the
final top score.

372
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,212
- Sure.

373
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,317
- Looks like they invited
everyone to the party.

374
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,758
- I invited Bren yesterday
'cause we got Spanish class.

375
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,359
She's cool.

376
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,829
I don't know about her other
friends, but it's good.

377
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,168
- Weirdos. Am I right?

378
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,971
- Yeah, it's whatever.

379
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,199
- This is sick.

380
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,266
- Wow.

381
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,772
Oh, they're doing
shots! I'll be back.

382
00:18:58,673 --> 00:18:59,874
- I'm gonna take this call.

383
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:00,675
- Okay.

384
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,244
- Thank you for
bringing me here.

385
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:08,082
- You're gonna have so
much fun. You'll see.

386
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,282
- Look.

387
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,085
There's Skip.

388
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,975
- See? I told you
that he'd be here.

389
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,243
Do you want me to break the ice?

390
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,145
- Can you?

391
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,513
- Of course I can. Come on.

392
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,014
Skip, hi.
- Hey.

393
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,749
- I don't know if you remember
me from history class,

394
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:44,085
but my name's Bren,
this is Alayna.

395
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,788
- Yeah, Bren, I remember you.

396
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,389
And Alayna, yeah,
you look familiar.

397
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,258
- Glad we can formally meet.

398
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,761
- I'm gonna head
out for a second.

399
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:54,562
- Okay.

400
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,264
- You sing in the school choir.

401
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,833
I love to hear y'all sing.

402
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,569
- As a matter of fact, we
have a choir recital tonight.

403
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,571
Maybe you could come.

404
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:04,404
- Yeah.

405
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:06,974
- Yo, Skip!

406
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:10,178
Hey, we are gonna do
some shots out back!

407
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,311
You should totally join us.

408
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,345
- Okay. I'll be right there.

409
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,147
- Sounds good.

410
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:16,383
- I guess I gotta go.

411
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,721
Oh, yeah, give me your number.

412
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,455
I'll text you an address
later in the day.

413
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,291
My sister's having a party
at my house at 2:00 p.m.,

414
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,894
but it's for college kids only.

415
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:28,428
If you bring a bottle of vodka,

416
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,898
I'll make sure that they
let you and your friends in.

417
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,365
Those are my sister's rules.

418
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,400
- Sounds good.

419
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,136
- Cool. See you there?

420
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:35,937
Awesome.

421
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:38,039
Hey, wait up!

422
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,243
- Yes!

423
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,478
- Hey, did you hear about
that party later today?

424
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,460
- Well, three's a crowd,
two's company, am I right?

425
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:05,600
- Weirdo.

426
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,431
- Mm-mm.

427
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,537
- What did he do this time?

428
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,405
See, I knew he was bad for you.

429
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,642
- Tommy just told me
he found another girl.

430
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,423
- Darla, I'm so sorry.
But you know what?

431
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,993
You're gonna find another
guy, okay? I promise.

432
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:08,830
- I just met the guy
I'm going to marry,

433
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,666
but he's right
over there, so shh.

434
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:16,336
- See, I told you you
could do it. That's great.

435
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:20,241
- What happened? Did
I miss something?

436
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:24,078
- No, it's just her stupid
boyfriend just called it quits.

437
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,013
- Let me just check
in with my mom, okay?

438
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,783
- Seriously, chillax
a little bit.

439
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,619
It's our senior skip day,
and you wanna call your mom?

440
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:32,954
Let's just have fun today.

441
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,122
- Look, let me just
give her a text, okay?

442
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:37,124
I always check in with
her during lunchtime.

443
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:57,678
- I'm so excited to
go to another party!

444
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,313
- Awesome.

445
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:00,514
- There you guys are!

446
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:01,649
I was just hanging out

447
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:02,884
with some really cool
people over there.

448
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,653
I don't know if
you've ever met...

449
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:06,721
Oh gosh.

450
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,323
Oh, me, myself, and I.

451
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,195
- Well, we were just hanging out

452
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,764
with the cool people
from the party.

453
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,700
- Meeting guys and stuff.

454
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:20,500
- Come on.

455
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:27,508
Where's Jennifer?

456
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,976
thought she was right behind us.

457
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,145
- I think she went to the
bathroom as we were walking out.

458
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:32,580
I think she's gross.

459
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,583
I literally cannot stand her.
I hate the way she dresses.

460
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:39,553
- Not everyone can be like
you, fashion model princess.

461
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:40,621
- Screw you.

462
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,555
- Screw me?

463
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:44,592
Why do you have
to insult me now?

464
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,661
It's not her fault
she likes punk rock.

465
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,561
It's her style. Get over it.

466
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:48,763
- You get over it.

467
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:52,266
Okay, we're all pretty.
Just don't argue.

468
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,268
- Go!

469
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,838
- What did you just do?

470
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:00,708
No.

471
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:01,776
- Just drive.

472
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,013
- Those losers stole my trophy!

473
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,081
They're gonna pay for this.

474
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,716
Girls, gimme some salt!

475
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,722
Those girls are dead meat!

476
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,258
- Why do you have that
trophy in your hand?

477
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,393
That's the one that Italy had.

478
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,195
- I stole it.

479
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,763
- Why?

480
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,699
- Because Italy stole it
from cheer coach Armstrong.

481
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,067
I'm just returning it.

482
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,568
- And since when
are you the hero?

483
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,237
I have to do one good
deed before the year is up

484
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:31,572
in order to graduate.

485
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:34,408
That's what principal Leigh
told me, so here it is.

486
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:35,776
- Jeez, Jennifer, you're crazy.

487
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,913
- Plus, I hate Italy. She's
a bully, and I hate her.

488
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,247
- Well great!

489
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,116
Because now we're going
to get our asses kicked.

490
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,317
- No.

491
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:46,454
You're gonna get
your kicked for sure.

492
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:50,591
- Who's the best?
You're the best.

493
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,460
Yeah, you're the best.

494
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,728
- So what's next?

495
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:57,665
- Well, we could be in
third period right now.

496
00:24:57,698 --> 00:24:59,633
That would suck.

497
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,002
- Let's go shopping!

498
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,170
Darla, you already
said that, remember?

499
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,906
- I know, I know, but it's
my favorite place to be.

500
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,775
- Let's go play
miniature golfing!

501
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,477
- How about let's go
back to the party.

502
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,113
- How about not. Is that a joke?

503
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,983
- Can I drive your car?

504
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,821
- Okay, fine.

505
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:21,555

00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,524
- Slow down.
- That scared me.

554
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,691
- That was pretty good.

555
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,960
- Um...

556
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:13,961
Pop the trunk.

557
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:14,995
- Why?

558
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:21,135
- 'Cause I wanna put
the trophy in the back.

559
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:22,436
I don't feel like carrying it.

560
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:23,437
- Oh, now you don't
feel like carrying it?

561
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,872
- Pop the trunk!

562
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,354
Maybe we should link arms.

563
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,155
- No.

564
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,825
- This is where I
like to hang out.

565
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:47,629
- You've never taken
me here before.

566
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,930
- That's 'cause it's special.

567
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,102
- I think I need to
find a new boyfriend.

568
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,338
- Who do you have in mind?

569
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:00,874
- I don't know, someone
older, more mature.

570
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,745
I thought I would've met
someone today, but who knows?

571
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,716
- Your last boyfriend
was kind of a jerk.

572
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,251
He hung out with those
like skater guys.

573
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:12,987
- But I like those skater guys.

574
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,055
They remind me of
how I wanna dress.

575
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,758
My mom's always
pushing me to dress up.

576
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,262
- For the record,
I really like Skip.

577
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,430
He's like the one for me.

578
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,033
- We know.

579
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:31,071
- So Jennifer, who's
your love interest?

580
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:34,275
- Don't have one.
Boys are gross.

581
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,909
- So you don't like guys?

582
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,978
- That's not it.

583
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:41,583
- It's just I haven't
found the right one for me.

584
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,752
- Well maybe if you dressed
nicely, then you would.

585
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,060
- Oh no.

586
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,795
We're in trouble now.

587
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:59,300
- Here we are again.

588
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:03,304
My three retarded school
nerds and their choir captain.

589
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,106
Where's my cheerleading trophy?

590
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,811
Where is it?

591
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,117
I want my cheerleading
trophy now!

592
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:18,919
- Hey, how are we
supposed to know?

593
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:21,088
I mean, we're not
the ones who stole it

594
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:24,391
from the cheer coach's office.

595
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,826
- Give it to me.

596
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,227
- I don't have it.

597
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,996
- You know, it's probably
where you left it last.

598
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,800
- You think this is funny?

599
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,067
I worked my butt
off for that trophy.

600
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,501
Now where is it?

601
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,038
- We've never seen it before.

602
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:39,507
- You want my friends
and I to kick your butts

603
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,542
and shake it out of you?

604
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,976
- Things get lost and, gosh,

605
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,478
people lose things all the time.

606
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:48,683
And, oh, it's especially
prevalent in dumb bimbos.

607
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,987
- Why do you think
we stole your trophy?

608
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,157
- You're gonna wish you never
messed with me, choir nerd.

609
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,629
- Go, go, go!

610
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:02,429
Let's go!

611
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:13,207
- What the hell is going on?

612
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,043
I told you not to
steal that trophy!

613
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,416
- Where are they going?

614
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,953
- Messing with
people's fun, right?

615
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:26,855
- We need to get back to school

616
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,188
before we get into more trouble.

617
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:40,735
Oh my gosh.

618
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,275
- I want my trophy!

619
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:50,911
What are we gonna do?

620
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,013
- We're gonna lose
'em, that's what.

621
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,058
- That was awesome!

622
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,261
Yeah!

623
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,430
- That was the best ever!

624
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,037
- I don't sees on them.

625
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,707
- Keep your eyes
on them, ladies.

626
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,114
- There they are.

627
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,249
- Come and get us.

628
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:35,523
- They mess with the
wrong cheerleader.

629
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,594
You're going down, choir nerds!

630
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:40,427
- Losers!

631
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:47,301
- We
beat you, suckers!

632
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,307
- You're
going, choir nerd!

633
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,515
- Old lady crossing the street!

634
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:01,315
- Look out!

635
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:03,150
- Que pasa!

636
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:09,089
- We beat you, suckers!

637
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,792
- That was so close!

638
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,961
- We had
'em the whole time!

639
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,662
- Thanks to my driving.

640
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,231
- Man, I am so hyped right now!

641
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,600
This is like that
time my dad took me

642
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,300
to the Cannonball
cross-country race.

643
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,803
with millionaires
and socialites.

644
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,203
- Well, we did it.

645
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:27,241
- Guys, the college
party starts at 2:00 p.m.

646
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:28,843
- I know.

647
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:31,211
Skip is going to be there,
and I'm super excited.

648
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,748
But there's just one problem.

649
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,316
- What's that?

650
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,485
- We need a bottle
of liquor to get in.

651
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,487
It's Skip's sister's
college party,

652
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:43,625
and that's the only way they'll
let us high schoolers go.

653
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:47,996
- I think my mom has booze at
her liquor bar in my house.

654
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,229
- Darla's house we go.

655
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,808
- I don't think anybody is home.

656
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:02,276
My mom's car's gone.

657
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,647
- That's great. Come on.

658
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,688
- Where's the booze?

659
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,355
Check the counter.

660
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,134
- Can I have one of
these gummy bears?

661
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:31,806
Yeah, just take whatever you
want. Take the whole bottle.

662
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:40,048
- Looks like there's no alcohol.

663
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,384
Except for in the trash.

664
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:48,422
Where's your bathroom?

665
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,591
- Down the hall.

666
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,467
- What was that?

667
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,302
It sounded like a car.

668
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,440
- Darla, are
you expecting company?

669
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,842
- No, why?

670
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,811
- Looks like
you have some now.

671
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,311
- Oh no. My mom is home.

672
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,480
Let's go hide in my room.

673
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,838
- So what are we gonna do?

674
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:44,639
- I don't know.

675
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,472
- Shh!

676
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:51,378
Why don't we just go
through the window?

677
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:15,536
- Now we're never gonna
get to that party.

678
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:19,974
- Wait, guys. I know
where we can get alcohol.

679
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,542
- Where are we going?

680
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:24,212
- What? This isn't enough
to get us into the party?

681
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,513
- No, Jennifer.

682
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:26,714
It's just that we
need real liquor

683
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:29,083
so that we don't walk
in looking like idiots.

684
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:31,652
I think I know a liquor
store where we can get some.

685
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,622
- What do you know
about buying alcohol?

686
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,456
- You don't know
everything about me.

687
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,325
- It's because she hangs
out with all the cool kids.

688
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,794
- Ha ha.

689
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,929
No, it's just that they let
teenagers into this liquor store

690
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:43,998
because they sell
chips and soda.

691
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,265
We should go check it out.

692
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,537
- Wait, can we turn this up?

693
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,038
- I love this song.

694
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,106
- You know this song?

695
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,274

00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:02,076
- You really think
this is gonna work?

709
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,312
- I'm a pro. Trust me.

710
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,513
- Let me see it.

711
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:12,653
- You do realize that you made
yourself 50 years old here?

712
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:13,888
- Yes, I know.

713
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,357
The guy who made it
messed up this time.

714
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,793
- Well, let's hope
you don't get caught.

715
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,828
- Don't jinx us.

716
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,362
- I don't think all of
our lunch money combined

717
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,464
is gonna be enough.

718
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:27,935
- Well, maybe we can
just get the small pint.

719
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,270
- Yeah, I don't drink.

720
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:31,371
It's just enough to
get into the party.

721
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,807
- Let's go inside.

722
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:50,358
- Look over there.
It's our four retards.

723
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:56,330
- The cops are gonna
catch us for sure.

724
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:01,535
- Oh yeah?

725
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:05,573
Let's call Principal Leigh and
leave an anonymous message.

726
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:07,642
Hello?

727
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,677
Principal Leigh por favor.

728
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,846
I just happened to be
passing by the liquor store

729
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,215
on the corner of
Vance Jackson and 410

730
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:16,751
and I noticed it looks
like four of your students

731
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,987
are taking advantage
of senior skip day.

732
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:23,791
I always say maneat in
schola, stay in school.

733
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:28,796
- Guys, we're gonna
get in huge trouble.

734
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:31,599
My dad once got arrested for
doing something like this.

735
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,834
- What are you kids
doing in my store?

736
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,069
- Uh, looking.

737
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,439
- What the hell do you want?

738
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:42,376
- Oh, we would like
to to buy your-

739
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,878
- Speak up!

740
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:46,681
- We would like to buy your
cheapest pinto of vodka please!

741
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:49,817
- Pint of our cheapest
vodka? That's it?

742
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,126
Is that it?

743
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,796
- Yep. That's the one.

744
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:05,032
- Do you want to taste
it first?

745
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,400
- Mm-mm.

746
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,838
- Are you girls old enough?

747
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,843
I don't believe you!

748
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,312
Let me see your ID.

749
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:19,280
- Show her the ID, Jennifer.

750
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,148
- Yes, the ID.

751
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:24,185
Ah, the ID that I
have in my pocket.

752
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:25,953
Yep.

753
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:26,854
- Jennifer, the ID.

754
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:29,156
- Yeah, okay, I'm getting it.

755
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,524
Oh, here it is.

756
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,938
- Hm.

757
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,943
Get outta here before
I call the cops on you!

758
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,088
- Oh, no.

759
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,964
- Surprise!

760
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:15,002
I just got an anonymous phone
call that you all were here.

761
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:17,171
You're in a lot of trouble.

762
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,940
You're gonna spend the
rest of the day in ISS.

763
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:22,877
Oh, that's in school
suspension for skippers,

764
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,545
because you're a skipper,
you're a skipper,

765
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,881
you're a skipper, and you,

766
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:30,684
you're on your way
outta here, so let's go!

767
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:34,822
- If you have a contraband,

768
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,892
I want you to leave
it right here.

769
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:45,599

- Only this much.

792
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,986

793
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:13,854
- No.

794

795
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:22,229
- It's nice, I guess.

796
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:34,175
- Excuse me, sir.

797
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,176
- Yes?

798
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,278
- May I please use the restroom?

799
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:41,949
- Okay. Just make sure you
take a hall pass with you.

800
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,285
- Me too? Lady problems.

801
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,387
- Oh, okay. Then proceed.

802
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,765
You, too, I bet.

803
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,471
And let me guess. I bet you too.

804
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:07,808
- Yup.

805
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:14,081
- Ladies, just make sure you
come back after you're done.

806
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:30,699
- I can't wait to graduate
and get to go to college.

807
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:33,702
Don't your parents
get on your nerves?

808
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,202
- Not really.

809
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:37,304
My parents don't
really care about me.

810
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:40,274
- I'm so excited to get to
go and live in a dorm room

811
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,910
and finally be by
myself for once.

812
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,111
- You've got it lucky, Bren.

813
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:46,046
My mom is a monster.

814
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,849
- Would you say that
your home life sucks?

815
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:51,151
- It doesn't suck. It's just
something I don't want to do.

816
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,954
- My home life is awesome.

817
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:55,923
My dad cooks for me every night

818
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:58,727
and takes me exotic places
around the world, so.

819
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:02,597
- Come on.

820
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,738
Can I tell you guys something?

821
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,572
- Sure.

822
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:16,043
- I don't really know what's
gonna happen after today.

823
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,579
- What do you mean?

824
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:24,552
- You wanna know the real reason
why I skipped school today?

825
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:32,126
I found out today that my
parents are getting divorced.

826
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,097
- Bren, I'm so sorry.

827
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:42,169
- I don't even know where I'm
gonna finish out the year.

828
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,871
My dad wants me to
move out with him,

829
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:47,141
and my mom wants me
to stay here with her.

830
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,577
What do they expect me to say?

831
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:52,946
It's like my last normal day

832
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,882
hanging out with my
friends, you know?

833
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,785
- I know how you feel.

834
00:46:56,817 --> 00:47:01,255
My parents don't really
care about me either.

835
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:02,590
- You're a brat!

836
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:04,458
You have it so good, and
you don't even know it!

837
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,593
- Hey!

838
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:07,227
- I can't even breathe

839
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:10,130
without my mom telling me
how I'm doing it wrong.

840
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:13,100
The other day I had an
eyelash out of place,

841
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,704
and she practically
slapped me to fix it.

842
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:18,606
And then she took me to an
audition the next morning,

843
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,974
because she said
I was getting fat.

844
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,744
She says it's for my own good,

845
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:24,679
but I just wanna
be a normal girl.

846
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:25,714
- Screw you!

847
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,983
Every girl in this
school wants to be you,

848
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:33,354
and every boy wants
to be with you!

849
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,189
- You know what? She's right.

850
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,825
I wish I were you.

851
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:39,259
At least your mom
cares about you.

852
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,161
My parents are just
rich and don't care.

853
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,364
- But you're so cool.

854
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:44,632
- I think I just get what I want

855
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:47,134
because I've been doing
this my whole life.

856
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:49,336
I've tried getting into trouble.

857
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,972
I've tried being the good girl.

858
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,808
Nothing's good enough for them.

859
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,677
They just don't care.

860
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,012
- Well, my dad has all
the money in the world,

861
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,716
so he travels with
me everywhere.

862
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:08,556
- You're such a liar, Jennifer.

863
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,058
I've known you since
the second grade,

864
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:14,529
and I've never
even seen your dad.

865
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:17,231
Does he even pick
you up from school?

866
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:18,298
- Hang on.

867
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:22,169
Why did you even
skip school today?

868
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,173
- You really wanna know?

869
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,709
- No lies.

870
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:29,076
- No lies?

871
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,944
- Tell me the truth.

872
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:36,316
- I skipped school because
I had nothing better to do.

873
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,788
I mean, do I look
like I have friends?

874
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,321
People are scared of me.

875
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:44,925
Nobody wants to hang
out with a punk rocker.

876
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:47,928
I don't look like them.

877
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:49,430
I don't wear the
same clothes as them.

878
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:51,265
I don't act like them.

879
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:56,671
You know what my dad
actually does for a living?

880
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,205
- What?

881
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:02,443
- He's a janitor at John
H. Bueller High School.

882
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:05,112
- Why did you lie about him
taking you to all these places?

883
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,214
- You wanna know why?

884
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:10,852
My dad wanted to
play pro football,

885
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:12,921
and then he found
out I was on the way,

886
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:15,022
and it was a huge
surprise for him,

887
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:17,090
and he was gonna be
the proud dad of a son

888
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,927
like he always wanted.

889
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:22,664
But he didn't have a son.

890
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:25,432
He had a little girl.

891
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,487
I hate myself.

892
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:08,308
- Well I think
you're pretty cool.

893
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,812
- Yeah.

894
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:13,313
- You're actually really funny.

895
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,652
- Thanks.

896
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,486
This is all so stupid.

897
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:21,856
I know it's not gonna matter

898
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,491
once I leave this stupid school.

899
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,962
So what about you?

900
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:34,501
- Well, I guess I've
had it pretty easy.

901
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:40,340
Wanna know something?

902
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:45,713
I've never even been kissed.

903
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:53,955
Bren, you're so cool and
independent that I admire you.

904
00:50:57,592 --> 00:51:00,828
You're like a big
sister to me, family.

905
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,398
And Darla, you're so pretty,

906
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,667
but not just because
of your looks

907
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,502
but because of who
you are inside.

908
00:51:10,505 --> 00:51:13,741
And Jennifer, I really
like your stories.

909
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:16,911
I totally believe that
you went to Mount Everest

910
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:20,347
and you got your jacket
from Justin Bieber,

911
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,349
and maybe your dad is a rich man

912
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:25,820
who takes you to exotic places.

913
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:26,621
- Thanks.

914
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:30,558
So what about you?

915
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:34,394
Why did you skip today?

916
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:40,902
Because I just wanted to get
a boyfriend before I graduate.

917
00:51:43,638 --> 00:51:48,076
- Speaking of which, we've gotta
get you to that last party.

918
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,511
If only we could get
past the ISS teacher.

919
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,617
- What's so funny?

920
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,219
- I gave him those
sleepy time gummy bears.

921
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:01,388
He ate the whole bottle.

922
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:03,457
He's not waking up
till tomorrow morning.

923
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,486
- Come on, guys,
let's go to my house.

924
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:09,724
We need change for
that college party.

925
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,977
- What are we gonna do about
the alcohol we need to bring?

926
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:33,981
- We're gonna have to go
with this. I hope it works.

927
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:11,866
- Whoa.

928
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:13,668
Hi!

929
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:14,835
Alayna, you look great.

930
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,570
- Thank you, Skip.

931
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:17,939
You don't look so bad yourself.

932
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:19,073
- Oh.

933
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:21,075
- We brought the
bottle of vodka.

934
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,410
- Oh, sweet.

935
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,744
Yeah, my sister will be
super happy about that.

936
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:24,946
Come in, please.

937
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:31,986
So where are you going
to college next year?

938
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,921
- Hopefully South Texas State.

939
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:36,290
- Oh, I hear they have
really cool sororities there.

940
00:57:36,324 --> 00:57:40,161
I hope to join a fraternity
when I get into college.

941
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,129
You know, you're really cool.

942
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:44,765
I'm really glad I got
to formally meet you.

943
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,599
- Thanks.

944
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:50,805
So, you're coming to my
choir recital tonight, right?

945
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:51,639
- Yeah.

946
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,243
- All right, ladies.
You ready for this?

947
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:57,278
- Yes.
- Yes.

948
00:57:58,679 --> 00:57:59,680
- Thank you.

949
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:00,881
- Mm-hm.

950
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:04,585
- Hey. Oh.

951
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,422
- Hey, loser.

952
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:12,326
What are you doing here?
And where's my trophy?

953
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,995
- In a safe place.

954
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,531
- All right, ladies,
let's drink up

955
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:19,934
before we kick this moron's ass.

956
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:21,402
- I really don't think
you should drink-

957
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:22,970
- Shut up, loser!

958
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:28,442
- You do know that's
toilet water, right?

959
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:32,747
- What the hell?

960
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,985
- You little shit!

961
00:58:46,861 --> 00:58:47,628
- Hello?

962
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:49,764
- Alayna? It's Kara.

963
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,098
Where are you?

964
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,967
The concert's going to
start in like 30 minutes,

965
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,970
a and Leslie's been looking
for you to do some warmups

966
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:57,805
and go over a plan.

967
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:59,006
- I'm going to be there soon,

968
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,241
but I'm in the middle
of something right now.

969
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,976
- What are you talking about?

970
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:04,078
This is the biggest
concert of the year.

971
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:06,013
There's gonna be recruiters
from all the colleges.

972
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:07,415
- I know.

973
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:09,050
- This is the moment
you've been waiting for,

974
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,385
the time for you to
show off your new song.

975
00:59:11,419 --> 00:59:12,720
- Okay, well what time's my cue?

976
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:14,121
I'm gonna try to
be there in time.

977
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:15,489
- 7:45.

978
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:18,059
- Okay, I'll see you soon.

979
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:20,861
I need to kick
someone's ass right now.

980
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,537
- Stop it, Italy.

981
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:32,239
- Italy, what do you want?

982
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:34,742
- You know what I want. I
want my trophy you stole.

983
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:36,811
- Uh, no, you stole it first.

984
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:37,845
I'm just returning it.

985
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,848
- So what if I stole
it? I deserve it anyway.

986
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,716
And you girls should have
never taken it for me.

987
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,352
- Nobody cares about
your stupid trophy.

988
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:48,055
I'm sick and tired of you
messing with me and my friends,

989
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:51,092
and this is gonna be
the last time you do.

990
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,060
Senior year is about to be over,

991
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:56,063
and you losers think
you can beat me?

992
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:58,533
- We don't need someone
in my life like you.

993
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,469
- Hey, stop it.

994
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:04,638
- What are you gonna do, choir
nerd, sing me a little song?

995
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:55,322
- Alayna!

- Okay, I'm gonna
go up on the stage.

1004
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:46,173
You guys go sit in the audience.

1005
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:54,982

01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:57,251
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1007
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,056
- Can you plug my
phone in and play this track?

1008
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:04,024
- Thank you so
much for coming out

1009
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:05,993
to our program this evening.

1010
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,127
We all worked really hard.

1011
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:09,564
We have such talent
in our school.

1012
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:12,366
- Principal Leigh!

1013
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:13,801
Principal Leigh!

1014
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:26,146
Principal Leigh, I...

1015
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:36,725
I have the trophy that
Italy stole from you.

1016
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:39,460
- Well, why, thank
you, Jennifer.

1017
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:43,264
This is one of
our best students.

1018
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:46,400
She's so good and
she helps everyone.

1019
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,970
And thank you, Jennifer,

1020
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:52,373
for bringing back the
cheerleader trophy.

1021
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:54,709
- And you're
gonna graduate me this year.

1022
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:55,710
- No.

1023
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:57,244
- One good thing.

1024
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:01,115
- And she'll be
graduating this year.

1025
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:10,659
- There she is!

1026
01:03:10,692 --> 01:03:13,360
That's the one who sold
the trophy! Not me, her!

1027
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:14,261
- Of course I did!

1028
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:16,397
It's my trophy! I earned it!

1029
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,132
- Italy, I'd like to
have a word with you

1030
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:19,400
and your two friends.

1031
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,569
- Oh no.

1032
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,314
- Hi, everyone.

1033
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:37,619
My name is Alayna,
and I am a choir nerd.

1034
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:39,386
I skipped school today,

1035
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,090
and I learned a lot of
things with my three friends.

1036
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:44,325
You know when you
don't really know

1037
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:45,959
what the future will look like,

1038
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:48,829
but you kind of know that
everything's gonna be fine?

1039
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:52,266
Well, today was
one of those days.

1040
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:54,134
- I was supposed to
sing my final song

1041
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:57,137
for the recital tonight,
because this is my senior year.

1042
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:59,239
But you know what?

1043
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:02,176
It is not the end
of our senior year.

1044
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:03,944
It's the beginning of a new year

1045
01:04:03,977 --> 01:04:07,782
for all of my new friends,
old, near, and far.

1046
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:14,188
And I wanna dedicate this
song to my three best friends.

1047
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:18,526
Thanks for being with me
today. I had an awesome time.

1048
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,360
And now...

1049
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:26,300
they are going to sing with me.

1050
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:30,237
- We'll do our best.

1051
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:33,374
- I learned a ton
of new stuff today.

1052
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:35,510
Just because you're the
prettiest girl in school

1053
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:38,212
does not mean you don't
have insecurities.

1054
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:41,482
And even the toughest
girls have problems.

1055
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:45,919
And even the weirdest out
of all of us have a heart.

1056
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:48,155
- Hit it, Kara.

1057

1099

wanna be like you.

I just want to be a simple
girl with simple problems.

Just let me dress how I want to.

make you so proud, I promise.

We'll work on it, baby.

you, little buddy.

1110
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,502
We had a lot of fun
today, didn't we?

1111
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:31,506
Did you like how
I sang up there?

1112
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:36,476
- I sure did, honey.

1113
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:40,548
- Dad!

1114
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,117
- Is that your trophy?

1115
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:47,655
- No, but I did steal it
from some evil cheerleaders.

1116
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,123
- That's a good looking trophy.

1117
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:50,725
Oh!

1118
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:56,396
Well, let's get you home.

1119
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:58,666
I think I'll make you
chicken on a stick.

1120
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,536
- Chicken on a stick!

1121
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:09,276
- Well, world, whatever
life you have ahead of me,

1122
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:10,078
I'm ready.

1123
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,549
- Can you give us a minute?

1124
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:16,249
- Yeah.

1125
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:19,319
- See? Today wasn't
so bad after all.

1126
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:22,590
- Yeah, it was awesome!
And it's all thanks to you.

no matter what school I go to?

1129
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:29,731
- Okay, I have to go
get the other girls.

1130
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:31,733
But go get your guy.

1131
01:10:40,742 --> 01:10:42,577
- You really made my day today.

1132
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:44,311
- No, you made mine.

1133
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,647

cool this day turned out.

1134

1159
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:53,207

gonna call it time please.

1160
01:12:57,912 --> 01:12:58,880

1161
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:01,716
Me as too.

01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:02,984
What did you say?

1163
01:13:03,017 --> 01:13:04,719
- I don't know what
I said.

1164
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:07,188
I was gonna say, "Me as well,"
but then I said, "Me too,"

1165
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:08,322
and I was like, "Me as too."

1166
01:13:08,356 --> 01:13:09,824
- Step back.

1167
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:11,826
- She's always on
Snapchat.

1168
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:13,294
- No, I had something to do!

1169
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:15,863
And I'm not gonna fight
with you right now!

1170
01:13:15,897 --> 01:13:17,732
- I'm gonna pretend we're not.

1171
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,033
- This girl.

1172
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,334
- What?

1173
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:21,569
This isn't enough to
get us into the party?

1174
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:23,304
- No, Jennifer.

1175
01:13:29,577 --> 01:13:31,178
- Jennifer.

1176
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:33,080
- Guys,
hold on, wait for me.

1177
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,048
- Ha ha ha ha.

1178
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:39,720

1179
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:40,855
Oh, oh.

1180
01:13:40,888 --> 01:13:42,690
- Okay, go.

1181
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:44,091
- No, it's just that
they let teenagers

1182
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:46,694
into the liquor store because
they sell chips and soda.

1183
01:13:46,727 --> 01:13:48,461
Let's go check it out.

1184
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,164
- Okay.
Looks good, right?

1185
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:51,599
- Yes!

1186
01:13:51,632 --> 01:13:52,566
I got the line!

1187
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,110
- What are you kids
doing in my store?

1188
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:04,745
- Okay, one more.

1189
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,913
- I'm just on the apple.
Do you want me to crouch?

1190
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:17,457
- Sorry.

1191
01:14:21,494 --> 01:14:23,531
- How'd you do it?

1192
01:14:23,564 --> 01:14:25,766
- As you can see here, Bill,

1193
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,135
it's kinda coming down out here.

1194
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:29,737
I don't know when
it's gonna stop,

1195
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,939
but it should be.

1196
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:32,807
- Help!

1197
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:39,647
It's so windy out here.

1198
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,782
It's like we're in
Australia something,

1199
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:42,750
where it's really windy.

1200
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:44,752
- Australia?
- It's crazy.

1201
01:14:50,524 --> 01:14:51,425
- Reset.

1202
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:53,594
- Such a doll face, that Gabby.

1203
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,830
She's so silly sometimes.

1204
01:14:55,863 --> 01:14:59,633
- So I'll just kind of turn
around and notice that, Kellyn.

1205
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,002
- She's just being silly.

1206
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:02,670
I look like you're
about to look back.

1207
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:04,805
You're gonna look at her.

1208
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,608
- No more saying
cuss words, guys!

1209
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:08,709
- It's rude.

1210
01:15:08,743 --> 01:15:10,111
- It's
inappropriate and rude.

1211
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:11,445
- No, no, no.

1212
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:13,748
- No more saying cuss words!

1213
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,915
It's inappropriate and rude.

1214
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:17,551
- It's inappropriate and rude.

1215
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:24,892
- I skipped school today,

1216
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:27,995
and I learned a lot
of things from my...

1217
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:30,564
I skipped school today and...

1218
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:40,741
Better?

1219
01:15:45,046 --> 01:15:46,814
I trust you.

1220
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,315
- Good.
Let's roll it.

1221
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,150
- Hit it.

1222
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,076
Hi!

1223
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:24,218
- Look at them go.

1224
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,387
- I was
gonna say sorry.

1225
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:31,759
- One more
time. Ready. and action.

1226
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:35,196
- I think my mom has booze in
her liquor bar at my house.

1227
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:36,697
- Darla's house we go.

1228
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:37,566
- One more time.

1229
01:16:39,568 --> 01:16:42,203
- I think my mom has booze...

1230
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:44,138
Let me do that again.

1231
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:51,011
So for the part at the end

1232
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:52,746
where she's doing some new...

1233
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,781
- Pretty easy too,

1234
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:55,950
so you have enough breathing.

1235
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:57,384
- I know.

1236
01:16:57,418 --> 01:16:59,120
- Sorry, guys, the
college party's at 2:00 p.m.

1237
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,021
- Oh, sorry.

1238
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,291
- Guys, the
college party's at-

1239
01:17:04,325 --> 01:17:07,094
- Oh, I forgot to
open the fricking lid.

1240
01:17:07,128 --> 01:17:08,762
- Hey, stop it.

1241
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:11,198
- What are you gonna
do, choir nerd?

1242
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:11,966
sing me a little song?

1243
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:15,069
I messed up.

1244
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:34,655
Oh yeah?

1245
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:36,824
Let's call Principal Leigh
and leave a unanimous message.

1246
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:38,392
- What?
- An anonymous message.

1247
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,996
- Okay, let's
do that one more time.

1248
01:17:48,637 --> 01:17:50,171
- Wow, that was a close call.

1249
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:52,940
- Scene 20
alpha, take one, marker.

1250
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:58,145
- Oh, no, you're good.
- Aw.

1251
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:05,753
- Keep a beat on dialogue.

1252
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:58,707
- How was that?

1253
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:09,718
- Yeah!

1254
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:18,359
- If you are in the
Bitters Road area,

1255
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:21,730
then maybe you saw us filming.

1256
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:57,431
- You all understand
what's happening, right?

1257
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:58,465
- Yes.

1258
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:03,404
- We're good, we're good.
We're ready to do it.

1259
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:17,284
- Thanks For
watching Skip Day!
