1
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,826
Sirs? May I greets from your hello?

2
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,159
Hello.

3
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,462
- Where's the doctor in charge?
- Doctor?

4
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,662
Dr. Aziz.

5
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,234
Doctor. Where is he?

6
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,599
Doctor! Yes! To be certain, I take you.

7
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,249
Doctor.

8
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,233
It's okay.

9
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,635
Why this happen?

10
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,603
You doctor! How you don't know?

11
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,098
What did she die of?

12
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,094
Pneumocystis Pneumonia.

13
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:23,173
That's only seen when
the immune system fails.

14
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,243
What was the major disease?

15
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,374
That's all she had.

16
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,441
That's not possible.

17
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,928
When he got here, he only had
pneumocystis, no major illness.

18
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,734
Now he's developed...

19
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,102
...fungus in the mouth...
warts on his arms...

20
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,009
...and more on his legs.

21
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,716
...and his brain is rotting with
Toxoplasmosis, a cat disease.

22
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,123
Two months before
its nominating convention...

23
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,757
...the Democratic Party began
preliminary work on its 1980 platform.

24
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,063
Fellow members
of the platform committee...

25
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:27,265
...I am Bill Kraus, liaison between
Congressman Phillip Burton...

26
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,503
...and the gay community of San Francisco.

27
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,278
The gay rights plank
I'm asking to be included...

28
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,108
...does not ask for special privileges.

29
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,049
It does not ask anyone to like us.

30
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,848
It doesn't even ask
that the Democratic Party give us...

31
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:46,858
...many of the legal protections which are
considered the right of all other Americans.

32
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,285
What this amendment asks...

33
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:54,630
...is that the Democratic Party recognize
that we, the gay people of this country...

34
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,462
...are also human.

35
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,710
Thank you.

36
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,485
Thank you very much.

37
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,627
- How you feeling?
- Tired.

38
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,325
I'll be back.

39
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,064
- Doctor?
- No, not now.

40
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,540
Here we are.

41
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,116
What is his T... cell count?

42
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,176
I gotta tell you, Dr. Gottlieb, this is weird.

43
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,620
- What?
- He doesn't have any.

44
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,917
- How can he not have any T cells?
- His immune system's gone.

45
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,504
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dr. Guinan.

46
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,208
Jim? Can I talk to you for a minute?

47
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,820
I got this in the mail from Dr. Shendera
in LA, who got it from a Dr. Gottlieb.

48
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,790
I think you oughta look at it right away.

49
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,667
It looks like there's a weird epidemic
breaking out among gay men in LA.

50
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,900
There've been five cases of pneumocystis...

51
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,909
...with no contributing disease
within the past few months...

52
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,569
...and already two fatalities.

53
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,635
Hot stuff.

54
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,505
Plus, I've called New York
and San Francisco...

55
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,448
...and they've had similar cases.

56
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,519
I think this oughta go into
the weekly newsletter as soon as possible.

57
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,796
- Why did you do that?
- I don't decide what is published.

58
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,834
I can only recommend,
but we've got a new administration.

59
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,462
You wanna see this published
so people can read it...

60
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,802
...or do you wanna see it killed?

61
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,931
Thanks.

62
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,754
- Don? Is that you?
- Hey, Mary!

63
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,961
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. Nice to see you.

64
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,868
- How long has it been?
- Smallpox in India.

65
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,336
Come on, join us.

66
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,940
How long do you plan on doing that?

67
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,310
Till I get my peanut butter cookies.

68
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,964
Guys, I'd like you to meet Don Francis.

69
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,532
We're just doing a little demonstration...

70
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,435
...of the benefits
of a sound knowledge of applied science.

71
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,474
Hi. Harold Jaffe,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases.

72
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,905
Hi. Bill Darrow, Sociology.

73
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,174
You didn't shake Harold's hand, did you?

74
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,508
Hi! Thanks for coming.
Did you meet everybody?

75
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,883
- How's Phoenix?
- Warm.

76
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,549
Don't we have a meeting at 3:00?
What's everybody doing here?

77
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,388
Tryin' to have lunch in four minutes,
like you.

78
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,990
If one of those is peanut butter cookies,
that is mine.

79
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,426
Let's go.

80
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,733
Dale Lawrence, Division of Host Factors.

81
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,733
What we've got in LA,
San Francisco and New York...

82
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,506
...is a number of gay men who've been hit
with a variety of opportunistic infections...

83
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,205
...and that's all we know.

84
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,113
I asked Don to join us
because for the last three years...

85
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,651
...he's been tracking
hepatitis B virus in gay men.

86
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,519
And before that worked on
the Ebola fever epidemic in Africa.

87
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,281
Thanks for joining us.

88
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,519
We've gotta hit the phones
and spread out...

89
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,324
...contact the health departments
in all major metropolitan areas as usual...

90
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,230
...so they can do a hospital... to... hospital
search for cases.

91
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,995
Basic epidemiology.

92
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,698
We've got to talk to the patients,
their doctors and friends, relatives.

93
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,233
- No question too stupid or too personal.
- Sexual relationships, too?

94
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,547
- Lifestyle stuff.
- Household chemical, cleaning...

95
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,603
Diet.

96
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,912
- Could be a bad batch of street drugs.
- Pets.

97
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,578
Maybe they all get
the same kind of Kitty Litter.

98
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,987
I'm going to New York today
to take a look at this disease.

99
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,922
- Can you come with me?
- Sure.

100
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,692
If I knew these blotches
would turn purple...

101
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,325
...I'd have bought some bags to match.

102
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,994
Here, look at my book.
When I was still human.

103
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,909
I was the best in the business.
Ask anybody.

104
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,949
Leave it to me to get some disease
nobody ever heard of.

105
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,950
Kaposi's sarcoma.

106
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,552
Even my doctor had to look it up.

107
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,618
"Nothing to worry about," he said.

108
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,382
"Usually happens
to Italian men in their sixties...

109
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:26,228
"...who continue to live a normal life
until they die of something else."

110
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,866
Do I look like an Italian man in my sixties?

111
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,598
Now I do:

112
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,162
160.

113
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,946
Why do they make things like this
that nobody can ever solve?

114
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,012
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

115
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,815
- Hello?
- Would you like me to come back?

116
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,591
Can I help you?

117
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,321
I'm from the CDC,
the Centers for Disease Control.

118
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,229
Are you one of the interviews
that Dr. Freedman... Kien set up for me?

119
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,895
I'm sorry,
I'm just having a little spot looked at.

120
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,736
Gaetan Dugas, Dr. Mary Guinan.

121
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,242
If you have a few minutes,
it'd be helpful if you talk to Dr. Guinan.

122
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,306
I'm sorry, but I'm barely going to
make my plane as it is, if I'm lucky.

123
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,985
I'm a flight attendant.

124
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,079
Could you answer a few questions
while you're getting dressed?

125
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,082
What kind of questions?

126
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,154
I assume from what your doctor told me
that you're gay.

127
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,885
Also homosexual.

128
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,295
And how long have you been having
sex with men?

129
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,434
About 10 years, I guess, openly.

130
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:48,646
Could you roughly approximate how many
sexual encounters you have in one year?

131
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,238
In a year?

132
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,475
- You're serious?
- Yes.

133
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,919
- I don't know.
- Roughly.

134
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,455
About...

135
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,094
...250.

136
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,991
250.

137
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,194
Actually, now that I think a bit,
that is a very conservative estimate.

138
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,770
- And of these partners, how many...
- I'm sorry.

139
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,106
I would love to chat forever
about my sex life. And we could.

140
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,938
If I don't leave this minute,
I'm going to miss my plane.

141
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,207
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

142
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,343
- Doctor, I'll call you next month.
- Fine.

143
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,477
All right.

144
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,623
- I look okay?
- Great!

145
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,750
- Of course I do. Thank you.
- Thank you.

146
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,590
- Doctor! Bye... bye!
- Bye!

147
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,223
- Do you have many gay friends?
- Not too many.

148
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,999
Two doctors I stay in touch with
from school.

149
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,404
- Are they a couple?
- Yeah, actually, 15 years at least.

150
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,306
Kico and I, Kico's my lover...

151
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:55,143
...we've got a wide circle of friends
and most of them are in relationships.

152
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,681
Or want to be in a relationship.

153
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,276
- So what are you saying?
- Lots of men go to these bathhouses.

154
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,311
But there are thousands of gay men in this
city, maybe a couple hundred thousand.

155
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,384
They're just cops and waiters and teachers
and lawyers and ditch diggers and athletes.

156
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,196
Talk a little louder,
they can't hear you down the block.

157
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,165
I'm sorry, I don't mean to lecture.

158
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,032
I just don't want you to come away
from the bathhouses...

159
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,162
...thinking that's how all gay men live.

160
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,570
Last night we lost another one.

161
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,670
In less than three weeks, this handsome
young guy turns into the Elephant Man.

162
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:32,149
Which we found out was caused
by some rare parasite that only sheep get!

163
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:37,388
So I called a vet,
to ask what they do when sheep get it.

164
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,815
They shoot them.

165
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,654
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

166
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,889
Bye.

167
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,831
Hi. Selma Dritz,
Department of Public Health.

168
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,997
- We're here to inspect the premises.
- I'll try to find the boss.

169
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,267
Thanks.

170
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,349
Those two guys there, strangers?

171
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,619
Maybe. Probably.

172
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,286
They just met,
and now they're gonna go in the...

173
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,689
Right.

174
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,855
It's interesting.

175
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,126
Listen to me.

176
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,930
Imagine yourself in a place like this...

177
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,736
...only it's filled with women,
really beautiful women.

178
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,176
Imagine one of those Penthouse women
wants to go in that room with you.

179
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,303
There's nothing between you but a towel.

180
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,371
You're telling me you wouldn't go
in that little room...

181
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,782
...and seriously consider dropping
that little towel?

182
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,247
- Possibly, yeah.
- Yeah.

183
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,988
I know men who would give up food for it.

184
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,188
- Hi, Eddie.
- Darling, how are you?

185
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,249
Good.

186
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,065
Eddie Papasano, Dr. Harold Jaffe
from the Centers for Disease Control.

187
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,226
Hi. What's the problem?

188
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,904
There may be an epidemic
spreading in the gay community.

189
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,271
And I'd like to just come in
and have a look around.

190
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,736
That's impossible. We must protect
the confidentiality of our clients.

191
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,909
I know, but you know I speak on behalf
of the Gay Liberation Committee...

192
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,785
...the City Council, the State Assembly.

193
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,185
I can tell you
without fear of contradiction...

194
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,690
...you are regarded
second only to Abe Lincoln...

195
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,717
...as a citizen who would fight to the death
to preserve civil liberties.

196
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,754
So let's cut the crap.
It's 10:00 in the morning, for God's sake!

197
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,959
Let us in.

198
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,692
- Only for you.
- Thank you.

199
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,168
You're a real mensch.

200
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,073
- How many men come here a night?
- Hundreds, every night of the week.

201
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,771
Some bathhouses, more than a thousand.

202
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,352
- What's this?
- Poppers: They're a quick, cheap high.

203
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,692
What are you doing here?

204
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,732
What are you doing here?

205
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,599
God, my wife is gonna kill me.

206
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,469
Did you get the results
on the amyl nitrite study?

207
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,134
Yeah, you can forget about poppers.
We ran every test there is.

208
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,341
The worst that happened was
two mice danced with a rubber glove.

209
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,708
Go home.

210
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,848
So far, not one TV station
has even mentioned it.

211
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,086
Not one word
in the straight press, nothing!

212
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,388
The number of patients
I'm treating for it is growing so fast...

213
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,864
...I don't even wanna think about it.

214
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,834
What's happening in Washington?
Do they even know it exists?

215
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,996
If they do, they don't discuss it.

216
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,597
- When do you go back to D.C.?
- Tomorrow.

217
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,405
That's the first thing we deal with.
You have to make people aware of it.

218
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,073
How? The media all say the same thing,
there's no story.

219
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,709
One journalist told me the only people
interested in gay men dying...

220
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,221
...are gay men and the ones
who wish they'd all die.

221
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,315
- I'm late for a meeting.
- Good luck.

222
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,824
If we don't get money for research,
and soon, a lot of it, God help everyone.

223
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,264
Okay.

224
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,901
- What is it?
- Nothing.

225
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,707
Can't you tell me?

226
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,484
Look, you have things to do...

227
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:34,150
...and they're very important things
and I can't tell you not to do them.

228
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,126
I guess I'd hate you if you didn't do them.

229
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:41,029
But I just want...
I just wish that we could... I want us...

230
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,958
All I want is a place where we...

231
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,630
This isn't...

232
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,273
I don't know what I want.

233
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,876
What do we think, what do we know,
what can we prove?

234
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,883
Zip.

235
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,943
- Only gays?
- Think, but can't prove.

236
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,214
- Only males?
- Think, but can't prove.

237
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,518
The semen depositors.

238
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,960
If it's in the semen, unless there's
something unusual about this disease...

239
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,193
...it shouldn't make a difference whether
it's deposited in the anus or vagina...

240
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,997
...which could mean that women
will be getting it also.

241
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,095
You should focus on that point.

242
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,073
We know the immune system
stops functioning completely.

243
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,974
- In all cases?
- Know, but can't prove.

244
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,410
What we have here...

245
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,881
...Looks more like a sexually transmitted
disease than syphilis does.

246
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,281
Think or prove?

247
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,412
I can't prove that the sun isn't gonna
turn into a bran muffin next Tuesday...

248
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,957
...but after 20 years, I know what I know.

249
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,253
That's not what I'm...

250
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:46,059
It's pure supposition, but it's more than
strong enough to justify a definitive study.

251
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,428
I agree with Bill.

252
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,833
It's a single infectious agent with
a high probability of sexual transmission.

253
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,894
Well then, viral or bacterial?

254
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,271
If you skip "think" and "prove,"
I'd guess viral.

255
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,536
A guess, definitely.

256
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,305
Let's assume that it's a virus.

257
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,315
The question is, is it one that
we already know that has become lethal...

258
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,477
...or is this a brand... new virus
that we've never seen before?

259
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,179
Here's a little stat to chew on.

260
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:15,359
In seven months, the number of cases
jumped from 5 to 152 in 15 states.

261
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,449
Seven months?

262
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,589
Yeah, but the spooky part is that so far
the mortality rate has been 40 percent.

263
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,654
40 percent?

264
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,361
And doctors taking care
of these patients say...

265
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,371
...the mortality rate could turn out
to be 100 percent.

266
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,168
100 percent.

267
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,904
My God!

268
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,589
Let's set up a case control study based on
the premise that it's sexually transmitted.

269
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:50,185
We want you to set up a lab here, run it
and handle the causative end of this study.

270
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,528
If it's a bug, find it! I've been authorized
to have a task force for three months.

271
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,932
If this disease is like any of the others,
it should be enough time.

272
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,996
And, of course, no money,
so we'll have to moonlight this epidemic.

273
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,167
Which means, I can't guarantee you
a staff or equipment...

274
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,232
Trust him.

275
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,745
...until I juggle the budget around
a little bit.

276
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,783
- You gonna show him the lab?
- You wanna see it right now?

277
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,013
- I think you should.
- Sure. Come on down.

278
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,514
- You have a flashlight?
- It's not that bad.

279
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,080
One of those miner's things
with a little light...

280
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,926
It's the only space we have left,
so it's gonna look a little hopeless.

281
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,395
- Only because it is.
- No comment.

282
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,061
Actually, it's bigger than it looks.

283
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,529
Tom Spira, Paul Florino. Don Francis.

284
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,067
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

285
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,240
What is this?

286
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,211
- An incubator from the Smithsonian?
- You know it too well.

287
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,807
Where is the CO2 attachment?

288
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,581
We had to put the CO2 tanks
in the next room...

289
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,681
...because we couldn't get approval
for a real CO2 incubator.

290
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,022
Hopeless I can live with,
but this is ridiculous.

291
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,264
Look, stick around here.
I might be coming right out.

292
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,016
- Dr. Mary Guinan, please.
- Your name?

293
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,581
I'm a friend of Dr. Conant's.

294
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,057
Your name.

295
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,655
You can tell him.

296
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,800
He has no idea who you are
and we'll pretend we never heard of you.

297
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,138
- You guys ahead of me?
- You go ahead.

298
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,371
We've got nothin' to do
except go to a Halloween party.

299
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,971
And you're in rehearsal, I know.

300
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,548
It's tres gauche to fawn,
but I happen to think you're a genius.

301
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,144
I mean, a double genius,
as a director and a choreographer.

302
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,923
Is that you?

303
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,158
Bobbi Campbell, self... appointed
K.S. Poster boy.

304
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,759
You look surprised.

305
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,864
No, I'm not.

306
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,970
Curious, maybe.

307
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,406
If the gay community doesn't raise hell...

308
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,912
...do you think Reagan's gonna do
a damn thing?

309
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,943
I wish I had your courage.

310
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,643
Courage? No.

311
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,118
I'm scared to death.

312
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,058
I just have
this absurd determination to live.

313
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,722
Don't you?

314
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,503
It's open.

315
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,309
- Dr. Guinan?
- Yes.

316
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,713
I'll tell you, I expected the neighborhood,
the hotel, this room even...

317
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:40,690
...but I think it would take Fellini to cast
such a beautiful woman in a sweat suit...

318
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:45,456
...as the doctor I'm supposed to reveal
my most intimate sexual eccentricities to.

319
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,289
- Hello.
- Hi.

320
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,457
I'm Mary Guinan.

321
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,364
The reason for the sweat suit is...

322
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:55,065
...somebody stole all the clothing I brought
with me from the laundromat this morning.

323
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,671
Would you mind signing
these two consent forms?

324
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,315
One is for the questionnaire and one
is for the specimens I need to collect.

325
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,811
Which specimens?

326
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,385
Blood, urine, a swab from your mouth
and another from your rectum.

327
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:15,088
In this study, some have the disease,
and some, like you, have no symptoms.

328
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,964
I really don't mind
if you know all this about me...

329
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,498
...I'm just not too sure that I want to know.

330
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,110
Is there a name yet for this disease?

331
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,443
The gay press calls it
gay pneumonia or gay cancer.

332
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,508
And the straight press
doesn't mention it at all.

333
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,994
I was hung up in traffic coming over here.

334
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,471
The Gay Halloween Parade was on.
Have you seen it?

335
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,574
I didn't know they had one.

336
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,537
They do. It's really pretty amazing.

337
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,404
The party's over.

338
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,040
You scared me, sorry.

339
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,671
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

340
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,676
What is that?

341
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,619
It's today's figures.

342
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,914
No. "Butcher's..."

343
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,391
When Admiral Nelson
was fighting Napoleon...

344
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,396
...and wanted to know how many
people were dead, he'd yell:

345
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,058
"What's the butcher's bill for today?"

346
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,529
God.

347
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:44,466
We've injected Mary's samples into mice,
rabbits, guinea pigs and we'll try monkeys.

348
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:48,444
So far, we haven't found any evidence
of parasites, fungus or viruses. Nothing.

349
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,347
You mean, the case control study
yielded zilch?

350
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,052
Yes, all we know is that
the disease is caused...

351
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,249
...by some unknown organism
or organisms, which we can't see or find.

352
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,293
We don't know if it's a single agent
or a combination.

353
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,056
We don't know how it's transmitted.
We don't know...

354
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,390
Don't touch that!

355
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,665
Don't you know there's about
a million things in there that can kill you!

356
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,841
I'm sorry.

357
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,949
These two women for example...

358
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:35,822
Both dying from pneumocystis.
Ridiculous. Nobody dies from that.

359
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:42,199
Nineteen people died in 3 years.
Rich, poor, women, men.

360
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,359
French... African.

361
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:52,469
One can see this illness in
homosexuals, here and in the U.S.

362
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,380
Be right back.

363
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,253
Dr. Rozenbaum. Please sit down.

364
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,161
This is very embarrassing.

365
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,664
We're both humane men, yes?

366
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,500
But... people refer to us as...

367
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,473
"That hospital where
those people go."

368
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:35,177
I don't advertise. Doctors send them
because I reported it first.

369
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:43,023
Some of our "normal" patients
are afraid of coming here.

370
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:50,227
That puts us in a very difficult
position, do you understand?

371
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,936
Can I assume that's the end
of the matter?

372
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,174
No, it's the end
of the discussion.

373
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,839
The end of the matter is that
I'll find another hospital.

374
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:15,419
Politically, as far as the next election's
concerned, we're not dead, but in a coma.

375
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:20,426
For 20 years I've built that coalition
so solid, nobody could touch me.

376
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,262
The only group you can count on
to vote as a block...

377
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,997
...because it's literally life and death
for them now, is the gay vote.

378
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,403
San Francisco is the only city
in the world...

379
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,635
...where that group can
swing the election.

380
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,644
Without them,
you're the ex... godfather of San Francisco.

381
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
What do they want?

382
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,643
Disability insurance for GRID,
if they get it, for one thing.

383
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,984
Gay Related Immune Deficiency.

384
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,524
And money for research, that is crucial.

385
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,794
Nobody knows what's causing this thing.

386
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,663
I'll introduce a bill.

387
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,993
But if angels came dancing down
to Earth like the Rockettes...

388
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,007
...even they couldn't get a dime from this
administration with the name "gay" on it.

389
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,444
In New York today, President Reagan
asked voters in Little Italy...

390
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,778
...to support
his economic recovery program.

391
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,545
I've never seen so many calories lined up...

392
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,713
We have to turn the direction around
that we've been going...

393
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,420
...in order to end inflation,
end unemployment...

394
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,596
...and get this country back where
it should be in the eyes of the world.

395
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,425
But at year's end, there'll be less money...

396
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,560
...to spend for public health next year.

397
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,906
I'm sure there is one department
you've been waiting for me to mention:

398
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,476
The Department of Defense.

399
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,135
It's the only department
in our entire program...

400
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,115
...that will actually be increased
over the present budgeted figure.

401
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,158
I don't suppose you heard back...

402
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,825
...on the requisition I put in
for an electron microscope.

403
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,536
- How can I put this to you diplomatically...
- Not approved.

404
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,935
Not approved.

405
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,872
How am I supposed to run this lab
without the basic, fundamental...

406
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:18,108
Every month, I write a memo asking
where's the $196,000 I need to run this lab.

407
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,174
- I can't even get a yes or no.
- I'm tired. I'm gonna go home.

408
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:26,279
I'm gonna go to bed
and I suggest you do the same thing.

409
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,223
- Not approved.
- Dr. Curran?

410
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,557
- What is it?
- Jeff called.

411
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,598
There's an outbreak
among the Haitian population in Miami.

412
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,624
- How many?
- Four known dead.

413
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:42,036
But since most of them are hiding from
Immigration, there could be dozens more.

414
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,870
None of them were gay, just Haitians.

415
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,872
What do you mean "just Haitians"?

416
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,276
That's what he said to ask you.

417
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,342
Okay, thanks.

418
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,575
Just Haitians.

419
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,485
This disease doesn't make
any sense to me.

420
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,424
I don't get it. It's completely off the wall.

421
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,896
A doctor in the Bronx has just announced
that 11 newborn babies have got it.

422
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,925
And now Haitians.

423
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,926
It's not just a gay disease anymore.

424
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,965
The National Center for Disease Control...

425
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,567
...is reporting more cases
of two rare and deadly diseases...

426
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,544
...found in homosexual men.

427
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,638
There is no apparent explanation
for the outbreak.

428
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,444
Health officials are urgently looking
for an answer.

429
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,316
It appeared a year ago
in New York's gay community.

430
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,551
Then in the gay communities
of San Francisco and Los Angeles.

431
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,923
Now, its been detected
in Haitian refugees. No one knows why.

432
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,454
Specialists argue that millions of dollars
should be spent for research now.

433
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,000
Bobbi Campbell is fighting for his life.

434
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,162
One of a rapidly growing group
whose battle has fascinated...

435
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,136
...and frightened modern medicine.

436
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,107
He has Kaposi's sarcoma. ;

437
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,440
A skin cancer that first appeared
on the bottom of his feet...

438
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,537
...as spots the size of a quarter.

439
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,072
When I first came down with the disease,
I found this button...

440
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,849
...which absolutely reflected
my position at the time.

441
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,617
I may be down, but I'm not out.

442
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,585
...gay plague that's sweeping across
our country. Say, God is not mocked.

443
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,324
You can't fool God.

444
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:18,260
You break all His laws
and God Almighty will judge you.

445
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,834
Hey.

446
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,641
Hey.

447
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,907
Can I get a really big chunk of meatloaf
with gravy and a couple of pickles?

448
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,916
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

449
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,222
Hello.

450
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,295
What's the matter?

451
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,437
What do we think, what do we know,
what can we prove?

452
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,403
I'm so sick of that.

453
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,444
The only thing we know for sure
is that we don't know anything.

454
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,207
Which also happens to be
the only thing we can prove.

455
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,910
We think. Or do we know,
or do we think we know?

456
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,553
I don't know what the hell it is.

457
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,117
It's a jelly doughnut.

458
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,525
- Thanks, it's a jelly doughnut.
- Your welcome. I owe you about a quarter.

459
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,129
Something's gobblin' up the T... cells.

460
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,668
I'm tellin' you, Max,
feline leukemia might be a clue.

461
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,301
Really looks infectious to me.

462
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:10,006
Just like your favorite bug,
the feline leukemia virus.

463
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,384
- They both cause cancer, right?
- Okay.

464
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,911
They both cause immune suppression.

465
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,917
- Something's gobblin' up those T... cells.
- Okay.

466
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,424
They both have long incubation periods.

467
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,824
Suspect or know?

468
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,762
These guys had
swollen lymph nodes, fevers...

469
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,959
...all sorts of things for years
before they get Kaposi's sarcoma.

470
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,966
Good.

471
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,170
- It's hardly scientific proof, but it's good.
- All right, let's add hepatitis B.

472
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,939
- It causes cancer, right?
- Right.

473
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,410
Immune suppression? No.
Has a long incubation period.

474
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,210
Can take up to 30 years
to give cancer to the liver.

475
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,147
Right.

476
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,447
Transmitted by sex.

477
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,919
No. Yes.

478
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,591
It all fits!

479
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,126
The disease we're looking for
looks like a combination...

480
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,030
...between feline leukemia and hepatitis B.

481
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,059
So isn't it likely what we're looking for
is some kind of new virus?

482
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,538
Like the retrovirus
that causes feline leukemia.

483
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,437
Possible.

484
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,912
It's also possible
that since your two fields of expertise...

485
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,676
...are feline leukemia and hepatitis B...

486
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,743
...what looks like a scientific eureka
might only be a case of wishful thinking.

487
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,352
It's possible. Maybe likely.

488
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,160
Actually it could be a retrovirus,
in which case we need Bob Gallo.

489
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,763
- Will we have to kiss his ring?
- Probably.

490
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,298
But here's a man who became
world famous for finding...

491
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,066
...the first human retrovirus, HTLV.

492
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,467
But he still hasn't found
a major illness to link it to.

493
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,272
And if this turns out to be the one...

494
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,881
Then Bob Gallo gets the Nobel Prize.

495
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,786
Shit!

496
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,457
Sorry, Dr. Gallo.

497
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,229
You're sorry about winning?

498
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,197
Never be sorry about winning.

499
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,898
If you don't get
your promotion next month...

500
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,410
...that's when you should be sorry.

501
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,113
Dr. Gallo, telephone.

502
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,062
- Bob, Max Essex.
- Max, how are you?

503
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,290
Are you working on that
new gay disease yet?

504
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,567
No. I'll tell you the truth,
that really doesn't interest me.

505
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,803
Don Francis used to be my student,
he's with the CDC now.

506
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,741
He's found enough evidence to suggest
that it may be caused by some retrovirus...

507
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,143
...possibly in the same family as yours.

508
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,977
I'm gonna explore this with him and I think
it's something you oughta look into.

509
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,917
Send me what you have
and I'll put someone on it.

510
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,184
Excellent!

511
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,649
Thanks for the call. Bye.

512
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,388
- What did he say?
- We got it.

513
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,892
I got a call from LA.

514
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,165
- Wait a minute. I'm on the phone.
- I got a call from LA.

515
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:25,197
This could be the first real lead
to prove this thing is sexually transmitted.

516
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
- My plane leaves in 40 minutes.
- The budget isn't approved!

517
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,839
Don't sweat it, I'll front the money.
You'll pay me back.

518
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:38,048
If you have definitive proof it was
brought in by a UFO, send it into us.

519
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,487
Thank you.

520
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,026
666.

521
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,133
Excuse me?

522
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,900
It's my room number.

523
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,113
That's when I called
the Public Health Department...

524
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,780
...when I saw what room they put me in.

525
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,586
But nobody listened to me.
Nobody listens in this place!

526
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,866
I'll listen to you.

527
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,802
That's why I'm here.

528
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,647
It all started with a barbecue.

529
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:45,178
It was in the summer of 1980.

530
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,950
We had it in our backyard.

531
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:53,553
And it was just me and my lover...

532
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,327
...and a gay couple from up the street.

533
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,096
One of them died...

534
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,942
...on October 6, 1981.

535
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,404
And one died on February 6, 1982.

536
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,581
And the other one died on March 6, 1982.

537
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,616
There are three sixes, you see?

538
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,345
Yes.

539
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,252
All of them died of this new disease?

540
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,529
There are three sixes.

541
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,896
There are three sixes, so I...

542
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,100
Do you see any of the names
of those men on this list?

543
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,968
October 6 is '81.

544
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,242
February 6 is '82.

545
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,309
And March 6, '82.

546
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,815
Good.

547
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,786
- You had sex with all three of these men?
- Listen.

548
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,062
- Can you hear that?
- What?

549
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,791
Do you hear that?

550
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,066
The music...

551
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,535
...it's playing upside down.

552
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,476
Which means...

553
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,706
...I'm number four on the list.

554
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,842
Four and two makes...

555
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,259
Would you tell me the absolute truth?

556
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:35,995
Would you?
No matter how terrifying that may be.

557
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,724
I'll try to.

558
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,033
Does it make a difference
if I was cremated?

559
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,073
I don't understand.

560
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,080
I'm sorry.

561
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,555
Him, him...

562
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,498
...and him.

563
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,273
I miss him very much.

564
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,139
I am 32 years old and I'm dying.

565
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,848
Can you just leave me alone?

566
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,148
- I'm sorry.
- Get him outta here!

567
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,955
- Here's my card, if you...
- God dammit, get him outta here!

568
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,930
Sorry to bother you.

569
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,091
Mr. Darrow. I'm not his lover.

570
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,028
I'm a friend who takes care of him
on Thursdays.

571
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,472
We take turns in a buddy program.

572
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,974
I'm not sure this
is what you're looking for but...

573
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,140
...I think Greg got it
from a man from New York.

574
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,150
You don't know a man from New York
with a French... Canadian accent, do you?

575
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,951
Very handsome, I was told, very chic.

576
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,258
I don't think so. I mean, I very seldom...

577
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,761
Wait a minute.
This might help somebody else, right?

578
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,993
Right.

579
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,469
Of course I know him.
From the bathhouses.

580
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:25,474
I never had sex with him but almost
everybody I know has, or wants to.

581
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,733
It was fun.

582
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:33,346
Then again, he gave me hepatitis,
so it's quite possible he gave me this, too.

583
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,219
From the moment I first spied him
at the tubs, I was so crazy about him.

584
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,586
He was so gorgeous.

585
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,016
Can you just give me his phone number,
or address...

586
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,230
...or anyway I can get a hold of him?

587
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:54,833
All I know is he's French... Canadian,
he's an airline steward based in New York.

588
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,272
I don't even know which airline.

589
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,933
That's okay.

590
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,641
If you can just give me his name.

591
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,110
I called him Dougie.

592
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,241
- Nickname.
- Dougie. And his full name?

593
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,120
Hi.

594
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,094
- You back in town?
- No, just for the night.

595
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,327
I'm going to New York...

596
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,930
...to try and find a very sexually active
French... Canadian airline steward.

597
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,343
Gaetan Dugas, Bill Darrow.

598
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,275
Hello.

599
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,318
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

600
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,287
- Sit down. Take all the time you need.
- Thank you.

601
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,686
Thank you.

602
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,685
Thanks very much for coming in.

603
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,229
I'm very flattered to be asked.

604
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,331
Although I've no idea
what I'm here to discuss.

605
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,163
- Would it disturb you if I smoke?
- If you need to, go ahead.

606
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,707
Mr. Dugas, have you had sex
with any of these people?

607
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,073
Is that what I'm here for,
to talk about my beautiful lovers?

608
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,342
Now I am flattered.

609
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:16,880
Although I cannot possibly imagine
why you'd be interested.

610
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,987
We've found substantial evidence...

611
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:23,117
...to suggest that one of the ways this
disease may be transmitted is sexually.

612
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,825
Now, wait a minute.

613
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,101
All I have is skin cancer
which is not contagious and you know it.

614
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:37,106
No one's accusing you of anything.
We just need to know as much as we can.

615
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:46,215
You know, I adore doctors,
but I must say, if it is an epidemic...

616
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:51,253
...this gay plague thing,
it's your fault for not stopping it, not mine.

617
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,585
That's exactly what we're trying to do.

618
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,625
And we need everybody's help...

619
00:49:55,692 --> 00:50:00,095
...so if you could give me the names
and addresses of all your lovers...

620
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,462
...and start with the people
on this list, please.

621
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,396
My friend, we're talking about
thousands of men...

622
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:13,136
...all over the world, whose faces I can't
even remember and you want names.

623
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,607
As many as you can remember would help.

624
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,880
My book's in my apartment. You call me.

625
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,610
What's the number?

626
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:22,977
I'll call you.

627
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:26,284
Help me, don't help me,
that's up to you, but don't fuck with me!

628
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,324
I'm not playing games here.

629
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:40,102
Not before 6:00, and not after 6:30.

630
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,465
Thank you.

631
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,142
And remember something.

632
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:54,880
Whatever it is, if I got it,
someone gave it to me.

633
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,256
- Mine.
- I'm sorry.

634
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,762
This is important!

635
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,235
Not to me!

636
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:37,459
Yes. Hello. It's Bill Darrow from the CDC.

637
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,490
- Got plenty of paper? I've got 73 names.
- Sure.

638
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,537
All right, this is how it breaks down.

639
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,408
This is Patient Zero,
an airline steward from New York...

640
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,073
...and the starting point
of this particular group.

641
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,912
These are the eight with whom
he had direct sexual contact.

642
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,680
These four in New York, these four in LA.

643
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,254
This is LA Three.

644
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:08,416
He had sex with LA Two,
this man from Florida...

645
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,150
...who in turn had sex
with this Florida man...

646
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,195
...two from Georgia,
one from Texas, and so on.

647
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,457
In all, 40 cases in 10 cities...

648
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,264
...are verifiably linked to Patient Zero.

649
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,773
Which strongly suggests this is
a sexually transmitted disease.

650
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,907
Great! That's absolutely terrific work.

651
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:34,006
- That is the first sign of real proof.
- Good job!

652
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,814
Is there any clue
why Patient Zero is still alive...

653
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,651
...and others in this cluster
died almost immediately?

654
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,817
We just have to assume
a variable incubation period.

655
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,722
How many of these connections
were made in bathhouses?

656
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,991
- Most of them.
- Most of them!

657
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,867
We know what we have to do:
Close the bathhouses.

658
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:56,599
The federal government
doesn't have authority to do that.

659
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,836
- How soon can you write a full report?
- Four or five days.

660
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,140
I'm from the Bay Area, I could just...

661
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,975
Could you stay out of this?

662
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:08,074
It's not my decision what to do with this
information and it's certainly not yours.

663
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,415
Something this important
has to go upstairs...

664
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,718
...and based on what they recommend,
we can act.

665
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,788
Are you saying that the public might
not even be told what we just found out?

666
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,058
Are you saying this is, or is not,
a sexually transmittable disease?

667
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:32,039
The existence of a cluster study
provides evidence for an hypothesis...

668
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:36,909
...that people in the study are not
randomly associated with each other.

669
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,282
The study is a sexual cluster, yet we don't
have enough scientific evidence...

670
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,878
...to say for certain that one person
gives it to another person.

671
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,355
We have to focus more research
into this area...

672
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:52,225
...so we don't prematurely release
information that's not validated.

673
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,960
Yet, we're not holding back information
that might provide important medical help.

674
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,734
Thank you.

675
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:08,100
In a situation that may slightly embarrass
the White House, your idea is to play dead.

676
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:11,238
I'm the bureaucratic whore,
you're Lawrence of Arabia?

677
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,578
- Do you think I like doing what I do?
- Do you?

678
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,915
One of my jobs is to make sure
I don't start a nationwide panic.

679
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,816
Is that worse than an epidemic?

680
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,881
I won't make enemies with people who can
cut off what little funding we have left.

681
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:27,123
- I'm juggling political, bureaucratic, public...
- What about science and medicine?

682
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,665
What I said in there was pure science,
you know it.

683
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,863
There's strong evidence but there's
nothing we can prove scientifically.

684
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,906
It can take up to five years
to establish scientific proof.

685
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,907
How many people are gonna get sick?

686
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,808
Let's just say we get rid of
the idea of scientific proof.

687
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:46,747
What are you going to replace it with,
the Ouija Board School of Epidemiology?

688
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,448
When a house is on fire,
you don't wait for scientific proof.

689
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,323
You grab the first hose
and you start putting out the fire.

690
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,470
I never said that.
Don't put words in my mouth.

691
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,983
Let me just say something. Listen to me.

692
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,978
You keep saying community!

693
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,048
Wait a second.

694
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,223
I am just talking about a modern...
Hold on. Just wait a second.

695
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,931
Somebody has to...

696
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,197
Goddamn it! Just shut the hell up.

697
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,864
I can't believe every time
we have a meeting in this town...

698
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,341
...we don't end in a brawl,
we start with one.

699
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,004
I don't have the power
to shut down the bathhouses.

700
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,747
As Director of Public Health, you can
shut down any threat to public health.

701
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:59,150
According to the press conference, there
was no evidence it's sexually transmitted.

702
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:03,591
You know damn well, if this epidemic
was killing grandmothers and virgins...

703
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,354
...you'd have an army of investigators
out there.

704
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,418
Exactly.

705
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:12,491
This is San Francisco, where the bathhouse
is a symbol of sexual freedom.

706
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:18,405
If you want these bathhouses closed down,
the gay community has to help close them.

707
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,737
Good night.

708
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,810
No way he's gonna budge
and commit political suicide.

709
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,747
Why should he, with the gay community
split down the middle?

710
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,750
We are not split down the middle.

711
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:33,084
The vast majority of gay men
are in stable, monogamous relationships.

712
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,649
They don't go to the bathhouses,
it's only the minority.

713
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,193
Okay, a vocal minority do.

714
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,424
If something isn't done about
this epidemic, they're dead!

715
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,693
The vocal minority and a lot more besides.

716
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,668
Just wait a second.
Let me talk for a second.

717
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,143
What's the matter?

718
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,685
There's been a...

719
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,886
- For a while now...
- You don't have to tell me.

720
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,362
Yes, I do. I've met someone.

721
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,099
He's an architect.

722
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,417
It'd hurt something awful
if you stopped being my friend.

723
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,216
How could I stop being your friend?

724
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,962
Five, six, seven, eight.

725
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,477
Straight back.

726
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,681
Five, six, seven, eight.

727
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,292
Five, six, seven, eight.

728
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,631
Hey, Doc.

729
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:46,913
Hi.

730
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:51,458
- I'm really happy you could come.
- Thank you for asking.

731
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,463
You said you were going to be
in New York...

732
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,436
I'm sorry I couldn't be more specific
with you on the phone.

733
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,479
I think I got this thing.

734
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,090
I'm really scared.

735
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,568
Why am I so afraid
to tell anybody about this?

736
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:52,086
I know how hard it is
for you people to get...

737
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:56,023
...the kind of money you need
to fight these things.

738
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,361
I want to...

739
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,301
Use that wherever you think
it'll do the most good, all right?

740
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,365
Thank you.

741
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,783
Get out of here. I gotta get back to work.

742
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,990
We won't stop!

743
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:14,867
I'm Bill Kraus. This could get you
in trouble with the CDC, couldn't it?

744
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,234
Probably.

745
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:20,500
As I tried to say on the phone,
the CDC caused chaos here.

746
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,813
That press conference was so ambiguous
about sexual transmission...

747
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,251
...the gay community
is in complete turmoil.

748
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,264
How much longer do you think
we're gonna wait here?

749
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,533
Let me tell you something.

750
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:56,141
No matter what happens here today,
if you try to close my joint, I'll sue you.

751
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,075
Do you know the people who have sex
in your bathhouse...

752
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,775
...are playing Russian roulette?

753
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,715
Please, let's cut out this bullshit!

754
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,378
We're all in this for one thing: Money.
I make it when the guys come in.

755
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,352
You doctors,
you make it when they go out.

756
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,200
How long will we wait for him?
He's an hour late. Let's go.

757
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,598
All right. Can we settle down please?

758
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,873
Please, everybody settle down
so we can start. Thank you.

759
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,810
While we're waiting for Dr. Silverman,
your Director of Public Health...

760
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,078
...I've got some good news to report.

761
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,720
Not just here in San Francisco,
but right across the country...

762
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,749
...gay organizations are raising money
to fight this epidemic.

763
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,531
I'd like to introduce Dr. Don Francis...

764
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,194
...from the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta...

765
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,965
...who's been fighting this epidemic
from the start.

766
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:06,207
First, I'm not speaking on behalf of
the Centers for Disease Control.

767
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,011
I'm speaking for myself.

768
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:13,081
There may have been confusion caused by
the way the information was distributed...

769
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:16,319
...about whether or not
this disease is sexually transmittable.

770
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,657
I'm here to give you the absolute truth
about what we've found.

771
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,323
First, if you get this disease...

772
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,296
...the chances are about 100 percent
that you're going to die.

773
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,273
Second, one of the ways
that you can get this disease...

774
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,709
...is by having sex with somebody
who already has it.

775
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,277
We have established...

776
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:42,577
...that most of the people who have
this disease got it in a bathhouse.

777
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,686
Quiet down, please.

778
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,369
One at a time, please.

779
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,137
Everyone will have a chance to speak.

780
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,608
Please, shut the hell up.

781
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,180
How can you say we get it from sex
when the CDC just said that we didn't?

782
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:21,112
This is another Reagan trick
to shove us back in the closet.

783
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,628
What about the bathhouses?

784
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:36,098
Here's the man we've all been waiting for,
your Director of Health...

785
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,969
...Dr. Mervyn Silverman.

786
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,202
Let's go.

787
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:46,205
Since the reason for this meeting is to
discuss how we feel, who would like to...

788
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,511
Bobbi Campbell go ahead.

789
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,420
For years, people in my hometown...

790
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,133
...were telling me I was a freak
because of my sexual orientation.

791
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,894
Until I came to San Francisco...

792
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,008
...and I found a community of freaks
just like me!

793
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,534
We stood together!

794
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,638
And it took a long time...

795
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,742
...but we finally forced this one tiny
spot of the universe, the Castro...

796
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:28,552
...to realize that how we choose to have
sex and where is our own damn business!

797
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:35,360
Which I know to people who haven't
gone through what we have...

798
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,262
...sounds funny and they may laugh.

799
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,959
But I know, speaking for most of us...

800
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:45,773
...I would rather die as a human being
than continue living as a freak.

801
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,945
There's a lot of strong feeling
on this subject.

802
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,885
Before I make my decision,
I'd like to put this to a vote.

803
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:03,924
All those in favor of the city closing
the bathhouses, raise your hand.

804
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,951
Close the tubs!

805
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,936
All those in favor of keeping
the bathhouses open, raise your hands.

806
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,815
I don't understand.

807
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,807
They're human.

808
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,119
And they're scared.

809
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,107
Why this happen?

810
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,603
You doctor...

811
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,881
...how you don't know?

812
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,721
Sorry, we're late.
We were held up by traffic.

813
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,632
Let's hope this lymph material
holds the key to the illness.

814
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,442
Put this in reserve.

815
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,548
It's amazing to me...

816
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,718
...that Americans can think
a disease has a sexual preference.

817
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,027
But that's all Americans think of...

818
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,124
Sex. Sex. Sex.

819
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,342
I think this read within weeks, and quickly.

820
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,777
Just have Gallo report the detection
of this virus, HTLV, in what?

821
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,450
It was the two East Coast homosexuals.

822
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,420
Two East Coast homosexuals.

823
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,492
In this hour, right away, now,
the Science...

824
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,124
This is big. We've finally got the big one.

825
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:16,871
Tell all our best people to drop what
they're doing and get to work on this.

826
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,205
- On this day, March what?
- Third.

827
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:24,617
Dr. Robert Gallo makes
the first gigantic strides in winning...

828
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,950
What? The war, the battle?

829
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,916
- The war.
- Battle...

830
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,961
...against whatever they call it now.

831
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,960
Francoise... You do the honors.

832
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,348
Unless the numbers reach 20,000,
we don't have a retrovirus.

833
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,748
300, 320.

834
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:04,315
Background radiation.

835
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,991
Where did we go wrong?

836
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:08,856
Start from scratch.

837
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,059
Modify the culture...

838
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:18,171
...and check any procedural errors.

839
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:32,182
Look what they're calling it.
"He died after another 'Iong illness."'

840
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,256
It's so sad.

841
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:41,561
This could be the first deadly epidemic
in history of which nobody officially died.

842
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,063
Look at this!

843
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,232
- Did you see this? Look at this article.
- Where?

844
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,867
"In order to move quickly
and take the lead...

845
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,873
"...in what may be a fierce
scientific battle against GRID...

846
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,536
"...Dr. Gallo has formed a special unit
of the National Cancer Institute...

847
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,070
"...to fight and win the battle against
this disease by the year's end."

848
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,674
- What?
- Hot damn! We're in business!

849
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:09,852
An IV drug user in New York,
I just got back, died from it.

850
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,688
- Gay?
- A woman.

851
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,758
It's in the blood supply.

852
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,940
- How long has he been ill?
- He was born with it.

853
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,273
No. I don't mean hemophilia.

854
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:34,012
He was doing fine until recently,
wasn't he?

855
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,179
He's crippled in one knee
because they couldn't stop the bleeding...

856
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:43,247
...until a few years ago,
when they came out with that new stuff.

857
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,892
- Factor VIII.
- Now look at him.

858
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,458
He was doing fine just a few weeks ago.

859
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:53,467
Did you happen to get a new supply
of Factor VIII about that same time?

860
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:58,096
What is that, exactly?
Fake blood or something?

861
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:01,006
No, it's real blood.

862
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,306
But they get it from
thousands of different people...

863
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:11,148
...put it through a lot of different filters
and take out things and add things to it...

864
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:15,245
...till all they've got is the clotting stuff...

865
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,691
...that makes you stop bleeding.

866
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,326
He was doing fine until a few weeks ago.

867
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:28,597
I'm really sorry about this,
but I've got some questions which are...

868
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,999
...embarrassing.

869
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,708
I've gotta ask them.

870
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,576
Has he ever had sexual contact
with another man?

871
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,448
I don't understand the question.

872
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,515
He's a man.

873
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:49,790
How can a man have sex
with another man?

874
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,694
I personally don't care...

875
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:58,432
...if these people were painted
by Norman Rockwell!

876
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,832
We have to prove the blood
is contaminated.

877
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,197
We've gotta prove it!

878
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,069
What do we know, what do we think,
what can we prove?

879
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,835
It is in Factor VIII.

880
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,069
- You think?
- I know.

881
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,941
- Proof.
- We can't prove anything till we do a test.

882
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,380
- We can't test till we find the virus.
- Assuming that it is a virus.

883
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,581
Finding a virus with our equipment?

884
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,985
You got a better chance of winning
the Indy 500 with roller... skates.

885
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,114
What about Max Essex?
Is he finding anything out?

886
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,990
He can't keep the cells alive long enough
to see a virus.

887
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,529
- The French have the same problem.
- Gallo, too.

888
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:31,964
Does anybody have anything positive?

889
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,033
We may be able to do something
about the blood supply...

890
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,129
...even though we can't find the virus.

891
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,074
The people getting this disease
are almost identical...

892
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:44,701
...to the group getting hepatitis B,
so we did an experiment.

893
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,041
We took the hepatitis B test
and took blood samples...

894
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,085
...from 60 gay men who've got it
and 60 men who don't.

895
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,654
The test was 88 percent effective
in detecting the disease.

896
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,725
- Really?
- That is fantastic!

897
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,557
If the blood banks can weed out
that many people...

898
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,063
...who have the disease
before they donate blood...

899
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,257
Exactly!

900
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,493
Wait.

901
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,866
Do all of you really believe
that the blood industry...

902
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:13,931
...is gonna spend millions of dollars
on an idea that is scientifically radical?

903
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,141
It's not so radical if you're a hemophiliac.

904
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,974
Can we be realistic just for one second?

905
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,812
We must prove that
it's even in the blood supply...

906
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,215
...before we get any action
from those people.

907
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,313
It's bound to turn up
in the regular blood supply.

908
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,154
I think we should look at transfusions.

909
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,929
In fact, if we can find one patient...

910
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,792
...who got the disease
after getting a transfusion...

911
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,857
...then we need to look at the donors.

912
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,267
See if one of them has the disease
that gave him the blood.

913
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:45,829
If we can find that,
we've made the connection.

914
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,399
We just gotta prove the patient
couldn't have gotten it any other way.

915
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,807
That's interesting.

916
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,438
Interesting? It's so obvious.

917
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,810
It's brilliant!

918
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,660
- Terry Mack.
- Dale Lawrence.

919
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:18,094
He's had 12 donors,
all from the New York Blood Center.

920
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,440
Are you saying the New York Blood Center
won't give me a list of the donors?

921
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:29,848
The CDC is convinced he couldn't have
gotten the disease from any other source...

922
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,977
...except the transfusions.

923
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:36,081
The legal protection of donor
confidentiality prevents me...

924
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,752
A donors has a disease
that will kill the man...

925
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,159
...who got the blood from you
to save his life.

926
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,958
If we don't find that donor...

927
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,932
...before he donates more blood
and kills more people...

928
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,334
Unless there is
irrefutable scientific evidence...

929
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,704
...that the alleged disease does exist,
that it can be blood... borne...

930
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:57,273
...and if so, has been proven
to be transfusion transmissible...

931
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,741
...there is nothing I can do.

932
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,357
Harold Jaffe, CDC.

933
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,476
- Hi.
- How do you do?

934
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,676
- Harold Jaffe.
- Betsy Reisz.

935
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:37,776
So it's true?

936
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,653
He was born here 20 months ago.
An Rh baby.

937
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:46,185
Within a week, his entire blood volume
had been replaced six times.

938
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,656
Now he has zoster...

939
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,461
...practically zero T... cell count...

940
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:54,993
...and more opportunistic disease
than we know what do with.

941
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,399
- He had 13 donors?
- All from Irwin Memorial.

942
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:04,805
That's all I could find out. They keep a lid
on it so tight, it's like the Pentagon.

943
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,314
Forget about getting a list of donors
from them.

944
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,611
The first irrefutable case
caused by transfusions...

945
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,417
...and these people are stonewalling us.

946
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:18,485
Know what we need?
Somebody to scare the hell out of them.

947
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,424
Only Attila the Hun could.

948
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,557
Selma Dritz!

949
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,362
- Well?
- I got it.

950
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:35,004
There's one problem, two problems.
I'm freezing, that's one problem.

951
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,476
Let's get some coffee.

952
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:40,503
One of the donors died from the disease
two months ago.

953
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,406
But we can't prove it.

954
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,452
What do you mean? Why not?

955
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:48,885
He was from one of the richest,
most socially prominent families in town.

956
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,618
He swore to his dying breath
he wasn't gay.

957
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,285
What's the difference?

958
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,956
When somebody dies from this,
you can't mistake it for whooping cough.

959
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,330
His doctor says he died from encephalitis.

960
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,165
- It's on his death certificate.
- Let's talk to the doctor.

961
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,602
And get him to say what? He lied?

962
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,039
Somewhere in town,
there must be somebody.

963
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,236
A gay man he had sex with or...
Does his family know?

964
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,779
My brother wasn't gay.

965
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,280
No matter how hard you search...

966
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,321
...you won't find any evidence
to suggest the contrary.

967
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,318
He was on the board
of several corporations.

968
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,656
He was the chairman of the Fundraising
Committee for St. Patrick's.

969
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,525
He was meticulous...

970
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,730
He was meticulous
in concealing his other life...

971
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:41,275
...even from me.

972
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,974
Please don't ask me to betray him now.

973
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,917
I'm very sorry.
But we're trying to stop an epidemic.

974
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:55,755
We know that this disease
can be transmitted by gay sex.

975
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,824
We hope to prove it's also transmitted
by blood products.

976
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,019
Your brother was a blood donor.

977
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,830
And we know that at least one person...

978
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,459
...who got his blood, got the disease.

979
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,135
If you can help us...

980
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,334
...it would be completely confidential.

981
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:22,306
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I really don't know anything myself.

982
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,484
Here's his stuff.

983
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,545
His mail.

984
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,992
Here's his address book.

985
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,584
You can look through it if you want.
I have.

986
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,192
There's no one in there I don't know.
Nothing unusual.

987
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,130
I wish he would've told me, but he didn't.

988
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,932
Look at this. What about this entry?

989
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,604
"Marc, Repairman"?

990
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,749
Dr. Conant's office.

991
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:06,159
- Is someone named Marc there?
- This is Dr. Marcus Conant's office.

992
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,852
May I help you?

993
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,593
Sorry, wrong number.

994
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,165
Only for you.

995
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:20,775
I was the secret doctor he came to
for those messy little problems...

996
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:24,636
...he couldn't let his family physician
know about.

997
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,474
In 1980, he had a case of K. S...

998
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:29,339
...pneumocystis...

999
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,413
...the whole bag of horrors.

1000
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,151
Thank you very much. I love you.

1001
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,089
Thanks a lot, Doctor.

1002
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,555
All right,
let the blood banks stonewall this one!

1003
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:51,999
I'd like to remind everyone that
these are not regulations from the CDC.

1004
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:55,008
This is a workshop where every agency...

1005
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,910
...connected to the blood industry can
evaluate information the CDC has found.

1006
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:03,082
We're hoping to be able to arrive
at some course of action.

1007
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:06,643
One option is to establish guidelines...

1008
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,519
...to keep people at high risk
from donating blood.

1009
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:13,220
Banning homosexuals from giving blood
won't protect the blood supply.

1010
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,695
What it will do is stigmatize them.

1011
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:20,562
Reminds me of blood banks
rejecting donations from blacks...

1012
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,694
...for fear of syphilis.

1013
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,207
The civil rights implications
of establishing guidelines...

1014
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,605
Civil rights, my ass!

1015
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:31,544
My son's a hemophiliac and if homosexuals
are infecting the blood supply...

1016
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,478
...why not keep them from donating?

1017
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:37,006
The entire gay community?
Then what? Separate drinking fountains?

1018
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,076
One for gays! One for humans!

1019
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:41,247
Don't start that gay rights crap!

1020
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,053
There are 20,000 hemophiliacs
in this country...

1021
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,561
...and GRID has become the second
leading cause of death.

1022
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,530
We have rights, too.
One of them is the right to stay alive.

1023
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,567
I know that we're dealing
with a very complex...

1024
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,999
...and a highly emotional issue, but...

1025
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,198
How can you expect us
to be unemotional...

1026
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:00,866
...when at least one person
is dying every day...

1027
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,843
...from a disease that doesn't
even have a name?

1028
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,346
If the CDC can't bother
to come up with a name...

1029
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:10,748
...at least it should stop the media
from calling it GRID!

1030
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:15,886
Enough people hate gays without having
the stigma of this disease placed on us!

1031
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:21,485
Especially since it's been shown that this
disease is no longer merely gay... related.

1032
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:25,127
I make a motion
to officially call this disease...

1033
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:28,327
...Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome...

1034
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,227
...or AIDS.

1035
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:36,109
Questions or discussions on this issue?

1036
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,610
I second it.

1037
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,413
All in favor of Dr. Voeller's motion.

1038
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:46,047
And opposed? The motion's carried.

1039
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,018
Dr. Bove?

1040
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,750
The FDA Advisory Panel
to the blood banks feels that...

1041
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:55,157
...the evidence for nearly all of this
is inferential.

1042
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:59,393
The CDC's evidence of blood
transmission cannot be warranted...

1043
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:04,734
...until the CDC shows definitively that
an infectious agent causes this disease.

1044
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:08,237
Nothing about it exists
in the peer... reviewed medical literature!

1045
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,208
Not one case!

1046
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,013
Evidence of such
blood transmission is lacking.

1047
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:17,608
May I point out that the blood industry
is under the jurisdiction of the FDA...

1048
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:21,382
...and according to Dr. Bove, they don't
acknowledge there is an epidemic.

1049
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:25,152
Because there is no evidence
that it's a blood... borne disease.

1050
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,820
Suppose, for example,
a small amount of blood...

1051
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:31,056
...by some unlikely chance,
is contaminated.

1052
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:35,498
With no test to find out which blood
is safe and which isn't, what should we do?

1053
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,270
Destroy the entire blood supply
in America...

1054
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:42,298
...because some of it may
or may not be contaminated?

1055
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,036
No.

1056
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:47,943
In fact, testing is the second option
that we should discuss.

1057
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,686
We at the CDC have found
that the hepatitis B test...

1058
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:58,658
...is 88 percent effective
in identifying patients with this disease.

1059
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,790
Is the CDC suggesting
that the blood industry...

1060
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:05,957
...spend $100 million a year
to use a test for the wrong disease...

1061
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:10,596
...because of a handful of transfusion
fatalities and eight dead hemophiliacs?

1062
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,033
How many dead hemophiliacs
do you need?

1063
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:16,805
How many people have to die
to make it cost efficient...

1064
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,810
...for you to do something about it?

1065
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,846
A hundred? A thousand?

1066
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,818
Give us a number
so we won't annoy you again...

1067
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,752
...until the money you begin spending
on lawsuits...

1068
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,916
...makes it more profitable for you
to save people than to kill them!

1069
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:54,048
The disease called AIDS,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome...

1070
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,606
...sounds less than deadly,
more like a diet pill.

1071
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,481
Medical researchers are warning...

1072
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,577
The risk of contracting AIDS...

1073
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:04,155
Henry Pinya, who has AIDS,
got into a minor traffic accident.

1074
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,294
Police called the Hazardous
Materials Team.

1075
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:10,721
The impact on blood banks
could be disastrous.

1076
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,464
Doctors learned today that
at least one hemophiliac patient...

1077
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:17,503
...was given blood plasma from a donor
who died of AIDS.

1078
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:21,266
Possible association of AIDS
and blood transfusion...

1079
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,742
...is of the order of one in a million.

1080
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:30,312
I've been looking all over for you.
I just talked to Paul O'Mally.

1081
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:33,043
He's wrapping up the hepatitis B study
and listen:

1082
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,157
12 of the first 24 cases of AIDS
in this country...

1083
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:40,785
...are men that we've been tracking for
hepatitis B every year since 1978.

1084
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:46,526
We've been talking about using the test,
but forgot about the hepatitis B study.

1085
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:50,101
- Congratulations.
- You don't think this is important?

1086
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:54,198
30,000 blood samples and detailed
questionnaires from 7,000 gay men...

1087
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:59,109
...from five cities, taken every year since
three years before the epidemic broke out.

1088
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,809
We've got the natural history
of the epidemic in a freezer in Phoenix.

1089
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,044
I know the study.

1090
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:07,178
You're saying we should pull
the samples and organize them.

1091
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:11,191
- Where will we get the money to do that?
- Juggle or steal it.

1092
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,387
There's nothing to juggle or steal.
There's no money, none.

1093
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:17,890
The $866,000 budget that we requested
a year ago...

1094
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:20,524
...for the task force
still hasn't been approved.

1095
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:24,003
Where do you think we'll get the money
to do a job as massive as this?

1096
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,630
That's your job.

1097
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:29,607
How am I supposed to do my job
with you shooting your mouth off?

1098
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:30,666
What?

1099
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:35,375
Your outburst at the blood bank meeting
damaged the credibility of the CDC.

1100
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:54,525
The only way we'll get the blood banks
to start testing...

1101
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:59,096
...is if we find somebody with enough clout
they've got God's unlisted phone number.

1102
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,241
Which these people do.

1103
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:03,610
Jesus, this is proof.

1104
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:06,880
Why haven't they sued somebody,
raised hell?

1105
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,417
Publicity, litigation,
pictures in the tabloids.

1106
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,651
My dear young man, it simply is not done.

1107
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:17,417
If you can convince them how many lives
they'll save if they go public...

1108
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,950
...that comes under the heading
of public service which they are big on.

1109
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,053
If!

1110
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,025
...might be of some assistance to us.

1111
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:27,933
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

1112
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:32,433
Complications of all kinds
are quite common after heart surgery.

1113
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:36,573
What could my case
possibly have to do with AIDS?

1114
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:40,410
They didn't tell you?

1115
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:42,613
Tell me what?

1116
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,747
We thought we'd heard everything.

1117
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,852
My God.

1118
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,852
I'm sorry.

1119
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,326
I have here your medical records.

1120
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,671
You're aware that...

1121
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:13,644
...during your surgery you were given
20 units of blood from Irwin Memorial?

1122
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:17,984
We know that.

1123
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:23,982
When you started getting all these
bizarre diseases, one after another...

1124
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,693
Didn't your doctors tell you why?

1125
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,125
We've had so many doctors.

1126
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:35,531
None of them had
any specific explanation, just...

1127
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:39,137
...severe complications due to surgery.

1128
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:47,372
I have here a letter
from one doctor to another...

1129
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:52,147
...at the University of California Medical
Center, where you had your surgery.

1130
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:56,352
"We have discovered
that one of her blood donors...

1131
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,918
"...is an AIDS patient."

1132
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,131
May I?

1133
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:04,218
No.

1134
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:17,060
Every blood bank in the country
has known for some time...

1135
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:21,835
...that some of the blood it has been using
for transfusions is contaminated.

1136
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:27,275
We've been unable to get them
to start testing...

1137
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:30,146
...or to take any precautions whatsoever.

1138
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:31,908
I'm terribly sorry.

1139
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:36,617
Are you telling me...

1140
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:41,161
...they knew they were giving AIDS
to people and continued to do it?

1141
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:55,135
We've had extensive discussion
on the subject and as of May 1...

1142
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:58,076
...Irwin Memorial will begin testing
for antibodies...

1143
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,613
...to the core of the hepatitis B virus.

1144
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,549
Good.

1145
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:08,447
This is the test we've been urging you
for a year to use...

1146
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,580
...until a better test comes along.

1147
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:15,061
Not good. That test is not totally effective.

1148
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:18,730
You're forcing the Red Cross
to start using it, too...

1149
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,800
...or we can't compete.

1150
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:25,300
Absolutely. We are not convinced
that it's transmitted by transfusion at all.

1151
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,600
What does it take to convince you?

1152
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,938
The CDC confirmed...

1153
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:34,343
...that the number of transfusion cases
has quadrupled in the past eight months.

1154
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,974
You know you can't prove that.

1155
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,109
Technically, you're right.

1156
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,648
But 89 percent of severe hemophiliacs...

1157
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,624
...who had the most transfusions
have become infected.

1158
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:47,893
89 percent!

1159
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:52,588
I find it very hard to equate these figures...

1160
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:55,224
...with the possible loss in revenue!

1161
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:00,838
I make a motion that FDA
regulations require...

1162
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:05,308
...the hepatitis B test be used
to screen all blood and blood products...

1163
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,813
...before they're used on patients.

1164
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:10,040
Second.

1165
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:11,780
In favor?

1166
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:14,582
Opposed?

1167
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,753
Motion not carried.

1168
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,859
Let me ask you this:

1169
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,535
When doctors start
acting like businessmen...

1170
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,869
...who can the people turn to for doctors?

1171
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:40,507
Jesus!

1172
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:44,444
Every day I plan to buy some groceries.

1173
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,679
I drive by each night on my way home...

1174
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:49,984
...and no matter how late it is,
you're always up working.

1175
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,991
You want pasta salad, melon?

1176
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,219
Melon.

1177
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,995
Anything new?

1178
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:58,930
Any hope? Anywhere?

1179
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,531
Of anything?

1180
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:03,502
Reagan still hasn't
said the word "AIDS" in public.

1181
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,062
I'm not asking about miracles.

1182
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,536
I think the only hope we have...

1183
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:12,845
...is the election's coming up...

1184
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,640
...and with the whole country in a panic...

1185
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:19,243
...even the Moral Majority is
on Reagan's ass to do something quick.

1186
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,112
Sure he will,
the same old political smoke and mirrors.

1187
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:28,519
A friend of mine sneaked me
a memo from the White House...

1188
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:32,465
...claiming they've already spent
$26 million on:

1189
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:36,669
"Studies relevant to patients with AIDS."

1190
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:40,405
If they spend $10 million on research
for the common cold...

1191
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:44,808
...they call it relevant because in both
cases the immune system breaks down.

1192
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,576
The truth is, out of that $26 million...

1193
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:51,949
...only $750,000 has actually been spent
on AIDS research.

1194
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,354
What happened to the rest, I have no idea.

1195
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,684
- Hello.
- It's Don Francis.

1196
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:03,628
I know this is kind of
a strange question, but...

1197
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,758
...who do you know that can get me
an electron microscope?

1198
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:08,165
Try Nancy.

1199
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:18,469
They're dying!
The cells are still dying!

1200
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:23,139
They've been dying all week.

1201
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:31,858
Is there anything we haven't
tried to keep the cells alive?

1202
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:38,126
We tried every culture in
the incubators and the freezers...

1203
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:45,129
We tried anti... interferon,
human cells, what's left? Nothing.

1204
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:54,648
Yes, try again by feeding the cells,
not just once but continuously.

1205
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:12,966
22,000

1206
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:16,594
We've found something.
A retrovirus.

1207
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:24,272
But is it Gallo's HTLV
or a new one?

1208
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:29,872
Here it is.

1209
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:42,490
Here's a photo of what you
just saw. Your virus.

1210
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:47,497
Here's Gallo's virus.

1211
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:50,529
See... It's round.

1212
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:52,567
Yours has a bar.

1213
01:36:52,773 --> 01:36:55,742
It's easy to see the difference.

1214
01:36:56,043 --> 01:37:00,241
What you found is
a new human retrovirus.

1215
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:02,142
Bob. Montagnier.

1216
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,681
How are you?

1217
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:06,275
We tested our virus with your antibodies.

1218
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,986
We find the two
not immunologically... related.

1219
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:12,487
- Really?
- I'm writing a paper with all the details.

1220
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:18,029
What we've found is a new retrovirus,
which we think is the AIDS virus.

1221
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,599
That's fascinating!

1222
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,960
I just did a paper, too, for Science.

1223
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:28,232
It shows that my virus, HTLV,
is the most likely candidate for AIDS.

1224
01:37:29,076 --> 01:37:32,876
Why don't you send me your paper
and I'll make sure...

1225
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,971
...it gets published along with mine.

1226
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:38,518
I'll write the summary
to make sure it gets published.

1227
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:43,652
Send me samples of your virus
as soon as you can, by courier.

1228
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,519
I'll verify what you got.

1229
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:47,026
Sure.

1230
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,637
He wants to see our paper
and samples of our virus.

1231
01:37:58,305 --> 01:38:00,500
Frankly, since I've worked
with him...

1232
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:05,540
Francoise please, Dr. Gallo
is an eminent scientist.

1233
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:08,238
Send him anything he wants.

1234
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:14,922
Shouldn't an independent agency
test our results?

1235
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:18,988
Absolutely.

1236
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:23,224
I'll get Don at the CDC
to send blind samples...

1237
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:27,633
...to prove it's the AIDS virus.
- Good idea.

1238
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,168
Just got a call from Paris,
they found the virus.

1239
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,673
- That's terrific!
- I just got a call.

1240
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:43,139
I just got a call from Paris.
They think they've found the AIDS virus.

1241
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:55,051
I need 30 coded samples
on a plane to Paris tonight.

1242
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:56,288
Can you do that?

1243
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,659
I'm sitting here in a complete stupor,
totally unable to comprehend...

1244
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:40,798
...what kind of a cosmic joke this is for me,
the man they call a sexual nazi...

1245
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:43,809
...for preaching safe sex
with such fire... and... brimstone...

1246
01:39:43,877 --> 01:39:46,573
...I was beginning to sound
like Sadie Thompson.

1247
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,979
Not Sadie Thompson, the Preacher.

1248
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:53,313
Sadie Thompson was her name.
Rain, wasn't it? The name of the...

1249
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:56,446
God, I'm babbling. I can't stop.

1250
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:03,686
How long does it take, do you think,
for it to really sink in that I've got it?

1251
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:06,799
Maybe not...

1252
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:22,514
I'm sorry.

1253
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:25,708
God damn you!

1254
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:29,881
Why can't this happen
to somebody that you hate?

1255
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:36,222
I'm going to leave you and Kico my house.

1256
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,528
- What?
- I'll put it in my will.

1257
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:42,228
I don't want to live with Kico.
He's completely irresponsible.

1258
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:44,361
He won't pay his half of the phone bill.

1259
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:47,202
He would never take the garbage out
on Friday nights.

1260
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:51,572
Come on! If that's the most that you have
to leave me, then to hell with you.

1261
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:55,647
Live.

1262
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:17,965
Anything?

1263
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:24,637
How can I isolate this virus
if I can't keep the cells alive?

1264
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:29,076
How is it possible that
in the first few months...

1265
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,979
...we found our virus
in two men who had AIDS.

1266
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:35,519
Since then, we haven't found it
in another case?

1267
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:38,956
- Not one other case.
- I told you, both of those men had T cells.

1268
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:40,425
I don't wanna hear that!

1269
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:43,119
- But you...
- I'm sorry. I don't wanna hear it.

1270
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:44,562
Listen to me.

1271
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:49,068
Statistically, what are the odds
on finding two men with AIDS...

1272
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:52,765
...both of whom
also have the same leukemia...

1273
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:56,103
...which is so rare
that it's hardly found in anybody.

1274
01:41:56,243 --> 01:41:58,768
- That's ridiculous. All right?
- Fine.

1275
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,813
Somebody in this lab made a mistake.

1276
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:03,405
I want you to call the French Institute...

1277
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,748
...and get some more samples
of their virus.

1278
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:09,516
While you're at it,
find out how they keep the cells alive.

1279
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:18,792
Popovic here, yes?

1280
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,691
Who's calling?

1281
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:24,628
It's Dr. Essex for you.

1282
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:28,300
How are you?

1283
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:29,739
How's it going?

1284
01:42:29,943 --> 01:42:32,309
Everybody's wondering
when you're gonna publish.

1285
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:37,183
I had the cause of AIDS, but I...

1286
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:48,016
The thing is, it comes from
my family of viruses. That's definite.

1287
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:53,026
I may have something else, too.
I've got three variants.

1288
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:54,700
I can't analyze it yet...

1289
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:57,468
...in a way that I'd want to
put my name on it.

1290
01:42:57,538 --> 01:42:59,096
What do the French have?

1291
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,202
How do you know they have anything?

1292
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:05,675
Don Francis sent them blind samples
to verify that theirs is the AIDS virus...

1293
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:09,076
...and they passed, almost 100 percent.

1294
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,680
Don Francis from the CDC
sent the French samples?

1295
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:14,912
The French?

1296
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:16,654
Are you upset?

1297
01:43:17,057 --> 01:43:18,354
Upset?

1298
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:21,950
No, the French amuse me.

1299
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:27,956
What I don't understand
is how somebody from my own side...

1300
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:30,968
...somebody from the U. S...

1301
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:37,167
Listen, I gotta run.
Let me call you back as soon as I can.

1302
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,538
Okay. Bye.

1303
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:45,644
...all the interviews in LA.

1304
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:50,281
Then, I bled 215 gay men at the
San Francisco Venereal Disease Clinic...

1305
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:54,622
...and using the T... cell test, found that
65 percent of them were abnormal...

1306
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:57,724
...and had no idea they had it.

1307
01:43:57,798 --> 01:44:00,130
- No symptoms whatsoever.
- No symptoms?

1308
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:04,867
It's like all the plagues in the world's
history squeezed into this one. Worse.

1309
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:06,700
If you take Bill's cluster study...

1310
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:10,140
...where sexual contact with one person
led to 40 people gettin' it...

1311
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,678
If each of those 40 give it to 40 others...

1312
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:15,474
You've got people who don't know
they have the disease...

1313
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:19,609
...givin' it to others who don't know
they have it for up to six years.

1314
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:25,115
Can I talk to you alone.

1315
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:26,685
What is it?

1316
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:32,390
Gallo called. From now on, you can
expect practically no cooperation from him.

1317
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:36,596
He's cut off your supply of reagents,
antibodies to the HTLV virus...

1318
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,568
...almost everything you need to function.

1319
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,039
Why?

1320
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:45,236
Did you send blind samples to the French
to test their virus?

1321
01:44:45,512 --> 01:44:47,241
Yes, it's common courtesy.

1322
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,677
Tell that to Gallo.

1323
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,344
Hello.

1324
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:29,220
Dr. Francis?

1325
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:30,647
Who's calling?

1326
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,789
Dr. Gallo.

1327
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,324
This is Dr. Francis.

1328
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,392
Congratulations.

1329
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:43,230
On what?

1330
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:46,632
For helping the French with the virus.

1331
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,669
What makes you think
they didn't discover the virus?

1332
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:53,338
What makes you think I care?

1333
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:57,916
I don't understand the purpose of this call.

1334
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:01,416
That's the purpose of this call.

1335
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:16,595
My God.

1336
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:25,608
It's open.

1337
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:18,323
It is now the country's number one
health priority.

1338
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:21,890
Tonight's science correspondent
has the first of two pieces on AIDS.

1339
01:47:21,968 --> 01:47:25,199
In San Francisco, police and firemen
were issued masks to wear...

1340
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,934
...in case they have to resuscitate
AIDS victims.

1341
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:31,444
In Coronado, California,
the city suspended first aid classes...

1342
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:35,345
...because city employees feared catching
AIDS from the class mannequin.

1343
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:39,180
In San Jose, two nurses quit
rather than treat AIDS patients.

1344
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:42,580
In New York's prisons,
there have been several AIDS cases.

1345
01:47:42,656 --> 01:47:45,591
The prison guards are demanding
special protective suits.

1346
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:49,390
The city's funeral directors
are refusing to embalm AIDS victims.

1347
01:47:49,596 --> 01:47:53,657
I lost my job, my housing, I lost friends.

1348
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,301
It's not carried on the air.

1349
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:00,167
It's not like pneumonia.
That's the message we must get across.

1350
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:04,804
If the numbers stay in the general area
that they are now...

1351
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:07,403
...I do not think this represents
a great problem.

1352
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:13,742
You need a lift?

1353
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:16,446
How ya doin'?

1354
01:48:16,623 --> 01:48:20,889
Gallo says that he's found the virus
and he's got a blood test, too.

1355
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:23,360
He has a blood test
or says he has a blood test?

1356
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,263
He's got it! He's passed both tests.

1357
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,898
- That's good news.
- It's not good news.

1358
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:31,333
Because Gallo wants to take all the credit.

1359
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:34,269
And he wants the patent for the NIH.

1360
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:37,707
- If he does that the French'll sue.
- That's right. They'll sue.

1361
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:41,436
So it'll probably take years
before anything gets done.

1362
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:44,007
Drive carefully.

1363
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:47,043
It's why we do what we do.

1364
01:48:48,955 --> 01:48:50,923
It's the gift of time...

1365
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:56,021
...and the smile of healthy children.

1366
01:48:58,765 --> 01:49:00,892
That's what this means to me.

1367
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:10,972
All I can say is, thank you.

1368
01:49:15,015 --> 01:49:16,812
Congratulations.

1369
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:24,890
- You need to talk to me.
- I'm the needy one? Nice try.

1370
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:27,653
The French had the virus
a year and half ago.

1371
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:29,786
- So?
- They can prove it.

1372
01:49:30,196 --> 01:49:32,664
- Me, too. Times ten.
- In court!

1373
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:35,591
What do they pay you, the French?

1374
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:40,038
The gift of time
and the smile of healthy children.

1375
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:43,108
I've used that line 50 times
and I still believe it.

1376
01:49:43,176 --> 01:49:44,473
Who wrote it for you?

1377
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:47,138
The French are claiming
they wrote it for me.

1378
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,510
A year and a half ago, no less.

1379
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:54,520
- Did you like my phone call?
- No, but I'm beginning to understand it.

1380
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:56,453
If you understood, you wouldn't be here.

1381
01:49:56,523 --> 01:50:00,653
We can play this with charm,
intimidation, or without the bullshit!

1382
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:02,285
Explain one thing to me.

1383
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,655
Ten times ten times ten...

1384
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:08,222
...my name is in every book ever written
on the human retrovirus.

1385
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:10,963
Why would you get in bed with the French
instead of me?

1386
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:14,905
It's you against the French?
I thought we were all against the virus.

1387
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:17,170
If you go to court now, everybody loses.

1388
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:20,110
You, the people who die
while you quibble over credit...

1389
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,408
What do you want?

1390
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:25,245
To stop you from turnin' a holocaust
into an international pissing contest!

1391
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:28,116
- By letting them take the credit?
- I talked to them.

1392
01:50:28,221 --> 01:50:30,086
They're willing to settle in private.

1393
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:34,183
We must get together. There can't be
confusion among scientists in the public.

1394
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:39,254
If you go to court now when nobody's done
a goddamn thing to stop this epidemic...

1395
01:50:41,868 --> 01:50:43,665
Do what you want.

1396
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:47,505
- I've said what I came to say.
- I'm going to Switzerland.

1397
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:50,008
April 1, for a three... day conference.

1398
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:54,937
I may, or I may not,
stop in Paris on my way back.

1399
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:57,606
If I do, it'll be on one condition...

1400
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:00,816
...I meet only with my peers.

1401
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:05,248
Who besides God qualifies?

1402
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:31,883
Twenty... five minutes
is quite long enough to wait.

1403
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:39,122
Gentlemen. Francoise!

1404
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:43,659
Good to see you. You look wonderful!

1405
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:46,060
How are you?

1406
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:49,699
You lost some weight.
You look good, very good.

1407
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,696
Good to see you again.

1408
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:05,607
I've got the comparative serology results,
the EMs...

1409
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:09,446
...the gels for the different proteins,
GP... 120, 41, 24...

1410
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:13,959
Why don't you wait out in the hall?
I'll call if I need you.

1411
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:18,455
What?

1412
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:21,967
You don't think I'd discuss anything
with you in the room?

1413
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:30,234
Fine.

1414
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:44,253
So you made some good progress?
We did, too.

1415
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,707
Come in.

1416
01:53:13,553 --> 01:53:15,521
We've agreed to write three papers...

1417
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:18,853
...which will be published
in the same issue of Science magazine.

1418
01:53:18,925 --> 01:53:21,291
The CDC will do the serology paper.

1419
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:24,694
Dr. Gallo will write the paper
analyzing nucleic acids.

1420
01:53:24,764 --> 01:53:27,392
We'll do the paper discussing the proteins.

1421
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,994
We've all agreed to make
a joint announcement together...

1422
01:53:31,204 --> 01:53:32,865
...and share the credit.

1423
01:53:33,173 --> 01:53:35,664
We'll keep each other informed.

1424
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:43,749
From the first day that AIDS
was identified...

1425
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,783
...in 1981.

1426
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:49,946
HHS scientists and their medical allies...

1427
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:54,919
...have never stopped searching
for the answer to the mystery of AIDS.

1428
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:59,029
And not only have we found the cause
to AIDS...

1429
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:01,429
Didn't she have her teeth done?

1430
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,568
...a blood test will be available.

1431
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:09,338
The man who discovered the virus...

1432
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:14,275
...which causes AIDS, excuse me...

1433
01:54:14,547 --> 01:54:18,711
...is our eminent Dr. Robert Gallo.

1434
01:54:23,723 --> 01:54:26,419
Thank you, Secretary Heckler.

1435
01:54:27,827 --> 01:54:31,786
I should start and be brief by saying that...

1436
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:35,196
...there are obviously
other major contributors.

1437
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:39,704
In our own group,
I have to mention someone...

1438
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:45,208
...who came to us from Czechoslovakia,
Dr. Mika Popovic.

1439
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:49,045
A lot of this couldn't have been done
without the previous support...

1440
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:53,814
...from the Cancer Institute
on the earlier HTLV isolates.

1441
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,455
I've seen discussions
about the work in Paris.

1442
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:02,756
There was, there is not,
there never has been...

1443
01:55:03,796 --> 01:55:07,698
...fights or controversies between us
and the group in France.

1444
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:11,997
I came back from a meeting
astonished to see this kind of discussion.

1445
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:15,439
The laboratory at the Pasteur Institute
and my laboratory...

1446
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:17,668
...have been friends for about 15 years.

1447
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:19,402
We are in fact collaborating.

1448
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,138
I can't watch.

1449
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:29,049
Phase One is finished. We've found
the virus, we're working on a blood test.

1450
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:31,823
This is my proposal for Phase Two:

1451
01:55:32,525 --> 01:55:34,823
Prevention, education and cure.

1452
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:36,953
If that goes through...

1453
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:41,328
...I wanna be transferred to San Francisco
and work on it from there.

1454
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:45,636
$37 million a year?

1455
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,305
- That's totally unrealistic.
- It's not.

1456
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,836
It's cheap.

1457
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:53,969
It's about 15 cents per person
to make the entire population safer.

1458
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:57,272
- It's what's needed.
- I'm sure it is, but you won't get it.

1459
01:55:57,350 --> 01:56:00,046
If you ask for this much, you'll get nothing.

1460
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:03,213
- Try to re... figure for $4 million...
- I won't re... figure it.

1461
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,917
It's an honest report.
I want you to send it in.

1462
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:09,257
I'm tryin' to tell you
you're going about this the wrong way.

1463
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:14,266
It's cheap. Wait a few years, and we'll
be talking about billions in health care.

1464
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:22,365
I'll send it in.

1465
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:26,574
Four more years.

1466
01:56:27,947 --> 01:56:28,936
Thank you.

1467
01:56:29,482 --> 01:56:31,643
Thank you all very much.

1468
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:39,485
It seems we did this four years ago.

1469
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:47,565
Nancy and I would like to express...

1470
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:51,761
Nancy!

1471
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:56,339
This is not a political issue,
this is a health issue.

1472
01:56:56,542 --> 01:56:59,306
This is not a gay issue,
this is a human issue.

1473
01:56:59,379 --> 01:57:03,179
Had this disease afflicted children or
members of the Chamber of Commerce...

1474
01:57:03,282 --> 01:57:06,479
...the Reagan administration
would've broken down all doors...

1475
01:57:06,586 --> 01:57:09,817
...in order to push the government
on all fronts to deal with it.

1476
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:13,752
I came here today in the hope
that my epitaph would not read:

1477
01:57:14,293 --> 01:57:16,090
"I died of red tape."

1478
01:57:16,295 --> 01:57:17,922
Four more years!

1479
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:27,827
Can I get a coffee and a jelly donut?

1480
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:38,438
Are you coming from work
or going to work?

1481
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,109
Going to.

1482
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,838
You?

1483
01:58:43,516 --> 01:58:45,143
I couldn't sleep.

1484
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:50,647
I heard your Phase Two proposal
was turned down.

1485
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:53,458
Officially, "too expensive."

1486
01:58:53,559 --> 01:58:56,426
Unofficially,
and they say this diplomatically:

1487
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:59,597
"You should look busy and do nothing."

1488
01:59:02,668 --> 01:59:05,603
Was that meant to be diplomatic,
how you just told me?

1489
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,871
It was meant to sound angry.

1490
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:11,167
At me or at you?

1491
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,934
At me?

1492
01:59:13,713 --> 01:59:14,975
Why me?

1493
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:19,615
I don't know. I guess, both. All right?

1494
01:59:20,887 --> 01:59:23,447
Sometimes I look at you
in awe and wonder.

1495
01:59:24,423 --> 01:59:25,720
I mean it.

1496
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:29,291
How you wind your way through
bureaucratic bullshit every day...

1497
01:59:29,395 --> 01:59:31,056
...and never get a drop on you.

1498
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:34,156
- How do you do it?
- By not asking questions like that.

1499
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,393
Insult me if you like, directly...

1500
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:40,268
...but don't insult both of us by disguising
this as some kind of compliment.

1501
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,906
Insult you? How?

1502
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:45,910
The awe and the wonder? I mean it.

1503
01:59:50,049 --> 01:59:52,779
I asked the Second Floor for a transfer.

1504
01:59:53,986 --> 01:59:56,045
Can you help push it through?

1505
01:59:56,222 --> 01:59:58,315
I already have. It's done.

1506
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:03,189
Really? Where to?

1507
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:07,833
- How do you want this, diplomatically?
- I've gotten used to angry.

1508
02:00:07,934 --> 02:00:09,128
San Francisco.

1509
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:11,828
Reward or exile?

1510
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:21,844
If you hate it, why spend your entire career
working for the government?

1511
02:00:25,918 --> 02:00:29,786
Remember what Willie Sutton said when
they asked him why he robbed banks?

1512
02:00:29,855 --> 02:00:33,188
"Because that's where the money is."
This is where the diseases are.

1513
02:00:34,694 --> 02:00:36,093
Bugs.

1514
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:45,495
Sometimes I look at you
with awe and wonder.

1515
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:13,423
There it is.

1516
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,758
A little cake for the maverick among us.

1517
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:19,464
Something the boys
in the retroviral lab whipped up.

1518
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:31,379
Excuse me, can I speak to you alone
for a second, please?

1519
02:01:37,023 --> 02:01:38,456
You might need this.

1520
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:43,587
That's great, they're rose... colored.

1521
02:01:44,463 --> 02:01:46,795
- Definitely you.
- Well done.

1522
02:01:47,266 --> 02:01:48,631
Looks good.

1523
02:01:51,737 --> 02:01:54,501
- To Don Francis.
- Long may he live.

1524
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:57,435
- Speech!
- Say something.

1525
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:06,247
I got a call from
our Washington lawyer.

1526
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:08,810
Gallo got the patent
for the blood test.

1527
02:02:09,455 --> 02:02:12,982
Even though we applied five months
before him.

1528
02:02:13,759 --> 02:02:17,923
Here's Gallo's virus which is
almost identical to ours.

1529
02:02:18,497 --> 02:02:19,725
Look at the photo.

1530
02:02:19,999 --> 02:02:23,730
It's a picture of our virus LAV,
which he calls his virus...

1531
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:25,960
...and names it HTLVIII.

1532
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:33,245
The only way to compare one virus
to another is by DNA.

1533
02:02:37,883 --> 02:02:44,584
Put together a team to break
the genetic code of both viruses.

1534
02:02:46,058 --> 02:02:47,855
This time he's gone too far.

1535
02:02:56,502 --> 02:03:00,233
The genes of any two different isolates
of the same virus...

1536
02:03:00,673 --> 02:03:05,303
...are expected to deviate from each other,
usually by 6 to 20 percent.

1537
02:03:05,745 --> 02:03:12,309
The genetic sequence
of Dr. Gallo's HTLVIII prototype isolate...

1538
02:03:12,785 --> 02:03:17,154
...varies from our virus, called LAV...

1539
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:19,357
...by less than 1 percent.

1540
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:23,295
They are identical to a degree that would
not be anticipated...

1541
02:03:23,362 --> 02:03:26,923
...from any two isolates
from the same family.

1542
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,032
Thank you.

1543
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:32,933
Are you suggesting that Gallo
stole it from the French?

1544
02:03:33,339 --> 02:03:37,139
I think that question would
best be answered by someone else.

1545
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:46,142
Excuse me,
I'm not quite sure what he was saying.

1546
02:03:46,786 --> 02:03:50,882
The virus Gallo has
is the same kind the French have?

1547
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:56,453
Not the same kind. It's the same virus
exactly, from the same patient.

1548
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:22,682
You okay?

1549
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:26,453
Sit down.

1550
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:37,227
Should I call an ambulance?

1551
02:04:39,839 --> 02:04:41,500
Stay there.

1552
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:15,206
I just heard.

1553
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:17,741
Let's go up.

1554
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:35,789
Hello.

1555
02:05:38,764 --> 02:05:40,163
This is Don.

1556
02:05:41,767 --> 02:05:43,394
Nice to meet you.

1557
02:05:44,803 --> 02:05:46,532
Look who's here.

1558
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:48,238
Is that Don?

1559
02:05:49,775 --> 02:05:51,367
There's two of you.

1560
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:55,905
We're both Don,
don't ask me which is which.

1561
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:07,287
One moment he's talking perfectly
coherently, the next he's talking gibberish.

1562
02:06:08,961 --> 02:06:12,829
I'm gonna take Kico for a cup of coffee.
You wanna join us?

1563
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:17,292
- No, I think...
- I'll be back in a minute.

1564
02:07:24,703 --> 02:07:27,900
Would you hand me my...

1565
02:07:34,913 --> 02:07:36,141
Glasses?

1566
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:49,526
Am I talking gibberish?

1567
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:52,430
No, not to me.

1568
02:08:01,874 --> 02:08:03,967
This didn't have to happen.

1569
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:07,978
We could've stopped it.

1570
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:11,107
Can you still?

1571
02:08:13,652 --> 02:08:15,620
Can we still stop it?

1572
02:08:16,755 --> 02:08:18,222
I don't know.

1573
02:08:21,827 --> 02:08:25,729
I used to be afraid of dying.

1574
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:30,096
I'm not anymore.

1575
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:34,836
I'm more afraid of what happens...

1576
02:08:37,242 --> 02:08:39,870
...to the people who live.

1577
02:21:42,242 --> 02:21:43,870
{{{the end}}}
