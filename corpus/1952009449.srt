1
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,475
Be careful!
It might be dangerous.

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,815
Take it easy! Take it easy!

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,714
You'll be fine. Just fine

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:34,400
A basic rule in journalism is to always thank

5
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,768
the person you interview

6
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,567
for any exclusive or secret revealed.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,806
I have to admit that this one

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,741
...is the hardest interview
I've ever done in my career.

9
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:51,007
But nothing's impossible
for Miranda Tovar.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,879
You know?

11
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,119
Being a prostitute is as hard

12
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,853
as being a reporter.

13
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,862
Something you want to add?

14
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,936
Well.

15
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,604
In that case we'll leave this interview here.

16
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,313
I hope I see you again some day.

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,656
See you in hell, Senator Davis.

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,772
"The Wild Reporter"

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,097
I told you as soon as
you knock at the right doors

20
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:47,332
you would start climbing
your way to success.

21
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,533
Sister, I'm so happy
you'll live here with me.

22
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,577
It smells like something burned.
I think it is you.

23
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,511
You're crazy!
- Yes, it is you.

24
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,631
Listen, soon I'll stop
being a reporter.

25
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,717
I will become the director
of The Publisher.

26
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,218
I think you should keep like this,

27
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,691
doing a good job and everything
else will just come along.

28
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:15,126
No sister, in this life
nothing comes by its own.

29
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,188
I'm a woman who sets goals
and get there, at any cost.

30
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,166
Any!

31
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,638
Hello! I'm home.

32
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,732
How are you, sweetie?

33
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,109
You are so pretty.

34
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,812
Hi Miranda, how are you?

35
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:39,586
Her boss is very happy,
for her article about immigration.

36
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,988
Oh really? Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:43,488
Well, I'm leaving now.

38
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,753
I have to get ready.
I'm meeting my boss later on.

39
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,095
Sweetie.
I missed you.

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,190
There's no turning back.
You'll have to suck it up.

41
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,592
Come on, chief.

42
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,931
You know I'm the best
qualified for this case.

43
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,057
Give me this investigation.

44
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,294
No Jose Luis.

45
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:34,333
You think you can choose
your cases as you wish?

46
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,746
When you're chief of this department
you can do whatever you want.

47
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,940
All right, fine!

48
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,083
And, what am I going to do now?

49
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,583
Arrest bums?

50
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,416
No, something better.

51
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,091
You're going to take care
of a drug dealing business

52
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,424
going on in a stripper club.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,395
But boss, this.

54
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,761
I want you to be in charge.
That's it.

55
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,133
"The Pamperers"?

56
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,540
Don't you speak Spanish?

57
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,213
"The Pamperers".

58
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,112
What exactly you want me
to develop in this interview?

59
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:27,121
The article you wrote about
Senator Davis's life was a hit.

60
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:31,520
By the way, do you know what
happened to Senator Davis?

61
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,201
No.
His car exploded. He's dead.

62
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,901
But, what happened? When?

63
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,355
This morning. And that interview
we published today.

64
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,775
couldn't have been more timely.
The edition sold out.

65
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,438
It's a tragedy!

66
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,814
We all will die some day,
won't we?

67
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,220
Besides no one liked him much.
Now let's get into business.

68
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,815
I want that article about
the life of a stripper.

69
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,924
Mr. Gabriel, but... I think.

70
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,679
No buts! I want you to disguise
as a stripper.

71
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:06,871
I want it to be from
a woman's point of view

72
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:10,028
who's in the need of strip tease
to make money.

73
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,872
Are you asking me to turn
into a stripper?

74
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,806
Just imagine the headlines.

75
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:23,647
Strip tease! Out of pleasure,
need or money?

76
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,749
The life of a stripper.

77
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,287
Special report by Miranda Tovar.

78
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,187
Of course I won't strip.

79
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,767
Of course you will strip.

80
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,260
You're the one who came here
looking for a job.

81
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,334
But it this really necessary?

82
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,146
Listen. I have my hands
in many things right now.

83
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,101
All I can offer you is a job
as a dancer.

84
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:04,622
And besides dancing,
you also have to strip.

85
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,019
I need to see the merchandise
you may offer in my business.

86
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,829
If you're not interested
don't waste my time.

87
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,901
Very good!

88
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,413
Talent my ass!

89
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,214
I won't allow you to talk that way
about Miranda. She's my sister.

90
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,010
I'm sure she got the job
by sleeping with someone.

91
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,085
Shame on you!
How could you say that?

92
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,161
I'm sorry, baby. Forgive me.

93
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,563
How do you dare to judge her
like that without knowing her?

94
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,768
Right. I'm an idiot.
Please forgive me.

95
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,708
She suffered a lot with dad's death
and mom's schizophrenia.

96
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,905
I want to make it up for
all the years we were apart.

97
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,942
Right. It won't happen again.
I promise.

98
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:30,108
You could be the show sensation.
What was your name again?

99
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,636
Well, never mind.

100
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,171
My name is Miranda.
- I'm Shakis.

101
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:43,213
Now I present to you, the only
the sensational, the red-hot.

102
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,381
Miranda, the wild woman!

103
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,733
If I had half of what you have
more than enough.

104
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,668
I could keep my husband.

105
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,997
You're hired.

106
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,878
"The Pamperers".

107
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,352
This is your work place.

108
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,989
Girls.
Please come here.

109
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,752
Welcome the latest acquisition
of "The Pamperers".

110
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,265
Welcome. I'm Candy.
- Hi!

111
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,069
Shall we go?

112
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,897
Go where?

113
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,534
I forgot. It's beach day!

114
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:44,850
Every two days we go to the beach
and have fun getting a tan.

115
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,760
Moron, can't you see
where you step?

116
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,328
I'm very sorry.
It was an accident.

117
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,594
Accident! Can't you open
your eyes wide before you walk?

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,260
You're too cute to
have that temper.

119
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,166
I'm sure you don't even have
a boyfriend. It's a shame.

120
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,701
Lots of meat but not hungry.

121
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,641
What's wrong with you?
- That's none of your business!

122
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,006
You are crazy.
- Yeah right.

123
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,952
Look at this mess.

124
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,492
Miranda. Good company you got there.
Who's your friend?

125
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,190
My friend?
I don't know this moron.

126
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,853
He just walked over me.
- I'm sorry.

127
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,897
Do you like walking over people?

128
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,217
Wouldn't you like to walk over me?

129
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:17,131
No, thanks.
What's his problem?

130
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,379
Would you like my phone number?

131
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,874
Very kind.
We'll see each other again.

132
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,918
Men. Who can understand them?

133
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,499
Who understands men?
Are you sure you put them here?

134
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,899
Please, don't get started.

135
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,868
I know where I put
my blue boxers.

136
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,803
They're my favorite.
They're not here.

137
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,442
I know that because
I've looked everywhere.

138
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,840
What's wrong with you?

139
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,615
You're acting worse than a child.
You lose everything

140
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,311
and then you try
to blame it all on me.

141
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,513
You're not the same woman.

142
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,023
Ever since your sister moved in
you haven't been the same.

143
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,744
Will you start with that again?

144
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,460
Yes, because you're different!

145
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,131
This place is turning into a hell.

146
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,407
And you know what?
I hate your sister!

147
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,466
I hate her, Raquel!

148
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,429
It doesn't matter to my family
whether I'm a secretary or a stripper.

149
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,404
I'm doing this out of need.

150
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,944
We all say the same thing.
But after a while you get used

151
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,382
to easy money, to presents
and you go on sinking in debts,

152
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,441
until it's impossible to stop.

153
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,949
You do this for love or pleasure?

154
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,324
Miranda.
You know, this sounds like an interview.

155
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:21,567
I'm saving to pay for my studies.
I know this won't be forever.

156
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:23,626
Candy, come with us
to the bathroom.

157
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,996
We'll talk later.

158
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,508
By the way, that swimsuit
looks great on you.

159
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,841
You will pay for this!

160
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,078
Hey, give me that.

161
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,055
Give me back my top.

162
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,542
Someone should teach
you good manners.

163
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,994
I'm telling you to give
me back my top.

164
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,435
But I asked you for that
report last month.

165
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,836
Don't you know the competition
is getting all the market?

166
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:06,210
Senator Davis' interview
was a hit.

167
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:11,350
That was good. Scandal, death,
that's what sell news papers.

168
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,113
But we can't rest now.

169
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:18,324
Miranda is working on that.
She'll hand it over by...

170
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,418
Make sure she hands it in today.

171
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,361
Scandal. Violence.

172
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,626
Those are the ingredients that
makes people to buy our paper.

173
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,998
Your position is at stake here.

174
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,111
I'll call the police if you don't
give me back that top.

175
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:43,104
I'm so scared.
I would like to see that.

176
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,749
May I answer that?
- Get out of here, moron!

177
00:14:55,461 --> 00:15:00,421
Hello? Yes, I'm on that.

178
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:06,227
Today? All right.

179
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,799
Some prince? Poor boy!
He has no idea of your temper.

180
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,779
Give me that.

181
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:26,388
You're wild, but there's a huge
emptiness of love in your eyes.

182
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,069
Didn't you say you don't know him?

183
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,269
Girls, you're impossible.
You're easier than the rule of one.

184
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,776
You're a great kisser. Miranda.

185
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,147
By the way, my name is Jose Luis.

186
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,548
Go away!

187
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,646
Let's go.

188
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,033
Heavy hand but nice lips.

189
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,746
Miranda. What a woman!

190
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,521
Hello?

191
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:38,218
Are you sure?
Okay, I'm on my way.

192
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,263
Please forgive me.

193
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:54,035
I know it's not an excuse,

194
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,711
but all of a sudden our life has
changed after Miranda moved in.

195
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,514
She has been through a lot.
She has no one else.

196
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,190
After dad passed away.

197
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,716
our mother was confined
in a mental institution.

198
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,653
She had many foster parents.

199
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,003
Life hasn't been easy for her.
And now she's happy at last.

200
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,800
You never told me.

201
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,008
Dad killed himself and that made
our mother to lose her mind.

202
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,641
Miranda was taken to
an adoption house.

203
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,316
I couldn't obtain her custody
because I couldn't support her.

204
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,129
Stop crying.
Please forgive me.

205
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,600
Forgive me.
I am an idiot.

206
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:51,001
Listen, don't cry anymore.

207
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:56,633
I promise I'll change my
attitude toward her.

208
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,716
Don't listen to her.

209
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,914
She has always been jealous of
those prettier than her.

210
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,225
Your family knows you're a stripper?

211
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,861
Are you out of your mind?
My mom thinks I'm a receptionist.

212
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,394
If she finds out she'll go nuts.

213
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,330
Poor mom. Do you have a family?

214
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,072
No. I don't have anyone.

215
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,847
Today is my lucky day.

216
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,382
This looks like a crime.

217
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,650
Heels.

218
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,305
Me, these shoes? No way.

219
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,274
At least not this kind of shoes.

220
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,412
I came here to work as a dancer,
not as a prostitute.

221
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,747
Oh, dear! This is not the
Convent of Charity.

222
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,885
And believe me, when you see
all that money in front of your nose,

223
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,820
you'll put all those baths
of purity aside.

224
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:54,660
Fine. So, do you have
a more screaming color?

225
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,262
Something like bright green.

226
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,664
I knew it.
No one can resist the money.

227
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:08,837
You're not here to decide.
You're here to obey.

228
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,370
All right.

229
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,281
I know I'm here to obey, chief.

230
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:22,647
But I specialized in plots.

231
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,190
I'll say it again.
The decision was made.

232
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:31,822
And I'm asking you to keep
away from Senator Davis' case.

233
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,891
I was told you've been
sneaking around.

234
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,568
I found something out.

235
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,529
What are you talking about?

236
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,873
It was not an accident.
I think he was murdered.

237
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,975
Really? And who murdered him?

238
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,514
I suspect it was a woman.

239
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,349
A woman?

240
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,595
That's what men come
to see in this club.

241
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,998
To watch the exotic dance.

242
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:19,475
Your sensuality and horniness.

243
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,344
Come here.
Between you and me.

244
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,446
No one knows how to dance with
that pole better than me.

245
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,958
What's so special about it?

246
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,621
It's just going once or twice
around the pole and that's it.

247
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,565
Miranda! You're being
very disrespectful.

248
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:50,469
Please God, let this I just heard not be an
advance of my punishment at the Last Judgment.

249
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,614
Listen, when you're up here
with all those thirsty men

250
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,245
looking at you with lust,

251
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,482
you have to seduce them
with your lure.

252
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,660
You have to picture yourself

253
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:18,225
making love with that pole.

254
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:27,104
An as intensity goes up,
you have to get more into it.

255
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:40,781
Remember, the more
you heat your audience,

256
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,376
the more money they'll pay.
So you'll get more money.

257
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,227
They'll get thirstier
and they'll buy more drinks!

258
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,732
You're a thief!
Give me back my purse!

259
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,175
Sweetie.
Thank you for being so understanding.

260
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,446
You know I would do anything
for you, sweetie.

261
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,785
We're the only family Miranda has.

262
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,991
Okay, stop worrying.
Every thing will change.

263
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:23,235
Today I work part shift but if they
ask me to stay longer I will.

264
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,726
We need the extra money.

265
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,307
Miranda could collaborate
a little bit, don't you think?

266
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,104
Sweetie!

267
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,601
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:44,621
Don't start, come on.

269
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,716
I have to work.
Stay a little longer.

270
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,788
Okay, that's it.

271
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,466
I'll call you later. Bye.

272
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,044
You won't accuse me
of something I didn't do.

273
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,149
Listen, darling. You better calm down
if you don't want me to teach you

274
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,718
a lesson so you know where
your place is in here.

275
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,486
Time out, girls!
What's going on, Casilda?

276
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,058
This prick stole my glow
case that I use in my make-up.

277
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,125
I didn't steal anything.

278
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,262
I'm sure you did it when
you were alone on the beach.

279
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:28,198
Stupid! You're a bastard!
- Casilda! Calm down.

280
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,394
Listen, this is not a market.

281
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,201
Don't you see this is
a high class club?

282
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,577
And I won't allow you to fight
like two vulgar greengrocers.

283
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,671
I want my glows back.

284
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:50,311
I have a set of glows I got from
the flea market in Los Angeles.

285
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,257
You will look stunning.

286
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,526
But if you fight.

287
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:01,296
I'll kick your asses out of here.
The two of you.

288
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,328
You know I do what I promise.

289
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,686
I knew you were into something.

290
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,886
What is this?

291
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:38,795
Oh dear! Life is full of surprises.
What is your game?

292
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,507
We're going to find out right away.

293
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,998
Leave my recorder alone!

294
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,548
I couldn't find the glows I got
from Hollywood, but I got these

295
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:53,450
in another flea market.
They're as good as the others.

296
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,547
Is something wrong?
- Nothing!

297
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,346
We were just talking girl's stuff.

298
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,285
You know, I'm an expert in that.

299
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,093
Now put this on so you see
what shades these glows have.

300
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,996
Be careful. I'll be watching you.

301
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,378
My God.

302
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,040
What were you talking about?

303
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:30,517
I don't know if I should tell you.
I think I shouldn't.

304
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,924
Come on!

305
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,628
We shouldn't have secrets.

306
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,687
You're right.

307
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,624
She told terrible things about you.

308
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,899
Your lack of humanity, your abuses.

309
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,530
and specially your drinking problem.

310
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,474
Me, a drunk!

311
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,852
I may be gay. I may be a bitch.

312
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:03,254
but never a drunk!

313
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,188
Take it easy.

314
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:10,028
I should go home. I have to get
ready for my first night.

315
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:13,657
I swear I didn't believe any
of what she said to me.

316
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:19,025
Especially that thing about
your problem with stomach gases.

317
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,102
Bye.

318
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,044
Gases. me?

319
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,973
Fabian.

320
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,939
Miranda.

321
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,916
I think this is yours.

322
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,751
Yes, they are.
Why do you have them?

323
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,983
I don't know. They just were
in the laundry the other day.

324
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,805
I'm sorry, but there's a problem
with the shower's faucet.

325
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,002
And I have to take a shower
before I go to work.

326
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,677
Are you going to work at nights?

327
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,647
A special report. You know how
a reporter's life is.

328
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,606
Would you help me?

329
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,411
Okay, let's go.

330
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:26,753
It was nothing.
- Oh, my!

331
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,536
Apparently the screw was loose.

332
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,026
Really?
- Yes.

333
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,269
You know, I'm crazy about you.

334
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:52,405
Darling, I'm back!

335
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,752
Miranda?

336
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,226
Miranda?

337
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,768
I don't know why Fabian
can't get along with you,

338
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,100
when both are so messy.

339
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,330
Miranda! Miranda!

340
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,734
Yes, what is it?

341
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:26,773
I'm very happy that you're with us.
And Fabian is happy too.

342
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,714
Could you wait until I finish
showering for us to talk?

343
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,958
Are you telling me you're ashamed,
of your sister seeing you naked?

344
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,845
Have you see Fabian?

345
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,297
Sure, a while ago.

346
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,664
Didn't you see him?

347
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,408
I swear I don't like that Miranda
woman at all.

348
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:59,073
I don't think she's a bad person.
I know what it is. You're jealous.

349
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,844
Me, jealous? Of her? Come on!

350
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:08,259
Admit it. Clients will die when
they see Miranda dancing.

351
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,193
You're going to lose some clients.

352
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,548
Over her? Oh, come on, Candy!
She can't even dance.

353
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,833
She may have a great body,
but she's too silly.

354
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:24,742
Clients like boldness, sensuality,
and she's harder than a board.

355
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,404
Anyway, you shouldn't mess with her.

356
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:32,650
She declared war on me already.
But I'll find out what she's up to.

357
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,620
I'm telling you she had
a tape recorder in her purse.

358
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:37,954
A tape recorder! What for?

359
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,755
How would I know!
But I have to find out.

360
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,428
Girls.

361
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,965
Shakis! Darling!
The glows look great on me.

362
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,766
You were right. They are better
than those from Hollywood.

363
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,300
As I was saying,
girls.

364
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:02,479
I want to introduce a very dear
and special person.

365
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,249
He is Mister Sugar.

366
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,252
Pleased to meet you.

367
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,088
He will be honoring us
with his presence.

368
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,718
So tonight I want your total
cooperation, okay?

369
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,726
I know I'm not perfect.
I have my flaws.

370
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,533
Like people say, breed crows and
they will gouge your eyes out.

371
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,771
I've been like a mother to you.

372
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,312
You're ungrateful.

373
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,871
That's all I got to say to you.

374
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,110
You're a poisonous viper!

375
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:50,983
Me, a drunk! Never!
Let's go.

376
00:33:54,966 --> 00:34:00,268
Damn Miranda. She shouldn't
have messed with me.

377
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,580
I'm so happy for you.

378
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,551
Will you come back late?
- I don't know.

379
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:15,403
I have to do this report.

380
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:17,186
And what is it about?

381
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,418
About the night life in the city.

382
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,429
Okay, but don't forget your cell phone
in case you need anything.

383
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:25,395
All right.

384
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,523
Fine. I love you, bye.

385
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:41,235
What do you say?
Shall we wrap this up?

386
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,813
No.
- Please don't say that.

387
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,281
You'll have to wait until tomorrow.

388
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,919
I want to make you mine now.

389
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,793
We'll do it tomorrow
all the times you want.

390
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,567
You drive me crazy.

391
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,116
Of course it was that stupid of Miranda
to put those ideas in Shakis' head.

392
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,981
You can't be certain.
You know how Shakis is.

393
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,024
He must be "on his days".

394
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,063
Right, don't listen to her.
You know he likes drama.

395
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:34,793
He must have fought
with his "husband".

396
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,068
I'm going to teach that woman
how to respect me.

397
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,408
Well, sister, see you later.

398
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,970
Do you have batteries in your phone?
- Yes. Bye.

399
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,713
Is something wrong?

400
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:57,187
There is. But I don't know
if I should ask you.

401
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,574
After all who am I to get
in your personal life?

402
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:03,494
You're my sister. You may
ask me whatever you want.

403
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:11,657
I never thought you and Fabian
would like wild sex.

404
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,437
What are you talking about?

405
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,305
Come on!
With me you don't have to pretend.

406
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,742
I had a boyfriend who also
liked that stuff.

407
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:26,305
I don't understand.
- What do you mean?

408
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:31,955
Come on Raquel, I mean that
huge bite on Fabian's chest.

409
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,026
He was watering the
garden without a shirt.

410
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,330
I went there to give him some
clothes that were in my laundry.

411
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,981
And I saw the mark.

412
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,597
It must be nice to be able to do all
the crazy things with your husband.

413
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,903
Yes, but.

414
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,498
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

415
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:56,881
It's the most natural thing, to vent
your carnal desires with your husband.

416
00:36:56,916 --> 00:37:00,578
Well, I'm off to work now.

417
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,879
I'm going to earn my bread
with my forehead's sweat.

418
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,229
What's wrong with you?

419
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,965
I'm furious! I'm not feeling well.

420
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,502
You know, you should
calm down a little.

421
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,004
Everything is that bastard
woman's fault.

422
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,005
But she won't laugh at me.
You'll see.

423
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:34,085
I think you're overreacting.
You know Shakis is a drama queen.

424
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,215
But I don't have to pay
for that slut's mistakes.

425
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,511
You better calm down.

426
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:48,032
You don't have insurance,
you can't afford getting sick.

427
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:52,025
That slut is dangerous.
I'm sure she's a witch or something.

428
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,339
I've always been Shakis' best girl.

429
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:01,329
You know sometimes Shakis is like
a little boy with a new toy,

430
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:06,284
but after a while he will get bored
and he'll find someone else.

431
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:11,022
Well, I'm going to take her
out of the way for good.

432
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:14,457
Stop talking like that.
You're freaking me out.

433
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:21,399
Now let's forget about all this and
grab something to eat. I'm starving.

434
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:26,235
You're right. At least I have the lead
in this business.

435
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,970
That's the one I like to hear.
Now leave the drama for the soap operas.

436
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:39,383
Do you have any glows?
I must be looking really bad.

437
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,484
All this because of that stupid...

438
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,649
I don't have any.
Please hurry, I'm starving.

439
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:59,168
Now, with great pleasure.

440
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:04,163
I want to present to you.
The unique, the hottest.

441
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,909
Miranda, the wild!

442
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,032
But wasn't it her first time?

443
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,727
Come on, they all say the same.

444
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:45,945
We all are stripper in disguise.

445
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,752
Hey, don't fart without a notice!

446
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:55,052
Dear, why are you so quiet?
Is there something bothering you?

447
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,612
No, no, nothing.

448
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,657
I told you I'll change my
attitude toward your sister.

449
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:06,559
In fact, we talked a lot this afternoon.
You know. Yes?

450
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:15,504
Also, have you forgotten we didn't finish
something this morning? Remember?

451
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,709
Yes, I saw the mark on his chest.

452
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,613
Get out!

453
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,773
What's the matter?

454
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,119
Get out of here!
What's the matter?

455
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,282
When you feel like telling me the truth,
then you may come back.

456
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,893
I think you're losing your mind.

457
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,397
Miranda told me the truth.

458
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:06,081
Listen, I'm telling you the truth.

459
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,677
This girl is a goddess.
She'll be great for business.

460
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,917
I'm so envious. Good envy.

461
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:23,957
But you know that girl
is hotter than me.

462
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,473
Darling, you don't have to be jealous.

463
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,077
She's a woman, and you know
I don't like women.

464
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,017
Besides, you and I are
not officially dating,

465
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:42,144
just friends with rights.

466
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,393
It's a shame you're in Los Angeles.

467
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,034
Do you miss me?
Really? A lot?

468
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:00,299
Me too dear.

469
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:12,316
I miss you too.
Like a real beast.

470
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:16,013
I just want to hug you.

471
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:24,257
Listen, when you get back here make sure you
bring your friends so they see our new acquisition.

472
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,992
They're going to die!

473
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,938
I don't understand how being so hot
she's not working in Hollywood,

474
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:38,066
or in any of those Latin soap operas.

475
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:50,618
Daddy, I wish you were here.

476
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:57,783
And you better behave, okay?
Don't forget I know a lot of people.

477
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,894
Alright.

478
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,491
I have to go now.

479
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,797
There are some birds watching.

480
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,436
Walls can hear.

481
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:22,007
There are ears flying around.
if you know what I mean.

482
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,520
Alright.

483
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,487
Do you love me?
A lot?

484
00:45:27,522 --> 00:45:30,419
Tell me you miss me.

485
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:34,911
Okay, I love you, bye.

486
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:38,794
Bye, darling, bye.

487
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,604
Shouldn't you be dancing, baby?

488
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:54,208
Shakis, I want to clear things up with you.

489
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,461
I never lie.

490
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,631
And I believe you. I just want
you to accept my apologies.

491
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:16,094
I was a real prick on the beach.
I shouldn't have done what I did.

492
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,707
And then what happened
to you on stage.

493
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:22,303
Please, I don't want to talk about it.
Someone played a joke on me.

494
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,612
Have you been in this business
for a long time?

495
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,612
It's my first night.

496
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,215
What a debut!

497
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,350
I guessed so.

498
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,259
You must come here very often.

499
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,864
I'm no saint.
I've came a couple of times with friends,

500
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,991
but I'm not a vicious person either.

501
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,601
What are you looking at?

502
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,763
You're beautiful. I love you.

503
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,202
But you don't know me.

504
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:58,373
And I'm not about making out
with strangers.

505
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,716
You're right. I'm Jose Luis Duran.
I'm a police detective.

506
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,590
Why are you telling me that?

507
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,362
First because this morning
you needed a cop.

508
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,196
Well, here I am.

509
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:18,634
And second, because we heard there's
a drug dealing business going on here.

510
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,368
Do you know anything?

511
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,833
I don't know if I should tell you.

512
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,269
Trust me.

513
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,016
Alright, listen.

514
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,222
There's a girl, her name is Casilda.
She has something to do with it.

515
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:42,960
She threatened me because I busted
her selling that crap to a client.

516
00:47:42,995 --> 00:47:46,088
No one can know I told you.
They would kill me.

517
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:52,427
Thank you, gorgeous.
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

518
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,383
Shakis. I can't believe you.

519
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:12,289
How could you believe
in that slut instead of me?

520
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:15,325
Life has taught me well.
But you trust me.

521
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,825
You trusted me.

522
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,763
But you're like a...
Like a mother to you.

523
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:22,731
I wouldn't dare to betray you.

524
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,935
What I am, what I know,
I owe to you.

525
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,635
That's why it hurts so much.

526
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,797
Because there's nothing
worse than treason.

527
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,101
Do you remember when I?

528
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:38,649
When with my own hands
I made your first dress you wore here.

529
00:48:38,684 --> 00:48:41,482
With these hands!

530
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,653
Remember?

531
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,555
Shakis. How could I forget it?

532
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,585
It was the dress you were wearing
the day you met your boyfriend.

533
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,764
I never said that,
please believe me.

534
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:01,004
I've learned people change.
It's a rule of life.

535
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,565
But I haven't changed!
Believe me.

536
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:09,308
Stop it! Now, get back to work.
It's a great night.

537
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:36,132
I feel the pain a mother feels when
her children turn their backs on her.

538
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:47,381
But I have to stop crying now.
I don't want to ruin my make-up.

539
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:59,663
A lot of men out there are waiting
for me, and Shakis must shine.

540
00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:02,791
Always.
I must go.

541
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,862
Now stop crying.

542
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,679
The show must go on.

543
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:48,377
Miranda! Why are you
getting home so late?

544
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,280
Yes, it's a little late.
What are you doing here?

545
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:57,275
Raquel is acting very strange.
She kicked me out of the bedroom.

546
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:03,427
Oh, Fabian.
It's okay. She'll be fine tomorrow.

547
00:51:03,462 --> 00:51:06,123
Take a seat.

548
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,729
What is it?

549
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,772
I don't know if I should tell you.

550
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,499
Tell me what?

551
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,572
My sister is cheating on you.

552
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,312
Are you kidding me?

553
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,650
You're a good man. You don't
deserve her treason.

554
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,525
That's why I couldn't hold it
anymore and I kissed you.

555
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,859
Because it's not fair that you
give her all your love and she...

556
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,024
While she is screwing
with another man.

557
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,070
Stop kidding me Miranda.

558
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,532
Don't be a fool!

559
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:58,782
These flowers were in her car.
And she will deny it.

560
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:01,182
And you will get hurt.

561
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:08,553
We have to bust her to set her up.

562
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:23,399
Wait. Take it easy. Stay with me.
Calm down.

563
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:53,527
They're like my daughters, detective.
I can't believe what you're telling me.

564
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,774
It will be just a preventive questioning.
We haven't found any evidence,

565
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:00,470
but there's an accusation
against her.

566
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:07,817
Shakis, could you wait until tomorrow?
I'm exhausted. I want to rest.

567
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,455
I feel sorry for you Casilda.
To screw your future just like that.

568
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,286
Don't you know about shame?

569
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,665
No! Wait.
What is all this about?

570
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,998
I'm innocent!
I haven't done anything.

571
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,774
My sister is shameless,
and a fool.

572
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,943
You're the best lover
in the world.

573
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,791
Don't stop.
Fabian wait.

574
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,292
Hello?

575
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,370
No, boss. I don't sleep.

576
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,540
Yes. I'll deliver it right now
before closure.

577
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,749
I have to go.
- No, where?

578
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,657
I have to work.

579
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:27,823
No.
Don't leave me like this.

580
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,866
Miranda!

581
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,924
Miranda?
- Yes, boss.

582
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:45,138
You should see her.

583
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,350
She looks like she was
taken out of a soap opera.

584
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:51,219
I don't care.
The fact is that the bosses

585
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:55,425
are very pleased how fast
we put two and two together.

586
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,725
You think that woman
will lead us to something?

587
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,891
We'll find out right now.

588
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,708
Why did he cheat on me?
I gave him everything!

589
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:18,398
Because that's how men are.
They're trash, worse than beasts.

590
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:23,053
Not Fabian. He never failed me.
He always gave me all his love.

591
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:28,013
Oh sister. You have got so
much to learn about men.

592
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,895
All they want is to fulfill
their instincts, like animals.

593
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,365
That mark on Fabian's chest
must have an explanation.

594
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,765
Of course it does.

595
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:43,740
Fabian has a lover and he's
planning to escape with her.

596
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:47,340
No, Fabian is my husband.
He can't do that to me.

597
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:50,905
Raquel! Don't even think
about confronting him.

598
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,381
He has to explain to me.

599
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,817
No. He will deny it.

600
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,588
and he'll find a way to make
you think you're the one to blame.

601
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,890
What am I going to do?

602
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:14,395
Bust him. Ruin him.

603
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,999
Today I was going to tell him.

604
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,773
I'm pregnant.
Me and Fabian will have a child.

605
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:41,398
<i>Senator Davis. You drove me crazy
since I interviewed you.</i>

606
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:43,662
<i>You're so beautiful, Miranda.</i>

607
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,432
And you so stupid in trusting me.

608
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:58,947
<i>It is a spectacular night,
filled with stars and dreams.</i>

609
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:04,621
<i>The low passions of the night become the
accomplice of an urgent need to survive</i>

610
00:57:04,656 --> 00:57:08,318
<i>Mixed with broken wings
of fame aspirations.</i>

611
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:14,931
<i>The night has been born and from the hell's
core, like if coming out from the Avernus</i>

612
00:57:14,966 --> 00:57:19,425
<i>Someone dances at the
rhythm of an exotic music.</i>

613
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:24,339
<i>A dancer who we'll call Pamela.</i>

614
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,979
<i>very soon, Pamela will take
all her clothes off.</i>

615
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,317
<i>But shame and she don't speak
the same language anymore.</i>

616
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:36,451
<i>Like every night, Pamela will be naked</i>

617
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:38,750
<i>with her legs and her hopes
opened and unprotected</i>

618
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,491
<i>to the lust of the highest bidder.</i>

619
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:47,389
<i>Inside this strippers cabaret
that hides in the moonlight.</i>

620
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,200
Why am I thinking about him?

621
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:16,688
If this gets into the press' ears,
it will be the end of this place.

622
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,592
Where will then the executives
of this city shelter.

623
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:24,024
so they can admire the perfection
of women's bodies?

624
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,634
But, is Casilda involved in
that drug thing?

625
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,235
I don't know.

626
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:37,446
But I've always thought that
tragedies never come alone.

627
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:42,478
This is really a big problem.

628
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,397
Thank you for letting me
enjoy this moment with you.

629
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,838
I love you.

630
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,555
Promise me you won't leave me.

631
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,153
How could I? You're the best
thing that have ever happened to me.

632
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,657
Where are you going?

633
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,418
Do you want to make love?

634
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,626
Even the question is silly.

635
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:58,491
Handsome!

636
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,058
No!!!

637
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,604
Could that be possible?

638
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:41,301
I won't lie to you. Your visit
has brightened my day, detective.

639
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,605
Are you married?

640
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,507
The reason of my call
is strictly professional.

641
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,714
I understand.
Do you want something to drink?

642
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:54,842
No, thanks.
I need to talk to Miranda.

643
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:02,047
And you say this is
strictly professional?

644
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,954
That's right.

645
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:08,996
Fine.

646
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,631
In all this tragedy something
good had to happen, Miranda.

647
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,937
Explain yourself Shakis. I don't get it.

648
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:25,615
That hottie. The police guy.
He wants to see you.

649
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:30,618
He told me it's work,
but I know men.

650
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:36,250
and I can see lust
and desire in his eyes for you.

651
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:41,859
Oh girl, I wish I was you.
Don't say such things.

652
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,701
I'm going to let him in.

653
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:55,740
And if he tries to abuse you.
Just enjoy it!!!

654
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:10,826
Come on in.
- Thanks.

655
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,371
I know you're going to think
that I'm crazy, and that's right.

656
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,374
I haven't thought of anything
else but your eyes.

657
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:29,071
And your lips.
I'm crazy about you, Miranda.

658
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:35,408
I don't know if this is craziness
or love at the first sight.

659
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:56,025
You look great. Will you be
working extra hours today?

660
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,125
What do you care?

661
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,425
Do you want to know so you
can "organize" your schedule?

662
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:11,504
I've never felt this way before.
Thanks. But you have to leave.

663
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,377
I'll be back soon.

664
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:15,204
<i>Senator Davis take me. I'm yours.
I'll make you enjoy me until you die.</i>

665
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,468
<i>Miranda, you're so beautiful.</i>

666
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,636
What are you doing with that?

667
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:30,549
That's mine. You shouldn't.
Why are you sneaking in my things?

668
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,585
Is this yours too?

669
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,060
You're an idiot!

670
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,500
Why did you do it?

671
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:50,398
You're a murderer.
You killed Senator Davis!

672
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,534
Wait here.
- No!!!

673
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:04,370
Raquel, please!
Stop talking to me like that.

674
01:07:04,405 --> 01:07:08,248
I talk to you the way I want!
I do as I please!

675
01:07:08,283 --> 01:07:12,091
You're cynical.
- I may be. Now, have a good day.

676
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,561
Who might she be
cheating on me with?

677
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,336
I have to find out
who's my husband's lover.

678
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:34,249
I'm going to give her a lesson.

679
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,121
What's going on, Miranda?

680
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,158
I'll tell you later.
That man is after me.

681
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:42,852
What?

682
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,587
Detective! What a big gun!

683
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,635
Why all this violence?

684
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,930
Women can be silly.
- Really.

685
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,404
If that man was chasing me
with that big gun.

686
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,841
I would surrender
without resistance.

687
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,874
The things you got to see!

688
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:22,964
Freeze!

689
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,262
Miranda please.

690
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,899
Don't do any stupid thing
you might regret later.

691
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:06,300
Leave me alone, moron!

692
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,897
Please Miranda. I love you. I'll help you.
And we'll get out of this one.

693
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,777
Whatever the problem is we can work it out.

694
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,644
<i>Love doesn't exist, you bastard.</i>

695
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,809
<i>Even though you could've made
me believe in it again.</i>

696
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,849
Miranda!

697
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,195
I hope you understand.

698
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:40,226
Look, I understand, but I just want to
know if you're going to lend me that money.

699
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,369
Tell me who Raquel's lover is.

700
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,273
I'm in a hurry.
I can't talk right now

701
01:10:44,308 --> 01:10:46,400
I have to run to cover that news.

702
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,142
I'm going.
- No!

703
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,179
There's something I got to tell you.

704
01:10:50,214 --> 01:10:51,146
All right.

705
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:57,052
You're a too big temptation to me.
I want you out of my house.

706
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:01,779
As soon as you get back from
your sudden trip I want you out.

707
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:07,626
I truly love your sister Raquel.
I want to make that clear.

708
01:11:07,661 --> 01:11:11,560
Whatever. Let's go to the bank
so you lend me that money.

709
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:35,555
It's a shame.
Doubt will never let you be happy.

710
01:11:55,144 --> 01:12:01,014
Miranda is my husband's lover.
I can't believe it.

711
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,316
I feel so dirty.

712
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,922
Don't worry,
everything will be just fine.

713
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:13,792
You're right. Everyone has to
fight for happiness at any cost.

714
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,181
That's right. Shall we go now?

715
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:19,966
Yes, I'm really in a hurry.

716
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:46,383
Why, why?

717
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,032
Miranda! Fabian!

718
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,368
What's going on?

719
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,211
She just left, with my husband.

720
01:13:07,246 --> 01:13:10,143
Miranda, is your sister?
- Yes.

721
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,888
Get up please.
I am going after them.

722
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,756
Now get back in the house.
We're going after them.

723
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,077
Stop!
Stop her!

724
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,591
Miranda!

725
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:34,227
She told me you were cheating on me
and that you were going to leave me.

726
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:40,266
Sweetie. She told me you
were the one cheating on me.

727
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,657
I wouldn't dare!

728
01:14:42,692 --> 01:14:44,306
I know my love.

729
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:47,749
I'm sorry.
Her condition is very serious.

730
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,614
I don't think she's going to make it.

731
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:54,221
Are you her sister?
- Yes, doctor.

732
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:58,522
Did you know your sister escaped
from a mental institution?

733
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,697
Miranda?
- Yes.

734
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:07,603
Being raped by her own father
generated serious problems.

735
01:15:07,638 --> 01:15:09,594
That got worse when he died.

736
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,941
What? She was confined when
she was little but,

737
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:14,772
I never knew she got back in.

738
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:21,680
We did some research and we found out
that she escaped eight months ago.

739
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:26,247
She's very dangerous because
of her obsessions.

740
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,555
What are you talking about?

741
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:33,892
An urge to have control over men to
destroy them, physically and mentally.

742
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,103
I forgive you Miranda.

743
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:50,312
If I knew about all this before
I would have helped her.

744
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:52,143
She would be alive.

745
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:57,308
Stop torturing yourself.
Everything will be just fine.

746
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:04,481
But if we have a girl, we're going
to name her after her, Miranda.

747
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,973
Casilda, please forgive me.

748
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,584
It's okay.

749
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,587
Stop it, I saw him first.

750
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,750
Don't forget that if you
don't buy, don't bother.

751
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,062
I'm still sad about poor Miranda.

752
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:19,267
It will always be a sad episode
in the story of this night club.

753
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,268
"The Pamperers"

754
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:28,436
But the show must go on.
So go and get ready.

755
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:36,350
Are you in a hurry? You may
"relax" a little if you want.

756
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:40,388
No thanks, I got to go.

757
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,818
Men!

758
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,558
Here.
- What is this?

759
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:51,011
Read it. There's something
that will interest you.

760
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:54,293
Okay. Thanks again.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

761
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:55,770
Bye.

762
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,373
I really would marry that guy.

763
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,542
Would he be a jealous man?

764
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,276
But of course, all men are jealous.

765
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:24,533
<i>The biggest danger for a stripper is not
to show the most intimate parts of her body,</i>

766
01:18:24,568 --> 01:18:27,501
<i>but to fall in love.</i>

767
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:33,008
<i>Because up there on stage she may not only
lose her clothes, she may also lose her heart.</i>

768
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:40,437
<i>But that's life. An exotic dance is where
passion, lust and money can end with love.</i>

769
01:19:40,438 --> 01:19:41,438
