1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,502
Oh, Nick, I...
I didn't know who else to call.

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,537
You were so good
with him the last time.

3
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:19,906
It's okay. Now, where's
Mike? He's in his room.

4
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,409
He's locked the door-- I'm
afraid he's gonna hurt himself.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,211
I can't believe
the cops accused him

6
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:26,546
of raping somebody? He
wasn't making any sense.

7
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:28,215
He just kept saying that

8
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,550
he didn't want to go to jail. Mike?

9
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,552
It's Nick Morelli.
Your mom called me.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,621
She's worried about you.

11
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,257
Mike?

12
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,659
How long has it been since
you've heard anything?

13
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,062
I don't know,
maybe five minutes.

14
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,400
Nick?
Mike, slow down.

15
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,352
Just slow down.

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,855
That could be
an ambulance, Mike.

17
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,274
Now, just tell me what's going
on. I didn't rape anybody, Nick.

18
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:56,026
Okay, now,
why would the police think

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,911
that you raped anybody?
Just tell me.

20
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,880
Mike? I was walking home from Desi's,

21
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:01,498
and they came flying up,
then they threw me

22
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,250
against the car, and
they said that the guy had

23
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,619
a red hoodie just like mine,
and they kept asking me why I

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,040
did it, and he went for his cuffs, and then
I just ran. O-Okay, nothing that's happened

25
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:11,591
can't be fixed,
but we got to deal with

26
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,260
the situation right here, Mike;
the police are coming.

27
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,896
They're not gonna believe me.
Mike, they will listen to you.

28
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,631
I am here, I will protect you,
I'll take care of it--

29
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:19,299
don't worry about it.

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,968
Mike, put that gun away. What
are you doing?! Put the gun down!

31
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,137
May, now, go in the bathroom, and
lock yourself... Put that gun...

32
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:26,139
Go now, May!

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,191
Mike, you got to give me that
gun. Mike, give me that gun.

34
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:30,176
I can't go back to jail.
Give it to me. The police are

35
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,529
I didn't do any... gonna be here soon,
and as soon as they get here, you're not

36
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:34,481
gonna look good with
a gun-- now, give me the damn gun!

37
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,283
Police! Open the door! Give it...

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,400
Give me the gun!

39
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:38,785
Gun! Gun!
All right,

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,487
all right, all right!
On the ground!

41
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,372
This is my client!
We are not resisting arrest!

42
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:45,292
Here's the gun! Face down
on the ground now! Face down!

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,228
All right, in my suit pocket,
there's a business card.

44
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,930
I'm an attorney!

45
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,565
Hold on, hold on.

46
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:53,466
I know him; let him up.

47
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:58,505
Nick, you got to help me, okay?

48
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,173
He invokes his
Fifth Amendment rights.

49
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:02,442
Hey, Morelli, what do you
call a defense lawyer

50
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,178
holding a gun?
What?

51
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,247
Justifiable homicide.

52
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:08,765
Hilarious.

53
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,518
It won't be, next time.

The Defenders - Season 1, episode 12
"Nevada v. Wayne"

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,702
Now, you've known Mike since
he was 12? Oh, yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,073
Played shortstop on a Little League
team that Pete and I sponsored.

58
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,326
Then five years later, the mother called
me and he got busted for possession.

59
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,078
Wow. And where's his dad?

60
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:44,247
He ran. He was gone
before I met the boy.

61
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:45,832
Here he is.

62
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,783
How you doing?

63
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,192
What happened?

64
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,027
Nothing. I'm fine.

65
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,528
You didn't answer me.

66
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,263
We're well past
capacity in here.

67
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:01,498
Things happen.

68
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,501
<i>Yeah, well, not
to this kid.</i>

69
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,503
If I see
one more scratch on him,

70
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:09,739
I'm gonna depose every one
of you guys wearing a badge.

71
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,414
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

72
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,349
Guy sucker-punched me.

73
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,619
All right, this is Lisa,
my associate.

74
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,421
She's gonna run us
through the facts of the case.

75
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,223
All right,
the police report says

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,391
that the victim was asleep
in her apartment

77
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,594
and woke up when the attack
started at 10:17 p.m.

78
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:34,264
She called to report the rape
after the attacker had left

79
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:38,435
at 11:14 p.m. I was home till
after 10:00-- my mom can prove that.

80
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:41,071
We were watching TV, and I told
her I was gonna go out for a while.

81
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,807
She told me to make sure that I
double-locked the door, and I left.

82
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,058
Well, that helps.

83
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,144
Well, it's a start, but a mother

84
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,479
sticking up for her son--
that's not the strongest alibi.

85
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,415
What did you do after you left? I
was at Desi's the rest of the night.

86
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,584
Desi. And when did you get
there, and when did you leave?

87
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,753
10:30. Left after midnight.

88
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,421
I was walking home when
the cops jacked me up.

89
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,991
We're gonna need Desi's
full name and number.

90
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,626
Is my mom here yet?

91
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:05,295
Your mom?
Yeah, she's here.

92
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:06,329
You'll be able to see her.

93
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,330
Now, let's finish up.

94
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:08,932
She'll come in.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,101
Nick?
Yeah?

96
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,670
Everything's gonna
be okay, right?

97
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,512
Yeah, Mike, it's
gonna be fine.

98
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,434
Hey, May.

99
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,020
I don't want you to freak out,

100
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:32,522
but, uh, he's
banged up a little bit.

101
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,957
Oh, my God, what happened?

102
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,358
Well, an inmate
attacked him.

103
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:37,160
But I already put
the guards on notice.

104
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,664
If anything else happens, he
goes right to protective custody.

105
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,332
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,034
Now, Mike said he was at home

107
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,435
with you until
after 10:00

108
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,037
last night watching TV?

109
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,638
Yes. He was.

110
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,974
We were watching TV,
and then he went out.

111
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,476
Do you remember
what you said to him?

112
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,547
Well, I always tell him to
double-lock the doors when he goes out.

113
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,016
Okay, May,

114
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:02,519
go see your son.

115
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,892
Being a juror is
an honorable and rewarding job,

116
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:11,361
but the rewards jury duty offers

117
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,947
are balanced by
important responsibilities.

118
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,448
Hey.

119
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,734
Is this taken?
Hey.

120
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,402
There's something off

121
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,456
about that judge.
Oh, yes, there is.

122
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,475
Hello.

123
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,515
Shoot!

124
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,502
Pull the chute, honey--
you just got shot down.

125
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,053
No, I...

126
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,888
just got a smile;
you missed it.

127
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:40,924
And it is your job

128
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,093
to report juror misconduct...

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,830
Hm! If anyone knows
about misconduct...

130
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,365
What?

131
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,934
Tell me!

132
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:54,271
Last year the cops found him
passed out in a sex club.

133
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:56,072
Head-to-toe rubber suit.

134
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,008
Had to breathe out of this
little snorkelly thingy.

135
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,743
Swore it was a
"weight-loss outfit."

136
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,912
I don't remember
hearing that in the news.

137
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,283
It wasn't. You hear things
when you're a defense attorney.

138
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh.

139
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,469
♪ ♪

140
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,090
Somebody drank my juice!

141
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:15,525
It's behind the milk.

142
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:16,993
It's gone!

143
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,064
Oh. Thank you.

144
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,549
Hmm.
What do you got?

145
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,933
Desi Williams, 21.

146
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,852
Mike's known him since
they were both 16.

147
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,221
Met him in drug court-- went
through the program together.

148
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,106
All right, all right,
well, they were juveniles,

149
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:32,225
so we can keep that out;
any other trouble?

150
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,777
A bust at 18
for possession.

151
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,729
Oh, please say pot.

152
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,530
Pot, pot, pot, pot?

153
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:40,317
Heroin.
I heard "pot."

154
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,652
Well, Desi's totally cleaned
up his act since then, though.

155
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,371
He's working for
the past few years,

156
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,556
going to N.A. meetings
regularly. All right, well,

157
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:48,425
when are you gonna talk to him?

158
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,127
Because we need to lock in
that alibi. Well, he hasn't

159
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:52,762
called in to work and
his landlord hasn't seen him,

160
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,414
but she promised to contact us
the second she does.

161
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,049
All right, what
about the victim?

162
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,636
Um, a Lona McKerin, 21,
full-time student at USLV,

163
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:03,073
no arrests, no history of substance
abuse or emotional problems.

164
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,557
I tracked down Detective Smith.

165
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:08,111
I had to promise
the dispatcher tickets

166
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,346
<i>to Thunder
From Down Under.</i>

167
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,948
Before you go, I need
you to sign these.

168
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,183
Sign.

169
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:15,585
Initial.

170
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:16,920
Sign.

171
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,621
Oh, wait,
that's for Pete.

172
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,423
That's for Pete.
Give me that.

173
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:24,127
He's using a corporate
card to buy his suits?

174
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,529
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

175
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,965
Zoey... Zoey!
I don't know.

176
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:29,749
Zoey!

177
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,805
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've all been sworn.

178
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:40,176
This case involves a charge of
attempted parental kidnapping.

179
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,878
The defendant, Alexei Nemerov,

180
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:44,347
has been accused
by his former wife,

181
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:47,484
Kelli Lazine,
of abducting their son.

182
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,269
Now, has anyone here

183
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,020
had anything to do
with the defendant

184
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,323
or any of the lawyers
involved in this case?

185
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,058
Judge, I'll see ya.

186
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,961
Anyone other than Mr. Kaczmarek?

187
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:03,400
Down.

188
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,569
Um, I-I'd like to be
excused from this jury.

189
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:09,289
On what grounds?
Well, I don't have a car,

190
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,841
so to get here this morning
I had to take three busses.

191
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,277
Sorry, that's not
grounds for dismissal.

192
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>Um, if you want to carpool,
I have a convertible...</i>

193
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,759
Sorry. Sorry.

194
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:34,814
Mr. Anderson, it
says on your questionnaire

195
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,232
that you're recently divorced.

196
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,067
Do you think that will
affect your ability

197
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,569
to be impartial in this case?

198
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,870
No.
So the divorce

199
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,905
was amicable?

200
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,273
I wish she were dead.

201
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,326
State strikes
for cause.

202
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,077
You are free to go, sir.

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,663
The defense strikes for cause.

204
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,499
You are excused, sir.

205
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,367
The State strikes for cause.
Free to go.

206
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,786
Strikes
for cause. You are excused.

207
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:57,921
State strikes
for cause.

208
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,222
Free to leave.

209
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,457
Strikes for cause.

210
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,459
Free to go.

211
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,426
You are dismissed.

212
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,294
You are excused.

213
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,228
Free to go.
Dismissed.

214
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,763
Excused.

215
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,098
Does the State or the defense

216
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,101
have any more peremptory
challenges for this jury?

217
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:13,686
No, Your Honor.

218
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,104
Cole, psst, psst.

219
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,475
No, Your Honor.

220
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,643
We have a jury.

221
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,612
Thank you all very much.
Please see the jury clerk.

222
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,982
And trial starts tomorrow.

223
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:29,819
Excuse me. Coming through.

224
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,871
Cole... Cole... No, I can't talk to you.

225
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:33,423
Are you insane?
I...

226
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,408
You just put a defense
attorney on your jury!

227
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,709
Look, despite how

228
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,127
I feel about you
personally, Kaczmarek,

229
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,663
I know you love the
law as much as I do.

230
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,999
Okay? Which is why I'm
hoping you'll overcome

231
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,269
all your baser
instincts and convict.

232
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,172
And when you do, a little piece
of you is gonna die inside.

233
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,926
9:00 sharp. Don't be late.

234
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:09,909
My, you got such tiny feet
for a man with a big mouth.

235
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,464
It's my day off, Morelli.
Hank, listen,

236
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,633
I need to talk to you
about my client, Mike Wayne.

237
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,701
Less than an hour
after the victim

238
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,271
reported the assault,
your guys picked him up

239
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,206
<i>because they think he did it?</i>

240
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,608
He matched the description
and he was in the area.

241
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:28,311
Well... My guys asked
him a couple of questions,

242
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,646
and he turns into the Flash.

243
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,015
Innocent people
don't run from the cops.

244
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,717
They do if you bounce them off a cruiser.
And who bounced him off a cruiser?

245
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,653
Your guys did. Yeah,
they did. No, they didn't.

246
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,221
No, they didn't!
Yeah, they did.

247
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,055
No...

248
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:40,657
Okay, okay.

249
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,160
Did you even look into
any other possibilities?

250
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,462
Sex offenders in the area,
guys on parole?

251
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,197
Did you check
DNA or prints?

252
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,818
No useable prints, no DNA.

253
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,037
Latex residue, however.

254
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,989
He wore a condom.

255
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,625
Look, the kid's only other
charge is some grass as a minor.

256
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,345
Now all of a sudden he's a master rapist
that knows enough to hide his own DNA?

257
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,880
Come on, Hank, it
doesn't make sense.

258
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,214
This doesn't fit.

259
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,050
You know what fits?

260
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,468
A couple of hours

261
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,637
after we pulled your client
from his house,

262
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:14,524
the victim put a big red circle
around his picture in a lineup.

263
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,559
"That's the man
that raped me, Officer."

264
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:21,264
I wish I had another story for
you, Nick, but I don't.

265
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,815
Now, it's my day off.

266
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,901
I'll see you guys in court.

267
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,936
Bye.

268
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,341
Aw, come on,
what is this all about?

269
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,492
I have no idea.

270
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:33,943
Is this the
right address?

271
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,945
The one the landlord
texted me.

272
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,197
You look nice today.
Thanks.

273
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,582
Where'd you get
that outfit?

274
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,050
Pete got it for me.
Pete?!

275
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,586
Yeah. Did he put it on
a corporate credit card?

276
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,089
I heard it was on sale.

277
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,091
Hey, Nick. Detective, how are you?

278
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,592
Good. Heard you almost got shot.

279
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,377
Oh, yeah, good
times, good times.

280
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,596
Oh, I bet, yeah.
What are you doing here?

281
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:55,098
I'm here to
see a witness

282
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,033
about a case.
What's his name?

283
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,401
Uh, Desi Williams.

284
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,169
You didn't bust
him, Tom, did you?

285
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,272
We didn't just bust him.

286
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,357
Oh...

287
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,808
How long has
he been gone?

288
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,876
Less than 24.

289
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,144
Cause of death?

290
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:09,979
Judging by the bindle
in his pocket,

291
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,982
the needle in his arm, I'm going
with heroin overdose. Oh, man...

292
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,384
I heard "pot."

293
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:17,720
Positive victim I.D.,
a dead alibi witness--

294
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,238
we're screwed.

295
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,958
If we were on a mountaintop
with a telescope,

296
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:24,794
<i>we couldn't see the
light from screwed.</i>

297
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,534
No. Desi doesn't get high anymore.

298
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,370
It was someone else--
they make mistakes, right?

299
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,372
They make mistakes.

300
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:42,291
Mike, well... I got
the crime scene photos.

301
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:45,511
It's Desi.

302
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:46,979
Hey...

303
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,315
they have the time of death--

304
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:52,551
right around the time
you two were together.

305
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,552
Now, tell me,

306
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,154
will the prosecution have

307
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,306
evidence saying that
you were doing drugs that night?

308
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:01,227
No. Just eating some pizza
and playing some video games.

309
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,261
Are you sure?

310
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:04,897
It's okay-- I just need to know.

311
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,315
I can't get blindsided in court.

312
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,833
Hey, I'm clean.

313
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,135
I'll take a test

314
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,137
if you want.

315
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,207
Okay.

316
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:21,814
Hey. You look like a
truck just hit you.

317
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:23,382
So do you.

318
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,836
Yeah, well, my best alibi for
the sexual assault just O.D.'d.

319
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,587
They just put me
on a jury!

320
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:31,390
Okay, on the scale of things,
not as bad, I'll admit it.

321
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,058
I'm glad you didn't
lose your perspective.

322
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:34,593
Is that a new suit?!

323
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,563
This is a perfectly
valid tax exemption. Pete,

324
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,399
this... is
a business credit card.

325
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,201
You cannot write off suits.

326
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,904
It's not a suit;
it's a work uniform.

327
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:46,572
Pete, you know how
they brought Al Capone down?

328
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,542
It wasn't the G-men;
it was the IRS.

329
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,111
I know; I saw the movie. Didn't
you learn anything from it?

330
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,413
Yeah, don't lie to Robert De Niro
if he's holding a baseball bat.

331
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:56,916
Come on, Pete,
you can't do this!

332
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,585
Everybody does it. Okay,
okay, I didn't just hear that.

333
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:03,389
I didn't hear anything you said
about committing tax evasion.

334
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,374
So when the IRS comes

335
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,859
and drags your ass to jail,

336
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:11,013
I'm gonna act
shocked and confused.

337
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:13,048
After your divorce
from Mr. Nemerov,

338
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:16,302
who was awarded primary
custody of your son, Sasha?

339
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,870
Alexei was too busy
whoring around

340
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,071
to be a proper parent.

341
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,706
Objection, non-responsive.

342
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,391
Sustained.

343
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:24,243
Objection, Your Honor.
Non-responsive.

344
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,378
Sustained. The
witness will limit herself

345
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,514
to answering the questions.

346
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,116
I have custody.

347
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,451
He had visitation.

348
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,386
And on the day
in question,

349
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,222
where did Mr.
Nemerov tell you

350
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,157
he was taking Sasha?
A movie.

351
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,659
And when Alexei didn't bring
him back by Sasha's bedtime,

352
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:41,927
I called the police.

353
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,829
That seems extreme.

354
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,965
How did you know your ex-husband
had abducted him?

355
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,466
Objection, leading.

356
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:50,135
Objection.
Mr. Cole is leading the witness.

357
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:53,105
Sustained. Shh, you're
gonna get me in trouble.

358
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,773
And once he was apprehended,

359
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:58,511
where had Mr. Nemerov
actually taken Sasha?

360
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,812
To the airport...

361
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,580
about to board
a flight to Russia.

362
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,949
If they had gotten
on that plane,

363
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:06,585
I never would have seen
Sasha again. Objection!

364
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,954
You were gonna hide him
in some backwater hovel

365
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:11,957
just to punish me,
you bastard!

366
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:15,361
Hate her.

367
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,329
Mr. Nemerov,
you quit your sales job

368
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,832
at Petersen's Used Carland
two days

369
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,668
before you were apprehended at
the airport, is that correct?

370
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,270
It was time for a change.

371
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,171
So it wasn't because you had

372
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,873
no intentions of ever
returning from Russia?

373
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,308
No, no, no.
You stated earlier

374
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:31,544
that Miss Lazine
gave you permission

375
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,546
to take your son to Russia.

376
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:38,150
Yes. Uh, to attend
the birthday of my grandmother.

377
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,952
Her 90th.

378
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,788
Talk directly to the jury;
that's a defense lawyer trick.

379
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,356
This guy is good.

380
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:47,159
I just wanted my son
to see his great-grandmother

381
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,460
before she died.

382
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,129
She said

383
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,032
it would make her life...
complete.

384
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,569
Hm.

385
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,479
I was asleep.

386
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:09,214
Um...

387
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:14,353
I'd had a pretty long day,
so I fell asleep early.

388
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,656
And then I...

389
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:20,726
I felt a pressure on my chest.

390
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:26,899
At first I thought
I was dreaming, b...

391
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,503
He was tying my arms.

392
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:33,606
You woke up, and the attacker

393
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,274
was on top of you?

394
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,510
I fought so hard.

395
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:41,947
I really did.

396
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:48,120
People say you, um...

397
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:51,690
you float out of your body,
but I didn't.

398
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,894
I didn't at all.

399
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,330
I wanted to so badly...

400
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,768
But I...

401
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,574
We can take a break.

402
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,943
No.

403
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,045
Please, I want to do this.

404
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,084
It was, um...

405
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,755
it was dark, but I could
tell that he had a...

406
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:27,626
he had sort of a baby face,
'cause he, uh...

407
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:30,129
no scruff, you know?

408
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,098
I could...

409
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,869
I could feel him rub
against me when he was...

410
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:47,112
...as he was raping me.

411
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,916
Do you see the man
who sexually assaulted you

412
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,751
in this courtroom today?

413
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,820
Yes.

414
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:05,030
Him. He raped me.

415
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:06,799
No, I didn't.
Order.

416
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,333
I didn't. She's wrong.
I didn't... Mike, stop.

417
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,501
Control your client, Counselor.

418
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:10,936
Stop it. Stop. Your Honor,

419
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,871
we're terribly sorry.

420
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,796
The State rests.

421
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,715
Mr. Morelli.

422
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:27,853
The defense has no questions

423
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:30,923
for the witness at this time,
Your Honor.

424
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:35,811
<i>We finally got</i>

425
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:36,995
the police video

426
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:38,480
of Lona McKerin
picking Mike

427
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:40,199
out of the photo lineup.
Great.

428
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,667
Let's see it.

429
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,452
Okay, if you see the man

430
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,404
who attacked you,
just circle his picture

431
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,039
with the red pen.

432
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,108
I have the one
from before.

433
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,478
This one.

434
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:53,579
You sure?

435
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,514
Yeah.
Okay.

436
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,549
She said, "I have
the one from before."

437
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:58,984
Yeah, so?

438
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:01,720
What before?

439
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,402
I wish you weren't here
today, Miss McKerin.

440
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,072
I wish I didn't have
to ask you these questions.

441
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,508
But a terrible crime

442
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,675
has been alleged.

443
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:26,178
Miss McKerin,
I'm gonna show you

444
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,514
the police video
of your identification

445
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,249
of my client,
and then

446
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,917
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

447
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:33,585
Are you gonna be okay with that?

448
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:34,620
Okay.

449
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,154
Thank you.

450
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,859
Okay...

451
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,895
if you see the man
who assaulted you,

452
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,197
just circle his picture

453
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,032
with the pen.

454
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,934
Take your time.

455
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,643
It's okay.

456
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:01,814
Can I take a break?

457
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:02,915
Yeah, sure you can.

458
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:03,982
I'm just really tired.

459
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,985
It's fine.
No problem.

460
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,454
Do you remember
asking for a break?

461
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,791
Yes. I-I had been
up for so long.

462
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,960
Absolutely, absolutely,
I understand.

463
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:17,296
But you resumed a half hour
later, is that correct?

464
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:19,398
Yes.

465
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,966
Okay.

466
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:26,138
Okay, if you see the
man who attacked you,

467
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,774
just circle his picture
with the red pen.

468
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:31,176
I have the one
from before.

469
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,149
This one.

470
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:38,600
You sure?

471
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,652
Yeah.
Okay.

472
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:47,276
Miss McKerin, is this the...

473
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,361
lineup that you circled?

474
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:50,996
Yes.

475
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:54,933
Were you aware that
this was not the original lineup

476
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,335
you were shown?

477
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,803
What?

478
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:02,207
You were shown
two different photo lineups

479
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,676
that night, and
the only person

480
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,845
that appeared in both...

481
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:09,281
was my client.

482
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,817
You had no idea

483
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:13,785
that there were two, did you?

484
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,153
No.

485
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,456
You were unable
to identify my client

486
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,658
in the first one.

487
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:21,326
Is that correct?

488
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,261
Yes.

489
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,398
But you could see him
in the second one.

490
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:30,669
Yes.

491
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:33,205
Is it possible...

492
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:35,123
that that's because
you remembered him from

493
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,476
the first photo lineup
and not the attack?

494
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:38,877
No.

495
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,546
No, it has to be him.

496
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,983
Wh... When I pointed him out,
they told me not to be afraid

497
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,818
because he was in jail already.

498
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,721
Now, I-I know this is
very tough for you,

499
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,092
but I need you to take a moment
right now and just think.

500
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,528
In light of
these new facts,

501
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:59,865
can you say,
for certain,

502
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:02,334
that it was my client

503
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,937
who sexually assaulted
you that night?

504
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:07,572
Objection, asked and answered.

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,907
Overruled.

506
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:10,409
You may answer the question.

507
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,018
I'm not sure.

508
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:25,590
Miss McKerin...

509
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:29,161
you need to be sure.

510
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:38,403
I don't...

511
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:43,642
I don't know.

512
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:56,722
No further questions,
Your Honor.

513
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,920
Okay, Mary. We are all clear
that you do not belive Kelli.

514
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,418
Now, without using the term
"micro-expression"

515
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,937
or anything else you might have
learned while watching

516
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:15,207
<i>48 Hours Mystery, can
you please tell us why?</i>

517
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,260
She seems like a bitch.

518
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,261
Aw, come on!

519
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:20,646
She thinks so, too.

520
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,381
I didn't say
it like that!

521
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:23,949
Okay. Kelli...

522
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:25,017
was a terrible wife.

523
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,018
She was judgmental,

524
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,219
she was withholding,

525
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:28,854
she was snippy, and...

526
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,623
Alexei, all the cheating aside,
seems great.

527
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:32,524
He's-he's funny,

528
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:33,375
he's personable,

529
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,893
he's good-looking.

530
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:37,196
Both of them love Sasha
with all their hearts.

531
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:38,897
Do you both agree with that?

532
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,132
Right, Mary?

533
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,066
Yes.

534
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,484
Talia?
Yeah.

535
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,787
Great. None of that

536
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:47,906
has anything to do
with our verdict.

537
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,976
Here we go.
"If the mother of a child

538
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:52,544
"has primary physical custody,

539
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:54,646
"the father of
the child shall not

540
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:56,648
"willfully conceal
or remove the child

541
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,917
from the physical custody
of the mother."

542
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:01,019
That is all we are
allowed to consider.

543
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,255
Now, did Alexei willfully

544
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:06,625
conceal or remove
Sasha from Kelli?

545
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,963
Hands for guilty.

546
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,333
Come on, Mary.

547
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,068
Yes.

548
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:17,269
Talia.

549
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,238
Come on.

550
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,023
Come on.

551
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,375
All right,

552
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:24,576
all right.

553
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:25,944
Guess we'll pick up tomorrow.

554
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,713
All right, I'm out of here.

555
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,047
Please,
we've been here forever.

556
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:30,749
Gladys, careful
with that diabetic cat.

557
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,584
No more candy
for her, okay?

558
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:34,586
Can we just make
up a verdict, please?

559
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:36,088
See you guys tomorrow. Talia.

560
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,456
Just one sec.

561
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:38,791
I'm not disputing

562
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:40,459
that the...

563
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,845
cuisine is four-star...

564
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:45,798
but come on, don't you have
a life you got to get back to?

565
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,966
I have to go.

566
00:24:52,972 --> 00:24:56,191
Hey, Talia, you
forgot your purse.

567
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,114
How are those busses running?

568
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:04,650
Fine.

569
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,494
Hey.

570
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,864
Sorry I'm late.
Are you all right?

571
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,532
Yeah.

572
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,668
Sorry, I'm... I'm just
not used to all of this.

573
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,371
Well, it's a good thing.

574
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,608
Find anything?

575
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,042
Not much.

576
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:07,446
She was a full-time student

577
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:10,482
at USLV, huh?

578
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,918
Yeah. Why?

579
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,122
Where's her books?

580
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:21,860
Wait, look at this.

581
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:24,279
She works at Fabio's.

582
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,701
<i>A lot.</i>

583
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:33,305
How does a full-time student
work a double shift

584
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:35,374
six days a week?

586
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,466
Hey, Nick.

Hey.

588

what is this?

590

I can't see with
your fingers in the way.

591
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,726
It is a bill from

and spa treatments at the
Beverly Hills Hotel.

594
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:01,567
That was from a year ago!

595
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:02,601
Don't change the subject.

596
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,369
I was at a legal seminar

597
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:06,905
in Los Angeles-- what, are
you going through the files

598
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,190

00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:09,942
You went with Jess.

business deduction.
Uh, ring-ring, hello?

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,781
Oh, Mr. Tax Computer.
How are you?

603
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,115
Who you looking for?
Nick Morelli?

604
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,084
Yeah. Stings, doesn't it?

605
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:20,252
Ow!

606
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,787
<i>I'm gonna sting your ass.</i>

607
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:23,088
Ha-ha-ha!

608
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:24,172
Lisa.

609
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:25,390
Pete.

610
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,426
Hey, what's going on?

611
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,628
<i>Well, Lona was
a student at USLV,</i>

612
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,847
but she dropped out...

613
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:35,601
after accusing another student
of sexually assaulting her.

614
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:38,737
How come we
don't know about this?

615
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:39,938
No charges were filed.

616
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,073
School handled
it internally,

617
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,224
and during the hearing,

618
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,109
it came out that
both of the students

619
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,444
were under
the influence of alcohol,

620
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,479
and the school
dismissed the charges,

621
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:50,282
then she dropped out. Do we have
the name of the guy she accused?

622
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,451
Well, we can't
use this in court.

623
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,052
Well, what do you mean?
The allegation

624
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,454
goes to
the accused's credibility.

625
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:57,656
Look, I know this is
your first rape case, Lisa...

626
00:27:57,724 --> 00:27:59,424
That has nothing
to do with it, okay?

627
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:00,826
This is about
attacking the victim.

628
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:03,428
The jury needs to know
if the victim lied

629
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:05,163
about a past
sexual assault.

630
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:06,465
<i>Yeah, well,
she's not lying now,</i>

631
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:08,000
'cause they did
a rape kit on her.

632
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,801
And our guy didn't do it.
Yeah, and Lona

633
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,903
already admitted on the stand
that she wasn't sure

634
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:13,505
Mike was the guy
who attacked her.

635
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:15,173
So we already have
our reasonable doubt.

636
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:18,310
Okay, Lisa...
let's play this out.

637
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:19,645
What now?

638
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,113
We drop our defense

639
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,314
and just...

640
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,516
hope the jury
goes along with us?

641
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,618
<i>Well, what
do you want?</i>

642
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:27,953
We're just supposed to go ahead

643
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,554
and destroy
this girl's reputation?

644
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,859
<i>You think I want to do this?</i>

645
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:35,661
Huh?

646
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:38,096
Is that what you think?

647
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,500
I have no choice, Lisa.

648
00:28:55,515 --> 00:29:00,152
You were a student at USLV,
is that correct?

649
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,820
Yes.
And you just dropped out?

650
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:02,988
Objection,

651
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:04,022
relevance.
Withdrawn.

652
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Miss McKerin, have you
ever made a claim

653
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,760
for a sexual assault before?

654
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,730
Objection,
the question introduces

655
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,332
inadmissible
prejudicial evidence.

656
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,601
It goes to credibility,
Your Honor.

657
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:23,237
I'll allow, but you are
on a tightrope, Counselor.

658
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:26,407
Have you?
Yes.

659
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,577
In college.

660
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,448
Was there an investigation
into that claim?

661
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,452
Yes, there was.

662
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,327
And what was the outcome
of that investigation?

663
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,041
The administrative board ruled
that the charges were false.

664
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:03,944
They said that
I was lying.

665
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:08,449
I wasn't.

666
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:12,019
Thank you.

667
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:16,290
The court will take
a ten-minute recess.

668
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,980
Hey.
Hey.

669
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,248
How you doing?

670
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:42,650
I'm okay.

671
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:45,119
You want to go over anything
before you testify?

672
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,687
No.

673
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:52,326
She's gonna be
all right.

674
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:02,436
You know, Michael could
afford to move out...

675
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,506
but he stayed
'cause he knew I...

676
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:09,076
I couldn't stand to be
in the house alone.

677
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:13,614
He's good to me.

678
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:15,182
Mm.

679
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:17,885
And you're good to him.

680
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:21,955
You know, if
you want an ear,

681
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:25,292
if there's something you want
to talk about, I'm here for you.

682
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:30,164
I don't know what to do.

683
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:32,299
I'm all he has.

684
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:37,271
Hey, just do what your
heart tells you to do.

685
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,343
He's my son.

686
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,112
She's their daughter.

687
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,988
I had a couple
glasses of wine,

688
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:57,891
and I fell asleep while
we were watching TV.

689
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,427
What time?
I don't know.

690
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:03,731
When I woke up, it was
around 9:00. Where was Mike?

691
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,701
I didn't see him.

692
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,236
You didn't see him,

693
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,538
or...?
He wasn't home.

694
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:14,241
I looked.

695
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,211
Okay...

696
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:18,912
All right.

697
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,983
We got a problem.

698
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,732
Desi's gone; my mother has to
testify-- she's my only alibi.

699
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,502
Mike, I-I can't put
your mother on the stand

700
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:41,004
if I know she's
gonna commit perjury.

701
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,407
What are you gonna do?

702
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:44,508
I'm gonna let the defense rest.

703
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:46,243
The victim's testimony

704
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,644
is suspect.

705
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:50,180
Is that enough to win?
Well, it helps

706
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:54,484
that there's no physical evidence,
but there's no way to know for sure.

707
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,391
Put me on the stand.

708
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,561
What are you gonna say, Mike?

709
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,763
I mean, your alibi is based

710
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,766
on your mother's lie
that she saw you leave.

711
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,636
But the jury doesn't know that.

712
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:19,609
What?

713
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:23,613
Well, the truth doesn't matter.

714
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:26,950
You're a defense lawyer--
your job is to win.

715
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:31,455
So you got to put me
on that stand

716
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:35,158
so I can convince the jury
that I'm innocent...

717
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,830
...just like I did with you.

718
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:46,470
If you don't, it's
ineffective counsel.

719
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:49,606
I get a new trial anyway.

720
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,309
Guard?

721
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:55,946
Just do your job.

722
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,282
I'm not going to jail
for this slut.

723
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,917
Nick! Hey! Hey!

724
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:03,737
Nick! Nick, come on!
Guard! Guard!

725
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:05,322
Come on.

726
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,833
I looked that kid
dead through the eye,

727
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,236
and I can't believe I
didn't see through his act.

728
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,137
Well, you've known him
since he was 12--

729
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:23,440
you wanted to believe. Aw,
I'm smarter than that, Pete.

730
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,742
Okay, well, what now, Nick?
'Cause if you put him

731
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,011
on the stand and he's lying,
you're committing a felony.

732
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,646
You got to withdraw
from the case.

733
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:31,281
Yeah. No, we're in the
middle of the trial.

734
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,149
No way in hell the
judge lets me out.

735
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,089
I can't believe it.

736
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,157
I made that victim...

737
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:43,960
doubt herself.

738
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:46,963
I practically called her a liar.

739
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,832
There is another option.

740
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,700
Mike wants to testify,

741
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,802
you let him testify
on the narrative.

742
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,639
Step back and let him
tell his own story.

743
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:57,641
And if Nick doesn't
question Mike on direct

744
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,843
and he doesn't
object during cross,

745
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,344
the ADA will know
something's up.

746
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:02,712
Let him sink himself.

747
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,813
Why don't we save time?

748
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,015
Put "I'm a
lying rapist"

749
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:06,816
on a sign around his neck.

750
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:08,218
No, Nick,

751
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:09,769
let him do it himself.

752
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,288
Get out of the way.

753
00:35:11,355 --> 00:35:13,223
That's what you got to do.

754
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:18,495
No.

755
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:20,063
We're defense
attorneys--

756
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:22,365
we defend.

757
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,070
<i>That's what I got to do.</i>

758
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,739
Is the defense ready
to call its first witness?

759
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,775
Yes, Your Honor.

760
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:56,800
Well, Counselor?

761
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:00,904
Just do your job.

762
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,611
<i>Mr. Wayne, can you tell the court</i>

763
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,245
what happened the night

764
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:10,914
of this alleged offense?

765
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,451
I ate some dinner with my mom,

766
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:18,288
and after dinner, we
both watched some TV

767
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,789
until a little after 10:00.

768
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:22,225
I told her I was
going out for a while,

769
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:25,495
I gave her a kiss good-bye,
and I-I left.

770
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,299
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell the court?

771
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:35,238
Well, after I left the house,

772
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,407
I walked to my
friend Desi's apartment.

773
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:39,042
Got there around 10:30,

774
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,911
and I sat on his couch
and played some video games.

775
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:44,481
I left right
after midnight,

776
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:47,283
and I was accosted by
some police officers.

777
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,254
I have no more, Your Honor.

778
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:53,957
Thank you.

779
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,226
Your witness.

780
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:12,809
Mr. Wayne, you said
you sat on Desi's couch

781
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:15,111
and played video games
that night.

782
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,846
Is that correct?

783
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:17,847
Yes.

784
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:19,783
Where was the couch?

785
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,185
In his living room.

786
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,554
And where was the television?

787
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,124
Across from the couch.

788
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,112
So... you couldn't have been
at the victim's house

789
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:34,497
sexually assaulting her,
because you were at Desi's

790
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,166
playing video games?

791
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:40,003
Yes.

792
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:46,276
Mr. Wayne, this is a photo taken

793
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:50,847
at Desi Williams' apartment
after his death.

794
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:59,522
Mr. Wayne...

795
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,292
can you explain

796
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,028
how you play video games

797
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:07,197
on a television
that isn't there?

798
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:20,960
Mm.

799
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,581

isn't my purse.

I hope you're aware
that jury tampering

807
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:55,078
is a serious allegation,
Mr. Kaczmarek?

808
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,746
I am, Your Honor,
but during voir dire,

809
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:59,282
she made a point about
how she had to take the bus

810
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,784

paying attention?

And you're sure

813
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,022
that the key ring was from

814
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,891
the defendant's
previous place of employment?

815
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,192
Petersen's Used Carland--

816
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,727

Get the juror.
Thank you, Mr. Kaczmarek.

820

a new purse, huh?
