00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,833  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:377 Y2:401

00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,503  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Dreamin' my dick was out</i>

3
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,907  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>if that infected bump on the head</i>

4
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,741  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>If it had. I was gonna name</i>
<i>that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla</i>

5
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,906  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>and bust it by jackin' off</i>

6
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,040  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:405
Oh, man.

7
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,947  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do</i>

8
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,117  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>Dreams let you think like that</i>

9
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:59,648  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Truth was. I hadn't had</i>
<i>a hard-on in years</i>

10
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,039  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:405
Oh, man.

11
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,508  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>My God. Man</i>
<i>How long have I been here?</i>

12
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:03,078  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Am I really awake now</i>.
<i>Or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?</i>

13
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:06,319  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>How could my plans</i>
<i>have gone so wrong?</i>

14
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,554  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>When the hell are they</i>
<i>gonna serve lunch?</i>

15
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,358  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Considerin' what they serve</i>.
<i>Why the hell do I care?</i>

16
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,833  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>If Priscilla discovered I was alive</i>.
<i>Would she come and see me?</i>

17
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:21,169  X1:092 X2:629 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Would we still wanna fuck?</i>
<i>Or would we merely have to talk about it?</i>

18
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,970  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>Is there. Finally and really</i>.

19
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,376  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:338 Y2:404
<i>Anything to life other than</i>

20
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,781  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>We, goddamn t</i>

21
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,788  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>How could I have gone from</i>
<i>the "King of rock and roll" to this?</i>

22
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:46,158  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Old guy in a rest home in East Texas</i>
<i>with a growth on his pecker</i>

23
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,375  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>And what is that growth. Man?</i>

24
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,183  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>Cancer? Nobody's talkin'</i>

25
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,781  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>No one seems to know</i>
<i>or wants to</i>

26
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,684  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:338 Y2:406
Makes you wonder, doesn't it,
what kind of life this old guy had?

27
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,660  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:338 Y2:406
What kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.

28
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,890  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:377 Y2:401
Look at him now.

29
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,625  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:377 Y2:407
Oh, who gives a shit?

30
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,006  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:377 Y2:401
Well...

31
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,548  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:377 Y2:407
Make you comfortable.

32
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,224  X1:337 X2:381 Y1:377 Y2:401
No.

33
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,891  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:377 Y2:407
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!

34
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,587  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:377 Y2:407
Help me.

35
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,781  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:377 Y2:405
You know, I was thinkin'...

36
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,015  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:338 Y2:406
What? You gonna get
all weepy on me again?

37
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,082  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:338 Y2:400
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you
use some of this here deodorizer

38
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,651  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:338 Y2:406
and spray it on that corpse
because she's smellin' pretty ripe.

39
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,698  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:377 Y2:401
Good idea.

40
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,870  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:377 Y2:405
Excuse me, miss?

41
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,604  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:377 Y2:407
You gonna throw all that stuff out?

42
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,669  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:377 Y2:401
Yeah.

43
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,579  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:338 Y2:406
Could I have one
of them pictures of Bull?

44
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,415  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:377 Y2:407
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?

45
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:55,948  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:338 Y2:406
I mean,
he was pretty proud of that.

46
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:59,719  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:400
And maybe that... that tin
of chocolates there?

47
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,125  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:377 Y2:407
I suppose.

48
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:12,431  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>The revealin' of her panties</i>
<i>wasn't intentional or unintentional</i>

49
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:13,995  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>She just didn't give a damn</i>

50
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:17,133  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>She saw me as so physically</i>
<i>and sexually non-threatenin'</i>.

51
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,475  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>She didn't mind if I got</i>
<i>a bird's-eye view of her love nest</i>

52
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,276  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>It was the same to her</i>
<i>as a house cat sneakin' a peek</i>

53
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,184  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I felt my pecker flutteronce like</i>
<i>a pigeon havin' a heart attack</i>

54
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,515  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>then it laid back down</i>
<i>and remained limp and still</i>

55
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,251  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>'Course. These days. Even a flutter</i>
<i>was kind of reassurin'</i>

56
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,361  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Here.
- Thank you.

57
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,093  X1:323 X2:395 Y1:377 Y2:407
Say...

58
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,163  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:377 Y2:407
Bull your kin?

59
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:44,396  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:377 Y2:407
My daddy

60
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,603  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:377 Y2:407
Never seen you here before.

61
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:53,003  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:338 Y2:400
I've only been here once before.
When I checked him in.

62
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,877  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:377 Y2:407
That's three years ago, wasn't it?

63
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,681  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:377 Y2:401
You and him friends?

64
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,948  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:338 Y2:406
No, we just roommates. I mean,
he never felt good enough to say much.

65
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,751  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:338 Y2:406
I just hated to see what
was left of him go away so easy.

66
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,493  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:377 Y2:407
Seemed like an all right guy.

67
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:14,499  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:338 Y2:406
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?

68
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,057  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:377 Y2:401
Yeah.

69
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,467  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:377 Y2:407
Well... he was all right.

70
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,600  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406
But not enough so you'd
come and see him, though.

71
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,933  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:338 Y2:400
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.

72
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,675  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:338 Y2:400
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid
or Medicare... whatever that stuff was...

73
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,649  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:338 Y2:400
he'd have been
in some ditch somewhere.

74
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,644  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:338 Y2:400
And I sure didn't have the money
to take care of him.

75
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,790  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>My own daughter</i>

76
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,895  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>lost long ago to me</i>

77
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,899  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>if she knew I lived</i>.
<i>Would she come and see me?</i>

78
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,366  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>Woud she even ccae?</i>

79
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,828  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:338 Y2:406
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.

80
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,939  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:377 Y2:407
Mind your own business.

81
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,866  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:377 Y2:407
I was busy.

82
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,590  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.

83
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,654  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:377 Y2:407
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?

84
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,393  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:377 Y2:407
I'm all right.

85
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,868  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:338 Y2:406
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.

86
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,428  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:338 Y2:406
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?

87
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,769  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:377 Y2:407
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.

88
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,777  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.

89
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,177  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:377 Y2:407
Good morning, Elvis.

90
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,814  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:338 Y2:406
Did you know we have
a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?

91
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:44,014  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:338 Y2:406
Elvis Presley. You know,
the rock and roll singer.

92
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,185  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:377 Y2:407
I thought he was dead.

93
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:52,190  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?

94
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,530  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:338 Y2:400
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.

95
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,398  X1:332 X2:384 Y1:377 Y2:401
Yet.

96
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,303  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:405
Now, Mr. Haff!

97
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,035  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:377 Y2:407
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."

98
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,942  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:338 Y2:406
But you're a little confused
and you like to play sometimes.

99
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:10,881  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:338 Y2:406
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?

100
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,887  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:338 Y2:406
You fell off the stage
and broke your hip... when was it?

101
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,445  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:377 Y2:407
Twenty years ago.

102
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:21,357  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:338 Y2:406
It got infected and you were
in a coma for quite a while.

103
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:25,761  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:338 Y2:406
You came out with a few...
problems.

104
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,798  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:338 Y2:400
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.

105
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,202  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:377 Y2:407
I don't have any problems.

106
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,365  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:338 Y2:406
You're tryin' to say
my brain's messed up, aren't you?

107
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,932  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:406
Why would you
wanna be somebody else?

108
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,104  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:407
I got tired of it.

109
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,004  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:377 Y2:407
I was hooked on pills, you know.

110
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,674  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:377 Y2:401
I wanted out.

111
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,480  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:338 Y2:400
And this boy Sebastian Haff...
he was an Elvis imitator.

112
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:50,386  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:338 Y2:406
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.

113
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,852  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:377 Y2:405
Problem is, he had a bad heart.

114
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,025  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:400
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.

115
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:00,122  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:338 Y2:406
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.

116
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,067  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>But why would you want</i>
<i>to leave all that fame. Mr Presley?</i>

117
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,728  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>All that money?</i>

118
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,138  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>'Cause they got old</i>

119
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:17,239  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>The woman I loved... Priscilla...</i>
<i>she was gone</i>

120
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,978  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>The rest of the women</i>
<i>were just women</i>

121
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,147  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I mean. The music</i>
<i>wasn't mine anymore</i>

122
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,215  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I wasn't even me anymore</i>
<i>Just this thing they made up</i>

123
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,226  X1:248 X2:466 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>And my friends</i>

124
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,664  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>We, they wwee succk n' moe d y</i>

125
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,035  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>So I took a little road trip</i>
<i>down to Nacogdoches</i>

126
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:48,036  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>to check out this Sebastian Haff</i>

127
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,755  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:338 Y2:400
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.

128
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:01,913  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:377 Y2:407
Oh, my God.

129
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,390  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:377 Y2:407
I didn't think you'd really...

130
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,816  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:338 Y2:400
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.

131
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:36,481  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:377 Y2:407
Let's split.

132
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,768  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.

133
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,168  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's all yours, baby.

134
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,948  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>So I signed everything</i>
<i>over to Sebastian</i>

135
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:08,509  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Except for enough money</i>
<i>to sustain me if things got bad</i>

136
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:11,613  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I was determined</i>
<i>to make myself a new life</i>

137
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,021  X1:274 X2:439 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>A better one</i>

138
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,023  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>But me and Sebastian</i>.
<i>We had us a deal</i>

139
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,090  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:377 Y2:405
<i>If I wanted to trade back. He'd let me</i>

140
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,326  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>It was all written up in the contract</i>

141
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,997  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>The thing was</i>

142
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,564  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I lost my copy</i>
<i>in a barbeque accident</i>

143
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,469  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:377 Y2:405
<i>But that wasn't so bad. Either</i>

144
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,709  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I was makin' new friends</i>
<i>and enjoyin' myself</i>

145
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,445  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:377 Y2:401
Cheers!

146
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,090  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?

147
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,026  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:377 Y2:407
It just went up like that.

148
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,169  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>- Now. Elvis</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

149
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,436  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:377 Y2:407
Don't carry it too far.

150
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:11,506  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:338 Y2:400
You may just get way out there
and not come back.

151
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:14,141  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:377 Y2:407
Oh, fuck you.

152
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,645  X1:330 X2:388 Y1:377 Y2:401
Shit.

153
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,215  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:338 Y2:400
Get old, you can't even cuss
someone and have it bother 'em.

154
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:25,286  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:338 Y2:406
Everything you do is either
worthless or sadly amusing.

155
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,498  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:377 Y2:401
Well...

156
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,397  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:377 Y2:407
I've got what I want.

157
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,102  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:338 Y2:406
The clothes can go
to Goodwill or Salvation Army.

158
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:37,802  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:338 Y2:406
Very well. And I'm sorry about
your father. He was a nice man.

159
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,343  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:377 Y2:401
Yeah.

160
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,103  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:377 Y2:407
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.

161
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:44,376  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:338 Y2:404
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.

162
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:51,588  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:338 Y2:400
I'll be back later to do that little... thing
that has to be done. You know.

163
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:57,286  X1:325 X2:393 Y1:377 Y2:401
Elvis!

164
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,133  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:377 Y2:401
Poor Bull.

165
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:15,307  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:338 Y2:406
In the end...
does anything really matter?

166
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,476  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>No one here ever listened to me</i>

167
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:26,557  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Except this one guy</i>
<i>only. He was certifiable</i>

168
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,820  X1:210 X2:502 Y1:338 Y2:406
That's where they took
a piece of my brain.

169
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:32,352  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:338 Y2:406
They got it back in D.C.
In that goddamn jar.

170
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,359  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:338 Y2:406
I got a little bag of sand
up there now.

171
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,928  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:377 Y2:405
Jack... no offense, but...

172
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,941  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:377 Y2:407
President Kennedy was a white man.

173
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,000  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:377 Y2:407
That's how clever they are!

174
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:49,070  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:338 Y2:400
They dyed me this color.
All over!

175
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:52,549  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:338 Y2:400
Can you think of a better way
to hide the truth than that?

176
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,670  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>I was livin' simple</i>

177
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,574  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>The way Haff had been</i>

178
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,639  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Going from town to town</i>
<i>doin' the Elvis act</i>

179
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,951  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Only. I felt like I</i>
<i>was really me again</i>

180
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,351  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:377 Y2:407
Can you dig that?

181
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,687  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:338 Y2:406
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.

182
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,186  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Women were</i>
<i>throwin' themselves at me</i>

183
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,199  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>'cause they could imagine I was Elvis</i>

184
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:52,135  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Only. I was Elvis playing</i>
<i>Sebastian Haff playing Elvis</i>

185
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,694  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>It was all pretty good</i>

186
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,865  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I didn't mind the contract</i>
<i>being burned up</i>

187
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,102  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Didn't even try to go back</i>
<i>and convince anybody</i>

188
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,939  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>Then I had the accident</i>

189
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,245  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I was gyratin'. See. Takin' care business</i>.
<i>And then my hip went out</i>

190
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,614  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>I'd been havin' trouble with it</i>

191
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,267  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:377 Y2:407
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.

192
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,313  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:338 Y2:404
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.

193
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,821  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:338 Y2:400
No more piss or crap
in the bed.

194
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:11,813  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:377 Y2:401
Shake it out...

195
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,058  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:377 Y2:407
There we go.

196
00:26:56,995 --> 00:27:01,193  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:338 Y2:406
Man... that is one
big bitch cockroach.

197
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,161  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:377 Y2:407
All right, man. Let's go.

198
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,666  X1:317 X2:402 Y1:377 Y2:401
Damn.

199
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:51,444  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:377 Y2:401
Hot damn!

200
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:22,844  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:377 Y2:407
Got you, you six-legged bastard.

201
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:07,485  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:406
Even a big bitch cockroach
like you should know...

202
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,354  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:377 Y2:407
Never... but never fuck with the King.

203
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,746  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey! Is anybody out here?

204
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:42,357  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:338 Y2:406
I think we got some major
bug problems in this place, man!

205
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,595  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:377 Y2:405
Oh, man...

206
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,223  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey, Jack?

207
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,375  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey, man, you okay?

208
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,877  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:377 Y2:401
What the Sam Hill is that?

209
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,452  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:377 Y2:407
Mr. Kennedy?

210
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,763  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:338 Y2:406
Hey, man...
you're on the floor.

211
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,399  X1:310 X2:408 Y1:377 Y2:401
No shit.

212
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,968  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:407
Who are you?

213
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,136  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:377 Y2:405
Look, I'm...

214
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,572  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:377 Y2:401
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.

215
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,976  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:377 Y2:407
Did you see him go by in the hall?

216
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:50,447  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:377 Y2:401
He scuttled like.

217
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,918  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.

218
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,317  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you know who.

219
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,125  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:338 Y2:404
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.

220
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,931  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:377 Y2:407
Lyndon Johnson.

221
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,492  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:377 Y2:407
Castro, maybe.

222
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,562  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:377 Y2:407
They sent somebody to finish me off.

223
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,803  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:377 Y2:407
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.

224
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,903  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:338 Y2:406
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!

225
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,245  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:400
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.

226
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:21,808  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:377 Y2:407
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.

227
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,185  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:377 Y2:401
Get his feet.

228
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,258  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:377 Y2:407
So, you say you heard a... a noise?

229
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:40,202  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.

230
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:44,675  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:338 Y2:406
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.

231
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,268  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:338 Y2:404
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,172  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:338 Y2:406
Were you awake or were you
in bed when you heard this noise?

233
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,084  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:338 Y2:406
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.

234
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,985  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:377 Y2:407
You got bugs all over this place.

235
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:03,856  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:338 Y2:406
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind
of bugs have you been seeing?

236
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,328  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:338 Y2:406
Look, do I look like
an ichthyologist to you?

237
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,558  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:377 Y2:407
Big damn bugs, all right?

238
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,795  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:338 Y2:406
The size of my fist. The size
of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.

239
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,201  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:406
What do I care?
I got a growth on my pecker.

240
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,432  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:338 Y2:406
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.

241
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,943  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:338 Y2:406
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow
and we'll take care of the problem.

242
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,841  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:338 Y2:406
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

243
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,597  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's time for that little thing again.

244
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,426  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:400

247
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:28,575  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
Doctor says this cream
ought to do the trick.

248
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:30,807  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:377 Y2:401
Corticosteroids.

249
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:34,613  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:338 Y2:406
Should heal the inflammation,
stop the pus.

<i>Could I have it back?</i>

254
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:50,023  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>And if I could</i>

255
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,180  X1:303 X2:413 Y1:377 Y2:401
Mr. Haff!

258
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:32,832  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:338 Y2:404
I think you better take
a cold shower, Mr. Haff.

259
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:37,411  X1:107 X2:613 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>There'd been two presidential elections</i>

266
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,991  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:377 Y2:407
You silly thing.

267
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,629  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:338 Y2:406
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?

268
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,671  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:377 Y2:407
You ought to be ashamed.

269
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:42,874  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:377 Y2:401

270
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,175  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:377 Y2:407
I haven't seen my kids.

271
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:45,409  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:377 Y2:401
It's an ambush!

272
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:51,014  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406

I saw him under the bridge.

273
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,124  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:338 Y2:406

00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:18,740  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:377 Y2:401

279
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,970  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:377 Y2:401
What's loose?

280
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:21,636  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:377 Y2:401
Lt. Listen.

281
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,684  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:377 Y2:401
Jesus Christ. What's that?

282
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,728  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:338 Y2:406
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson,
but I was wrong.

283
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,356  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:338 Y2:406
I've come across new evidence
to suggest another assassin.

00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,161  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:377 Y2:401
Assassin?

285
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,829  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:377 Y2:407
He's after another target tonight.

286
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,804  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:377 Y2:407
Come on, I wanna show you something.

287
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:51,341  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:338 Y2:406
I don't think it's safe
if you go back to sleeping.

288
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,037  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:338 Y2:400
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.

289
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:58,707  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:338 Y2:406
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!

290
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:03,083  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:338 Y2:406
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas,
and look where they got my brain and me.

291
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,146  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:377 Y2:401
I'm thinkin' with sand here.

292
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,387  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:338 Y2:406
I mean, I pick up some waves,
maybe, from my brain,

293
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,291  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:377 Y2:407
but somheday, who khows

294
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,525  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:338 Y2:406
Somebody might just disconnect
the battery at the White House.

295
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,762  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:338 Y2:406
Oh, yeah. That's something
to worry about, all right.

296
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,701  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:377 Y2:401
Listen here. Listen.

297
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:24,605  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:377 Y2:407
I know you're Elvis.

298
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,814  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:406
There was a rumor, you know,
that you hated me.

299
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,287  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:377 Y2:407
But I thought about that.

300
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:43,817  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:406
If you hated me, you could've
finished me off the other night.

301
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:49,497  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:338 Y2:406
What I want from you is
that you look me straight in the eye

302
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:54,732  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:338 Y2:406
and assure me you had nothing
at all to do with that day in Dallas,

303
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:58,867  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:338 Y2:406
and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.

304
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,345  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:377 Y2:405
Look, man...

305
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,580  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:377 Y2:407
I had nothing to do with Dallas.

306
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,216  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:338 Y2:406
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.

307
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,792  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:338 Y2:400
Good. May I call you Elvis
instead of Sebastian?

308
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,659  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:407
You may.

309
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,223  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:377 Y2:401
Excellent.

310
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,962  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:377 Y2:407
You wear glasses to read?

311
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,527  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, I wear glasses
when I really want to see.

312
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,596  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:377 Y2:401
Get them. Come on.

313
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:37,203  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:338 Y2:406
Come on.
Right down the hall.

314
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,252  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:338 Y2:406

<i>Maybe I was nuts. Too</i>

318
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:51,657  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:338 Y2:406

319
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,821  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:377 Y2:401
It's in here.

320
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,562  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:377 Y2:401
In here.

321
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,614  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:401
That's it?

322
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:17,245  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:338 Y2:406
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall,
trying to figure out who attacked you,

323
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,154  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:338 Y2:406
and you bring me here to look
at stick pictures on the shit house wall?

324
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:21,748  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:377 Y2:401
Look close.

325
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,405  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's Egyptian.

326
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,879  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:377 Y2:407
Right-a-reen-o.

327
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:47,884  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:338 Y2:406
Hey, you're not as stupid
as some folks made you out.

328
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:52,912  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.

329
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,518  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:338 Y2:406
I came in here to take a shit because
they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.

330
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:00,928  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:338 Y2:406
Saw that on the wall,
took it back to my room,

331
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,694  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:338 Y2:400
looked it up in my books,
and I wrote it all down.

332
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:09,764  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:338 Y2:406
Now, this top line
translates roughly into,

00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,675  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:377 Y2:407
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."

00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:18,238  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."

335
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,374  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:377 Y2:407
Say what?

336
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,180  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:338 Y2:400
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.

337
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:26,779  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:338 Y2:406
All right, so, one of the nuts in here...
present company excluded...

338
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,691  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:338 Y2:406
thinks he's Tutankhamen,
comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.

339
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,854  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:338 Y2:406
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?

340
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,331  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, I don't know what
the connection is, exactly... not yet.

341
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,995  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:406
But that thing
caught me asleep last night.

342
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,562  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:377 Y2:407
And I came awake just in time.

343
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,369  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:377 Y2:401
He had me on the floor.

344
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:48,139  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:377 Y2:407
I had his mouth over my asshole.

345
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:49,372  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:377 Y2:401
A shit-eater?

346
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:50,937  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:377 Y2:401
I don't think so.

347
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,745  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:377 Y2:407
He was after my soul.

348
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:57,686  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:338 Y2:406
Now, you can get that out of any
major orifice of a person's body.

349
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:58,813  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:377 Y2:401
I read about it.

350
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,949  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:377 Y2:405
Yeah? Where, man? <i>Hustler?</i>

351
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:04,961  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>The Everyday Man Or Woman's</i>
<i>Book of the Soul</i> by David Webb.

352
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,259  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:338 Y2:400
And they got pretty good
movie reviews in there

353
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,266  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:338 Y2:400
about stolen soul movies
in the back.

354
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,359  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:377 Y2:407
Come on. I'll show you.

355
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:16,224  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:338 Y2:406
I think that there might be some sort
of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.

356
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,235  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:338 Y2:400
That light...
looks like it's shortin' out.

357
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,897  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:377 Y2:407
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.

358
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:24,134  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:377 Y2:407
But you don't have to think about that.

359
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,200  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:338 Y2:400
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin'
on her enema.

360
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,146  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:377 Y2:407
All right. All right. I'm comin'.

361
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,244  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:377 Y2:407
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.

362
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,348  X1:327 X2:390 Y1:377 Y2:401
God.

363
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,969  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:377 Y2:407
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.

364
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,313  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:377 Y2:407
Damn! Hey, Jack.

365
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:47,551  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:338 Y2:406
What it says here
is that you can bury some dude,

366
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:52,619  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:338 Y2:406
and if he gets the right tanna leaves
and spells said over him and such bullshit,

367
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:56,029  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:406
that he can come back to life
thousands of years later, man.

368
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:57,825  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:377 Y2:405
But hold on, now.

369
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:01,668  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:338 Y2:404
To stay alive, he has to suck
on the souls of the livin',

370
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,402  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:338 Y2:406
and that if the souls are small,
his life force doesn't last long.

371
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,338  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:338 Y2:400
Small.
What's that mean?

372
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:10,903  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:338 Y2:404
Read on.
No, never mind.

373
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,642  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:377 Y2:407
I'll tell you myself.

374
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:16,182  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:338 Y2:406
But first,
would you like a Ding Dong?

375
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,078  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:377 Y2:401
I don't mean mine.

376
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,618  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:377 Y2:407
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.

377
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:25,951  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:338 Y2:406
Of course, mine would be chocolate
now that I have been dyed.

378
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,554  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:377 Y2:407
You got Ding Dongs, man?

379
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:31,691  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:338 Y2:406
I got Paydays
and I got a box of Baby Ruths.

380
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:33,100  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:377 Y2:405
Oh, mama!

381
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:38,534  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:338 Y2:406
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.

382
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:40,805  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:377 Y2:407
I'll take a Baby Ruth.

383
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,014  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:377 Y2:407
All right.

384
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:50,218  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:377 Y2:401
Now... small souls...

385
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,918  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:338 Y2:400
are those that don't have
much fire for life.

386
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,459  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:377 Y2:407
You know a place like that?

387
00:46:56,527 --> 00:47:00,520  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:338 Y2:406
Man, if souls were fires,
they couldn't burn much lower than in here.

388
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,361  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:377 Y2:401
Exactamundo.

389
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:07,769  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:338 Y2:406
What we have here at Shady Rest
is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.

390
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,329  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:377 Y2:407
You know, a mummy hiding out.

391
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:13,899  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:406
Coming in here,
feeding on the sleeping.

392
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:16,139  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's perfect, you see?

393
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,876  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:338 Y2:406
We're small souls,
so we can't provide him much.

394
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:24,954  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:338 Y2:400
But if that thing comes back
two or three times in a row

395
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:29,721  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:338 Y2:404
and wraps his lips
around some elder's asshole,

396
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:33,524  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:377 Y2:407
that elder is going to die pretty soon.

397
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,963  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:377 Y2:401
And who would be the wiser?

398
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:57,284  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:377 Y2:401
Asshole.

399
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:02,690  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:338 Y2:406
A mummy can't be getting
too much energy from all this...

400
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,890  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:338 Y2:406
not like with big souls...
but the prey is easy.

401
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:11,925  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:338 Y2:406
With new people comin' all the time, he can
keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.

402
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:13,731  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:338 Y2:406
That's what they
brought us here for...

403
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:16,398  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:338 Y2:400
to get us out of the way
until we die.

404
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:22,309  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:338 Y2:406
And those who don't die first from
disease or just plain being old, he gets.

405
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,714  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:338 Y2:406
Look, that's all well and good, Jack,
but there's one thing that still throws me.

406
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:31,914  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:338 Y2:406
How does an ancient Egyptian
wind up in an East Texas rest home,

407
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,220  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:338 Y2:404
and why is he writin'
on the shit house walls, man?

408
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:37,783  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:377 Y2:407
Well, he went in to take a crap,

409
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,728  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:338 Y2:406
got bored,
started writing on the walls.

410
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:44,199  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:338 Y2:406
He probably wrote
on pyramid walls centuries ago.

411
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,237  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:338 Y2:400
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.

412
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:49,465  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:377 Y2:405
Well, he eats souls.

413
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,306  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:338 Y2:406
So, I assume
that he would crap soul residue.

414
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:57,279  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:338 Y2:406
By that, I would mean
that if you die from his mouth,

415
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,340  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:338 Y2:406
you don't go to the other side
where the souls go.

416
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:05,514  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:338 Y2:406
He digests souls
until they don't exist anymore.

417
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:09,423  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:400
And you're just so much
toilet water decoration.

418
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,859  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:377 Y2:407
And speaking of toilets...

419
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:15,387  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:338 Y2:406
This is how I figured
that whole thing out.

420
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:19,498  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:338 Y2:406
He's just like anybody else
when it comes to taking a dump.

421
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,061  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:338 Y2:406
He wants a nice,
clean place with a flush.

422
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,970  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:377 Y2:407
They didn't have that in his time.

423
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:49,924  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.

424
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,800  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:338 Y2:406
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.

425
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:57,432  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:338 Y2:406
"He" my ass. There isn't
any mummy from Egypt.

426
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:03,537  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:377 Y2:407
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.

427
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:26,716  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:377 Y2:401
Asshole.

428
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:37,457  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart</i>

00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:57,246  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>This time. We got quizzed about</i>
<i>what had happened to Kemosabe</i>.

433
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:59,714  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>But neitherof us told the truth</i>

438
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,129  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:377 Y2:405
<i>So. What we did was</i>

439
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:17,827  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>we lied</i>

440
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,110  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:377 Y2:407
Life sure is fleetin', you know?

441
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:07,514  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:338 Y2:406
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.

442
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:10,246  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:338 Y2:406

and the next minute you're gone...

443
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:14,283  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:377 Y2:401
Shit! Shit! Come on!

444
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,558  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:338 Y2:400
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!

445
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,427  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:377 Y2:401
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.

446
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:25,559  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:377 Y2:401
Nonchalant.

447
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:27,763  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:401
Get it in there.

448
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:31,938  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:377 Y2:401
You are one fuckin' idiot.

449
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,297  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:401
Mr. Haff?

450
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,703  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:377 Y2:407
Mr. Presley?

451
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:13,480  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:377 Y2:407
Now, how, Mr Pres ey

452
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,283  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:338 Y2:406
You are looking much stronger,
but you shouldn't be out here too long.

453
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:20,118  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's time for your nap.

454
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,718  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:338 Y2:406
And it's also time for us to do
that little... you know.

455
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,922  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:338 Y2:406
You fuck off,
you patronizing bitch!

456
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:32,658  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:338 Y2:406
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube
my own crankshaft from now on.

457
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:36,528  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:377 Y2:407
You treat me like a baby again,

458
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:39,268  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:338 Y2:406
I'll wrap this goddamn walker
right around your head!

459
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,177  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:338 Y2:406
How in the hell
did that mummy do that?

460
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:48,341  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:377 Y2:401
Well... what the hell.

461
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,959  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:377 Y2:407
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?

462
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,085  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:377 Y2:401
Where did he come from?

463
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:43,761  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:377 Y2:407
How the hell did he get here?

464
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:49,035  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:377 Y2:401
Wait a minute.

465
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:11,983  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Under the bridge</i>
<i>I saw him under the bridge</i>

466
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,189  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:377 Y2:405
Come on, mama.

469
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,763  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>They think age will kill me first</i>.
<i>And they're probably right</i>

476

<i>Out-fight. And outwit the bad guys</i>

477

478
01:02:03,466 --> 01:02:04,865  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:377 Y2:407
Shitty pictures, man.

479
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:07,266  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:377 Y2:407
Every single one.

480
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:13,798  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Here I was complainin' about</i>
<i>loss of pride and how life had treated me</i>.

481
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:17,313  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>And now I realized</i>
<i>I never had any pride</i>

482
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,712  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>And much of how life</i>
<i>had treated me had been good</i>

483
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,115  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>The bulk of the bad</i>
<i>was my own damn fault</i>

484
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,853  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>Should've fired Colonel Parker</i>
<i>by the time I got in the pictures</i>

485
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,652  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:377 Y2:405
<i>Old fart had been a shark and a fool</i>.

486
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:31,057  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>And I was an even bigger fool</i>
<i>for following him</i>

487
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,420  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>If only I'd treated Priscilla right</i>

488
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:38,026  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>If I could've told</i>
<i>my daughter I loved her</i>

489
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:42,335  X1:215 X2:498 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Always the questions</i>
<i>Never the answers</i>

490
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:45,897  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Always the hopes</i>
<i>never the fulfillments</i>

491
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:56,580  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:338 Y2:406
I had the woman who calls herself
my niece come get me.

492
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,816  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:338 Y2:406
She took me downtown this morning
to the newspaper morgue.

493
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,357  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:400
She's been helping me
to do some research.

494
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:06,126  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:406
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.

495
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:07,857  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:377 Y2:401
You know somethin' about him?

496
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,990  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:377 Y2:407
I know plenty.

497
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:15,803  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:377 Y2:405
Now, one of the lesser mummies,

498
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,466  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:377 Y2:407
on loan from the Egyptian government,

499
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,601  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:338 Y2:400
was being circulated
all over the United States.

500
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,236  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:338 Y2:400
You know, museums,
stuff like that.

501
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:25,338  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:406
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?

502
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:27,212  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:377 Y2:407
No, more like King Tut's brother.

503
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:31,652  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:338 Y2:406
His mummy was flown or carried
by the train from state to state.

504
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,315  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:338 Y2:400
When it got to Texas,
it was stolen.

505
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,379  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:377 Y2:401
Stolen?

506
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:40,225  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:338 Y2:406
Evidence points to it being stolen at night
by a couple of guys in a silver bus.

507
01:03:40,296 --> 01:03:43,026  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:377 Y2:407
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!

508
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,329  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:338 Y2:404
Anyway, the thieves
broke into the museum,

509
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:48,336  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:377 Y2:407
stole it in hopes of a ransom,

510
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:53,273  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:338 Y2:406
when in comes the worst storm
in East Texas history.

511
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,336  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:407
Let me guess.

512
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:58,303  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:377 Y2:407
The bus was washed away, see?

513
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:01,544  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:338 Y2:406
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.

514
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,451  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:338 Y2:406
The mummy was imprisoned
by the debris.

515
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:07,414  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:400
Look here...
how'd it come back to life?

516
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,890  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:338 Y2:400
And how did I end up
inside its memories?

517
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:12,792  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:338 Y2:404
Speculation broadens here,
but from what I've read,

518
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,695  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:400
some mummies get buried
without their names...

519
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:18,063  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:377 Y2:407
a curse put on their sarcophagus.

520
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,429  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:338 Y2:400
Hey, now, maybe our boy's
one of them.

521
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:26,669  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:338 Y2:406
I mean, when he's in the coffin,
he's just a dried-up old corpse,

522
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:29,974  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:338 Y2:406
but when the bus got washed away,
maybe it overturned or broke open,

523
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,037  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:377 Y2:401
and now he's free of coffin and curse.

524
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:36,484  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:338 Y2:400
He's free from imprisonment,
but he still needs souls.

525
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,451  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:377 Y2:401
Now he's free to have them.

526
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:42,719  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:338 Y2:406
He can just keep on feedin'
unless he's finally destroyed.

527
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,052  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:377 Y2:405
So, what do we do, Jack?

528
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:51,196  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:338 Y2:406
Changing rest homes
might be a good idea.

529
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,894  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:377 Y2:401
I can't think of much else.

530
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:54,960  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:377 Y2:407
But I will say this...

531
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:58,701  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
Our mummy is
a nighttime kind of guy.

532
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:01,972  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:377 Y2:407
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.

533
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:04,411  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:338 Y2:406
I'll set my alarm
for just before dark,

534
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,108  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:338 Y2:406
then I can get myself
a couple of cups of coffee.

535
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,046  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:377 Y2:407
Damn straight.

536
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:12,849  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:338 Y2:406
If he comes in here tonight, I don't
want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.

537
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,288  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:377 Y2:401
Yes. Consider it.

538
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:21,025  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:338 Y2:406
He's got the proverbial
bird's nest on the ground here.

539
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:42,684  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>What do I really have</i>
<i>left in life but this place?</i>

540
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:48,986  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>It ain't much of a home</i>

541
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:51,717  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>but it's all I got</i>

542
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:58,465  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:377 Y2:407
Well, goddamnit.

543
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:04,865  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:338 Y2:406
I'll be damned if I let some foreign,
graffiti-writin', soul-suckin',

544
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:08,274  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:338 Y2:406
son of a bitch in an oversized
cowboy hat and boots

545
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:12,178  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:338 Y2:400

down the visitors toilet!

547

548
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:26,355  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:338 Y2:406

01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:52,617  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:338 Y2:406
Ask not what your rest home
can do for you.

555
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:56,022  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:338 Y2:406
Ask what you can do
for your rest home.

556
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:59,755  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey, you're copying my best lines.

557
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,093  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:338 Y2:406
Then let me paraphrase
one of my own.

558
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:05,023  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:377 Y2:401
Let's take care of business.

559
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,435  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:338 Y2:406
Just what are you
getting at, Elvis?

560
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:10,699  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:338 Y2:406
I think you know
what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.

561
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,731  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:377 Y2:407
We're gonna kill us a mummy.

562
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:29,056  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:377 Y2:407
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.

563
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:32,821  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:400
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.

564
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:34,385  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:377 Y2:401
Look here.

565
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:36,898  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:377 Y2:407
Found this in the storage room.

566
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,998  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:377 Y2:407
I thought they kept it locked.

567
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,866  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:338 Y2:406
They do. I stole a hairpin
and picked the lock, baby.

568
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:43,235  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:377 Y2:401
Great.

569
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:44,398  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:377 Y2:401
Matches.

570
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:47,836  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:338 Y2:406
Check. Even scrounged up
a cigarette lighter.

571
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,413  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:377 Y2:401
Good. Uniform.

572
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:58,016  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:377 Y2:407
Big check on that, baby.

573
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:04,620  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:338 Y2:406
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes
to go with this.

574
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:05,752  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:377 Y2:401
Check.

575
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:08,957  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:401
Scissors.

576
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:10,259  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:377 Y2:401
Check.

577
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:12,525  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:377 Y2:407
All right.

578
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:15,969  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:338 Y2:406
Now, I got my chair
oiled and ready to roll.

579
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:18,597  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:338 Y2:400
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.

580
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:22,508  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:338 Y2:406
And I picked some words of power
from my book of magic.

581
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:24,307  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:338 Y2:406
I don't know
if they'll stop a mummy,

582
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,712  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:338 Y2:400
but they're supposed
to ward off evil.

583
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:30,284  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:338 Y2:400
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.

584
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:32,344  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:377 Y2:407
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.

585
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:35,690  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:338 Y2:406
All right, 2:45 a.m.,
we hook up right back here.

586
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:40,024  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:338 Y2:406
No, at the rate we travel,
maybe we ought to start at 2:30.

587
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:43,890  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:377 Y2:407
Say, Jack?

588
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,663  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:338 Y2:404
Do we know
what the hell we're doin', man?

589
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,707  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:338 Y2:400
No. But they say
that fire cleanses evil.

590
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:57,371  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:338 Y2:406
Let's just hope that they...
whoever they are... is right.

591
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,005  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:377 Y2:405
Check on that, too.

592
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:00,639  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:377 Y2:407
All right, synchronize watches.

593
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:03,947  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:377 Y2:401
And... mark.

594
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:09,756  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:338 Y2:400
Now, the two key words for tonight
are "caution" and "flammable."

595
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:13,318  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:338 Y2:406
And also...
"watch your ass."

596
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:24,131  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:338 Y2:406
What's that you got
hanging around your neck?

597
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:27,164  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:377 Y2:407
That's my medicine bag.

598
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:29,170  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:377 Y2:401
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.

599
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:32,274  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:377 Y2:407
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.

600
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:36,469  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:338 Y2:406
See here?
Mucho mojo.

601
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,580  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:377 Y2:407
That's my daughter.

602
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:50,257  X1:315 X2:404 Y1:377 Y2:401
I know.

603
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:56,490  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:338 Y2:406
We weren't there for our kids
when they needed us, were we?

604
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,726  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:377 Y2:407
Man, if I could just talk to her again...

605
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,165  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:377 Y2:401
tell her I love her...

606
01:11:05,608 --> 01:11:07,667  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:377 Y2:407
try and make things right somehow.

607
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,902  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:377 Y2:407
No time for regrets, Elvis.

608
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,177  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:338 Y2:400
We were the best fathers we could be
under the circumstances.

609
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:18,580  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:338 Y2:406
Yeah, I guess,
no time for regrets.

610
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,583  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:377 Y2:407
We got business to take care of.

611
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,353  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:338 Y2:406
Look here.
Top it off with this.

612
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,759  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:400
I stole it from the gardener
when he wasn't lookin'.

613
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:34,465  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:338 Y2:406
It's gonna be
one hell of a barbeque.

614
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:45,746  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:377 Y2:407
Let's do it, amigo.

615
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,577  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey, Jack?

616
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:57,183  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:377 Y2:407
I just got one last question.

617
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:00,520  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:377 Y2:407
Marilyn.

618
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,031  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:338 Y2:406
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?

619
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:08,927  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:377 Y2:401
What was she like in the sack?

620
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:13,068  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:338 Y2:406
That is classified information.
Top secret!

621
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,305  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:377 Y2:407
But between you and me...

622
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,540  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:377 Y2:401
Wow!

623
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,911  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:338 Y2:406
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.

624
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:31,786  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:377 Y2:407
Gotta hump it.

625
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:26,947  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:338 Y2:404
<i>Shitwhen Bubba Ho-Tep</i>
<i>comes out of that creek bed</i>.

626
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:29,075  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>He's gonna come out</i>
<i>hungry and pissed</i>

627
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:31,813  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>When I try and stop him. He's gonna</i>
<i>jam this paint can up my ass</i>

628
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:34,219  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>and jam me and that wheelchair</i>
<i>up Jack's ass</i>

629
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,892  X1:330 X2:388 Y1:377 Y2:401
Shit.

630
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:28,971  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey, Jack.

631
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,550  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:338 Y2:406
Don't make me use
my stuff on you, baby.

632
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:31,691  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:338 Y2:406
Damn!
Where did he go to?

633
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,267  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:377 Y2:407
Hey! You stay put!

634
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,303  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:377 Y2:401
I'll flush him out!

635
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:42,635  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:377 Y2:405
You be careful, man.

636
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:52,175  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:405
No, Jack!

637
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,478  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:405
Oh, man.

638
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:05,920  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:338 Y2:406
Come and get it,
you undead sack of shit.

639
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:32,613  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:377 Y2:407
Sorry, man.

640
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,710  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:377 Y2:407
Mr. Kennedy?

641
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:13,661  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:377 Y2:401
The President is soon dead.

642
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:23,900  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:338 Y2:406
So, now...
it's up to you, Elvis.

643
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:26,406  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:377 Y2:407
You got to get him.

644
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:30,707  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:377 Y2:407
You... got to...

645
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:32,610  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:377 Y2:401
take care of business.

646
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:50,691  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:377 Y2:407
That's right, man.

647
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:53,991  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:377 Y2:401
T.C. B...

648
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:57,602  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:377 Y2:407
It's just you and me.

649
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:17,752  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:377 Y2:401
Mr. President.

650
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,081  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:338 Y2:406
"You nasty thing
from beyond the dead...

651
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:48,417  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:338 Y2:406
"No matter what you think or do,
good things will never come to you.

652
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:54,924  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:338 Y2:406
"And if evil
is your black design,

01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:59,661  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:406
"you can bet the goodness

655
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:05,567  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:377 Y2:401
For chrissake...

656
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:06,801  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:377 Y2:401
That's it?

657
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:11,778  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:338 Y2:400
That's the chant against evil
from the <i>Book Of Souls?</i>

658
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:13,109  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:377 Y2:407
Yeah, right, boss.

659
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,673  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:338 Y2:404
And what kind of decoder ring
comes with that, man?

660
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,049  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:377 Y2:407
Shit, it doesn't even nyme well!

661
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:47,213  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:377 Y2:407
This is dog shit.

662
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,817  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:377 Y2:401
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.

663
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:59,186  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:338 Y2:406
Come on, baby.
Here we go.

664
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:18,938  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>I was goin' out</i>

665
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,643  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:338 Y2:404
<i>And if I did. Rhot only would I be</i>
<i>one dead son of a bitch</i>.

<i>But so would my soul</i>

667
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,711  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>I'd be just so much crap</i>

668
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:31,315  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>No afterlife. Rho reincarnation</i>.
<i>Rho angels with harps</i>

669
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,614  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:338 Y2:400
<i>Whatever lay beyond</i>
<i>would not be known to me</i>

670
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,020  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>It would all end right here</i>
<i>for Elvis Aaron Presley</i>

671
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:40,753  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>Nothin' left but a quick flush</i>

672
01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:46,456  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:377 Y2:407
T.C.B., baby.

673
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:58,872  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:338 Y2:406
Your soul-suckin' days
are over, amigo.

674
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:59,605  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I felt somethin' inside</i>
<i>gratin' against somethin' soft</i>

675
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,577  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:338 Y2:406
<i>I felt like a water balloon</i>
<i>with a hole poked in it</i>

676
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:08,542  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:377 Y2:407
<i>I was goin' down for the last count</i>

677
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,811  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:377 Y2:401
<i>And I knew it</i>

678
01:25:13,255 --> 01:25:15,086  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:377 Y2:407
But I still have my soul.

679
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:18,658  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:377 Y2:401
It's still mine.

680
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,594  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:377 Y2:401
All mine.

681
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:29,399  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:338 Y2:406
And the folks up there
at Shady Rest...

682
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,930  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:377 Y2:407
they have theirs, too.

683
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:36,066  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:377 Y2:407
And they're gonna keep 'em.

684
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,436  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:377 Y2:407
Every single one.

685
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,370  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:377 Y2:407
Thank you.

686
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:13,978  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:377 Y2:407
Thank you very much.
