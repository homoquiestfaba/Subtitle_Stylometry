1
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:25,490
My name's Kyle, and I
wanna be a policeman.

2
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,531
I'm Gordon.
I wanna be a lawyer.

3
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,905
My name is Martha,
and I'm a t. Rex!

4
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,242
Okay, Martha.

5
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,987
No, I'm gonna delete that one.
Hey, what's up?

6
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,257
"My girlfriend just sent me
the sexiest photo."

7
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,795
Ew. Oh, that looks like a butt.
My boobs look like a butt?

8
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,598
Just hanging' out in your
favorite shirt and lingerie.

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,034
Oh, boy.
None of these are good.

10
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,241
Okay.

11
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,752
I mean, was I cheating on you?
Yes, maybe.

12
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,189
I'm such an asshole, okay?
I know.

13
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,424
Do you think that I like
being like this?

14
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,228
I just need validation all the time.
It's pathetic.

15
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,264
But I think that's
something you can work on.

16
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,002
Yeah, this is super-fucked.

17
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,805
But maybe...

18
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,375
It's a new beginning,
right?

19
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,211
Mmm.

20
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,547
Oh, wow.

21
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,916
I like your nail Polish.

22
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,353
I'm just gonna grab
this little fella.

23
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:39,858
This is what
I'm talking about, Martha.

24
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,460
You got no sense
of adventure.

25
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,443
Hey, watch it.

26
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,311
Hey, have a nice day.

27
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,965
Hi. Hey. Sharon?

28
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,467
- Yeah.
- How are you?

29
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,536
Is that Chanel?

30
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,138
I like it.

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,540
What, are you with the hotel?
No, no.

32
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,009
I'm actually supposed to be in
Milwaukee, killing your husband

33
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,345
before he can take
your half of the firm.

34
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,982
That's what it's about. They don't tell
me much. That's what I could figure out.

35
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,618
I was really proud of myself for that.
Gee whiz.

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,886
Look, i--

37
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,487
don't hurt my feelings,
Sharon.

38
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,124
You contacted a fixer to hire
someone to kill your husband.

39
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,460
Huh?

40
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,729
Okay.

41
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,533
So if you're not there,
then why are you here?

42
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,669
Murder's wrong, Sharon.

43
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,338
But you're a hit man.

44
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,873
Nobody's perfect.

45
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:44,148
You're gonna come home
and look at me

46
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,686
like I'm uptight 'cause
i don't want a threesome?

47
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,189
You asshole! 'Cause
I'm not so-- Martha?

48
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,725
- It's Sophie. Are you okay?
- You don't even know me!

49
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,260
She's not okay.

50
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,495
No, because you didn't
bring the--

51
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,331
why would you bring-- that
doesn't even make any sense.

52
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,433
She's doing drunk closet.
She's regressed to college.

53
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,170
We've gotta open the door. I need you
to keep your eyes to the ground.

54
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,440
Because she takes direct eye
contact as a sign of aggression.

55
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,843
We're coming in.
No! No!

56
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,945
This is my whole zone!

57
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,180
This is for me!

58
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,783
You stop judging me, 'cause
these are my favorite socks!

59
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,052
And I have only
been drinking for two days.

60
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:25,089
- Martha, you look good.
- I feel assumptions from you.

61
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,725
I feel judgment from you.
You don't know the situation.

62
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,896
You don't know what's in my
heart 'cause you're racist!

63
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,131
No.
Okay, whoa.

64
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,401
And you smell weird!
I'm sorry. You don't.

65
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,070
Julia, I'm gonna need your help.
I am not touching her.

66
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,640
- She seems sticky. - Get physical
with me, i will get physical with you.

67
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,609
Take my hands.
One, two, there we go.

68
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,744
You unhand me, you brute!
Ha-ha.

69
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,413
No, I don't wanna leave.
No! Martha.

70
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,082
- I need your hands.
- You can't stop me! No!

71
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,851
One of you hussies
is getting fisted!

72
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,791
Okay, he's headed
towards the elevator.

73
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,259
Eta two minutes.

74
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,760
Espinoza's team
is already in position.

75
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,997
For the money this guy's worth,
I'm gonna do my thing big.

76
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,300
- Don't let this joker start doing
that thing he does. - Amen, brother.

77
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,002
Fucking dance party
is canceled!

78
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,971
Yeah!

79
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,345
- Hey, hopper, you coming or what?
- No.

80
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,313
Nope, I made a mistake.

81
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,483
I thought you guys
were professional.

82
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,251
But that's okay.

83
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,087
That's okay.

84
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,622
Someone's gotta return the
Van after he kills you all.

85
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,792
Yeah, whatever, pussy.

86
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,427
Break a leg.

87
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,301
- Here we go then.
- <i>Stopping elevator now.</i>

88
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,037
That's a mistake. <i>What the hell?
He's not in here.</i>

89
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,207
Yes, he is. <i>What the fuck?
How's he moving like that?</i>

90
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,576
<i>Catch up! He's right there!</i>
- No, he isn't.

91
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,147
Wow. Pretty.

92
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,282
Balloons. Wedding?
Nice job.

93
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,785
Listen, there's been
a fire down the hall,

94
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,186
so everyone's gonna
have to evacuate.

95
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,988
<i>He's going in the ballroom!</i>

96
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,890
Don't follow him
into an open space.

97
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,558
Fire! Now!

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,227
Fire!

99
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,616
<i>I got him in my sight.</i>

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
By the cake!

101
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,572
Well, if he's by the cake,

102
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,374
that means he's got a knife.

103
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,112
Fuck me.

104
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,029
Who shoots cake?

105
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,566
<i>This would have been
such a nice wedding.</i>

106
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,136
Well, that was fun... ish.

107
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,607
I'm not a racist. I know
you're not a racist.

108
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,142
I'm not.
Heads up! Whoa!

109
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,977
Are you feeling--
ow! What the fuck?

110
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,214
What if that was a bullet? I'm
training you. You're welcome.

111
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,050
Guys, let's go out.
You know?

112
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,319
Let's get out of here.
It's New Orleans.

113
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,287
You know, like,
we're young and free.

114
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,456
We should find
a block party.

115
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,892
We could find one
with a contest or something.

116
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,895
Like a contest
for our bodies.

117
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,132
And we show, like,
our boobs or something.

118
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:59,303
I don't know. But I wanna
do something terrible.

119
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,006
I wanna do something terrible.
Ah!

120
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,111
Are you okay?

121
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,082
Excuse me.
Hello, ladies.

122
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,617
What's this?

123
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,286
That was a piña colada,
but I drank it,

124
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,823
so now it's an empty cup
for my friend Julia.

125
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,026
Oh, my god.
Jesus Christ.

126
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,696
Is he here?
I knew this was a good bar.

127
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,966
I'm gonna go find him.
Ooh.

128
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,646
Oh. Oh! Oh!

129
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,449
Wait!

130
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:51,556
What the hell? I'm the
fucking man right now!

131
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,458
Ow!

132
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,231
Oh, my gosh. She's texting.
Who is she texting?

133
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,000
Who are you texting?
Nobody.

134
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,337
Do you think if I text him I'm
pregnant, it would change anything?

135
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,173
Is there a pregnant emoticon?
Like... "Pregnant."

136
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,175
What if I text him
that I'm dying?

137
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,177
What if I text him
that<i> he's</i> dying?

138
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,846
Because I'm going
to murder you, you--

139
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,849
okay, give me that. I'm not
watching you repeat yourself.

140
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,385
You're the little engine that could
that keeps running off the tracks.

141
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,554
I'm stopping this train.
No more.

142
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,490
I'm sorry. I am.

143
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,859
I'm sorry, Sophie.
You're so good to me.

144
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,729
I don't know how this keeps happening.
Do I just suck?

145
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,499
No. Am I just like
suckball McGee over here?

146
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,669
No, you're not suckball McGee.
Come here.

147
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,606
You know what? You're just
a work in progress, babe.

148
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,341
Oh, Sophie.
Okay.

149
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,710
Why don't you come to work
with me tomorrow? Really?

150
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,213
Yeah. You just chill.
We can pet the cats.

151
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,749
Love the cats! They love you.
Mew!

152
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,285
Yeah.
I love you so much.

153
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,420
I love you too.

154
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,693
<i>in reference to target m4937,</i>

155
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,896
<i>you have been assigned
a new identity.</i>

156

Agent Leonard Knox?
Uh-huh.

163
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,262
And you are?
Detective Gus Patrick.

164
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,097
Welcome to New Orleans.

165
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,866
Nice to meet you.

166
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,507
Is this supposed
to be relaxing?

167
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,076
Normally, it is. You make
everything so crazy. I don't--

168
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,844
why are you wearing
cat ears?

169
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,347
They sell them behind the counter.
Those are for kids.

170
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,482
Well, I feel beautiful.

171
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,484
But you guys are okay,
aren't you?

172
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,787
You're just the cutest.
No, that is Hannibal.

173
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,789
He's a straight-up killer.
This one?

174
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,591
- Yeah, he'll fucking scratch
your face off. - Are you crazy?

175
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,460
Are you crazy?

176
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,329
This is a metaphor.
No.

177
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,497
- This cat is my soul.
- It's not a metaphor.

178
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,466
- I need to confront this.
- Martha, no.

179
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,469
- We're gonna be best buddies.
- I would not stand that close.

180
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,771
- It's gonna be okay.
- What are you doing?

181
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:29,113
So in the metaphor,
do you think I won or lost?

182
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,182
God, it just exploded.

183
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,552
I mean, it pissed
right in your face. Ew.

184
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,655
Sorry. You really
took the brunt of it.

185
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,158
I thought you'd have better reflexes,
working with cats so long.

186
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,795
Do you think that's a defense mechanism?
That it pisses in your face?

187
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,299
Is that like
an evolutionary sort of--

188
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,503
I'm really sorry, Sophie.

189
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,473
It wasn't a metaphor.
Yeah, I realize that now.

190
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,874
Yeah.

191
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,479
You should go home.

192
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,981
Are you sure?
Yeah.

193
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,950
Yeah, very sure.

194
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:09,687
Okay.
I will see you at home.

195
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,467
Phew.

196
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,436
How'd you do that?

197
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,238
This is a lot of condoms.

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,141
Enough condoms here to choke a goat.
What?

199
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,910
I don't know
what I just said.

200
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,646
Hey, you wanna get out of here?
What?

201
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:12,383
Is it creepy? Sometimes I
don't know I'm being creepy.

202
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:17,321
Do you wanna go on a date? Do you wanna
get out of here and then go on a date?

203
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,926
Based on what?
Based on nothing?

204
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,994
Just go on a date?

205
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,629
What else
are you doing today?

206
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,998
Fighting the urge to run
away from you right now.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,069
I'm actually on the run too.
From creepy guys like you?

208
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,139
Oh, man. These guys wish
they were as creepy as I am.

209
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,675
International hit men.

210
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,778
Ew. Gross, right?
Oof.

211
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,148
Come on, it's 3:00 pm. Let's go get
some gumbo. Alligator pancakes?

212
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:49,453
What else you got to do today? Other than
get serial killed by a cartoon character?

213
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,021
Maybe a lot.

214
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,160
Was that cartoon character
bothering you?

215
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,695
'Cause I'll kick his ass.

216
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:01,532
What happened to your hand?
Oh, it was a cat.

217
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,301
I don't own cats, actually.
I'm not like a cat lady.

218
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:10,274
I mean, I love cats,
but it was a rogue cat.

219
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,143
I think you're beautiful.

220
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,980
I'm more fun than a barrel of kittens.
Mm-hmm.

221
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,448
In a good way.
Yeah.

222
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,383
Let's ditch
this popsicle stand.

223
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,487
Let's go for it. Let's go on a date.
Let's go out, you and me.

224
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,690
Explain to me in two words
why I should hang with you.

225
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,559
Two words?

226
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,060
Um--

227
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,398
"or else."

228
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,637
Wow, yeah. That's actually
really fucking creepy.

229
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,171
That's really creepy, right?
Yeah.

230
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,507
Come on.
You gonna pay for those?

231
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,910
Um, I did. Didn't I pay
for these already?

232
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,711
No. Oh, I didn't. I'm so sorry.

233
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,080
So sorry.
Ha. You caught me.

234
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,183
Hey, buddy. What?
Hmm?

235
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,654
You can't just attack it
from the bottom Willy-nilly.

236
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:01,725
You were doing fine before. Just eat it
like a-- you know, like a normal human man.

237
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,028
Are you-- what are you,
the hot dog police?

238
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,529
Are you new to eating?

239
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,698
I love that shirt.
Oh, really?

240
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,668
Yeah, it's confident. You've
got, like, a confidence thing.

241
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,603
I have a confidence thing?

242
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,205
Yeah. Like, "fuck everybody."
You know what I mean?

243
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,942
Excuse me. Ladies? Don't you think
she has a confidence thing?

244
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,344
Sorry. He's a crazy person.
I don't know him.

245
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,080
You do. It's funny, though,
'cause this was an ordeal.

246
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,884
Every time I get dressed, i have to confront,
like, what does this say about me?

247
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,454
'Cause I have stuff going on
in here and in here,

248
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,057
and I need my shirt
to be a reflection of that.

249
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,226
That's a lot of
responsibility for a shirt.

250
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,730
Yeah. Well, I probably don't need
to tackle the meaning of life

251
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,732
every time I make
a decision about clothes.

252
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,068
I actually relate to that.
Oh, yeah?

253
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,738
Yeah. It takes me half an hour every
morning just to decide what to wear.

254
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,642
Oh, 'cause I thought this was a
terrible, terrible accident.

255
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,277
No, this was
a conscious decision.

256
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,146
I'm completely
fucking bananas.

257
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,283
You're funny.
Yeah.

258
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,651
Eh--

259
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,726
you didn't finish your story
about the museum dig things.

260
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,428
Oh, yeah, well,
it never happened.

261
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,499
I met Jeff, and it was sort of about
him and his dreams and his goals.

262
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,267
He's a professor, so--

263
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,304
I guess I'm supposed to be
too, if I honor my degree.

264
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,640
How'd he die?
He's--

265
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,076
no, he's alive.
He's fine.

266
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,945
He's just an asshole.

267
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,947
Well, I mean,
he wasn't at first,

268
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,150
but then he sort of Scooby-doo-style,
you know, unmasked himself.

269
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,752
Oh. Secret asshole.
Yes.

270
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,521
The worst. I think it's
my selection process.

271
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,690
Just every guy
i get attached to, you know,

272
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,493
turns out to be secretly,
like--

273
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,428
yeah.
Am I in trouble?

274
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,330
Like, am I gonna get
asshole syndrome?

275
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,633
But it's not a secret you're an asshole.
Oh, well, then we're fine.

276
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,136
I think the guy thing's
just a symptom though.

277
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,272
I think I don't know
what I'm doing generally.

278
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,473
Hmm.
You know.

279
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,110
If you know that,
why don't you change it?

280
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,382
Well-- is a question
only dickheads ask?

281
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,052
Sorry.

282
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,321
Yeah, dragons. You know, 'cause humans
just wanna put a name on something

283
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,956
to make it feel safe,
but really,

284
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,025
what is a dinosaur
other than a dragon?

285
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,629
Sorry, I feel like we've been
talking about paleontology a lot.

286
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,364
I don't know anything about you.
Really?

287
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,700
Yeah.
Well, that's too bad

288
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,968
because I'm a fascinating
and complex person.

289
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,004
Is that right?
Yeah, kind of, sort of.

290
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,006
What do you do?
I travel a lot.

291
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,042
I buy used cars,
old cars, vintage cars.

292
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,512
I travel, looking for cars. And I
kill people, but not so much anymore.

293
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,247
Oh, you split the time?

294
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,317
- Fuck!
- Hey, you okay?

295
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,820
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

296
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,695
What was that?

297
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,430
Goddamn it!

298
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,666
Just some poopyhead
trying to kill me.

299
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,001
You wanna shake him?
Yeah.

300
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,938
Maybe he's trying to kill you.
Something you're not telling me?

301
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:01,565
I think my problem is that I have to be
the best ever at everything that I do.

302
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,300
Like if I'm
picking out a suit

303
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,403
or I'm waterboarding a
terrorist or I'm-- sure.

304
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,772
Doing a soufflé or being
someone's boyfriend,

305
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,108
I have to be
the best ever at it.

306
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,111
I think I'm just trying to take
life more seriously these days.

307
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,913
What's so funny?

308
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,116
You're just the corniest
person I've ever met.

309
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,084
I am.
Shuck me.

310
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,753
But number one.
Number one.

311
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,622
Number one.

312
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,459
Ah. So then, like,
philosophically,

313
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,128
you're opposed
to casual sex 'cause--

314
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,298
I usually do it naked. I don't
know what's more casual than that.

315
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,001
I once dated a girl, and we had formal sex.
Had to wear a tuxedo.

316
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,138
Sure. It got really sweaty.
Bow tie got all crooked.

317
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,373
That's so stupid.
It's really stupid.

318
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,310
I'm here every Tuesday.

319
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,178
Try the veal.

320
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,281
This is cute.

321
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,450
You like that?
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

322
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,520
Hello.
Hey.

323
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,856
Hello. How are you?

324
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,059
You're really pretty.

325
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,330
That was dumb.
Corny.

326
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,232
Yeah.
You're the worst.

327
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,078
Oh, my god.

328
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,113
Put that down.

329
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,186
Oh. Hello.

330
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,488
Mmm. Oh.
Hey. Oh.

331
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,923
Hi.
Hi.

332
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,759
Hey, Sophie.
Hey.

333
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,995
Have we met before?
No.

334
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,564
I'm the crazy guy that Martha
met at the supermarket.

335
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,366
Now I know where you live.

336
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,834
- Hey, whoa!
- Oh.

337
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,836
Awesome.

338
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,573
Wow, you look great.
You really do like dragons, huh?

339
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,110
And bonus tigers. Why don't you
park those dragons right here?

340
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,949
So, I should let you know
i still feel, like,

341
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,185
a little messed up
over the, um--

342
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,422
the-- the other thing,
previous thing, you know.

343
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,524
Scooby-doo?
Yeah.

344
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:12,462
So I still want you to stay
if you wanna stay though.

345
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,132
Well--

346
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:21,104
yeah! Hang out till infinity!
Yay! I'm down!

347
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,307
Jumping on a bed!
Yay!

348
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,910
Sorry.

349
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:31,114
If I'm being jumpy, I'm just a
little nervous. I think I like you.

350
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:41,425
You don't think that this
is too much, do you?

351
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,295
Nah. I still think we should've cut
his head off though, you know?

352
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,930
Turns up the volume.

353
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,932
Johnny moon,
you sick fuck.

354
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,001
This is the beginning
of a new era.

355
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,570
Once we are back in Jersey,
we're gonna be in charge.

356
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,340
We're not gonna be stuck
in this armpit of a city.

357
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,276
No offense. I know you grew up here.
No offense taken.

358
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,479
I like you. You're not a smart guy.
You're not a tough guy.

359
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,148
But you make big calls
and you got big balls.

360
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,518
Getting clown nose to kill Richie
so you can take over? Wow.

361
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,688
This is a terrible fuckin' plan,
but I believe in it.

362
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,924
It's gonna be fun.

363
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,860
Hey, check it out.

364
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,862
Houdini here is still alive.

365
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,131
Hey, paco!

366
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,467
You having a rough night, buddy?
Huh?

367
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,168
What?

368
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,771
All right.
Okay, let's get him up.

369
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,440
Ready?

370
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,677
All right. You ready?
Yeah.

371
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,413
One, two, three.

372
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:15,419
- That's him?
- I like it.

373
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,888
- Yeah.
- I like it a lot.

374
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,856
How long you said
you've been trackin' him?

375
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,427
FBI's been on him
for 10 years,

376
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,228
the CIA for 15.

377
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,431
I've been running point
for five.

378
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,499
Why don't we just
grab him right now?

379
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,501
Lock up the street
with snipers and SWAT?

380
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,271
You really want to
clean up that many bodies?

381
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,743
Yeah!

382
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,978
I'm in love.

383
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,090
- Are you kidding me? - I used to
make breakfast for you all the time.

384
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,692
Yeah, in a microwave.

385
00:24:55,694 --> 00:25:00,230
That guy last night, he seemed
really, like, fancy homeless.

386
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,899
Oh, my god. I just realized
i don't know his name.

387
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,570
- Who, Mr. right? - We were together
for 10 hours. It never came up.

388
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:10,240
- You slept with him and don't know
his name? - I did not sleep with him.

389
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,110
We slept together.
We didn't have sex.

390
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,245
We cuddled.
It was adorable.

391
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,581
- Okay.
- I don't need a name for that.

392
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,716
But still,
he didn't tell you his name.

393
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,152
You're gonna just have to start
recognizing these red flags.

394
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,421
Why?
You think he's evil?

395
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,822
What if he is?

396
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,126
When I was little, i had this
fantasy i was dating Lex Luthor.

397
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,261
From<i> superman?</i>
Wasn't he, like, a genius?

398
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,164
Your guy's more like
a sexy rain man or something.

399
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,134
Thank you. But I don't really
think this is about him.

400
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,269
I think you're just
in an unstable time,

401
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,105
and maybe you're just
latching onto this guy

402
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,441
because, you know,
the first guy you meet--

403
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,178
- I think I'm in love with him.
Is that stupid? - Yes. Hard yes.

404
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
What is that?
I want support.

405
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:54,284
- I made you a pancake. You have to be
nice. - You're saying crazy things.

406
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,953
I think you may be having
an early midlife crisis.

407
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,788
That doesn't sound like me.

408
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,124
Hmm. Pretty good.

409
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,260
He just makes me feel--

410
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,496
I don't know.
Like you said, Mr. right.

411
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,531
Oh, my god.

412
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,500
- Can you fry whip cream?
- Why not?

413
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,402
Oh, what?

414
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,610
<i>How come you're still alive?</i>
What are you doing, hopper?

415
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,147
<i>The company says you stopped checking in.
What's your big plan?</i>

416
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,483
<i>Well, I'm bringing him in.</i>
What the hell?

417
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,385
<i>He killed
my whole fucking team!</i>

418
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,854
He's mine,
and I'm taking him out.

419
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,389
- Really?
- You have a better idea?

420
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,157
Always.
Literally, always.

421
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,027
I will always have
a better idea than you.

422
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,629
I know this guy.
I know his weak spot.

423
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,164
<i>I trained him.</i>

424
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,233
<i>So for now, we wait.</i>

425
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,835
Mmm.
Yeah, like pussies, huh?

426
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,904
Yeah, okay.
Like pussies.

427
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,473
We're in
a big pussy parade.

428
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,210
Hey! I'm not in a pussy
parade, all right?

429
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,379
<i>You watch
your fuckin' mouth, hopper.</i>

430
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,216
- It's the wife.
- I know what you mean.

431
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,852
- So what's the story on hopper?
- Who?

432
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,488
Ed hopper. His name keeps
coming up in the files.

433
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,557
He used to work
with our boy, right?

434
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,493
Some sort of master of disguise,
secret agent type dude.

435
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,063
- I didn't read the whole thing,
but-- - of course you didn't.

436
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:16,766
But if you had, you'd know that hopper's
been missing almost 12 years now.

437
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,703
They worked together in the
ultra program at the CIA.

438
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,505
That went down in flames.
End of story.

439
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:26,276
Forget hopper. Let's focus
on one psycho at a time.

440
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,845
All right.

441
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,199
Hey, monster.

442
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,905
-Did you just call me "monster"?
-It's like a nickname.

443
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,942
- Like marth, marthster, monster,
that sort of thing. - Yeah, into it.

444
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:02,579
Worth noting that nicknames are supposed
to happen organically over time, but--

445
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,914
I can say it a thousand
times in 10 minutes.

446
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,585
Monster, monster, monster,
monster, monster, monster.

447
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,420
Monster, monster,
monster, monster--

448
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,223
yeah, just Stockholm syndrome me.
I love that album.

449
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,558
It's better than Agatha.
Who's Agatha?

450
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,961
Oh, I think Agatha
is a swell middle name.

451
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:22,165
It is "swell." It is swell
'cause it's basically from 1935.

452
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:27,137
And Martha Agatha, it's just a
double menopause punch in the--

453
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,639
oh. It's brutal.

454
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,442
Hey, you wanna do,
like, a role-play thing?

455
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,744
Where I'm an old lady?

456
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,114
Yeah, I could get into that.
We could get a Walker, a cane.

457
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,451
Actually,
it's my sort-of dream

458
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,454
to eventually be the old
lady in the neighborhood

459
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,625
that's like the crazy old
lady, like crazy old Martha,

460
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:52,796
and just have, like, messy white
hair and, like, ratty clothes,

461
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,832
and I just drive around all
day dead-eyeing teenagers.

462
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:01,137
- That's awesome.
- It's, like-- it's my dream.

463
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,106
I can't wait
to be there for that.

464
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,276
Hey, are you hungry?

465
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,211
Excuse me, waiter?
Can i--

466
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:19,789
I'm sorry. I have to just go outside
for a second. I'm really sorry.

467
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,231
Hey, buddy,
here's the thing.

468
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,535
I'm on a date, and I like this girl.
Can't we do this tomorrow?

469
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,072
I could kill you in a park, at the beach.
Rent a cozy hotel room?

470
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,676
I'd kill you there. We'll get a big
fruit plate, hang out, hold hands.

471
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,977
Fuck you, bitch.

472
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:54,057
Are we done?

473
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,925
Where the fuck
you going, pussy?

474
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,496
I'm gonna kill you and your fucking bitch.
You heard me.

475
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,065
What?
You fucking heard me.

476
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,034
- Come get some.
- Why'd you have to go and threaten her?

477
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,836
That's not
a nice thing to say.

478
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,342
All right.
Give me a second.

479
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,110
Yeah, come on, Princess.

480
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,613
Let me know
when you're comfortable.

481
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:37,033
Let's go, bitch!

482
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,638
- Hurts, don't it?
- Aaah!

483
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,616
Whoa.

484
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,454
Okay. Fucking guys.

485
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,824
- That guy's really homophobic.
- Get the fuck off me!

486
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,766
All right.
Have you had enough?

487
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:14,537
You could've gotten blood on me.
This is a nice girl.

488
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,274
I just--

489
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,844
I want it to go well.

490
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,846
I like this girl.

491
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,520
- Hey, did you have to finish
a book on tape? - No, sorry.

492
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,789
Had to kill somebody in the parking lot.
Some asshole.

493
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,958
Yeah,
he was a real dickhead.

494
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,095
Hey, you mind if I come around to your
side of the table? Oh, yeah. Sure.

495
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,164
Yep. Okay.
I love it.

496
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,667
Let's fly in the face of
traditional face-to-face dining.

497
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,370
Yeah. There's too much
real estate between us.

498
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,205
Anarchy.
I'm starving.

499
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,208
After killing that guy, you
must be exhausted. Right?

500
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,743
Let's get some food.
Okay.

501
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,948
I don't understand.

502
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,452
Why would anybody kill paco

503
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,521
and dump his body
under a bridge?

504
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,556
Well, to get at us,
Richie.

505
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,892
I mean, they're trying
to suss us out.

506
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:13,162
I think that it is this local
big dick, Hector Garcia.

507
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,465
Paco must have talked.

508
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:20,203
He probably let it slip that he was helping
to hide out big-money, up-north scaries.

509
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,804
Fuck.

510
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,409
- We have to tell dad.
- What?

511
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,077
We don't have to
tell dad shit.

512
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,147
They're still cleaning blood
off the walls back at home, Von.

513
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,150
And might I remind you
that this was your fucking mess?

514
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,657
I apologize.

515
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:45,862
- Yeah.
- I got an idea.

516
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,866
There's word on a guy. Big-time
hit man, wears a clown nose.

517
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,669
Maybe he takes care of the job for us.
Yeah. This.

518
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,271
I like this.
He makes a statement.

519
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,841
No. I'm not hiring some straight-off-the-boat
asshole to fix our problems.

520
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,277
We're supposed to be lying low.
That's great. That's great.

521
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,845
That's a much better
fucking plan.

522
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,715
We'll just stay locked up
like a bunch of fucking rats

523
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,351
waiting for the FBI to knock
on our fucking door!

524
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,388
Oh, that's great, Richie. Eight years
of therapy is working out beautifully.

525
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,391
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10. I apologize.

526
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,632
I like what Johnny's saying
because this guy,

527
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,133
he's a real international
contractor.

528
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,270
He's this Bruce Lee, James Bond
type of bad-ass motherfucker.

529
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:30,740
We get him
to make a move on Garcia

530
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,943
and we stop this shit
before it starts.

531
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:39,749
Okay.

532
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,417
Okay.

533
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,188
Go, uh, find
your professional.

534
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,957
I'll meet with him.

535
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,158
Okay?

536
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,071
Here you go.
Thank you.

537
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,443
She's with a guy who doesn't
wanna be in a relationship,

538
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,312
so it's a real treat
for her.

539
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,980
Ah.

540
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,952
What's your name?
My name?

541
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:20,523
Yeah. I realized i was kinda
having fun not knowing,

542
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,593
but now I think it's
more weird than adorable.

543
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,295
Is it hot in here?
I don't really like my name.

544
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,966
I just kind of-- i kinda hate
it, and it makes me angry.

545
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,435
I've been really honest
with you about everything.

546
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,538
It's only been a couple of days, and
that's not a big accomplishment.

547
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,308
I just don't like my name, and I
don't wanna tell you. Is that okay?

548
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,277
Okay. Weirdo.

549
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:46,949
Um... how'd you do
that thing in the store?

550
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,951
What thing?

551
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,622
You know, like, the way
you move sometimes.

552
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,557
It's like--

553
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,693
it's like you know, um--

554
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,562
oh, yeah, that thing.
Right. Yeah.

555
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,033
You wanna see a trick?
Okay.

556
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,507
Is this gonna get,
like, scary?

557
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,409
No scarier than usual,
i don't think.

558
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,011
There aren't
usually knives.

559
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,747
Well, first time
for everything.

560
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:21,284
Ever since
i was a little boy,

561
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,253
I've had an idea.

562
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,056
It's more of a theory, really.

563
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,698
Keep up.
I'm trying.

564
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,868
Everything we see,
like, physical things,

565
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,370
it's all just islands,
and under it, carrying it,

566
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,340
is this sweeping current.

567
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,077
And if you pay attention,
you can start to feel it.

568
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,816
Yeah.

569
00:35:55,552 --> 00:36:00,289
You see how your hand
moves with mine?

570
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,958
You can feel it,
right?

571
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,697
Uh--
that's okay.

572
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,133
Just concentrate
on the knife.

573
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,205
Now, if we can feel
the current,

574
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,342
we can feel other things
in the current--

575
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:21,577
people.

576
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,780
Watch the knife.

577
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:27,416
We can feel how the current
will move them,

578
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,752
and we can see
where they'll go.

579
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,121
It's all in the movement.
You see, it pushes itself.

580
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,725
It's easier to move with it
than against it.

581
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,638
Jesus Christ!
What? What?

582
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,807
Why the fuck
would you do that?

583
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,676
- I thought you were gonna catch it.
- Catch it?

584
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,612
- Did you see where it was gonna go?
- I can't catch a knife!

585
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,147
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't!

586
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,017
Yes, you can. Remember last
night, we were dancing?

587
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,620
You have an energy.
You've got a knack for this.

588
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,824
Shit. This is crazy.
Oh, my god.

589
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:12,695
Look, I had a really
nice night or whatever.

590
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,463
I know you can feel it.

591
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,700
- You don't know how yet, but I
can keep showing you. - No, no.

592
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,368
You need to leave
right now.

593
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,539
- You can feel it.
- It doesn't matter what I feel!

594
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,841
Martha.

595
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,777
Yeah.

596
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,716
- Cool, right?
- That's so gnarly.

597
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,823
No, no more.

598
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,392
No more, no more.
I get it. It's okay.

599
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,194
I should be so freaked out.

600
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,363
Give me one of those back. Okay.

601
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,200
Yeah.

602
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,252
Yeah, baby.

603
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:15,758
So, it's like a pulse?

604
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,262
Yeah, kind of. I never tried to
explain it to anybody before.

605
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,529
No?
Yeah.

606
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,799
- You never talked to anybody about it?
- No.

607
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:26,202
Why me?

608
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:29,005
Because I wanted you to know.
I needed you to know.

609
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,241
You have a-- a grace.
I just knew you'd understand.

610
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,543
And that's how you knew
I'd catch a knife?

611
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,879
I didn't know
you'd catch the knife.

612
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,416
I believed you could catch the knife.
I wanted you to catch the knife.

613
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,854
There was no way I could know. You're the
one who did it. You're the one who knew.

614
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,557
Are you mad?

615
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,294
No.
No, I'm not mad.

616
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,730
I think I'm crazy.

617
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,733
Me too.

618
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,304
And also, I want you.

619
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,739
I mean, really.

620
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,708
I really do.

621
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,910
I think that's doable.

622
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,146
Shut up.
I mean, immediately.

623
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,662
Hi.

624
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,298
You come here often? Oh, you
didn't like my breakfast?

625
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,467
I gotta do this
five-second stop,

626
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,969
and then maybe we could get
a little something.

627
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,337
Okay.
Yeah?

628
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,106
Cool.
Okay.

629
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:25,688
It's weird. I feel like I've
been in a coma with you.

630
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,523
Like I don't remember

631
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,793
what my life was like
before three days ago.

632
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,995
Yeah. Me too.

633
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,664
So, when we were
in bed last night--

634
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,967
oh, no, it's fine.
I smelled it.

635
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,503
I know. Gumbo, hot dogs.
I get it. Oh, my god.

636
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,205
You're such an idiot.
It doesn't bother me.

637
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,407
It's fine.

638
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:48,811
I... saw your, um--
the scar on your back.

639
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,313
Oh, yeah.

640
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,916
Um, well,

641
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,519
uh, it's a long story.

642
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,989
I was in Serbia chasing this
guy all over the tundra,

643
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,591
and the whole area's
a war zone,

644
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:07,596
and I finally find the guy,
and he's already dead.

645
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,699
This is when I used to
work for the corporation.

646
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,368
The CIA, et cetera.
Yeah.

647
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,405
Anyway, a piece of ceiling tile
missed my heart by about two inches.

648
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,275
Some rubble hit my back.
That's what the scar is from.

649
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,178
Hit me in the head, and they
said I had brain damage.

650
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,014
Blah, blah, blah.
Doctors. Right?

651
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,950
And an old friend of mine
turned on me.

652
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,785
That's why
i blew up the building.

653
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,420
Pretty shitty, actually.

654
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,623
Anyway, I think it put
everything into perspective.

655
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,426
Maybe the brain damage
helped. I don't know.

656
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,528
Hey, there's my guy.
I'll be right back.

657
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,630
I'll finish the rest of the story.
Okay.

658
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,165
Okay? You look great.

659
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,146
Hey.

660
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,150
You the guy?

661
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,487
I'm a guy, sure. Yeah.

662
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:09,325
Everything's in there.
Nice.

663
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,995
Who's that guy?
Where the fuck is Richie?

664
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,131
Who hired you?

665
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,399
That's none
of your business.

666
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,169
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's kind of my business.

667
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,138
<i>What do you mean
Richie's not there?</i>

668
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,040
<i>Fucking clown nose
is supposed to kill him.</i>

669
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,520
Hector Garcia?

670
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,489
Look at this guy. He looks like serpico.
What are you doing?

671
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,626
You want me to kill Hector Garcia?
That's a bit ambitious.

672
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:47,763
You won't tell me who hired you
to hire me to kill Hector Garcia?

673
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,432
Fuck you, psycho.
Psycho?

674
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,302
Get the fuck out of here
before this shit gets ugly.

675
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:57,339
You're lucky I don't pop your ass
right here. You like clowns?

676
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:15,724
Shit! He just fucking killed the guy.
The wrong guy.

677
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,664
Sorry. Whew.

678
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,833
That took a little longer
than I thought.

679
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,670
What's--
are you okay?

680
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:29,238
What's--

681
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,009
are you upset
'cause I killed that guy?

682
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,647
Martha, how I feel about that guy has
nothing to do with how I feel about you.

683
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,350
Are you--

684
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,687
um, can I go home, please?

685
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,758
Sh--

686
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,862
fudge.

687
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,939
<i>The European
central bank on Wednesday--</i>

688
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,708
geez, look at that.

689
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,509
Mm-hmm.

690
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,379
There's blood spatters
all over the place.

691
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,514
The angle and the velocity
is all weird though.

692
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,185
Like he's spinnin'.
Dancing.

693
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,654
Huh?

694
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:22,157
He wasn't spinning.
He was dancing.

695
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,629
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

696
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:32,201
Martha, wait a second.
Wait a second.

697
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,802
Goddamn it.

698
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,437
Hold on.

699
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,740
Sweetheart, is--

700
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,241
is this a fight?

701
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,443
You're really upset
about that.

702
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,713
Hey, monster, it's me.
I'm not--

703
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,248
I'm--

704
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,285
I don't think
before I act sometimes,

705
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:52,087
but I'm not a bad person.

706
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,057
You think bad people
have the capacity

707
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,327
to... love and stuff?

708
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,931
I'm sorry. You've been
through a lot, and I'm--

709
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,100
h-hold. Wait.
D-d-don't go.

710
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,169
I just wanna talk to you,
that's all.

711
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,242
Please?

712
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,913
This is on your head.
All right, clevon?

713
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,949
- You were supposed to do the hire
yourself. - Shut up for a second!

714
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:24,353
Why would anybody kill our hire in
the middle of public like that?

715
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,288
You know what doesn't
make any sense

716
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,091
is you,
here in your fortress.

717
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,426
Okay, listen to me.

718
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,127
If I'd been on that bridge,

719
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,129
your own brother
would be dead right now.

720
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,332
- Is that what you want?
- No.

721
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,336
I got an address.

722
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,473
Followed him back there. He
dropped off his girlfriend.

723
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,575
Apartment number's
on the back.

724
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:49,812
Okay, Von.

725
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:53,215
Go get 10 guys, local,
then go to this girl's place.

726
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,751
When this motherfucker
shows his face,

727
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,954
blow his face off.

728
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,490
What? Ten guys?

729
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,992
Other than you and moon.
That sounds appropriate.

730
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,061
But, Richie,
what I'm trying to--

731
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,731
no buts.
Get outta here. Go.

732
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,647
Martha.

733
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:33,088
Martha. There's two guys here
from the FBI to see you.

734
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,491
Are you in there?

735
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,892
Uh--

736
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:42,264
his name is Francis munch.

737
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,601
Formerly one of the world's most
notorious professional killers.

738
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:48,937
He's been in the game
since he was a teenager.

739
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,373
Trained
at various programs,

740
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,542
privatized,
became a bullet-for-hire

741
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,745
and just a meat grinder
of a man.

742
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:01,383
About two years ago, munch had
a nervous breakdown and quit.

743
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,352
He quit? Why?

744
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,954
The guy has something close
to emotions, always has.

745
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,290
Guilt. Remorse.

746
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:13,028
We're guessing these feelings
just finally caught up with him.

747
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,799
If he's not a hit man anymore, why
did he kill that guy on the bridge?

748
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,802
We think he developed
a kind of moral code.

749
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:21,537
He's still notorious.

750
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,541
People still try to hire him,
but now he kills them.

751
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,609
He kills the people
who hire him?

752
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,077
Yeah.

753
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,248
Because murder is wrong.

754
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,883
That's insane.

755
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,454
I would say that's
a reasonable diagnosis, yes.

756
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,256
Is this the place
where we--

757
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,825
the restaurant, yeah.

758
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:46,495
He said he killed a guy in the parking lot.
I thought he was joking.

759
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,096
I mean,
how dangerous is he?

760
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:51,033
Well-- well, now...

761
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:53,969
How dangerous?

762
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,605
There's no kind of chart.

763
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,974
If there was,
I'd say he's near the top.

764
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,110
He's just... gifted.

765
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,179
Frighteningly gifted.

766
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:08,150
NSA, interpol, FBI have made a combined
nine attempts to take him into custody

767
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:09,818
in the last two years.

768
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:14,690
Every direct confrontation has ended
in absolute, unmitigated disaster.

769
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,992
He dances in,

770
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,127
a storm of bullets and chaos,

771
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,129
and he dances out.

772
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,332
So now what?

773
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,468
If he makes
any attempt to contact you,

774
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,037
you call us immediately.

775
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,739
You get it?

776
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,165
<i>Please leave a message
at the tone.</i>

777
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,834
Martha, it's me.

778
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,336
Um, I know
the smart move here

779
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,572
is to give you
some time and some space,

780
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,674
but I need to see you
and I'm--

781
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,343
I'm coming over.
Okay?

782
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,212
I'm coming over.

783
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

784
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,355
Everything okay?

785
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,823
Everything is great.

786
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:27,062
Okay.

787
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,434
Do you think
I'm in danger?

788
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,003
We think<i> he's</i> in danger.

789
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,240
A man he killed has a lot of
dangerous people backing him up.

790
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,610
But then so did the pirrellos, and
it didn't help them none. Who?

791
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,379
A little syndicate
in New Jersey.

792
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,548
Drugs.
Heroin mainly.

793
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,618
Tried to hire munch,
and he killed 'em all.

794
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,220
Only a guy from the cartigan
family made it out.

795
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,789
John...

796
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,458
Tom...
No.

797
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,994
I forget his name. No.
You misunderstand. I'm--

798
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:03,065
do you think
I'm in any danger from him?

799
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,933
Well,

800
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:09,538
when you're a contract
killer, you have no friends.

801
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,708
You barely ever talk
to anyone.

802
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,511
Just spend hours
in endless motels,

803
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:19,481
cars,

804
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:22,050
planes,

805
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,154
just sitting there,

806
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,657
staring at nothing.

807
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:32,160
But around you,
his behavior is unique.

808
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,763
He expresses himself.

809
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,064
Emotions.

810
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,634
Other than that blank, happy
thing he's got going on.

811
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:42,137
You're the one person he's had any
kind of meaningful interaction with

812
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,106
that didn't end in a bullet.

813
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:47,075
So, are you safe?

814
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,777
Are you in danger?

815
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,580
Well, let me put it
to you this way--

816
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,449
you're clearly
an asset to him.

817
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,185
Which makes you
an asset to me.

818
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:03,025
So you can sleep tight,
Martha.

819
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,907
What the fuck, man?
This beauty's yours.

820
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,344
What the fuck
i supposed to do with this?

821
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,513
It's simple.
Bullets come out that end.

822
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,982
They hit people
and then people die.

823
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,384
This is like some
world war ii-ass old shotgun.

824
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,054
You said this guy's a supersonic
psycho killer, right?

825
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:35,157
You want me to go out like I'm
duck hunting on this motherfucker?

826
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,858
I'm sorry, Steve.

827
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,462
It was the best that we
could do on short notice.

828
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:44,533
He has no idea we're coming. Walk up
to the guy, shoot him in the face.

829
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,902
Seen crackheads in Brooklyn
with better guns.

830
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,970
A cocksucker like you
could do it.

831
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:52,240
You watch your fucking mouth, you
blinged out, cajun green goblin.

832
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,009
Look at this shit.

833
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,779
I'm like Elmer fucking fudd,
man.

834
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:17,599
Oh, really?
A grenade?

835
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,804
I taught you that one,
Francis.

836
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,053
Oi, mate.
Oh, for fuck's sake.

837
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,892
Oh.

838
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,861
I know, I know.

839
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,396
Is this guy dead, or...

840
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,898
Just unconscious.
Mm-hmm.

841
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,067
I'm really sorry.
Okay.

842
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:55,303
Do you have any-- you
have a bathtub, right?

843
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:59,307
Hey, I'm not sure, um,
that you should be here.

844
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,543
'Cause--

845
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,212
I don't know,
i feel really confused,

846
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:08,984
and... like, we should
probably take a break.

847
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,027
What do you m--
a break?

848
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,132
Okay.

849
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,734
Okay.

850
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,580
No, wait, wait.
What? What?

851
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,583
Okay, like, this whole reverse
hit man thing is like--

852
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,084
it's weird. I know.
Awkward.

853
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,920
I kill
a whole bunch of people.

854
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,155
But they suck?
They're, like, bad people?

855
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,091
But that's not an excuse.
I should stop.

856
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,127
I'm just panic-rationalizing
this to myself.

857
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:55,630
Honey, you are, but you're doing great.
Really good.

858
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,066
Uh-huh. Okay.

859
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,869
Okay, whatever.

860
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:08,176
- What the fuck?
- Hey, Sophie.

861
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,512
Hey, buddy.
- Is he dead?

862
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:13,515
Oh, he's just taking a nap.
I can see him breathing.

863
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,116
What the fuck?

864
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:20,822
You gonna take
the east side, right?

865
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,691
Yeah. I see anything,
I'll let you know.

866
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,726
Shit! Shit.

867
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,130
Hey, uh, Knox,
look, we got trouble.

868
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,834
<i>Twelve uglies heading in the
building right now. Knox? You copy?</i>

869
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,171
- Who the hell is Knox?
- He's, uh, the FBI guy.

870
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,707
FBI?
No, no, no.

871
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,876
That guy hopper's
a seriously mean bad guy.

872
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,512
Haven't seen him in a while. He looks
different every time. Who is he?

873
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,181
It's a long story.

874
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,817
After I left the agency,
he was--

875
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,319
we used to work together.
We were really close.

876
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,156
And then I said, "i don't wanna kill
people" and he was like, "you have to."

877
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,692
- He blew up a building on me in Serbia.
- What?

878
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,829
So he's<i> not</i> with the FBI? Nope.

879
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,397
We're gonna be fine.

880
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,932
Oh, Francis, I just--
what?

881
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,368
What did you call me?

882
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,869
Did you just call me...

883
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,272
He told you my name?

884
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:13,608
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Fucking motherfucker!

885
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,545
That was unnecessary. I'm sorry. Let's go.
No, I'm not gonna go.

886
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:20,949
- Wh-why not? - 'Cause you're a
criminal, and you lied to me.

887
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:24,552
- You can't go with him. He just killed
a cop. - Shut your face. Thank you.

888
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,088
I never lied to you.
Not once.

889
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,257
Martha, listen-- i guess--
yeah, that's true.

890
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,060
I mean, I did think you
were joking, in fairness.

891
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,462
- Martha, we should call the police now.
- Please.

892
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,866
- I-I'm gonna shoot you in the armpit.
- Great, great. Can't wait.

893
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:41,303
- I would never do that. - You brought
a dead body into our home! Hello!

894
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,605
How about if i
shoot you in the eye?

895
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:46,574
- I'm not talking to you right now.
- I would never do that.

896
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:51,079
- I'm pretending. - We could be
dead in an hour! Martha. Martha!

897
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,415
- Get off of me!
- Live in there now, in silence.

898
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,917
I'll let you out later.
I never lied to you.

899
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,454
What do you want from me? I'm here.
That's real. I don't know though.

900
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,924
'Cause you show up, and you're,
like, the greatest thing ever,

901
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,560
and then
you kill people.

902
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:09,264
And this guy's from the FBI,
but then he's not from the FBI.

903
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:12,100
And I don't know. It's just
overwhelming, you know?

904
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,969
I don't think
it's healthy.

905
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,138
Fuck you guys! Nobody's norm--
nobody's normal. Nobody's healthy.

906
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,775
Listen. We don't have time. So
you've gotta decide now. Okay?

907
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,579
I love you. What are you gonna
do for the rest of your life?

908
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,849
You and me. You're all I got.
Am I being crazy?

909
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,784
Am I nuts?

910
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:33,088
Let's do this. This is it. Now, honey.
We gotta do this now.

911
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,157
Oh, my god, stop talking.
I'm totally into it.

912
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,160
- Yeah?
- You're both fucking insane!

913
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,895
Let's go.

914
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:43,798
This is gonna be tough.
Why?

915
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,968
I can't kill anybody. Last time I killed
somebody, you really freaked out.

916
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,336
No, no, I'm fine.

917
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,138
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do what?

918
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,307
'Cause later you'll say--
I'm not doing anything.

919
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,641
Trust me?
Yes.

920
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,143
You look hot.
You look beautiful.

921
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,278
Hold my hand.
Okay.

922
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,285
Oh-ho! Nice shot!

923
00:57:41,223 --> 00:57:43,091
Yeah! Nice, baby.

924
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:10,385
You all right?
Huh?

925
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,886
How'd you do that?

926
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,855
Some people waste time
with the fighting.

927
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,958
I skip straight to the winning.
We'd better get out of here.

928
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:28,203
Oh, my god.

929
00:58:29,738 --> 00:58:31,172
Fuck.

930
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:34,976
Oh-- eh--

931
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,645
fuck!

932
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:42,050
Was that even a shotgun? What the
hell was that? What just hit me?

933
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,918
You okay?
Fine. Fine.

934
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,820
- Is it bad?
- You look handsome.

935
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,789
Thanks.
How's my hair?

936
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,425
Hey!

937
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,427
Aah! Aah!

938
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:55,430
Fuck, it hurts!
Fuck, it hurts!

939
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:58,933
That was great. That was really--
I totally didn't see that coming.

940
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,169
You-- you really got me.

941
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,238
What's your name?
Steve.

942
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:06,741
Too many things
happening, Steve--

943
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:11,012
Martha. Trying not to kill anybody.
I went add for a sec.

944
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,248
Why didn't you grab her?
Take her hostage?

945
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,683
I didn't think
that'd be cool, man.

946
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,953
Didn't that'd be cool?
Get a load of this guy.

947
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:22,824
You got talent. Why the fuck did they
give you that piece of shit shotgun?

948
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,159
I don't know.

949
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,528
Baby.
We should go.

950
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,963
Thank you
for not taking me hostage.

951
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:34,936
Baby!

952
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,989
Who the fuck are these guys now?
Seem super pissed, right?

953
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,559
- Yeah.
- Where the fuck is Johnny?

954
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,461
I'm gonna kill one of these guys.
Fine.

955
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:03,498
It's the last one, i promise.
No, I don't care.

956
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,668
You say that now, but later
you'll be, "why'd you have to--"

957
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,436
no, I don't care!
Okay.

958
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,141
Son of a bitch!

959
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,842
Okay, fellas.

960
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:19,180
So you saw that I could basically kill
all of you guys from here, right?

961
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:23,351
Was that dude your buddy? I mean,
look at that guy. That's game over.

962
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:26,521
Imagine Christmas with his parents.
Maybe he's got kids.

963
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:29,424
Oh, what if he's got a cat?
Maybe he's got a cat.

964
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:32,360
Who's gonna feed his cat?
Who's gonna feed<i> your</i> cats?

965
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:36,931
I know they're paying you, but is it worth
it? We all know how this is gonna go down.

966
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,033
No shame here.

967
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,535
Good?

968
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:42,570
Anybody?

969
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,039
Hey! Where the fuck
are you going?

970
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,242
We paid you for the day!
Fuck this, man!

971
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:50,878
Okay.
Anyone else?

972
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,847
Go fuck yourself!

973
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,882
Oh.

974
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,852
That wasn't very nice.

975
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:01,289
Hey, we got some chips here. We
got some pitchers of lemonade.

976
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:04,225
Why don't we hang out and
talk about this for a second?

977
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,928
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a little push.

978
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,563
It's gonna be okay.

979
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:09,964
Ready?

980
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,566
One, two, three.

981
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,941
How you feeling, fellas?

982
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,410
I had fun.
Nobody got hurt.

983
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:25,947
Well, a little hurt.
You should call an ambulance.

984
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,949
Hey, you.
Wanna call an ambulance?

985
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,484
Okay, look, don't--
don't shoot.

986
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,619
This was just
a big mistake.

987
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:34,155
There you go.

988
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,258
- Have we met?
- Kinda.

989
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,793
New Jersey, right?

990
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,928
The poconos, the pinocchios,
or something?

991
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,097
Yeah.
Th-the pirrellos.

992
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,433
- Pirrellos! Yeah.
- That's right. Yeah.

993
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,603
- Vinnie, right?
- It's Von, but don't...

994
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:52,440
Yeah. You were the guy
hiding under the table.

995
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,942
It was my first big gunfight.
It was scary.

996
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,980
- Vinnie, what did I tell you? Stay out
of trouble, right? - Stay out of trouble.

997
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:00,915
This isn't staying
out of trouble.

998
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:05,119
I'm not the one that hired you. That was my
brother, Richie. He is the one that you want.

999
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,954
I literally don't care.

1000
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,395
Okay, that's enough.
Get away from him.

1001
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:19,467
Steve, is that you?

1002
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,703
Good for you, pal.
You got me again.

1003
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,439
Martha!

1004
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,477
Clown nose. Wow.
That's a cute gimmick.

1005
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,714
You know, one time
i was gonna wear bow ties.

1006
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:36,284
Then I decided to be the guy who
just killed all your friends.

1007
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,687
I don't get it, man. Why we taking this
girl? Just shoot that motherfucker.

1008
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,824
Steve, just do
what you're told.

1009
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:44,559
Okay?

1010
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,728
Johnny, let's go!

1011
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,566
Wait a second, Vinnie.

1012
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:54,402
You want her, you come and get her.
Fremont and oleda.

1013
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,371
This is a bad call.

1014
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,339
- Hey, what about us, man?
- Fuckin' bums.

1015
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,675
That's what happens
when you craigslist criminals.

1016
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:03,077
Wait a second.
Bad move. Bad move, man.

1017
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,746
Bad move.

1018
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,984
You're awake.

1019
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:13,488
You having fun making a fool
out of yourself, Francis?

1020
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,490
Don't call me that.

1021
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:18,192
Wh-what happened to you?

1022
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:21,596
You used to be
like the grim reaper.

1023
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:24,565
I remember there was a--

1024
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,568
a guy, he was
a yakuza twat, I think.

1025
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,339
And he literally
pissed himself

1026
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:34,208
just 'cause he heard
you was on the way.

1027
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,676
What?

1028
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:41,115
Clown nose is tacky. Is there some
kind of joke I'm not getting?

1029
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,784
Knock knock.

1030
01:03:43,852 --> 01:03:47,255
- Who's there?
- The joke you're not getting.

1031
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:50,057
Get it?

1032
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,692
That's hilarious, Francis.

1033
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,229
Well, now it's time
to go home.

1034
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,365
You should smile more.

1035
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,367
You'd be more popular.

1036
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,903
That's a nice smile.
See?

1037
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:05,206
Police! Put your hands where I can see 'em!
Stay on the ground!

1038
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,109
What took you so long?
I was waiting for backup.

1039
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:12,480
- Nobody's here yet. - You're here
now, so relax. He's in custody.

1040
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,451
Why are you talking
like that?

1041
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,055
Why is everything
such a problem?

1042
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:24,959
Oh, bollocks.

1043
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,063
It's actually a very simple plan.
All right.

1044
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,999
The girl is exactly where we want her.
She's in Richard's office.

1045
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,936
So the bait is set. We wait
for that maniac to come here.

1046
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:37,572
He kills everyone
that stands in his path.

1047
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:40,675
We find an excuse, any excuse,
to get the fuck out of here.

1048
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:43,744
And then, blip-blap-blop, Richard's
gone, I'm king of the castle.

1049
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:47,415
What doesn't make sense about this?
I don't know. All of it?

1050
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,618
Richard
is waiting for you.

1051
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,286
Thanks, dickhead.
Peace to you too.

1052
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,956
No.
Just him.

1053
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:58,493
You're telling me that you
shot this guy in the face

1054
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,028
and he just
survived?

1055
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,499
It was your guys that gave me a
900-year-old fucking shotgun.

1056
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,601
- Really?
- So with all due respect, mister,

1057
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,169
I don't understand
what happened.

1058
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:11,405
Just give me my fucking
money and I'm out the door.

1059
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,976
I apologize.
What was your name again?

1060
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,044
Steve.
Steve.

1061
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,981
Steve, what do you like
on your pizza?

1062
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:21,983
Uh, cheese, man.
Yeah?

1063
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:24,118
Yeah?
Cheese?

1064
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,455
How about
some extra cheese?

1065
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,728
Still working.
It's a good phone.

1066
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,863
Now... you.

1067
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,666
No, listen. This is what me
and Johnny are gonna do.

1068
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,135
We're gonna go out there,
get the word out.

1069
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,638
Then we're gonna throw up
a 100-grand reward.

1070
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,674
$100,000? That's your plan?
That's my plan.

1071
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,978
That's
a stupid idea.

1072
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,915
Bruce, what the fuck do you
even do around here, man?

1073
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,651
If we don't know
where this guy is,

1074
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,186
no one can afford
to leave this house.

1075
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:03,190
Honestly, I think the safe bet
is to just let her go.

1076
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,526
- Hmm?
- Let her go?

1077
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,095
Really?
That's your fucking idea?

1078
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,732
You know what? You have no
idea what you are doing.

1079
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,235
You have no balls,
no-- oh, yeah?

1080
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,837
Fuck!
Son of a bitch!

1081
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,943
I'm going to work much harder
to control my anger.

1082
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:23,678
But people are dead.

1083
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,014
The bodies are piling up
and dad is kinda gonna notice.

1084
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,051
And the fault is yours,
you piece of shit worm-fuck.

1085
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,554
I have been defending
your worthless coke-head ass

1086
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:37,358
for years--
for fuckin' years.

1087
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,493
And now I realize...

1088
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:42,196
I was wrong.

1089
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,968
You should've died
with the pirrellos.

1090
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,740
- Fuck you, Richie! - Take the girl
and get the fuck out of this room.

1091
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:57,645
And I don't give a shit if
you tell mom I beat your ass.

1092
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,648
Bruce.

1093
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,250
Nobody else leaves.
No more fuck-ups.

1094
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,587
If that cocksucker has the
balls to show up here,

1095
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,656
we hit him
with everything we got.

1096
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,928
Okay, okay.

1097
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,565
I lost track of my dumb
decisions a long time ago.

1098
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:26,440
You guys had an automatic m-16
military issue with a laser scope,

1099
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:29,644
and you give me
a fucking Elmer fudd shotgun?

1100
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,846
Fuck this shit.

1101
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:38,986
Motherfuck,
we are totally fucked.

1102
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,089
We're gonna be stuck here
when that psychopath shows up.

1103
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,826
Will you get this for me? I can't do it.
Yeah, we're fucked. Big deal.

1104
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,095
You started this ride,
Von.

1105
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,599
You're the one who pushed the
shit ball rolling down the hill.

1106
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,000
Seriously?
Mmm.

1107
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:55,369
Will you please
shut the fuck up?

1108
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,872
Watch your mouth
with me, man.

1109
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,675
Or what?

1110
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,677
Don't let this
become un-fun.

1111
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,679
It's supposed to
be fun, right?

1112
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,947
Or I get
a bad attitude.

1113
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,517
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1114
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,019
I'm fucking Johnny moon.

1115
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:18,325
What?

1116
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,633
Okay. You wanna have some fun?
Yeah.

1117
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,234
You wanna
have some fun?

1118
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,470
What's that, baby? I couldn't
hear you under there.

1119
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,641
Okay.

1120
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:36,077
This is you guys.

1121
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:38,879
"Oh, no! He's gonna
come and kill us!"

1122
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:42,016
"I'm Johnny moon!
I love you, Von!"

1123
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:44,585
"I love you too. Wanna
go on a camping trip?"

1124
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,587
"Oh, anywhere with you,
buddy."

1125
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,889
I like this bitch.

1126
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:54,528
So,

1127
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,430
why don't you tell me.

1128
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,566
What's it like?

1129
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,935
Having an IQ
over 17?

1130
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:03,771
Dating a serial killer.

1131
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,176
Now, I gotta slow you down
right there for a second,

1132
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,712
'cause to be honest, i--

1133
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,115
I don't understand
your plan.

1134
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:18,018
Like, is it
a "get killed" plan?

1135
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,121
Is it, like, a plan
to get killed?

1136
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:23,090
Like an elaborate
sort of suicide pact?

1137
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,363
Stings, right?

1138
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,632
Are you stupid?

1139
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,102
You're so fucked.

1140
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,573
When he gets here, you better
hope you're long gone.

1141
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:43,577
Because he's
going to kill you.

1142
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:47,114
And if he doesn't,
i will.

1143
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,284
You're gonna kill me?
You are?

1144
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:55,055
Well, they tell me successful
people set achievable goals, so...

1145
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,997
How does it feel now?
Huh, bitch?

1146
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,135
I feel--

1147
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:14,842
I feel motivated.

1148
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:21,148
Motherfuckers-- "oh, do this, Steve.
Do that, Steve.

1149
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,585
Come on, Steve, you can handle it.
Take the fucked-up shotgun."

1150
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:29,156
Hey,
what's going on?

1151
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:32,026
Uh-uh.

1152
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,364
Ooh,
that looks good.

1153
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,167
How many guys inside?

1154
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:43,971
Got fucking Von, Johnny, Bruce, Richie.
So that's four.

1155
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,707
Plus six other motherfuckers
with automatic weapons, man.

1156
01:10:47,642 --> 01:10:49,343
May I?

1157
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:01,288
That oughta stir 'em up.

1158
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:05,359
- What happened to your face? - Fucking
asshole Richie beat me with a phone.

1159
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,361
Get outta town.

1160
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,898
I'm serious, man. Motherfucker
beat me with a phone. What a jerk.

1161
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,033
Yeah. Can I have some
of these gummy bears?

1162
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,402
I like the green ones.
Help yourself.

1163
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,672
That's funny. I hate the fucking
green ones. Really? Perfect.

1164
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,741
You know what I mean?

1165
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:23,677
Will I see you inside?

1166
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,346
That's what
they pay me for.

1167
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:27,214
Good luck, buddy.

1168
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,084
This fucking guy
is crazy.

1169
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:33,087
Von,
go to Richard's office

1170
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,055
and take him down
in the basement.

1171
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:40,094
You, upstairs.

1172
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:49,937
- Don't worry, Richie.
- Everything's under control.

1173
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:16,297
Motherfucker.

1174
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:18,899
What's going on? Having
a hard time with that?

1175
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,602
I'm used to a smaller
caliber gun than this

1176
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:23,938
let me take
a look at it.

1177
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:27,608
It's a nice gun.
Thanks.

1178
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,977
There you go.
You want your gun back?

1179
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:33,047
Do you want it back?
Please?

1180
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,149
- Psych.

1181
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,918
Son of a bitch, man!

1182
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,287
- Where's Martha?
- My foot!

1183
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,989
Fuck you.

1184
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,733
All right,
I'll find her myself.

1185
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,301
What?

1186
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,104
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1187
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,673
- Aren't you gonna kill him?
- What?

1188
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,776
- You know, do your thing with
the thing that you do? - What?

1189
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:06,613
The hit man thing where they try
to hire you and then you kill them

1190
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:10,584
out of some fucking misguided moral fucking
purpose you have-- that crazy bullshit.

1191
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,754
No, no. I promised my girlfriend.
I don't do that anymore.

1192
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:17,591
- What? - Yeah. You ever met
a girl and it's just like--

1193
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,127
you can't eat, you can't
stop thinking about her.

1194
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,130
Dude,
spare me the bullshit.

1195
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,866
I brought you all the
way here to kill him!

1196
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:30,471
And you tell me that you're not
killing anymore? What the fuck?

1197
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:33,140
I'm sorry, man. I don't
mean to let you down.

1198
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:37,511
I have no desire to kill you or your brother.
I'm just here to pick up my girlfriend.

1199
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,314
What the fuck, clevon?
Shut the fuck up, Richie!

1200
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:42,483
You're letting me down
in a big way!

1201
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:45,319
I think you two have some
issues to talk about.

1202
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:47,554
I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

1203
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,660
Richie, get off!

1204
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:57,398
Give me that-- ow! Hey! What's
with you and the biting?

1205
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,141
Fuck.

1206
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,024
Hey, what's happening?

1207
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:27,027
- Gorgeous.

1208
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:30,931
Okay. What are you doing? What is
that, like tae Kwon do or something?

1209
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,902
It's karate. The thing is, I don't
do karate. So that's not fair.

1210
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:37,037
You got a fucking gun
in your hand.

1211
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,873
All right, well,
I'll tell you what.

1212
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:44,111
If I promise to put the gun
down, will you not use karate?

1213
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,347
Okay.

1214
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,584
All right, I'm gonna put the gun down.
We're all good.

1215
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,053
Ow! Fuck!
That was karate!

1216
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,756
That's definitely karate!

1217
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,258
Wait a sec!
Wait a second!

1218
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:03,897
Oh-ho-ho!
That's a grenade.

1219
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,201
What's the plan here?
It's a small room.

1220
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:09,903
Th-this is bad.
It's real bad.

1221
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,738
Why do you have
a grenade?

1222
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,574
Never mind.

1223
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,309
I don't wanna die.

1224
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,144
Yeah.

1225
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:20,581
Okay, hold on a second.
Just stay still. Okay.

1226
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:23,650
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Now you're making<i> me</i> nervous.

1227
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:26,587
Okay, you're shaking a little bit.
Shh. Be careful. Be careful.

1228
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:30,224
We're gonna do this together.
Ready? One, two, three.

1229
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,493
There we go.
Yeah.

1230
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:35,262
We did that.
Why don't you sit down?

1231
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:38,398
Go ahead, sit down.
Relax. Just breathe.

1232
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,969
Out through the nose,
in through the mouth.

1233
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:44,905
- Freeze!
- Hey! Whoa! Steve!

1234
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,306
Look at you.

1235
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,143
That's my man Steve.
What's happening?

1236
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:53,614
Well, there's no way i could get my gun.
You got a little red dot on my heart.

1237
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:56,850
I mean, i don't<i> think</i> I could.
Could I?

1238
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,852
Hey.

1239
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:02,322
Your bosses are in the other
room trying to kill each other.

1240
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:05,626
Do you hate me? You wanna kill me?
Is that important to you?

1241
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:08,862
It's not worth it to me. I'm just
here to pick up my girlfriend.

1242
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,466
So you know what? Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna put my gun down.

1243
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:13,734
Okay?

1244
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:19,439
What's the move, Steve?

1245
01:16:27,682 --> 01:16:31,051
You know what? I like you more than
those motherfuckers anyway, man.

1246
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,786
I like you too, man.

1247
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,956
Hey, you know Bruce? Bruce, Steve.
Yeah. We met at the office.

1248
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:39,660
Bruce is having a hard day. Maybe you
could look after him for a while.

1249
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:41,962
I gotta go.
I'll see you.

1250
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:48,402
Hey!

1251
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,108
- Hey, monster.
- Hi, honey.

1252
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:57,010
Oww!
Sorry.

1253
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,579
That was thoughtless.

1254
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,247
Terribly sorry.

1255
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:04,218
What? What are you waiting for?

1256
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,486
Gosh, you're cute.

1257
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:09,990
You just like me
tied up.

1258
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,825
You pervert.

1259
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:14,528
It's true.
Yes, I see it now.

1260
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:18,098
It's true. Okay. Get in here.
Come here.

1261
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,866
Mine now.

1262
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,468
Like that?
It's mine now.

1263
01:17:23,104 --> 01:17:25,606
Why are we going
so slowly?

1264
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:29,042
I'm a little afraid of that guy
with the tank top. Oh, Johnny moon?

1265
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,178
Yeah.
Is that his name?

1266
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,447
I know. It's so stupid.
Ridiculous.

1267
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,749
You know, he spit on my face.
What?

1268
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,752
That's not the worst of it.
He made fun of my nose.

1269
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:41,722
- Oh, no. I like how the nose looks.
- You do?

1270
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:45,425
Yeah, 'cause it's like-- it feels
like everybody's having a good time.

1271
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:48,128
Yeah, well, ideally they
are, you know, but--

1272
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,232
oh!

1273
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,901
Baby. Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

1274
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,070
Knock it off, Francis.

1275
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,905
Get out!

1276
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:02,409
Get outta here!
Get out! Run!

1277
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:06,280
All right, wait a second.
Let's talk about this.

1278
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,499
Come on.

1279
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:39,813
He must really like you.

1280
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,517
I sure hope so, 'cause otherwise coming
to save me and killing all these guys

1281
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:46,186
is sending some
seriously mixed messages.

1282
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:52,426
God, can you not
laugh right now?

1283
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:57,297
I've got blood in my ass crack and my
face hurts from you guys hitting me.

1284
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,933
You're being a real ass,
you know.

1285
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,203
You know, it's funny, you being
down there and me up here.

1286
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,473
It reminds me of when I was little.
There was this kid, Eric.

1287
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,643
This is gonna be a great
story, I can tell. No, no.

1288
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:12,646
Now, this kid, he would
pick on me every day, man.

1289
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:16,450
He would scrunch up
my lunch bag every day.

1290
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:19,886
And I thought, you know, that
kid, he's bigger than me.

1291
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,488
He's stronger than me.

1292
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,891
But-- and you're gonna like this.
He had this turtle.

1293
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:30,230
The most important part is,
he loved this turtle.

1294
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:34,301
And I thought, you know,
I'm bigger than a turtle.

1295
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:37,471
I'm stronger than a turtle.

1296
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:41,608
And you know the sound a turtle
makes when you crush it?

1297
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,915
Screams.

1298
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:53,019
Now you're catching my drift,
right?

1299
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:57,524
Clown nose shows up, he sees you bleeding
out, gets him thrown off his game.

1300
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,961
Squish. Johnny moon wins. Done.

1301
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,564
You know,

1302
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,735
truth is,
it wasn't about Eric.

1303
01:20:11,205 --> 01:20:13,440
Truth is...

1304
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:19,212
You know, i just love
crushing turtles.

1305
01:20:30,057 --> 01:20:33,693
Aah! Oww! Fuck! Aah!

1306
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,963
Ow!

1307
01:20:42,036 --> 01:20:43,770
Ow! You mother--

1308
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,482
just fuckin' die.

1309
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:05,759
I like turtles, you dick!

1310
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,001
Whoa!

1311
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:24,845
Johnny, Richie's dead!

1312
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:27,781
The guy you're calling is dead.
Sorry. <i>What?</i>

1313
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,817
Hello? Hello!

1314
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:34,521
Super-good.
Super-good.

1315
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:43,330
It's not
that I'm angry with you.

1316
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,899
It's just
that I'm disappointed.

1317
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:49,769
I'm gonna take you
out into the desert,

1318
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:53,807
I'm gonna dose you up on
something really, really special

1319
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:57,277
and we're gonna reprogram
this shit out of your brain.

1320
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,778
Too late for that.

1321
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:05,051
- This is bad.

1322
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:28,608
Babe?
You here?

1323
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,882
Where the fuck is Johnny?

1324
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:38,184
And why do you have
his phone?

1325
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:40,387
Okay,
he told me to tell you

1326
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:43,690
that he, um, wanted to go to
Canada to visit his girlfriend.

1327
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:46,526
They met online. She designs jewelry.
She seems super-sweet.

1328
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,229
- Shut the fuck up. Where is he?
- Okay.

1329
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:51,264
Okay.

1330
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:55,035
I<i> did</i> kill him. I bashed him
over the head with a statue.

1331
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:57,537
And you're next.

1332
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:00,206
No, you-- you're lying.

1333
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,542
- You're lying!

1334
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,847
Shit.

1335
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:10,417
Oh, fuck!
You fucking bitch!

1336
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:14,054
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

1337
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:15,789
Fuck!
My fucking hand!

1338
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,599
I told you
this would happen!

1339
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,468
I told you, but you
didn't listen to me!

1340
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,303
Nobody listens to me!

1341
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,472
God!

1342
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:35,842
I am a t. Rex!
I am invincible!

1343
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:43,083
Oh, well done. This is great.
Thanks for this.

1344
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:44,651
Yeah?

1345
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:48,088
This isn't exactly
how I saw the day going.

1346
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,656
Really?

1347
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:56,062
I promised Martha
i wouldn't kill anybody.

1348
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:58,531
Oh, well, that's a relief.

1349
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,801
I'll tell you what,
Francis.

1350
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,404
I might not be the good guy
or whatever,

1351
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,439
but it takes one
to know one.

1352
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,942
I mean, look at you.

1353
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:12,312
You look like a fucking
psychopath right now.

1354
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:16,282
You think you're just gonna walk
out of this life and settle down?

1355
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:20,553
You'll never be normal.

1356
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:22,856
Good.

1357
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:28,995
Hey!

1358
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,965
Hey!

1359
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:34,534
Who the fuck
wants to be normal anyway?

1360
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,670
Oi, turn around,
you daft cunt!

1361
01:24:37,371 --> 01:24:39,005
Francis!

1362
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:41,474
You're gonna make me
shoot you in the back?

1363
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:45,178
The truth is,
you got boring, hopper.

1364
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,158
- Hey, Steve!
- You all right, buddy?

1365
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,160
Yeah, I'm okay now.

1366
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:01,961
Look at you, man.

1367
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:05,165
The bounty on hopper's,
like, $5 million.

1368
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:08,368
What? This motherfucker
worth $5 million?

1369
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,336
I'm rich, bitch!

1370
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,872
Hey, you got
any green ones?

1371
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:15,075
I saved a couple
for you.

1372
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:19,579
Thanks, man.
Hey, dancer.

1373
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,148
Yeah?
Thank you.

1374
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,917
Hey, right on.

1375
01:25:25,352 --> 01:25:27,821
Hey, dummy.
Hey, baby.

1376
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:29,889
You're all wet.
I<i> am</i> wet.

1377
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:33,493
I missed you.
I missed you.

1378
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,662
Oh, where did you
get these?

1379
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,764
I got 'em from Steve. Steve?

1380
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,833
Hey, Steve.
You know Steve?

1381
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:42,402
Baby, your pupils are super-dilated.
Really?

1382
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,437
Did you get shot
in the face?

1383
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,373
Yeah.
I got shot in the face.

1384
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,042
You did?
Yeah.

1385
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:51,211
Who did that?
I'll bang him.

1386
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:52,712
No,<i> I</i> banged him.

1387
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,081
I banged him, and I banged
the other guy, yeah.

1388
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,250
I banged them
right in their faces.

1389
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:00,019
You banged <i>two</i> guys?
I banged two guys!

1390
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,721
That's a-list killing,
Martha.

1391
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:05,024
That's a clean sweep. You
got all the main bad guys.

1392
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,192
Yeah?
Yeah.

1393
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:09,362
Well, you know,
i-- I make shit happen.

1394
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,464
Confidence.
Yeah, confidence.

1395
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,299
Fucking t. Rex.

1396
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,202
Rrrr!

1397
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:20,106
Hey, listen. We gotta go to
the hospital real bad. Okay.

1398
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:28,481
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
You're right.

1399
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,351
Hey, Steve,
can you give us a ride?

1400
01:26:53,674 --> 01:26:57,677
Where do you wanna go first? Don't make
me choose. You know I'm bad at this.

1401
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,313
I'm so indecisive, it's
like torture. Okay.

1402
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:04,184
I'll tell you what. I got a plan.
Oh, yeah?

1403
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:08,288
Jalapeño, we go to Thailand
for the allosaurus dig.

1404
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:12,325
Lime, we go to Brazil
for the pterodactyls.

1405
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:18,198
Whichever one you pick, that's
the one you really wanted.

1406
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,338
Targets in sight.

1407
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,208
Snatch and grab as soon
as they leave the market.

1408
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,910
<i>Copy that.
Alpha team in position.</i>

1409
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:35,782
Oh! Jalapeño!
I'm really happy.

1410
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:37,984
- I wanted it to be the jalapeño.
- Thailand?

1411
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:39,786
Yeah!
Thailand it is.

1412
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:44,891
- He's got nowhere to go.
- <i>Echo team, prepare for lockdown.</i>

1413
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,893
<i>Target has something
in his hand.</i>

1414
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:48,461
Wait.
<i>Could be a weapon.</i>

1415
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,663
- What's he doing?
<i>- Echo team, what can you see?</i>

1416
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:54,000
What's he doing? <i>We've lost visual
contact with the female target.</i>

1417
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,835
We've been spotted.
Shit!

1418
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:58,571
Where's the girl?
Who's got eyes on the girl?

1419
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,674
Oh, shit.

1420
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,143
What you looking at?
