1
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,646
Oh great, mighty Rapu.

2
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:31,965
We pray to you.

3
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,621
For water and sustenance.

4
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:37,731
I pray to you, not for me...

5
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,684
But for my daughter.

6
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,675
I'm tired.

7
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:15,546
You have suffered...

8
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,780
Come to me...

9
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:35,030
You have suffered...

10
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,281
Ah, what do we have here?

11
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,179
Look at it...

12
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,847
Gobbling up all my fruit.

13
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,056
Rapu.

14
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,522
Bringer of light.

15
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:35,273
Oh, it's one of mine.

16
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:37,943
I am Gorr.

17
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,846
The last of your disciples.

18
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,685
We have lost everything, my lord.

19
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,592
The land is dry.

20
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,977
All life is lost.

21
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,071
But our faith in you,
never wavered.

22
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,178
And now we await the promise...

23
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,537
of the eternal reward.

24
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,878
Is this why you celebrate?

25
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,686
He thinks there's
an eternal reward.

26
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,464
No...
No, sorry.

27
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,253
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

28
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:14,021
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

29
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,874
We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword.

30
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,144
Before he could harm any other
gods with that cursed blade.

31
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,532
- You see...
- Threaten to end my entire empire.

32
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,119
But my lord...

33
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,769
Your empire has already ended.

34
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,913
There's no one left to worship you.

35
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:34,558
There'll be more followers to replace you.

36
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,251
There always are.

37
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,548
We have suffered...

38
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,833
And we have starved.

39
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,495
My daughter died...

40
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:48,679
in your name.

41
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,067
And well, you should.

42
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:53,669
Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

43
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,771
There's nothing for you after death...

44
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,837
...except death!

45
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:00,350
You are no god.

46
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,465
I renounce you.

47
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,367
Now, your meaningless life...

48
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,099
...finally does have a purpose.

49
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:22,764
To sacrifice yourself to me.

50
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,011
So it's revenge you seek...

51
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,439
Kill all the gods.

52
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,462
Go to Eternity.

53
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,759
It's revenge you seek.

54
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,051
Summon...
The Bifrost...

55
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,944
Go to Eternity...

56
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:42,857
Summon...
The Bifrost...

57
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:45,376
Go to Eternity.

58
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,451
Kill all the gods.

59
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,718
The sword chose you...

60
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,479
But you are now cursed.

61
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:06,795
Funny...

62
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,732
It doesn't feel like a curse.

63
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:13,948
Feels like a promise.

64
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,198
So this is my vow...

65
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,112
All gods will die.

66
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,396
Come...

67
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,056
Come, gather round...

68
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,416
And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

69
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,129
a.k.a. "The God of Thunder".

70
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:19,128
a.k.a. "Thor Odinson".

71
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:27,737
Raised in the way of the Warrior...

72
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:30,440
Thor was taught to
help bring balance.

73
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,180
Fighting the good fight, for
those who can't fight neither.

74
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,550
He grew.

75
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,901
And he grew.

76
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,736
And he grew.

77
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:43,047
He was sensitive,
like a smile.

78
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:45,808
And his loving nature
did not discriminate.

79
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,381
He once loved a swash-buckling fashionista.

80
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:52,553
Another time, he
loved a wolf woman...

81
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:54,643
on a woman wolf.

82
00:07:56,132 --> 00:08:00,697
But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

83
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:01,932
Oh, wait no...

84
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:03,804
Jane Foster.

85
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:04,832
But sadly...

86
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:07,302
In the battle for love, Thor lost.

87
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,052
In fact,
he lost a lot of people in those days.

88
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:13,354
His mum.

89
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,569
His dad.

90
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,103
And that guy.

91
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,119
And that guy...

92
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:18,504
And whoever that is.

93
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,817
And Heimdall.

94
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,779
And his brother.

95
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,438
And his brother again.

96
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,764
And again.

97
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:29,426
Poor Thor had to watch
his planet explode.

98
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,341
And then he said,
"What have I done?"

99
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:35,891
it seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

100
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,769
And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...

101
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,270
So it could never be broken again.

102
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,301
But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

103
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,346
He teamed up with
the Guardians of the Galaxy...

104
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:52,316
and set off on some
classic Thor adventures.

105
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:54,032
He got in shape...

106
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,907
Putting in the hard yards...

107
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,839
Turning pains into gains...

108
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,274
And never skipping leg day.

109
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,868
He went from dad bod to god bod

110
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,333
But beneath this god bod...

111
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,110
There was still still a sad bod,
just trying to get out.

112
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,005
Because all of the bods that
Thor had worn over the years...

113
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,709
Couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

114
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,914
So, he gave up his search for nothing.

115
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,908
Accepting that he was
only good for one thing.

116
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:30,721
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...

117
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,622
Thor...

118
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,991
We need your help
to win this battle.

119
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,091
Thor...

120
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,962
We need your help
to win this battle.

121
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,228
Let's go.

122
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,639
Alright, I'm game.

123
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,843
Come on, Stormbreaker.

124
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,188
Let's hurry, okay?

125
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:49,606
People are dying.

126
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,709
See you down there.

127
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,670
Hurry up!

128
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,529
Gimme those!

129
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,787
You're gonna break it.

130
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,600
- I am Groot!
- Oh, you got sap all over it.

131
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,238
Hello, everybody!

132
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,402
Well, well...
Look who it is!

133
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,984
- How are we doing, guys?
- Horrible!

134
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,169
We're all about to die!

135
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,556
You said, this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

136
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,624
I said, it was going to
be like a relaxing holiday.

137
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,038
Well, look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

138
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:34,991
What can be more
relaxing than that?

139
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,587
An actual holiday!

140
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,806
Die, Booskan scum!

141
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:44,795
- God of Thunder!
- King Yakan.

142
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,156
You have finally joined our fight.

143
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,726
Well, as they say,
better late than not at all.

144
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,479
It's very nice.

145
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:55,155
As you know, we
used to live in peaceful oasis.

146
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,941
- But then, our gods were murdered.
- Murdered?

147
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:01,176
And now, our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

148
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,847
And Habooska's horde
took control of it's path.

149
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,851
It is our most sacred
shrine and... He desecrates.

150
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,939
Not for long.

151
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,915
King Yakan...

152
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,843
Tell them what happened here today.

153
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:17,102
Tell the time that Thor...

154
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,804
Ragtag, motley crew,
misfit desperados...

155
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:26,288
Turn the tide in the battle and
etch their names in history.

156
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,263
The odds may be against us...

157
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,647
- But I'll tell you this for free.
- Here we go.

158
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:35,026
This ends here, and now!

159
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,569
Please don't let him
go into the temple.

160
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,650
Well done, everybody.

161
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:47,955
We can collectively take credit for that,
because we worked as a team.

162
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,582
We used our hearts and
our minds to defeat the enemy...

163
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,618
With minimal loss or damages.

164
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,301
What a classic Thor adventure.

165
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,716
Hurrah!

166
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,534
Good book?

167
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,450
Yeah.

168
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,644
I wrote it.

169
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:36,326
You're...
You're Dr. Jane Foster?

170
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:37,964
I am.

171
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,367
- Hi!
- Hi!

172
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:41,144
How's the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

173
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:42,731
Tough.

174
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:43,956
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

175
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,928
You need a 3D model.

176
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,742
You ever seen Event Horizon?

177
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,721
No.

178
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,480
- Interstellar?
- No.

179
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:53,395
That movie explains
everything really clearly.

180
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,169
Um, alright.

181
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,934
The Einstein-Rosen
bridge folds space...

182
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:04,726
So that point A and point B
will coexist in space, like that.

183
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,563
You just ruined your own book.

184
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,266
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

185
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,114
- You watch those movies.
- Okay.

186
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:16,992
Ah, the hot Cheetos.
Had to get it.

187
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,443
So how's the...
How's the club?

188
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,543
It's going amazing.

189
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,973
Have you...

190
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,582
Told anyone else besides me?

191
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,482
When people find out.
they start acting weird.

192
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,794
They're just...

193
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:42,685
different.

194
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,421
And I'm not afraid now.

195
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:46,944
Anyway, it's not that serious.

196
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,866
Jane, it's stage four.

197
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,959
Out of like, how many stages?

198
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,203
- Four.
- That we know about.

199
00:15:58,267 --> 00:15:59,268
Oh, you have uh...

200
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,971
Somewhere else you gotta be right now,
that's more important than chemo.

201
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,006
No...

202
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,200
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

203
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,618
- I have a few ideas I'm trying.
- Okay, no. Time out.

204
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,874
I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do.

205
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,604
Otherwise, you're letting
down all civilization, but...

206
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:26,528
You're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

207
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,263
So let me translate.

208
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:31,314
Slow.
Down.

209
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:34,168
Use your energy to fight this thing.

210
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,885
I'll fight it my way, okay?

211
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,440
Um, FYI...

212
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:42,311
"My way" does not have
to equal alone in a lab.

213
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:47,083
Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

214
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,418
- It's not a card.
- Yes, it is.

215
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:51,137
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

216
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,856
It's tall, and blonde,
and it's gorgeous.

217
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,157
It is a handsome card.

218
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,992
Jane, are you sure?

219
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:59,061
I will figure this out...

220
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,273
By myself.

221
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,568
Results are just
coming back the same.

222
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,472
I'm afraid the chemo
has very little effect.

223
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,946
I'm so sorry, Jane.

224
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,823
If there's anything I can do
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

225
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:17,979
Smell like a king...

226
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:20,017
Because you're worthy.

227
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,243
Old Spice.

228
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:55,255
Look at this place.
It's beautiful, oh.

229
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:57,821
Allfather.

230
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,471
- We're here to take you home.
- Yes.

231
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,466
To Planet Asgard.

232
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,271
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

233
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,689
It is a people.
It is you.

234
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:12,804
And now it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

235
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,974
I will take my place

236
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:22,600
in the great banqueting hall of Valhalla,
the resting place of the gods.

237
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,357
Oh, one more thing.

238
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:26,783
You have a sister.

239
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:34,516
And so now I turn into godly
stardust and say farewell.

240
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:35,317
Oh, look.

241
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,144
Do you see?

242
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,921
Dad?

243
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,155
I'm disappearing.

244
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:49,678
- No!
- Father!

245
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,400
But wait, brother!

246
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:55,957
An ominous portal has appeared behind us.

247
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,480
Transform!

248
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:10,119
I am Hela,
Goddess of Death.

249
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:15,432
Now, I return to Asgard, to stake my
claim as the rightful heir to the throne.

250
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,369
And no one will stop me!

251
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,260
Join me or die.

252
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,729
- We'll never join you, witch.
- Mjölnir.

253
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:26,945
Impossible!

254
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,406
I broke your hammer!

255
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,949
Time to die!

256
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,075
- Bifrost!
- Bifrost!

257
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,664
You can almost feel the power

258
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:51,068
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

259
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,538
Okay, let's head back to the village...

260
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,774
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

261
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,848
Come on.

262
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,627
God of Disaster...

263
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,823
We thank you.

264
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:41,786
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods.

265
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:45,213
But now, peace shall reign.

266
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,038
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

267
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,774
It is tradition, protectors of our
world are bestowed with great... beasts...

268
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,749
- Giant goats?
- Oh, look at those. They are wonderful.

269
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:03,723
Korg, look at that.
Those kids are beautiful.

270
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:06,042
King Yakan,
thank you so much.

271
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,936
Listen um...
about the temple.

272
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,426
- I don't want to talk about the temple.
- I know, but if we were to talk about it.

273
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:14,024
- It's important... Okay, I'll stop talking.
- It's making me sad and mad.

274
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:15,913
Don't forget the goats.

275
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,490
Which you accepted and now must take with you.

276
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:19,546
No whacking.

277
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,968
Awh, they are beautiful.

278
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:23,421
Yes, they are beautiful.

279
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,961
- They also scream quite a lot.
- They'll be fine.

280
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,681
We need to find a damn remote so
we can download the distress signal.

281
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:34,017
Well, re-retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

282
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,540
One of these goats
probably ate it.

283
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,235
Goats don't eat remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,011
Alright, he can do that crap.

285
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:39,955
I love them.

286
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,514
These will live with us forever.

287
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:42,510
Found the remote!

288
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:44,471
I'm putting them down.

289
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,607
Don't shoot.

290
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,135
No, it's not working.
It's not charged.

291
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,018
Well maybe, you need
to find the charger.

292
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

293
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,124
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

294
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,383
Alright.
Everybody, just relax.

295
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:56,297
The goats are going
to be fine.

296
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:58,111
If not, we can just
turn them to meat.

297
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:02,892
...ting people... meeting people.
They are great conversation starters.

298
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,357
And... been told you can summon them
with a special whistle.

299
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,654
It goes something like this...

300
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,931
No, that's not it.

301
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,013
No, that's not it.

302
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:10,544
No, that's not it.
You have a go.

303
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:11,972
No, that's not it.

304
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,136
- Oh! Hey, guys!
- Kraglin!

305
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,004
You've been here,
this whole time?

306
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:17,873
Yeah, you said to
stay with the ship.

307
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,912
This is Glenda.
We're married.

308
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,085
I am Groot.

309
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,688
What did I tell you about
jumping into new relationships?

310
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,582
- That I shouldn't do that.
- Yeah!

311
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:28,784
You can't get married on
every single planet we land on.

312
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,160
I am Groot.

313
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:32,047
Finally!

314
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,510
Alright, here we go.
"Distress Calls".

315
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,035
Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

316
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,103
God Butcher?

317
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:41,306
- It's just a dragon.
- It's a warning!

318
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,861
All of these gods murdered.

319
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,867
Our greatest champions...

320
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,804
Now laid to waste.

321
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,136
The horror.

322
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,761
Who could have done something like this?

323
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,193
- Where are you?
- Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,632
What was that?
Go, go, go back.

325
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:55,833
Play that one.

326
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:58,569
Thor, where are you?

327
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:00,266
- Sif.
- We need you here.

328
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:02,851
Well, my friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

329
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:04,590
Start the ship, my friends.

330
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:06,418
Oh. Maybe,
we should split up.

331
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,131
So many people to save, I mean.

332
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,069
Look at all these distress... calls.

333
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,843
Thor, you're gonna be okay?

334
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:20,057
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

335
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,002
Alas, it's something
I'll never have.

336
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,994
Buddy, if I may

337
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:24,812
You may.

338
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:30,053
After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.

339
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:31,593
I've been lost before.

340
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,583
Then I found meaning,
I found love.

341
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,018
And yeah, it got taken
from me, and God, that hurts.

342
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,354
But that shitty feeling is
better than feeling empty.

343
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:47,455
My hope for you is that one day,
you will find something...

344
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,342
To make you feel this shitty.

345
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,617
I have loved before.

346
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,302
Didn't work out.

347
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:57,114
They either die a brutal death or
they dump you with the handwritten letter.

348
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,175
I don't know which is worse, which is
why I keep everyone at arm's length.

349
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,292
I've grown too attached, damn it!
I knew this would happen.

350
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,515
You must go!

351
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,114
I'll find, Sif.

352
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:09,483
You answer the other calls.

353
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,053
The Galaxy needs its guardians.

354
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,684
- Cool, yeah. We were just thinking.
- Shhh! I know this hurts.

355
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,912
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

356
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,227
To ease the pain,
why don't you uh...

357
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:22,042
Take the ship here,
as a parting farewell gift.

358
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,273
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

359
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:25,234
Yes, she's yours.

360
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,865
May you make as many
memories with her as I have.

361
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,813
She's a temperamental old lass.

362
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:32,107
Serve you well,
in a tight pickle.

363
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,217
- Start the ship?
- Thank you.

364
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,742
Goodbye, old friend.

365
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,334
Human handshake.

366
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:39,567
Asgardian shake.

367
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:42,608
Into the snake that
you cannot trust.

368
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:47,597
- Really dragging this out
- Finish the classic Asgardian high one.

369
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,871
- Let's go.
- Take care of my crew.

370
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:54,930
It's going to be
hard for them.

371
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,223
- Hurry up!
- Not her.

372
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,576
Remember what I told you.

373
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,945
You ever feel loss?

374
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,715
Just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

375
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,833
They'll tell you exactly where you are.

376
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:12,159
Alright, bye.

377
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:18,681
Once more, but we
had good memories.

378
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:22,891
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens".

379
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,512
I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead.

380
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:28,672
They're gone.

381
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:30,562
Alone again, just me and you.

382
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:31,558
Stormbreaker!

383
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:34,356
Careful with your crazy ax.

384
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,483
So what do we do now, bro?

385
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:40,742
Let's go get Sif.

386
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,280
Who or what is that?

387
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,594
Falligar,
God of the Falligarians.

388
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,000
One of the nicest
gods you'll ever meet.

389
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,176
Sif!
It's me, Thor.

390
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,518
Odinson.

391
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:20,886
You're missing an arm.

392
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,101
Let me get you home.

393
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,018
No!

394
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,261
Leave me here.

395
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,356
I want to die a warrior's death.

396
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,590
On the battlefield, in battle.

397
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,127
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

398
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,717
Oh, I hate to break it to you.

399
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,494
But for a warrior
to get into Valhalla,

400
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,633
you have to die in the battle.

401
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:40,042
- You survived.
- Ah, shit!

402
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,313
Maybe, your arm is in Valhalla.

403
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,649
What happened here?

404
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:47,186
I've been hunting a mad man.

405
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,652
I followed him here!

406
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:51,118
- It was a trap.
- Who is this mad man?

407
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,515
The God Butcher,
he's coming.

408
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:56,118
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

409
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:57,770
Asgard is next.

410
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,256
- Look, it's Thor! Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

411
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:53,877
Hey! Who'd you piss off now?

412
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:54,632
It's not my fault.

413
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,738
I've never even seen these things,
whoever the hell they are.

414
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:57,873
Welcome back.

415
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:07,830
Die!

416
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,711
Whos' the new guy?

417
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,213
That guy...
You're gonna love that guy.

418
00:30:41,545 --> 00:30:43,371
Mjölnir.

419
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:43,992
Mjölnir!

420
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:45,414
It's me, Thor.

421
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,532
Have you seen my hammer?

422
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:48,367
Mjölnir, here boy.

423
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:51,085
Mjölnir?

424
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:56,943
Mjölnir.

425
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,986
You're back.

426
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:08,744
Mjölnir!

427
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:38,315
'Scuse me.
Hello.

428
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:39,771
That's my hammer you got in there.

429
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:41,959
and that's my look.

430
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,185
Hey!

431
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,969
Enough tomfoolery, wench.

432
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:57,235
Take off that mask
and reveal yourself.

433
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,040
Grant...

434
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,000
Hey.

435
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:02,754
Jane?!

436
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,063
Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.

437
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,110
He was a God of Thunder.

438
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:17,590
And she, a woman of science.

439
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,876
And although they were
from different worlds...

440
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:24,955
Somehow, it just made sense.

441
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:29,346
And together, they embarked
on the journey of love.

442
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,493
Thor taught Jane,
the way of the warrior.

443
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,446
And Jane taught Thor,
the way of the people.

444
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:48,184
And as time passed, their
love grew deeper and deeper.

445
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,654
She's incredible.
Isn't she, Mjölnir?

446
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,500
I need you to promise me,
you'll always protect her.

447
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:02,464
I love you too, buddy.

448
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,451
A love that deep, has a way
of becoming magical.

449
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,325
Thor set a path towards a future
and all it might hold.

450
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:24,754
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

451
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,215
And although Jane didn't want to admit it,

452
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:29,416
she was scared of loss as well.

453
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,539
And so, they built walls between them.

454
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,781
Thor got busy,
saving humanity.

455
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:40,156
Heimdall!

456
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:44,436
Jane got busy, doing the same.

457
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,464
Real busy.

458
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,168
And eventually, the space
between them grew and grew

459
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,356
Until it became too wide to bear.

460
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,613
Some things
had to give.

461
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:02,679
I have to stay up all night,
then go through this data.

462
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,786
While I just stay up all night
eating and clean all of this up.

463
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,601
There's two plates!

464
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,297
And then one night,
it didn't give.

465
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:16,336
Jane wrote a note.

466
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,439
And Thor read that note.

467
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:24,317
And their legend
suddenly became myth.

468
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,176
Or so they thought.

469
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,239
You okay?

470
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:33,730
Yes.

471
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,434
It's a little hot,
isn't it?

472
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,579
Just trying to feel...

473
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,394
Bit claustrophobic
with the helmet.

474
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:45,683
How?!

475
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,465
Can we talk about this later?

476
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,766
Yeah, sure.

477
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,109
Great seeing you!

478
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:55,898
What?!

479
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:45,035
Hey! Is that the Necrosword?

480
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,833
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

481
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:50,926
Then, you know
this is going to hurt.

482
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,263
Pain.

483
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,681
What is pain, but a construct
invented by the weak.

484
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:56,173
Oh, okay!
That's very sharp!

485
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,697
Ready?

486
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:10,642
Don't touch my things.

487
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,705
You better run,
you coward.

488
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:01,156
The children!
They're taking the children!

489
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,422
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

490
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:04,804
- Dad!
- Mom!

491
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:05,648
Mother!

492
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:32,267
Shadow monsters,
disgusting.

493
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:37,633
Flew around the world twice, nothing.

494
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:40,351
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

495
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:45,540
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Ah, you're telling me.

496
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,709
What's it been like?
Three, four years?

497
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,187
Eight years, seven months and six days.

498
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:51,380
I haven't forgotten.

499
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,310
The last time I saw you or
didn't see you, because you left.

500
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:57,611
Kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

501
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,855
Ah, no, you left.
You did.

502
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:02,190
You wrote me
a beautiful handwritten letter.

503
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,258
I should know,
I was there.

504
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,532
- You weren't there, actually.
- I was.

505
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:06,971
Hence, the note...

506
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:12,409
And if you weren't there to see me
leave, then maybe it was you that left.

507
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,916
Fair point.

508
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,513
- Not that it matters, like...
- No.

509
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:18,088
- Just keeping track, right?
- Yeah.

510
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,064
I supposed we both left
and both got left.

511
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:22,509
Now, you're leaving again.

512
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,102
Miek, we need detailed
accounts from all the witnesses.

513
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:29,900
Darryl, get all the names of the
children who've been lost.

514
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,629
- Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken.
- Don't worry.

515
00:38:32,654 --> 00:38:34,402
And she'll be found.

516
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:37,044
Guys, they're bleeding!
Get them to the infirmary, now!

517
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,859
- Darryl!
- Majesty.

518
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,243
Should we start working on a
performance of this entire debacle?

519
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,861
People need entertainment.

520
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,733
Particularly now,
in times of crisis.

521
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:46,867
Particularly.

522
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:50,535
I did not hear a "no".

523
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:52,395
Nor did I.

524
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,853
Asgard, at night.

525
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:55,201
We open on some
sleeping children.

526
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,883
So that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

527
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:04,294
- The old ex-girlfriend,
- Judie Foster.

528
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,184
- Jane Foster.
- The one that got away.

529
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:08,370
The one that got away.

530
00:39:08,394 --> 00:39:10,258
- That means escaped.
- Yeah.

531
00:39:10,654 --> 00:39:11,727
Yeah.

532
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,603
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

533
00:39:13,628 --> 00:39:15,870
and your ex-hammer hanging out 
and getting on so well.

534
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:22,167
What you up to, bro?

535
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:24,221
Come on.

536
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,053
Come to daddy.

537
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:29,314
Come on, Mjölnir.

538
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:33,862
Hey, there you are!

539
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:35,386
Hey!

540
00:39:35,517 --> 00:39:37,521
- I was just calling you.
- ...Start an army.

541
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:38,218
With what?

542
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,426
- Half our soldiers are dead.
- Half our soldiers are always dead.

543
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,036
- Everyone, please. Go home.
- Where are the children?

544
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,520
I promise you will have news soon.

545
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:45,140
- I don't know.
- Can't go far.

546
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:46,183
I think the worst has happened.

547
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,254
She'll find them.

548
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,443
You know what?
This is all wrong.

549
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:54,735
Asgard!

550
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:06,362
My friends,
we must not quarrel.

551
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,618
Times like this, we need
to unite and come together.

552
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,302
See what's happening here.

553
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:14,818
We're afraid.

554
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,002
Hm?

555
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:16,960
Scared.

556
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:19,773
Afraid.

557
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:20,860
Anxious.

558
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:26,821
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

559
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:27,945
I'm sorry, Miek.

560
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,505
It's very hard to give a rousing
speech with the eh-eh-eh noise.

561
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,074
What are you doing?

562
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:34,597
- She's taking minutes.
- Well, precious minutes we don't have.

563
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:36,448
Want the kids back?

564
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:38,558
I'll be back in a moment.

565
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:41,621
Write that down, Miek.

566
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:55,939
Stormbreaker,
what are you doing?

567
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,633
Is this about Mjölnir?

568
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:58,693
Everyone out!

569
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:02,630
Didn't find 'em.

570
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:03,962
Your cape is on fire.

571
00:41:03,987 --> 00:41:05,040
It's fine,
it'll grow back.

572
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,844
I'm invoicing you for this.

573
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:07,688
Okay.

574
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:08,877
What do we know about this guy?

575
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:10,248
He travels through shadows.

576
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:11,788
And he creates
monsters with them.

577
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:13,596
Absolutely, freaky monsters.

578
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:14,980
Also wields the Necrosword.

579
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:15,700
How do I know that?

580
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,136
Because he almost speared
me in the face with it.

581
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:18,215
What's a Necrosword?

582
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,516
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands, since the dawn of time.

583
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,746
It has the ability to slay gods.

584
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,903
It slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

585
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:29,840
- Oh, so it infected him.
- It's infecting him. Yes, it must be.

586
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:34,811
So basically, we're up against a
cursed shadow, zombie kidnapper.

587
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:36,750
Awesome!
When do we leave?

588
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:38,407
Thor?

589
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,574
Can you see me?

590
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:40,625
Uh, floating head alert.

591
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:41,819
It's Astrid.

592
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:42,867
Heimdallson.

593
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:44,588
Astrid, are you okay?

594
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:46,682
I no longer go by the name, Astrid.

595
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:48,904
I'm now known as Axl.

596
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:51,170
He's a singer from a
popular band I heard on Earth.

597
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:51,988
GNR.

598
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:52,621
Astrid...

599
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:56,121
Your father gave you a very tough Viking
name and I intend to honor his wishes.

600
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,376
- Axl.
- Astrid.

601
00:41:57,402 --> 00:41:58,689
- I said, Axl.
- Astrid.

602
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:01,298
- Axl!
- He's Asshole! Now, listen to him.

603
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:03,158
Alright, fine.
"Axl"...

604
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:05,200
- Where are you?
- I'm not sure.

605
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,942
I don't know how to
use my magic powers yet.

606
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,503
Your father told me
and I'm here to teach you.

607
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:11,455
I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

608
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:12,932
Okay, good.

609
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:15,855
Now, focus.
Close your eyes.

610
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:22,169
Thor!

611
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,865
Hey!
How's it going, kids?

612
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:27,597
How's it going?
Look where we are.

613
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:30,233
We're in a cage made of spikes.

614
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,102
Yeah, that's right.
Not good.

615
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,117
- You gonna do something?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

616
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:36,938
But just not right now.
I'm the vision ghost, look.

617
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:40,267
- See.
- What will happen to us?

618
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,905
You can tell,
this is a very, very bad situation.

619
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,483
You know, the good news
is, you're Asgardian.

620
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:48,743
So if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

621
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,243
Oh, my God, go away.

622
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,290
Okay, kids.

623
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:56,182
Alright, kids. Don't cry.
You'll survive, okay?

624
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,697
Listen, I got a plan, okay?

625
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,688
I'm putting together a
really, really good team.

626
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:01,039
We've got
um, uh...

627
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:02,399
Uncle Korg.

628
00:43:02,424 --> 00:43:03,587
King Valkyrie.

629
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:04,493
Um, yeah...

630
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:08,311
My ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
'nother story I won't bore you with, okay?

631
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:12,501
But it is a top notch team, and we're
gonna have you home before you know it.

632
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,372
Yeah.

633
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,016
I know where you are.

634
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:26,516
I'm gonna get
you out of here.

635
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:27,949
I'm scared.

636
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:28,837
We all are.

637
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,980
Look out for them.
Take care. Okay, take care.

638
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:40,327
See you soon, alright?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

639
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:43,098
They're in the Shadow Realm.

640
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:44,341
How do you know?

641
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:46,913
The atmosphere there has
a darkness like no other.

642
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,209
As if color refused to tread.
It's unmistakable.

643
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:51,444
Well then,
if it's color we need.

644
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:52,703
Let's bring the rainbow.

645
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:56,954
Bring the rainbow? Is that a
catchphrase or something?

646
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,679
She's only been a
Thor for a minute.

647
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:01,572
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest, she needs work.

648
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,419
- How many catchphrases have there been?
- A lot.

649
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:06,822
Yep, jumped the gun.

650
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:10,101
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the shadow realm.

651
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:11,864
It seems like that's where he's
going to be the most powerful.

652
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:13,460
You're right. We can't
just go launching in there.

653
00:44:13,492 --> 00:44:15,551
Could be a trap.
Could be endangering the children.

654
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:17,574
We need reinforcements.
We should raise an army.

655
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,884
Are you thinking what I
think you're thinking?

656
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,375
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

657
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,461
- Thinking what?
- Taking it to...

658
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:22,899
- Omnipotent City
- Omnipotent City

659
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:26,046
What's Omnipotent City?

660
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:28,352
It's the home of the most
powerful gods of the universe.

661
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,379
We can put together the greatest team ever.

662
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:33,984
We can recruit Ra,
Hercules, Tūmatauenga...

663
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,418
Quetzalcóatl, maybe.

664
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:38,165
And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

665
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,901
- Did you say, Zeus?
- Yes, Zeus.

666
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,523
Like the Zeus.
Zeus Zeus.

667
00:44:41,523 --> 00:44:42,837
I'm not sure if
he has a second name.

668
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:44,986
You think my god will be there?
Ninny of the Nonny.

669
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,033
Well, you never know, Korg...

670
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:47,696
But if they are, we'll 
ask them to join our team.

671
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:48,400
Yes!

672
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:49,305
Stormbreaker.

673
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:52,309
Calm down, relax.

674
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:53,010
No, no, no, mate.

675
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:55,258
We are not traveling on
Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

676
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:56,371
Look what just happened.

677
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:59,245
We can't exactly go in your tiny
little flying portal horse, can we?

678
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,578
- We won't all fit.
- What are you talking about?

679
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:01,385
Warsong's awesome.

680
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,740
Stormbreaker's
awesome too.

681
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:04,109
Stormbreaker just
needs a conduit.

682
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,414
Anything that can
handle space travel.

683
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,872
I love when she talks science.

684
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,517
It has the power
to get us there.

685
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,018
Just need something
to focus that energy

686
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:12,210
So it's not so...
unpredictable.

687
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:12,932
You know, uh.

688
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:15,954
If we had a ship, we could harness it
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

689
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,166
Ooh, like an engine.

690
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:19,094
- Like an engine.
- You need a ship?

691
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,396
I got a ship.

692
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,241
Throw all those seats.

693
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:28,376
There you go.
No, tie those goats to the front.

694
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:29,993
We leave in 15 minutes.

695
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,944
Essentials only,
everyone.

696
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,256
That's essential.

697
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:38,247
Bet you moved on quick, didn't you.

698
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:40,977
You are some piece of work.

699
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:44,040
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

700
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:46,468
- Catching up with an old friend.
- Yeah.

701
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,528
I've been meaning to apologize.

702
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:50,022
Sort of acting a little weird before.

703
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:53,360
I just haven't really been myself lately.
You know, now that...

704
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:56,455
Trying to figure out who I am and
uh, just felt a little bit lost

705
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,567
And then all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me.

706
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,536
And it's been kinda...

707
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:02,638
It's a lot for me, too.

708
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:03,879
So how did uh...

709
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:04,849
you guys get together?

710
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:06,083
How did this happen?

711
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:09,871
I swear, I heard
Mjölnir call to me.

712
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,321
Ah, did it?

713
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:13,281
And so I came here to investigate and...

714
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:17,461
- Pieces started glowing and swirling...
- Crazy.

715
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,254
Thor.

716
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:22,644
Well, you know what. It looks
good on you. It works, so...

717
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:27,329
Just checking.

718
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:32,789
See you later.

719
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,471
What?

720
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:41,950
We were just talking.

721
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,924
Mommy, don't leave me.

722
00:46:55,924 --> 00:46:58,961
Don't be afraid.

723
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:01,396
Even when I'm gone, honey.

724
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,032
You won't be alone.

725
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:09,004
And whatever happens...

726
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:12,708
Never stop fighting.

727
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:30,901
- Hey.
- You alright?

728
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:32,227
Great!

729
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:34,959
The sink would say otherwise.

730
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:38,413
You think I really
should be coming?

731
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:40,043
I'm not getting any better.

732
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,150
You're a Thor.
Of course, you should come.

733
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:43,606
Besides, what else
are you gonna do?

734
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:45,192
You're a Viking now.

735
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:47,293
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle.

736
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:49,587
It needs to be
devastatingly painful.

737
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:51,525
Otherwise, you
don't get into Valhalla.

738
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:52,318
My plan.

739
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:55,325
What about you
kinging and stuff?

740
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,918
I love being king.

741
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:57,886
I love my people.

742
00:47:57,886 --> 00:47:59,526
But it's all meeting
and raven mail.

743
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,307
And meetings that could
have been raven mail.

744
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:02,695
I miss fighting.

745
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:03,992
I miss my sisters.

746
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:06,403
Which is why you need to come
because I need one.

747
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:09,114
Okay, we should go.
You packed?

748
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:11,152
Are you packed?

749
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:13,681
Yes.

750
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:17,383
A hand grenade?

751
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:19,004
No, it's a portable speaker.

752
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:27,353
Let's go.

753
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:31,795
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps.

754
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,821
I got you.

755
00:48:35,343 --> 00:48:37,526
My fellow Asgardians...

756
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:38,455
Wish us well.

757
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,579
For we shall travel with
the speed of Odin's ravens.

758
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:44,539
We will return with children.

759
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,236
Many children.

760
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:51,348
Then we should feast,
along the children.

761
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:53,103
We do not do that anymore.

762
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:54,710
It was dark times.

763
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,467
Shameful time.

764
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:57,773
Okay, we should go.

765
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:46,203
So...
Still rollerblading?

766
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:48,030
No, no.
You?

767
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,409
Oh yeah, every weekend.

768
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:50,785
Once you blade, you never fade.

769
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,534
- Right, Korg?
- Skate twins for life.

770
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,844
Hey, can I run something by you?

771
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:54,611
Yeah.

772
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:56,881
So I was thinking,
when we get to the bad guy...

773
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:59,710
What about if I had, like,
the cool catchphrase, like...

774
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,818
"Eat this hammer, bang!"

775
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:03,187
Or like?

776
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,278
"Check out my hammer, boom!"

777
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,848
Like, what about?

778
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:08,977
You know,
I'm workshopping it.

779
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:11,502
No, they... They're all
really good. Mine is uh...

780
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:13,155
"This ends here and now."

781
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,756
Oh, that's such a good one.

782
00:50:14,756 --> 00:50:16,090
Took me a long
time to perfect it.

783
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:17,559
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

784
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,094
This is my first bad guy.

785
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:20,398
You never forget your first.

786
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:24,375
Yeah.

787
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,202
So you got a girlfriend?

788
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:28,839
Oh, no, no.

789
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:31,250
Too busy. Don't have time.
You know, just...

790
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:33,219
With work and everything.

791
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,049
Cool.

792
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,244
Let me check this place out.

793
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:40,991
So cool.

794
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:42,292
- Who's so cool?
- Huh?

795
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:44,262
The buildings are cool.

796
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:45,395
What's happening there?

797
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,197
- What?
- Am I, uh...

798
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:48,847
Sensing feelings?

799
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:50,645
Feelings, what?
With Jane?

800
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,465
- Yeah.
- No, don't be ridiculous with feelings.

801
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,764
The last time we had feelings
were long time ago. Long, long gone.

802
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,607
Not even...
She said you had feelings.

803
00:50:58,632 --> 00:51:00,788
Mate, relax.
We're on the same team.

804
00:51:00,813 --> 00:51:03,194
I know exactly what
team we're on, okay.

805
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:04,258
Team Jane.

806
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:11,346
Thing about Thor is that
he always bounces back.

807
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:14,187
Like when Hela stole his
hammer, he went and built an ax

808
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:16,401
which is forged in
the heart of a dying star.

809
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:22,257
And with the same ax,
he used to cut off Thano's head.

810
00:51:23,337 --> 00:51:25,536
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Now, come on.

811
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,872
What a neat story.

812
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:35,913
Oh, with all this talk
about chopping off heads...

813
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:37,272
I wanna have a go.

814
00:51:38,507 --> 00:51:39,792
What's this?

815
00:51:39,816 --> 00:51:41,543
Oh...

816
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:43,394
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho...

817
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:44,813
Oh.

818
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,148
This is Harpy.

819
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,557
Hello, Harpy.

820
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,318
How are you?

821
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,903
Do you know
what Harpy loves?

822
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:54,232
Having his head ripped off.

823
00:51:58,105 --> 00:52:00,236
What? You liked it
a second ago.

824
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:03,574
Alright.
Alright, alright.

825
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,863
Harpy's gone.

826
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,152
Come on.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

827
00:52:11,176 --> 00:52:13,227
Ah, you.

828
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,718
I knew a little girl,
just like you.

829
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:21,549
And she was brave.
And she was smart...

830
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:24,761
And funny.

831
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:26,926
And, she liked to draw.

832
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:31,694
Let me ask you a question...

833
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,714
About gods.

834
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:36,766
They're meant
to protect you, right?

835
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:38,734
Well, where are they?

836
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:41,694
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

837
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:43,115
Yes...

838
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,082
I'm counting on that.

839
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,243
That's why you're here.

840
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,614
It's invitation only, so we're gonna
have to keep a low profile and blend in.

841
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:56,484
Luckily, disguises are my speciality.

842
00:52:56,953 --> 00:52:57,953
Philosopher.

843
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:00,183
It's all a painting.

844
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,331
What are those?

845
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:03,066
Actual disguises.

846
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:05,273
They're the cloaks of
the emotion gods.

847
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:09,105
Every color signifies
different emotions.

848
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,555
- Where are the emotion gods?
- Hm, don't ask.

849
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,446
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

850
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,473
This is where the most powerful
creator gods in the universe hang out.

851
00:53:34,356 --> 00:53:36,458
There's the god of magic.

852
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:38,337
God of dreams.

853
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,334
God of carpentry.

854
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:40,945
Ah, look at that one.

855
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,975
Ah, yes.
That's Bao, god of dumplings.

856
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,860
- Pst! Hey, Bao.
- Bao!

857
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:46,210
Look up there, guys!

858
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:48,583
The Kronan god,
Ninny of the Nonny.

859
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:51,060
Hey, Ninny Nonny.

860
00:54:03,468 --> 00:54:19,989
Zeus!

861
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:34,960
Hey!

862
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:36,977
I am Zeus!

863
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,117
Bless us!

864
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:42,636
Oh, there he is!

865
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,765
The man, the myth, the legend.

866
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,327
Oh, I don't know if you know this,
but I based a lot of what I do on this guy.

867
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,074
He's the god of lightning
and the god of thunder.

868
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:51,793
Huge source of inspiration.

869
00:54:51,817 --> 00:54:52,594
That's really good.

870
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:55,516
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

871
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,006
Um, how do we get up there?

872
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,406
We should like, fly?

873
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,037
Well, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of his entrance.

874
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:01,766
He's famous for his entrances.

875
00:55:02,547 --> 00:55:03,855
Thunderbolt.

876
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:05,483
- Thunderbolt.
- Yes!

877
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:09,306
Zeus!

878
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:30,178
Calm down!

879
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,249
Calm down!

880
00:55:32,982 --> 00:55:34,082
Silence.

881
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:35,701
Silence!

882
00:55:39,543 --> 00:55:41,949
I hereby open...

883
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:45,249
this holy council of the gods.

884
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:49,019
Where we have many,
many serious matters...

885
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:50,734
To be talked about.

886
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:51,788
Such as...

887
00:55:52,623 --> 00:55:54,932
Where are we going to
hold this year's orgy?

888
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:57,103
Is this guy for real?

889
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:58,496
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

890
00:55:58,496 --> 00:56:00,525
- I'm sure he has important things...
- Shh!

891
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,861
- So now we're going to announce...
- Sorry.

892
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:08,481
The winner of the most human souls
sacrificed in the name of a god.

893
00:56:08,506 --> 00:56:10,007
Yeah, okay.
Maybe, he's not that great.

894
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:11,342
Oh, no,
not good.

895
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:13,299
No, I don't think it's going
to get any better than this.

896
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:14,879
And at least,
god's army can help

897
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:16,647
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be huge.

898
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:17,627
Judges!

899
00:56:17,651 --> 00:56:19,799
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

900
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:22,153
We bum-rush him,
take the bolt, ding dong.

901
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:24,430
- All right, let's go get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

902
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:26,229
There's no ding donging
or bum-rushing.

903
00:56:26,254 --> 00:56:27,915
Especially not, Zeus's bum.

904
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,727
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

905
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:30,602
Time is right now.

906
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:33,209
- Time is not right now.
- Who is talking?

907
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:34,465
Who is talking?!

908
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:36,027
- These guys!
- Korg, shut up.

909
00:56:36,052 --> 00:56:38,760
You guys have something
to say to the group?

910
00:56:38,785 --> 00:56:39,946
Sorry.

911
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,782
I'm bashing heads in
60 seconds, so speak fast.

912
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:45,042
Literally, heads will roll.

913
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:46,276
Who are you two?

914
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:47,855
Hello!

915
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:51,322
Uh, let me be the first to say
it is an honor and a privilege...

916
00:56:51,347 --> 00:56:52,716
- to be here.
- No, I can't hear you.

917
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:54,537
Why don't you take the stage?

918
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:56,198
The stage, down there?

919
00:56:56,223 --> 00:57:00,559
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

920
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:02,942
Gotcha.

921
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:13,540
Oops, sorry.

922
00:57:13,565 --> 00:57:14,692
Good luck, bro!

923
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,709
Mighty Zeus!
Heh, wow!

924
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:28,224
Gods of the universe.

925
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:31,288
I come here to ask for help,
to raise an army.

926
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:35,174
There's a maniac, called the God
Butcher, which seeks to end us all.

927
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:36,402
His destruction is everywhere.

928
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:40,660
Entire planets, realms, have
been left completely unprotected.

929
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:43,013
There's nothing but
chaos in his way.

930
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:44,536
But I know where he is.

931
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,878
With your help...

932
00:57:45,903 --> 00:57:49,246
We can crush him before
he kills anyone else.

933
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:50,629
That guy.

934
00:57:50,654 --> 00:57:53,751
He killed a couple
of low-level gods.

935
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:55,227
Eh, boo-hoo.

936
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:57,884
If that's all, pretty boy...

937
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,703
You go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

938
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:02,887
Um, yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not
hear any of what I just said?

939
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:05,056
He's, he's murdering on mass.

940
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,257
I tell you, one time.

941
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:08,434
Now, you shut up.

942
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:09,474
You'll be quiet.

943
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:12,528
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

944
00:58:12,553 --> 00:58:14,924
Zeus!
We must do something.

945
00:58:14,948 --> 00:58:16,867
You can not come to the orgy!

946
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:18,327
You have to listen to us.

947
00:58:18,352 --> 00:58:20,554
That's it!
Shut up!

948
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:24,679
Your highness. Whenever
you're ready, you just tell me.

949
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:26,043
We go on my signal.

950
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:27,044
What is the signal?

951
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,604
- It'll be go.
- Hmm...

952
00:58:32,357 --> 00:58:33,927
Let's see who you are.

953
00:58:33,952 --> 00:58:35,579
Take off your disguise.

954
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:37,892
And flick!

955
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:46,451
Flicked too hard, damn it!

956
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,635
Should we help him?

957
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:52,503
Eventually.

958
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:53,968
Grape?

959
00:58:54,472 --> 00:58:55,761
Looks like a shy...

960
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,557
And what about the others?

961
00:58:57,582 --> 00:59:02,189
- We take off their disguise too.
- Oh, no, you don't. We got this.

962
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:04,243
- Disguise off.
- Mine's off.

963
00:59:04,268 --> 00:59:05,995
Asgardians...

964
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:08,927
I thought you've seen the
last of him when Odin died.

965
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:12,566
You...
are Thor.

966
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,796
The God of Thunder.

967
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,366
It is not thunder,

968
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:18,211
Just the sound of lightning?

969
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,609
Good one, dad!

970
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:23,467
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

971
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:25,469
He's taken Asgardian children.

972
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:27,638
Who do you think we are?

973
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:29,507
The God police?

974
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:32,885
Every god watches
over their own people.

975
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,554
Nothing more,
nothing less.

976
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:38,249
Asgardian problems...

977
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:40,991
are Asgardian problems.

978
00:59:41,016 --> 00:59:43,198
How the mighty have fallen.

979
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:45,798
My hero, Zeus...

980
00:59:45,823 --> 00:59:47,362
Afraid.

981
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:00,204
Couple of things...

982
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,275
One.
Yes, I am scared.

983
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:06,752
Gorr has the Necrosword.

984
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,417
Which means, he will kill us.

985
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:10,281
Not good.

986
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:13,101
Two, I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

987
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:14,153
I understand.

988
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,954
But all you do,
is causing panic.

989
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:18,964
Panic is not good.

990
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:20,524
We are safe here.

991
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:21,893
You, my friend.

992
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:23,502
You are safe here.

993
01:00:23,527 --> 01:00:25,563
So chill up here, okay?

994
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:28,067
Have some wine. Have some grape.

995
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,942
Anything goes here...

996
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,769
In Omnipotent City.

997
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:35,648
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

998
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,079
If you do that,
I put your clothes back on.

999
01:00:39,276 --> 01:00:41,145
Now, I put your clothes back on.

1000
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:44,605
Flick, flick, flick.
It's the Golden Temple of the Gods.

1001
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:47,665
It's not a rude
and nudy festival.

1002
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:50,659
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least, let us use your weapons.

1003
01:00:50,684 --> 01:00:52,508
We need your lightning bolt.

1004
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:55,101
My lightning bolt is
called Thunderbolt.

1005
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:58,337
So I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this...

1006
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:01,571
That you should, at least, get
the name right when you ask.

1007
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:03,487
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1008
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:04,668
Thunderbolt!

1009
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,980
No.

1010
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:39,136
Do not worry.

1011
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,337
The God Butcher...

1012
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:43,709
He will not reach Eternity.

1013
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:44,675
Eternity?

1014
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,844
What does he mean,
"reach Eternity"?

1015
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:51,753
Oh, shit!

1016
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:55,861
Eternity.

1017
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:59,557
It's a very powerful being at
the center of the universe.

1018
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:03,103
He will grant the desire of
the first person who reaches it.

1019
01:02:03,128 --> 01:02:04,628
Like a wishing well?

1020
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:09,801
What do you think a guy called,
the God Butcher, would wish for?

1021
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:13,072
If he seeks the altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1022
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:16,115
- Zeus, we must act now.
- He's not going to make it.

1023
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:18,580
He doesn't have the key.

1024
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,486
Is this the
purpose of the gods?

1025
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:23,322
To hide away in a
golden palace, like cowards?

1026
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:25,449
Maybe we have lost our way.

1027
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:27,511
You know what?
We're gonna stop him ourselves.

1028
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,612
I am afraid,
I cannot allow that.

1029
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:32,581
This is a secret place,

1030
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:34,667
known only to the gods.

1031
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:36,746
You know where we are...

1032
01:02:36,771 --> 01:02:39,204
The God Butcher could use you...

1033
01:02:39,228 --> 01:02:41,173
To find us.

1034
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:42,419
This is not good.

1035
01:02:43,434 --> 01:02:44,635
So now...

1036
01:02:45,836 --> 01:02:47,559
You must stay.

1037
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:49,585
Guards!

1038
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:53,250
Hey!

1039
01:02:53,275 --> 01:02:54,478
Can we do
my plan now?

1040
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:56,446
Yes,
rush his bum.

1041
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:57,431
Hell, yeah!

1042
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:02,222
Oy,
you didn't say "go".

1043
01:03:06,558 --> 01:03:07,590
Coming, guys.

1044
01:03:18,435 --> 01:03:19,535
Thor, catch!

1045
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:23,152
Korg!

1046
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:43,918
Val, duck!

1047
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,382
Korg!

1048
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:53,636
Thor.

1049
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:56,248
Oh, no.

1050
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:57,808
No!
Korg!

1051
01:03:57,808 --> 01:03:59,021
Thor!

1052
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:00,483
I'm perishing.

1053
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:07,206
Zeus!

1054
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,932
You're next, Odinson!

1055
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,909
That's the sound of lightning.

1056
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:28,835
No.

1057
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:31,909
Korgy!

1058
01:04:32,576 --> 01:04:34,517
Thor, I'm down here.

1059
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,456
Great! Where are you?

1060
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:38,527
- Here I am.
- Korgy!

1061
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:39,990
I thought I died.

1062
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:41,685
Yes!
You're alive!

1063
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:45,020
Turns out, the only part of
the Kornan that's alive is its mouth.

1064
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:47,158
Korgy, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1065
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:48,322
I'll do my best.

1066
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:50,513
- My god, I need you alive.
- I won't mind.

1067
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:51,537
Ready to go for a ride?

1068
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:57,424
Now,
you got me six.

1069
01:04:57,982 --> 01:04:59,336
Eight o'clock, Val.

1070
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:00,962
7:48!

1071
01:05:02,294 --> 01:05:03,658
You can do this, dammit.

1072
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,122
That's not it.

1073
01:05:05,147 --> 01:05:06,153
That's not it.

1074
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:07,238
Nope.

1075
01:05:07,263 --> 01:05:09,615
Come on, Korg.
Push those lips.

1076
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:24,285
I did it!

1077
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:06,401
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us, and we flew out the window.

1078
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:07,104
The end.

1079
01:06:07,104 --> 01:06:09,306
Another classic Thor adventure.

1080
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:11,142
Can't believe you killed Zeus.

1081
01:06:11,142 --> 01:06:12,661
Well, you know what they say...

1082
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:14,079
Never meet your heroes.

1083
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:18,491
What's important is, we are on
our way to you, right now.

1084
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,238
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1085
01:06:20,263 --> 01:06:21,708
We're alright.
A little scared.

1086
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:24,221
Well, listen. I know what
it's like to be scared.

1087
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:26,073
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

1088
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:27,992
I don't think I would
have been as brave as you.

1089
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:28,826
Really?

1090
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:31,908
In fact, you might just be the
bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1091
01:06:31,932 --> 01:06:33,138
All of you.

1092
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,221
So I need you to keep
being brave, alright?

1093
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,436
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1094
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:39,054
Team kids in a cage.

1095
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:41,972
Can you do that?

1096
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,565
Yeah.
I think we can do that.

1097
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:46,242
I know you can.

1098
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,142
Alright?

1099
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,239
- Thor?
- Yeah?

1100
01:06:52,723 --> 01:06:54,270
I'm glad, I met my hero.

1101
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:55,595
Wow.
Thanks, buddy.

1102
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:01,325
How are the children?

1103
01:07:01,325 --> 01:07:03,360
As you can imagine, they're a
little bit scared because they're kids.

1104
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,429
But I told him that
everything is going to plan.

1105
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:06,364
And so you lied to them.

1106
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,498
You still have a plan?

1107
01:07:07,498 --> 01:07:08,665
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1108
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,901
- There is a plan.
- No, there's no plan.

1109
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:13,204
We failed to raise a god army.

1110
01:07:13,204 --> 01:07:14,571
- Korg is dead.
- He's not dead.

1111
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:16,333
- I'm not dead.
- Well, he's a head.

1112
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:18,676
And you, you were properly humilated.

1113
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:21,112
No, I got properly naked,
which I'm okay with.

1114
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:22,957
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1115
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:24,152
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1116
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:28,152
We're not going into the Shadow Realm
weaker than we were before. We...

1117
01:07:28,152 --> 01:07:29,640
- We're gonna die.
- No one's gonna die.

1118
01:07:29,664 --> 01:07:30,721
- We...
- Okay.

1119
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:33,157
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1120
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:35,063
- We killed Zeus.
- You killed Zeus.

1121
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:38,129
For you, that may or may not
be catastrophic for the whole universe.

1122
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:38,922
And surely,

1123
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:41,799
The entire god kingdom is probably gonna
hunt us down for the rest of our days.

1124
01:07:41,799 --> 01:07:44,611
But listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

1125
01:07:44,636 --> 01:07:46,504
Alright, this is the army right here.

1126
01:07:46,504 --> 01:07:49,800
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful.

1127
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,696
Well, for you, I love it.

1128
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,819
For you, Valkyrie.

1129
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:55,258
I mean, it's not
really what I'm into.

1130
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:57,414
But I got my,
my weapon out there.

1131
01:07:57,439 --> 01:07:59,306
Can I borrow that for a sec?

1132
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,822
Ah!
There you are, old friend.

1133
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:07,150
That was quite
an entrance, back there.

1134
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,106
Listen, uh...

1135
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,908
We good?

1136
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:16,976
Yeah?

1137
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:20,532
I mean, I don't feel weird having
my ex weapon around, but come on.

1138
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:22,563
Mjölnir, in the past.

1139
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:24,224
It's you and me now, buddy.

1140
01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:25,048
You know what?

1141
01:08:25,817 --> 01:08:27,290
I think it's time
for your first beer.

1142
01:08:27,314 --> 01:08:28,235
What do you say?

1143
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:34,618
Delicious.

1144
01:08:35,642 --> 01:08:37,822
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1145
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:46,386
Hey.

1146
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,237
Oh, hey.

1147
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,304
It's quite the...
view, huh?

1148
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:54,405
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1149
01:08:54,405 --> 01:08:57,686
As I was saying, I was very, very
impressed with what you did back there.

1150
01:08:58,709 --> 01:09:00,084
You and Mjölnir.

1151
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,980
Yeah.

1152
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:08,749
- In space, there are dolphins.
- What?

1153
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:09,531
This...

1154
01:09:09,556 --> 01:09:11,246
You should see
some space dolphins.

1155
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,832
Beautiful.

1156
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:18,114
- God.
- They're so beautiful, so rare,

1157
01:09:18,139 --> 01:09:19,658
They're very loyal creatures.

1158
01:09:19,682 --> 01:09:21,273
They mate for life...

1159
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:22,807
In packs of 6.

1160
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:24,205
Just... love.

1161
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:30,848
♫ Oh, brother.
Man, you look so hot ♫

1162
01:09:30,873 --> 01:09:34,494
♫ I wanna get in your rocks ♫

1163
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:37,815
♫ When we get together,
we're gonna get it on ♫

1164
01:09:37,815 --> 01:09:41,352
♫ I'm gonna make some babies ♫

1165
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:46,065
That is the song that my dad sang to
my other dad when they were courting.

1166
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:49,201
When two Kronans want to make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain.

1167
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,112
They go down to
a little lava pool.

1168
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:52,730
They hold hands
over the hot lava.

1169
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,298
And then after a month,

1170
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:55,173
They pull their hands apart...

1171
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,141
and they finally created a
beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1172
01:09:58,166 --> 01:10:00,271
Oh, it's fascinating.
And hot.

1173
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:02,183
Did you ever had
a special someone?

1174
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:03,779
Oh, I've had...

1175
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:05,209
many special someones.

1176
01:10:05,209 --> 01:10:07,583
But, I don't know.

1177
01:10:08,627 --> 01:10:09,747
I don't know if I want it again.

1178
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,658
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1179
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:15,439
And now, you're just trying to find
the answers in the bottom of the bottle.

1180
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:18,540
And some meaningless goings-on,
which only serves to numb the pain.

1181
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:21,164
Instead of bringing you
real happiness or satisfaction.

1182
01:10:21,188 --> 01:10:23,609
Yeah, something like that.

1183
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:27,965
They're beautiful.

1184
01:10:27,965 --> 01:10:29,408
Beautiful thing.

1185
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,351
Jane.

1186
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:37,408
- What?
- I want to feel shitty about you.

1187
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:38,332
What?

1188
01:10:40,258 --> 01:10:41,212
For me, I want...

1189
01:10:41,212 --> 01:10:42,622
I...

1190
01:10:42,646 --> 01:10:44,757
I want to feel shitty
about something.

1191
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:46,446
I think that's you.

1192
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:49,261
- Not really getting attached.
- Not as attached.

1193
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,602
Well, uh...

1194
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:53,145
My friend, he told me that
it was better to feel shitty

1195
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:56,582
for losing love than it is
to never experience love,

1196
01:10:56,606 --> 01:10:59,427
and to feel nothing at all, and
feel empty and I think he was right.

1197
01:11:00,097 --> 01:11:02,700
Which is how I've been
feeling for a long time.

1198
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,069
I push people away,
kept them at a distance

1199
01:11:05,069 --> 01:11:06,437
because of the fear of that loss.

1200
01:11:06,437 --> 01:11:08,271
But I don't want to do that anymore.

1201
01:11:08,296 --> 01:11:08,847
No, no, no.

1202
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:10,608
Close off your heart
will seal the pain.

1203
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:11,342
That's what I did.

1204
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:14,103
Yes, I closed off my
heart and I meditated.

1205
01:11:14,127 --> 01:11:16,206
- You meditate?
- No, it's so boring.

1206
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,049
It actually made
me more angry.

1207
01:11:19,049 --> 01:11:21,318
But I'm tired of giving
myself up as the idea of fate

1208
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,796
and try to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

1209
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,822
I want to live in the moment.

1210
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,400
I wanted to live like
there's no tomorrow.

1211
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:27,470
Throw caution to the wind.

1212
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:31,061
I want...
I want to be with you, Jane.

1213
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:32,571
What do you say?

1214
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:34,282
I have cancer.

1215
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:38,296
I'm sorry, what?

1216
01:11:38,321 --> 01:11:39,434
I'm dying.

1217
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:41,013
- Wait, what is happening?
- God!

1218
01:11:41,038 --> 01:11:42,721
- I...
- No, no, no, no.

1219
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:43,514
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

1220
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:44,909
- Wait, Jane.
- What did I say?

1221
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:45,933
I didn't mean that.

1222
01:11:45,957 --> 01:11:46,977
Just kidding.

1223
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:48,340
I...

1224
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:50,209
don't have cancer.

1225
01:11:50,234 --> 01:11:52,366
I want to smash something.

1226
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,651
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1227
01:11:53,651 --> 01:11:57,221
Don't be sorry.

1228
01:11:57,221 --> 01:11:59,231
When did you find out?

1229
01:11:59,255 --> 01:12:00,797
Um...

1230
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:02,593
About six months ago.
I...

1231
01:12:02,593 --> 01:12:03,861
I was just feeling tired.

1232
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,958
And then, they told
me I have stage four.

1233
01:12:06,982 --> 01:12:08,470
Get my fears in order.

1234
01:12:09,266 --> 01:12:11,789
And then, I heard Mjölnir
calling me and so...

1235
01:12:12,303 --> 01:12:13,572
I thought, maybe...

1236
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:15,748
If science didn't help,
then maybe...

1237
01:12:15,773 --> 01:12:17,529
Viking space magic.

1238
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:20,678
And that's why you came to New Asgard.

1239
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:22,705
Yeah, I think the hammer...

1240
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:24,737
Knew what would
be good for me and...

1241
01:12:27,614 --> 01:12:28,550
Maybe not.

1242
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,323
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1243
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:34,925
You don't know
what tomorrow holds.

1244
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:37,526
And Mjölnir,
Mjölnir chose you.

1245
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:40,364
It chose you because
you are worthy.

1246
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:41,941
And that's something.

1247
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,450
When I first met you,
I was unworthy...

1248
01:12:44,474 --> 01:12:46,474
I was unable to
pick up my hammer.

1249
01:12:47,032 --> 01:12:51,337
You told me, there was no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1250
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:54,299
You made me worthy.

1251
01:12:55,526 --> 01:12:58,197
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1252
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,044
Look, what do you wanna do?

1253
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:06,733
I'm gonna get those
children back to their families.

1254
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:09,133
I want to finish that mission.

1255
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:10,679
Spoken like a true Thor.

1256
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:13,819
How do you feel now?

1257
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:16,006
So scared.

1258
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,811
How do you feel?

1259
01:13:18,836 --> 01:13:20,039
Shitty.

1260
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,019
How shitty?

1261
01:13:21,044 --> 01:13:22,179
Really shitty.

1262
01:13:33,717 --> 01:13:36,320
I wonder what those two
are talking about, out there.

1263
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,888
Yeah, they're not talking.

1264
01:13:37,888 --> 01:13:40,291
Oh!

1265
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,146
Do you think those two will ever
hold hands over a hot lava pool

1266
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,933
to make a Thor baby?

1267
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:48,837
Unlikely, sadly.

1268
01:13:48,862 --> 01:13:50,643
Oh, that's too bad.

1269
01:13:50,668 --> 01:13:52,479
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1270
01:13:55,258 --> 01:13:57,118
Hey!
We're here.

1271
01:14:05,694 --> 01:14:07,494
This is where color goes.

1272
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:41,743
They're not here.

1273
01:14:47,391 --> 01:14:48,391
Where are they?

1274
01:15:07,839 --> 01:15:09,339
The hell is this place?

1275
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:40,034
Bifrost is the key.

1276
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:50,338
It's a trap!

1277
01:16:07,671 --> 01:16:10,168
Can you tell me why you just threw
Stormbreaker out the window?

1278
01:16:10,193 --> 01:16:12,399
He needs it to open the gates of Eternity.

1279
01:16:43,834 --> 01:16:45,309
We really have to
stop meeting like this.

1280
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,513
Call the ax.

1281
01:16:46,538 --> 01:16:48,264
I'll call the ax when
you call the dentist.

1282
01:16:48,289 --> 01:16:50,929
Call the ax.

1283
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:53,409
Tell me where the children
are or I'm gonna kill...

1284
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:01,598
Call the ax.

1285
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:11,335
How ungodly you are.

1286
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,946
You know nothing

1287
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:15,234
of being a god.

1288
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:19,643
You went to the gods for help

1289
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:22,159
and they did nothing.

1290
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:24,452
We're alike, in that sense.

1291
01:17:25,216 --> 01:17:27,118
He's nothing like you.

1292
01:17:27,118 --> 01:17:28,618
What was that?

1293
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:33,518
I said, he's nothing like you.

1294
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:36,894
That's right.
I'm not a hypocrite.

1295
01:17:36,894 --> 01:17:39,972
I'm truly creating peace.

1296
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:41,503
You're murdering innocent gods.

1297
01:17:41,528 --> 01:17:42,738
Innocent?

1298
01:17:43,734 --> 01:17:44,954
Are you a Valkyrie?

1299
01:17:44,978 --> 01:17:46,237
Huh?

1300
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:48,637
Haha, how exciting.

1301
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:53,010
Oh, my gosh.
They're onto you too.

1302
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,970
Your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1303
01:17:58,683 --> 01:18:00,878
Did you pray to the gods...

1304
01:18:00,903 --> 01:18:05,389
When the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1305
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,836
Did you beg them for help...

1306
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,972
As your family was massacred?

1307
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:16,319
Good chat.

1308
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,213
This one...

1309
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,949
You're interesting.

1310
01:18:23,974 --> 01:18:25,403
You're different.

1311
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,980
Yes.

1312
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:32,462
Awh...

1313
01:18:35,886 --> 01:18:37,514
You're dying.

1314
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:40,296
I'm sorry.

1315
01:18:41,246 --> 01:18:43,223
We're on the same path.

1316
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:48,769
Just as the sword empowered me.

1317
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:52,425
The hammer empowered you.

1318
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:55,425
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1319
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,383
The gods will use you...

1320
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:02,937
But they will not help you.

1321
01:19:03,314 --> 01:19:05,036
There is no...

1322
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,765
eternal reward...

1323
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,563
for us.

1324
01:19:15,163 --> 01:19:17,262
She'll be gone soon.

1325
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:20,664
And you know who won't help her?

1326
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:22,213
I give you one guess.

1327
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:34,954
I know your pain.

1328
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:37,187
Love is pain.

1329
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:44,689
I had a daughter once.

1330
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:48,850
I put my faith in a higher power,
hoping it will save her.

1331
01:19:49,693 --> 01:19:51,195
And she...

1332
01:19:52,273 --> 01:19:53,873
died.

1333
01:19:58,369 --> 01:20:00,404
Now I understand...

1334
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:03,349
My daughter is the lucky one.

1335
01:20:03,374 --> 01:20:06,809
She does not have to grow up in a world...

1336
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:10,459
Of suffering and pain

1337
01:20:10,484 --> 01:20:15,510
run by wicked gods.

1338
01:20:16,287 --> 01:20:19,722
Choose love.

1339
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:23,926
Call the ax.

1340
01:20:31,973 --> 01:20:36,465
Call the ax.

1341
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:15,179
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1342
01:21:17,153 --> 01:21:18,749
Hmm, I want to kill that guy.

1343
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,420
So do I, but we have
to take him alive.

1344
01:21:21,445 --> 01:21:23,356
He's our only link to
finding those children.

1345
01:22:36,921 --> 01:22:39,268
Oh!
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1346
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:12,997
Val!

1347
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:25,576
We gotta get her out of here.

1348
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:36,720
I got you.

1349
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:49,467
The goats are here.
Come on, let's go.

1350
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:51,635
Stormbreaker, take us home.

1351
01:24:49,379 --> 01:24:52,689
Look, there are other, more aggressive
forms of treatment we can try,

1352
01:24:52,722 --> 01:24:56,734
but something's affecting her
body's ability to fight the cancer.

1353
01:24:56,734 --> 01:24:58,034
I'm sorry, Thor.

1354
01:25:12,616 --> 01:25:14,471
Oh, there you are.

1355
01:25:14,496 --> 01:25:15,506
What's going on out there?

1356
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:18,697
Oh, some moron made a fridge
without a door. Can you believe it?

1357
01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:22,089
Don't you worry, I got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1358
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:22,976
How's Val?

1359
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,596
Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

1360
01:25:25,596 --> 01:25:26,939
Okay, good.

1361
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:28,854
Now, I just gotta get this...

1362
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:30,418
- out of my...
- Woah! No, no, no.

1363
01:25:30,443 --> 01:25:31,214
That's gotta stay in there.

1364
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:34,980
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1365
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,157
Just gonna pop out for a moment.

1366
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:37,783
Pick up the kids.
Uh, kill a bad guy.

1367
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:40,244
And then, I'll come straight back.

1368
01:25:40,244 --> 01:25:42,346
You're going without me?

1369
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:43,617
Uh, yeah.

1370
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:45,542
What happened to like...
doing everything together?

1371
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:47,985
He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

1372
01:25:47,985 --> 01:25:48,752
You need me.

1373
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:50,013
I do need you, Jane.

1374
01:25:50,037 --> 01:25:51,244
I need you alive.

1375
01:25:51,655 --> 01:25:53,090
Would be great to have
you on the battlefield.

1376
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:54,558
Fighting Gorr side by side,

1377
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,493
but that hammer is killing you.

1378
01:25:57,695 --> 01:26:00,865
Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength,

1379
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:03,187
leaving your body unable
to fight the cancer.

1380
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:06,212
What happened to live
like there's no tomorrow?

1381
01:26:06,237 --> 01:26:08,213
It was before I knew
you might not have one.

1382
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:09,564
Why not have
one more adventure?

1383
01:26:09,589 --> 01:26:11,709
Jane, if there's a chance to live.
You have to take it.

1384
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:14,799
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1385
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:22,409
I know, I seem like some cool
astrophysicist from New Mexico.

1386
01:26:22,434 --> 01:26:23,354
Just living the dream.

1387
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:25,356
But, look at me.

1388
01:26:25,356 --> 01:26:27,057
I wanna keep fighting.

1389
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,859
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1390
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:30,127
And you want me not to do that?

1391
01:26:30,127 --> 01:26:32,630
What's the point of
more time than this?

1392
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:35,398
Because I love you.

1393
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,764
I've always loved you.

1394
01:26:40,771 --> 01:26:43,641
And this is a chance, for us.

1395
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:46,897
If you pick up that damn hammer
again, then that chance is gone.

1396
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:00,384
It's your choice, Jane.

1397
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:03,540
But I'd regret it,
every single day.

1398
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:06,888
If I didn't ask you to stay here, so we
can try and figure this out together.

1399
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:12,536
You better come back to me.

1400
01:27:12,536 --> 01:27:15,012
I'm coming back,
as soon as I can.

1401
01:27:17,015 --> 01:27:18,062
Break a leg.

1402
01:27:18,087 --> 01:27:19,624
I'll break all his legs.

1403
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:35,668
Remember that, the gate
to Eternity is at the literal center...

1404
01:27:35,693 --> 01:27:36,383
- of the universe.
- Universe.

1405
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:37,728
- You have to pass the comet.
- Yes.

1406
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,063
Yes, yes. I know.
We've been over this.

1407
01:27:39,063 --> 01:27:40,781
I'm not going to get lost.

1408
01:27:40,806 --> 01:27:43,200
So how are you feeling
with the old stab wound?

1409
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,945
- I think I lost my kidney
- Gone? Completely?

1410
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,860
I wish I could join you, but...

1411
01:27:47,885 --> 01:27:50,046
I'd probably die and that
won't help get the kids back.

1412
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,931
So you'll have
to go it alone.

1413
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:54,687
All you have to do,
is destroy that sword.

1414
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:56,147
It's his source of power.

1415
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,662
You won't survive
long without it.

1416
01:27:59,423 --> 01:28:01,701
Hey, don't die.

1417
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:02,866
Hell, no.

1418
01:28:56,647 --> 01:28:58,347
Eternity.

1419
01:29:00,688 --> 01:29:02,108
Finally.

1420
01:29:44,157 --> 01:29:45,548
Hey, kids.

1421
01:29:47,837 --> 01:29:49,260
I knew you'd come.

1422
01:29:51,312 --> 01:29:52,713
Go, kids.

1423
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:02,309
Everyone okay?

1424
01:30:02,334 --> 01:30:04,275
Alright, gather round.
Gather round.

1425
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:05,537
Good to see you, in person.

1426
01:30:05,562 --> 01:30:07,118
Thank goodness.

1427
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:19,339
Alright, listen up!
Here's the plan.

1428
01:30:19,364 --> 01:30:21,634
We sneak our way towards Stormbreaker,

1429
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:25,663
Being very careful not to bump into,
any of those big shadow monsters.

1430
01:30:27,315 --> 01:30:28,697
They're behind me, aren't they?

1431
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:35,939
Does anyone here
have battle experience?

1432
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,927
Well, no time to
learn like the present.

1433
01:30:38,951 --> 01:30:40,486
But, we're not
strong like you.

1434
01:30:40,511 --> 01:30:41,309
We're just kids.

1435
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,722
Hey, don't forget.
You're Asgardian kids.

1436
01:30:43,747 --> 01:30:44,482
I'm not.

1437
01:30:44,482 --> 01:30:47,760
- I'm just a Lightfusion.
- And I'm a Ligathian kid.

1438
01:30:47,785 --> 01:30:48,919
Okay.
Okay.

1439
01:30:48,919 --> 01:30:51,355
But today,
you're Asgardians.

1440
01:30:51,355 --> 01:30:52,765
Now, collect your weapons.

1441
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:53,800
What?

1442
01:30:53,825 --> 01:30:55,903
Go and find anything
you can pick up.

1443
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:57,251
And bring it back here.

1444
01:30:57,275 --> 01:30:58,633
Hurry, hurry.

1445
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:03,461
They're getting closer,
hurry up.

1446
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:09,498
Today, is a day that
will go down in history.

1447
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:14,047
Today's a day they'll talk
about for generations to come.

1448
01:31:14,072 --> 01:31:17,089
Today, we are Space Vikings!

1449
01:31:17,114 --> 01:31:19,447
Present...
arms!

1450
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:26,050
Whosoever
hold these weapons

1451
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:28,585
and believes in going home
if they be true of heart.

1452
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:31,438
is therefore
worthy and shall possess...

1453
01:31:32,632 --> 01:31:34,650
For a limited time only.

1454
01:31:34,675 --> 01:31:38,441
The power of Thor!

1455
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:48,992
General Axl...

1456
01:31:50,815 --> 01:31:53,186
Lead your army
to that ax.

1457
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:55,152
We shall do our work...

1458
01:31:56,056 --> 01:31:57,506
For Asgard.

1459
01:34:12,562 --> 01:34:13,562
Jane.

1460
01:34:31,142 --> 01:34:32,638
Destroy that sword
and he's dead.

1461
01:34:32,663 --> 01:34:35,488
The gate is almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

1462
01:34:35,513 --> 01:34:37,397
It's okay.
I got him.

1463
01:34:44,985 --> 01:34:47,016
Stormbreaker, stop this!

1464
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:48,822
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing.

1465
01:34:48,847 --> 01:34:50,254
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1466
01:34:51,206 --> 01:34:52,206
Come on!

1467
01:34:58,849 --> 01:35:02,439
Let go of my friend!

1468
01:35:06,374 --> 01:35:08,087
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1469
01:35:15,352 --> 01:35:16,520
First off,

1470
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:19,029
the name is Mighty Thor.

1471
01:35:20,946 --> 01:35:22,368
Secondly...

1472
01:35:22,393 --> 01:35:25,263
If you can't say Mighty Thor,

1473
01:35:25,288 --> 01:35:29,358
I'll accept Dr. Jane Foster!

1474
01:35:33,137 --> 01:35:34,617
Thirdly,

1475
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:37,668
eat my hammer!

1476
01:35:46,222 --> 01:35:48,339
Stormbreaker!

1477
01:35:52,656 --> 01:35:54,241
I knew you could do it.

1478
01:35:55,093 --> 01:35:57,374
Axl!
Get them home.

1479
01:37:45,848 --> 01:37:46,889
Jane?

1480
01:37:47,373 --> 01:37:48,184
I'm okay.

1481
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:50,578
You gotta stop him.

1482
01:38:20,385 --> 01:38:21,667
Gorr, stop!

1483
01:38:26,377 --> 01:38:30,537
What kind of father
would I be, if I stopped.

1484
01:38:34,952 --> 01:38:37,311
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1485
01:38:39,657 --> 01:38:42,852
It's not death
or revenge that you seek.

1486
01:38:45,596 --> 01:38:47,596
What do I seek?

1487
01:39:01,378 --> 01:39:02,635
You seek love.

1488
01:39:05,828 --> 01:39:06,828
Love?

1489
01:39:08,185 --> 01:39:10,888
Why should I seek love?

1490
01:39:10,913 --> 01:39:13,139
Because that's all
any of us want.

1491
01:39:15,233 --> 01:39:21,799
How dare, you turn
your back on me.

1492
01:39:21,799 --> 01:39:23,709
You won, Gorr.

1493
01:39:23,734 --> 01:39:27,138
Why would I spend my last moments
with you, when I can be with her?

1494
01:39:28,572 --> 01:39:30,143
I choose love.

1495
01:39:30,168 --> 01:39:32,371
You can, too.
You can bring her back.

1496
01:39:37,047 --> 01:39:38,492
Make your wish.

1497
01:40:09,847 --> 01:40:11,148
I'm dying.

1498
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:14,218
She would have no one.

1499
01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:17,218
She would be alone.

1500
01:40:24,595 --> 01:40:26,295
She won't be alone.

1501
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:38,099
My love.

1502
01:41:48,263 --> 01:41:50,663
I've missed you,
so much.

1503
01:41:53,047 --> 01:41:55,047
I've missed you, too.

1504
01:41:58,215 --> 01:42:00,796
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1505
01:42:02,754 --> 01:42:05,449
As soon as I picked up that hammer...

1506
01:42:07,134 --> 01:42:10,994
It's like...
I've gotten an extra life.

1507
01:42:12,269 --> 01:42:15,567
It's just...

1508
01:42:15,592 --> 01:42:16,941
Magical.

1509
01:42:19,977 --> 01:42:22,109
Not too bad for a human.

1510
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:25,703
Not too bad for a god.

1511
01:42:27,624 --> 01:42:30,487
I think I figured
out my catchphrase.

1512
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:32,656
- Really? What is it?
- Come closer.

1513
01:42:38,043 --> 01:42:39,645
Perfect.

1514
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,412
- It's the best one yet.
- Thank you.

1515
01:42:50,101 --> 01:42:52,390
Keep your heart open.

1516
01:42:57,724 --> 01:42:59,450
I love you.

1517
01:43:00,677 --> 01:43:02,677
I love you too.

1518
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:49,549
Protect her.

1519
01:43:50,622 --> 01:43:52,022
Protect my love.

1520
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:28,989
Let me tell you the
legend of the Space Viking.

1521
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,616
a.k.a

1522
01:44:30,641 --> 01:44:32,403
"The Mighty Thor".

1523
01:44:32,427 --> 01:44:33,785
a.k.a

1524
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:36,052
"Dr. Jane Foster".

1525
01:44:38,043 --> 01:44:43,833
Her sacrifice saved the universe and
taught us all what it means to be worthy.

1526
01:44:44,735 --> 01:44:46,934
She helped the
children of the gods.

1527
01:44:46,959 --> 01:44:49,198
Who laser beamed
their way back home,

1528
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:53,632
to their dozy, little fishing
village turned tourist destination.

1529
01:44:53,657 --> 01:44:55,751
Mommy!

1530
01:44:55,776 --> 01:44:57,420
Look at you!

1531
01:44:57,445 --> 01:44:58,737
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1532
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:00,054
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1533
01:45:00,292 --> 01:45:02,718
The kids were safe
to be kids again.

1534
01:45:04,628 --> 01:45:05,554
Widen your stance.

1535
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:09,501
Especially after their king, made
them all go to self-defense classes.

1536
01:45:09,526 --> 01:45:12,582
- Look at all those budding Space Vikings.
- And the most important part,

1537
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,616
The war cry!

1538
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:17,223
Even Heimdall's son,

1539
01:45:17,248 --> 01:45:18,669
Axl Heimdallson,

1540
01:45:18,694 --> 01:45:21,252
who could now do his
dad's freaky eye magic,

1541
01:45:21,277 --> 01:45:23,421
was becoming
quite the warrior.

1542
01:45:23,446 --> 01:45:25,811
The future of Asgard was secure.

1543
01:45:27,503 --> 01:45:28,753
Speaking of futures,

1544
01:45:28,778 --> 01:45:30,454
I was forging one of my own.

1545
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:32,602
Now, that my body
has grown back.

1546
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:35,150
With a dude I met called Dwayne.

1547
01:45:37,145 --> 01:45:38,567
What about Thor, you ask?

1548
01:45:39,343 --> 01:45:41,545
He embarked on a new journey.

1549
01:45:41,545 --> 01:45:44,048
Because he had found something to live for.

1550
01:45:44,048 --> 01:45:46,036
Something to love for.

1551
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:49,195
A little someone who
turned him from sad god

1552
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,630
into dad god.

1553
01:45:50,654 --> 01:45:52,456
Breakfast is served, bon appetit.

1554
01:45:53,438 --> 01:45:54,434
Hello!

1555
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:55,520
There you go!

1556
01:45:55,544 --> 01:45:57,828
Hey!
Breakfast!

1557
01:45:57,828 --> 01:45:58,929
Excuse me.

1558
01:45:59,663 --> 01:46:00,731
What is that?

1559
01:46:00,731 --> 01:46:02,553
They're...
They're panflaps from Earth.

1560
01:46:02,578 --> 01:46:04,543
I don't think
I like panflaps.

1561
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:05,701
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1562
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:07,724
- Yes, you do.
- Never had that in my life.

1563
01:46:07,749 --> 01:46:09,774
Come on, eat up.
We have to go. We're gonna be late.

1564
01:46:09,774 --> 01:46:12,530
- Now, where are your boots?
- I'm wearing them.

1565
01:46:12,897 --> 01:46:14,378
You're not wearing those.

1566
01:46:14,378 --> 01:46:16,082
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1567
01:46:16,107 --> 01:46:18,514
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1568
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,421
Go to hell, demon!

1569
01:46:22,928 --> 01:46:24,296
It's brand new.
Now, destroyed.

1570
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:26,023
Thank you very much.

1571
01:46:26,023 --> 01:46:27,958
You know what,
you wear what you want.

1572
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,583
Don't come complaining to
me when your feet get sore.

1573
01:46:29,608 --> 01:46:31,706
Alright, you get no
sympathy here from me.

1574
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:34,398
Ugh, fine.
I'll wear the boots.

1575
01:46:34,398 --> 01:46:35,065
Thank you.

1576
01:46:35,065 --> 01:46:37,264
I remember what
my mother used to tell me.

1577
01:46:37,288 --> 01:46:38,344
Listen to the grown ups.

1578
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:40,545
And if you see anyone
scared or being picked on,

1579
01:46:40,569 --> 01:46:41,981
- Look after them. Okay?
- Okay.

1580
01:46:42,006 --> 01:46:43,596
Most of all, have fun.

1581
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:45,248
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1582
01:46:45,272 --> 01:46:47,341
Now, where is Mjölnir?
Where did I put it?

1583
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:48,807
Over there,
sleeping in the bed.

1584
01:46:48,832 --> 01:46:50,894
It's in the bed.

1585
01:46:51,828 --> 01:46:52,628
Oh, wow!

1586
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:57,588
That is not coming off.

1587
01:46:57,588 --> 01:46:58,906
What did you do?

1588
01:46:58,931 --> 01:47:01,110
Eh, she looked boring before.

1589
01:47:02,095 --> 01:47:03,035
Ah!

1590
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:03,868
Supposed it did.

1591
01:47:03,892 --> 01:47:04,763
I love it.

1592
01:47:05,185 --> 01:47:06,333
Very creative.

1593
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:12,139
Okay...

1594
01:47:12,163 --> 01:47:14,970
Now, see the aliens down there?
The stripy ones?

1595
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:15,781
They look nice.

1596
01:47:15,806 --> 01:47:16,674
Yeah, they are nice.

1597
01:47:16,674 --> 01:47:17,771
That's why we have
to look after them.

1598
01:47:17,796 --> 01:47:18,713
Got it.

1599
01:47:18,737 --> 01:47:20,193
Protect the nice ones.

1600
01:47:21,104 --> 01:47:21,939
I love you, sweetie.

1601
01:47:21,972 --> 01:47:23,192
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1602
01:47:26,217 --> 01:47:27,942
They will always
be there for us.

1603
01:47:27,967 --> 01:47:31,185
The Space Viking
and his girl born from Eternity,

1604
01:47:31,536 --> 01:47:33,122
with the powers of a god.

1605
01:47:35,942 --> 01:47:37,083
Two warrios...

1606
01:47:37,747 --> 01:47:40,911
Fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

1607
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:50,004
The have travelled far
and have been given many names.

1608
01:47:50,716 --> 01:47:52,879
But to those who know them best,

1609
01:47:53,372 --> 01:47:54,950
They're simply known

1610
01:47:54,975 --> 01:47:57,177
as Love and Thunder.

1611
01:49:45,035 --> 01:49:49,597
It used to be that being a god,
meant something.

1612
01:49:50,868 --> 01:49:53,504
People will whisper your name...

1613
01:49:53,529 --> 01:49:56,799
Before sharing their
deepest hopes and dreams.

1614
01:49:58,539 --> 01:50:01,408
They begged you for mercy...

1615
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:06,576
Without ever knowing,
if you're actually listening.

1616
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,936
Now...

1617
01:50:08,349 --> 01:50:10,985
You know, they look to the sky.

1618
01:50:10,985 --> 01:50:13,892
They don't ask us for lightning.

1619
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:16,991
They don't ask us for rain.

1620
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:21,288
They just want to see one
of their so-called superheroes.

1621
01:50:24,532 --> 01:50:26,797
When did we become the joke?

1622
01:50:29,868 --> 01:50:31,821
No.

1623
01:50:32,173 --> 01:50:34,134
No.

1624
01:50:35,177 --> 01:50:38,137
They will fear us again...

1625
01:50:38,162 --> 01:50:41,396
When Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1626
01:50:44,485 --> 01:50:47,939
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1627
01:50:47,964 --> 01:50:50,380
Do you understand, my son?

1628
01:50:50,404 --> 01:50:52,275
Yes, father.

1629
01:57:40,985 --> 01:57:42,298
Oh, hey!

1630
01:57:43,915 --> 01:57:45,603
Jane Foster.

1631
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:47,493
Heimdall?

1632
01:57:48,591 --> 01:57:49,919
I see you're dead now.

1633
01:57:50,044 --> 01:57:51,638
Uhh... yeah.

1634
01:57:52,403 --> 01:57:53,981
Thank you for looking after my son.

1635
01:57:55,153 --> 01:57:57,841
You are very welcome here
to the land of the gods.

1636
01:58:02,616 --> 01:58:04,093
Welcome to Valhalla.
