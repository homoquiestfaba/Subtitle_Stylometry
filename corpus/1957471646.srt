1
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,583
- Are you sure you don't wanna
come to Vienna for the holidays?

2
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,108
- You know it's going to be
my first Christmas with Roy.

3
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,979
- Yeah, so bring him here.

4
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,764
Vienna is beautiful and
romantic during Christmastime.

5
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,114
Besides, everybody's
getting all set up

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,551
for the holiday ball season.

7
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,640
Maybe you guys could go to one.

8
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:34,817
- You should go to one.
You're always the better dancer.

9
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:35,948
- Yeah, it's only 'cause
you stopped practicing

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,428
ballet in high school.

11
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,822
- Well, I still go
to cardio barre classes.

12
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,216
- Yeah, that is not
the same thing.

13
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:43,956
- How's the search for
your dad's family coming?

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,655
- No family yet.

15
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,135
- I still can't believe
my big brother's gonna be

16
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:49,266
alone on Christmas.

17
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:50,920
- Don't worry about me.

18
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,139
I just want to make
sure that you and Roy

19
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,836
have a romantic first Christmas.

20
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,925
- Ooh, I gotta go!

21
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,796
He's taking me to
this really fancy restaurant.

22
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,408
And he says he wants
to talk about our future,

23
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,149
something important.

24
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,976
- Hm, like a proposal?

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,631
- I don't know. I hope.

26
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,503
You'll be the first one I call.

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,214
Hey.
- Hey, babe.

28
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,868
- So sorry I'm late.

29
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,263
Thank you.

30
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,396
I got caught up
talking to Daniel.

31
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,529
Brought you some
homemade Christmas cookies.

32
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:35,704
- Thanks.

33
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,314
You look gorgeous, by the way.

34
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,273
- Thanks.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,321
So, I'm really excited to know
what you wanted to talk about.

36
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,410
- Remember when you said
you wanted to give me

37
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:49,239
the best gift you could?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,633
- Nothing, really nothing,
would make me happier for you

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,722
to make my Christmas
fantasy come true.

40
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,159
- Yes.

41
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,770
- So I want you to meet
someone special.

42
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,424
- Am I finally
gonna meet your mom?

43
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,080
- No, not really. Hey...

44
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,909
- Hi. You must be Amy.
So nice to meet you.

45
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,911
- Who...who is that?
Who is she?

46
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:12,088
- Uh, this is Elaine.
Elaine? Amy?

47
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,438
Have a seat.

48
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,485
- Who is she?

49
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,748
- I'm his girlfriend.

50
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,142
- Yes.
- I'm his girlfriend.

51
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,665
- Yes.

52
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,754
- You said she
was okay with this.

53
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,364
- She is okay with this, right?

54
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,758
- Okay, but what am I...

55
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:37,896
Why would I be okay with this?

56
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:39,376
- Amy, what are you doing?

57
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,076
Okay.
I'll only be a second.

58
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,339
Amy!

59
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:57,873
- I can't believe I thought
I was gonna marry him!

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,092
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Ames.

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,921
I know how much you liked him.

62
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,532
I see you got
my Christmas present.

63
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,623
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,495
Thanks.
It's pretty.

65
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:13,932
- And handmade.

66
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,500
- Tell me more about Vienna.
I need a distraction.

67
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,372
- Okay.

68
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,200
It's magical.

69
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,636
There's Christmas lights
on all the shops.

70
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,072
Everything smells
like gingerbread.

71
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,595
And everybody's
getting extra hyped

72
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,380
for all the extravagant
Balls happening.

73
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:31,341
- Oh, yeah, with
the big gowns and the dancing.

74
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,778
I can't believe that
they still do those.

75
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,737
- And everyone is extra
hyped right now

76
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,739
because the biggest Ball of
the season, the Christmas Ball,

77
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,654
is like it's right
around the corner.

78
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,569
- Sounds amazing.

79
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,922
- Hey, you should
come to Vienna.

80
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,664
- Oh, no, I can't.

81
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,405
- Why not?
Look, we're family.

82
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,971
We shouldn't both
be alone on Christmas.

83
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,756
- I can't. It's crazy.
I...

84
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,584
- Okay, look.
Let's make a deal.

85
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,760
Come out to Vienna and
stay with me through Christmas.

86
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,762
Try some new food!
See some new sights!

87
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,372
Maybe even go to a Ball.

88
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,765
I think getting outside
of your comfort zone

89
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,157
is exactly what
you need right now.

90
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,116
- I don't know.

91
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:10,946
- Vienna, it's so full of all
this magical old world charm.

92
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,035
- Does sound nice.

93
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,645
- Plus, it's
5,000 miles from Roy.

94
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,473
- Yeah.

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,170
- Yeah, as in
you're coming

96
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,868
'cause I'm not taking
"nein" for an answer!

97
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,696
- I'm coming to Vienna.
- You're coming to Vienna?

98
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,350
- I'm coming to Vienna!
- Wow!

99
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,221
I did not think that
was gonna work!

100
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,571
- I'm coming to Vienna.
I'm gonna come see you.

101
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,138
- Hey, and who knows?

102
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,358
You might even meet
a prince and get married.

103
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,402
- That's not funny.

104
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,876
- Hey.
- Hey!

105
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,748
Nice to see you too!

106
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,098
- Sorry. Didn't get
any sleep on the plane.

107
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,186
- Hi.

108
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,190
- How's it all going,
by the way?

109
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,887
- It's good.

110
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,324
Taking me forever to track
down my dad's family,

111
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,064
but I think I found my uncle.

112
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,284
- Daniel, that's great!
- Yeah.

113
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,199
I'm just... I'm hoping
he can tell me

114
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,896
a little bit more about
my biological father.

115
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,465
He died when I was so young

116
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,075
that I'm trying to
get a better sense of

117
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,642
where I come from, you know.

118
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,471
- You will.
I know it.

119
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,517
And when you do,
maybe Mom, Dad and I

120
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,040
will finally know
why you're so weird.

121
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,085
- Hm. And then you'll also
maybe know why

122
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,087
I don't invite you to the palace
when I discover I'm royalty.

123
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,959
- Oh, you're so funny.

124
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,790
- Let's go drop your bags
and go see the town.

125
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,705
- Sound of Vienna concerts.

126
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,104
- Welcome to Vienna's best café.

127
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,584
- Thank you.

128
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,107
- I'm so sorry.
I've got to take this.

129
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,240
It could be about my uncle.
- Okay.

130
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,763
- Hello? This is Daniel.

131
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,289
- May I be of some assistance?

132
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,033
- Um...you know, we'll just have
a couple of large cappuccinos.

133
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,950
- Two Café Mélange.
Right away.

134
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,781
- Great.

135
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:33,567
So that was my researcher.

136
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,221
Ames, I'm a nephew.

137
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,964
I've got an uncle.
He's here.

138
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,053
His name is Markus.
They could call me at any time.

139
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,621
- Oh my God.
- I can meet him...I...

140
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,188
- That's amazing!

141
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,148
- You sure?

142
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,759
- Hey, the coffee was amazing,

143
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,762
but you know I don't
eat anything with eggs.

144
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,111
- So much for trying new things.

145
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,547
- I am working
my way up to that.

146
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,854
- Sure.

147
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,859
- Hey, who's that?

148
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,167
Think they're hosting a Ball?

149
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,342
- Probably.

150
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,735
Sorry.

151
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,258
Hello?

152
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,609
Okay, sure. Right now?

153
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,175
I'll see you soon. Great.

154
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,568
That was my researcher.

155
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,004
My Uncle Markus,
he wants to meet me.

156
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,658
- Right now?
- Yeah.

157
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,225
- That's incredible!

158
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,967
- I'm sorry I can't
sightsee with you.

159
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,142
Are you gonna be
okay on your own?

160
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,187
- Sure, yeah.

161
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,451
I've been here about a day
and practically an expert now.

162
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,017
- Okay. You know, go check
out the Danube Tower.

163
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,889
It's great.
It's beautiful.

164
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,194
The view is incredible,
especially this time of year.

165
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,544
- Okay, I will.

166
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,588
- Okay. You're not
gonna regret it.

167
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,807
- Okay.
- Thank you!

168
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:40,982
I love you!
- Love you!

169
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,331
- Bye!

170
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,336
- Okay.

171
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,727
- Ich bien...

172
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,514
...lost.

173
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,758
- I'm afraid you screwed
that one up, Lukas.

174
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,891
- Tommy, I'll take
the class by myself.

175
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,893
- Waltzing alone?

176
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,025
And I think you can clap
with one hand too, right?

177
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,594
You know, this is for
the Midnight competition.

178
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,552
And I'm afraid there's no sense
in continuing this class

179
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,944
without a partner.

180
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,729
- How am I going
to find a dancing partner

181
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,295
on such short notice?

182
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:20,472
- You have this little playbook.
Find someone.

183
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,476
- My apologies.

184
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,653
I'm just gonna ask one
of these gentlemen over here,

185
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,958
if you don't mind.

186
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,877
Hi.

187
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,705
Hopefully, you can
understand me.

188
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,535
I was just
curious if you guys

189
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,582
are practicing for a Ball and
if there are any tickets left.

190
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,758
I keep hearing
amazing things about it

191
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,498
and I'd really like
to go to one.

192
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:52,113
You can't understand
anything I'm saying.

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,246
- No...yes... I can.

194
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,815
We are practicing for the Ball,
the Christmas Eve Ball.

195
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,122
- That's the fancy one
that sells out tickets

196
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,950
a year and a half in advance?

197
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,343
- Yeah. Actually, it's more
like two years in advance,

198
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,564
but, yes, that one.

199
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,653
- Can you help me get tickets?

200
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,441
- No, not directly, but I do
have a proposition for you.

201
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,530
- I don't know what you've
heard about American girls...

202
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,272
- Do you have any
ballroom dance experience?

203
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,752
- No.

204
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,669
I mean, I did ballet
in high school.

205
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,845
We almost went
to Nationals junior year.

206
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:32,806
- I'm Lukas Hofbauer.

207
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,677
- Amy.

208
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:38,855
Listen, I know this is going
to sound completely strange,

209
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:42,293
but I'm looking
for a dancing partner.

210
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,601
And I must attend this class
to qualify for the competition

211
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,474
of the Midnight Show
for the Christmas Eve Ball.

212
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,389
It showcases the best dancers
in Vienna.

213
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:52,695
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,611
And you want me?

215
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:58,092
- Yes.

216
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,877
Yes, but once
you commit, that's it.

217
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,792
I mean, you would have to
be my dance partner

218
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,273
and commit your time
and energy to waltz.

219
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,232
If we get through
the competition,

220
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,279
we'll be able to attend
the Christmas Eve Ball.

221
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,020
And if you take the class,

222
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,153
I'll be your personal
tour guide in Vienna

223
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,807
to whatever you want to see

224
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,635
for the rest of
this beautiful holiday season?

225
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,553
- Well, I did...
- I know...

226
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,424
- Promise myself
I would try new things

227
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:30,037
and I do really want
to see the Ball.

228
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,782
Okay, yeah, I'll be
your dance partner!

229
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,914
- All right!
Wunderbar!

230
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,222
- Yeah. Wunderbar!

231
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,093
- Welcome to Christmas
in Vienna.

232
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:57,499
- Everybody? We have a
new dancer with us today.

233
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,937
Please welcome...
what was your name?

234
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:04,419
- Amy, Amy Michaels.

235
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,944
Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,252
- This was kind of a
spontaneous decision.

237
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,471
I flew in from Chicago

238
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:19,086
after catching my boyfriend
with another woman.

239
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,784
But...but I'm moving on
and I'm trying new things.

240
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:26,049
So I think it's working
'cause two days ago

241
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,268
I really didn't expect to
be dancing

242
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,096
ballroom in Vienna, right?

243
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:33,361
So, cest la vie...

244
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:37,365
Oh, that's French, not German,

245
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,541
but I ramble when I'm nervous.

246
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,673
- Okay, everyone,
come on, get up.

247
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,023
Break is over.

248
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:48,071
- Two bodies...
- One mind...

249
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,507
- Four feet.

250
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,596
- They don't mess around,
do they?

251
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,685
- No, they take the waltz
very seriously here.

252
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,600
Here we go.

253
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,080
Don't look at me.

254
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:02,172
- I... I feel like
I'm in over my head,

255
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,434
like you should find
somebody who actually

256
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,696
knows what they're doing.

257
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,915
- No, no, no.
A deal is a deal.

258
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,875
You can do this, okay?

259
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:12,313
- Guys, always maintain contact!

260
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,228
- Oh.
- All right?

261
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:18,580
And, remember, the judges will
be looking for the perfect form.

262
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,887
We try this with music.

263
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,411
Start with the basic
right turn

264
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,326
just to get a little bit
of a warmup, okay?

265
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,589
On my count.

266
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,898
- Go.

267
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,816
- Oh!

268
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,774
- I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

269
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,993
- I'm fine.

270
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,082
- Everyone back to one!

271
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:44,824
Once again.

272
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,043
You live in Chicago, hm?

273
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,958
Take your head to the left.

274
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,919
Good.
Shoulders down and elbows up.

275
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,616
Nice.

276
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,400
Now keep your posture.

277
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,316
- Posture was never
really my forte as a ballerina.

278
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:05,975
- Go.

279
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,546
- Don't look at me.

280
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,764
- I wasn't.

281
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,766
God, get over yourself.

282
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,683
- No. It's just that if you
look at me, you'll get dizzy.

283
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,251
- Oh!

284
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,210
- I am so sorry.

285
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,865
- You really got to watch
your feet a little bit more.

286
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:26,822
I mean, take
this seriously, okay?

287
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,171
It's not that hard.

288
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,652
One, two, three,
two, two, three.

289
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,523
- Okay, I wanted to
try new things.

290
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,266
But I didn't come to Vienna
to be ordered around, okay?

291
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,877
I'm gonna find
my own way to the Ball.

292
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,620
You , uh...
Good luck in your competition.

293
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,405
- Well, nice meeting you!

294
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:45,928
And thanks for
confirming everything

295
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,495
I already knew about
stubborn Americans!

296
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,192
- Well, thank you for
confirming everything

297
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,151
I already knew about
snobby Europeans!

298
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,458
- What?

299
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,293
- Wait, the Lukas Hofbauer?

300
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,034
You've been here
less than 24 hours.

301
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,646
You already head-butt
the Prince Harry of Vienna.

302
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,039
Gonna see him again?

303
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,823
- He was kind of a jerk.

304
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,216
- Uh...

305
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,305
- I'm so done with jerks.
- Right.

306
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:18,439
That's fair, but
counter-argument.

307
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,397
I hear he's a heck of a dancer

308
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:23,444
and he might be your best way of
getting into the Christmas Ball.

309
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:26,969
Come on!

310
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,971
You said that you'd get
outside your comfort zone.

311
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,714
- Okay. Yeah, maybe I'll try
to find him and apologize.

312
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,542
Or something.
- Oh, wow!

313
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,065
That's gonna be painful.

314
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,545
- Get outside my comfort zone.

315
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,547
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

316
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,747
- Hi. I'm looking
for Lukas Hofbauer?

317
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:11,187
I took a dance
class with him today.

318
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,755
I wasn't very good.

319
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:20,153
I bought him a
Gugelhupf to apologize.

320
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,549
- Who is it?

321
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,859
- Lukas, it's Amy.

322
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,514
I brought you a Bundt cake!

323
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,646
- I got it from here.
Thank you.

324
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:41,826
- Amy?
How did you even find me?

325
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,960
- Have you ever Googled
Lukas Hofbauer's address?

326
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,222
- No.

327
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,964
- Good. Don't.

328
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,446
- Well, guess you know
who I am now.

329
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,797
- Yeah. Kind of.

330
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:59,235
I actually just
came to apologize.

331
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,586
Dancing seems really
important to you and I...

332
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,632
- That's so sweet of you.

333
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,461
I feel like I need
to apologize to you as well.

334
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,941
Thanks for the cake.
That's very kind.

335
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,118
Why don't you come inside?
It's freezing out here..

336
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,119
- Sure.
- Okay.

337
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:14,294
- Thank you.

338
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,909
I also tried to find
you some edelweiss.

339
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,563
I know how you
Austrians love it.

340
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,217
They have a whole song about it.

341
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,001
Unfortunately,
it's out of season.

342
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,786
- It's also written
by Americans, I think.

343
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:29,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

344
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,746
- Huh.

345
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,791
Well, speaking of,

346
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,186
where's the rest of
the Von Trapp family

347
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:41,886
and the Christmas decorations?

348
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,845
- Yeah, well, I haven't
been able to bring myself

349
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,499
to decorate in
the last couple of years.

350
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,502
- Really?
It's the best part.

351
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,634
I mean, your
place is so beautiful,

352
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,593
it makes up for it.

353
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,856
It looks like it has
so much history.

354
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,642
This chandelier is beautiful.

355
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:02,211
- My great-great-grandfather
actually made that one.

356
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,213
- He made it?

357
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,695
I'm so sorry!

358
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,786
I'm such a klutz!

359
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,092
- It's okay.

360
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,531
- I get you a gift
and I ruin it.

361
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,971
- You know, I just
realized I haven't lived up

362
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,756
to my end of the bargain.

363
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,324
I would love
to take you to town.

364
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,543
If that's okay with you?

365
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,154
- Yeah, of course,
- Okay.

366
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,423
- Wow, you Viennese really do
take Christmas seriously.

367
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,295
It's my kind of town.

368
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:45,646
- For me, Vienna is the most
beautiful city in the world.

369
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,822
And this is when it comes alive.

370
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,477
You know everybody's preparing
for the Holiday Ball season.

371
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,523
It's like a
Viennese requirement.

372
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:58,093
- You really do love it
here, don't you?

373
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,269
- I've traveled the world,
but for some reason

374
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:03,316
I always come back home.

375
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:07,189
35 years ago my parents
won the midnight show

376
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,757
and were crowned King and Queen
at the Christmas eve ball.

377
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:13,674
Shortly after, they got married
and they had me.

378
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,937
- So dancing really is
in your blood.

379
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,808
- Yeah.

380
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,463
- Of course, they always wanted
to see me win as well.

381
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,814
But they're gone now.

382
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,687
- Oh Lucas, I'm sorry.

383
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:29,907
- No, it's okay.
It's been a few years.

384
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,953
But now I feel like I have
to win it for them.

385
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:38,481
Listen, I just
want you to know

386
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:42,050
I was going to
compete with my ex.

387
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:48,404
We were pretty much
going to win this thing

388
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,190
until she decided
to find a new partner.

389
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,149
- That's why you need me.

390
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,978
- Exactly.

391
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,111
She said she didn't think
that she could win

392
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,896
with me as a partner.

393
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:05,160
So she found a new one,
in and out of the ballroom.

394
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,902
Some French guy, Philippe.

395
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,383
- That's awful.

396
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,994
I can relate.

397
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,344
My ex cheated on me too.

398
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,392
- You know what they say.

399
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,350
Misery loves company.

400
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,225
- I've had worse company.

401
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,059
- It's beautiful, huh?

402
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,592
Uh-huh.

403
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,475
Very nice.

404
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,521
- I haven't done that
in so many years.

405
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:04,567
- It's because Vienna
suits you, that's why.

406
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,395
- You think?
- Yeah.

407
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,571
You know, now all we
need to do is get you

408
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,444
to waltz the way you ballet.

409
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,707
- Yeah, you see, it's a
little bit different, though,

410
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,056
Because when I was a ballerina,

411
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,840
I was actually
more of a soloist.

412
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:20,148
So all I really had to do was
trust myself and my body.

413
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,804
But the waltz,
I gotta trust you.

414
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,893
- Oh, no.

415
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,808
See?

416
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,463
You can trust me.

417
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,856
- I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

418
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,598
I know a really
great place around here.

419
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,600
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

420
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:41,300
- You do.
Okay, well then, try to find it.

421
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:46,479
- Yes, um, I think
it's this way.

422
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,573
It's awful people can't
just leave you alone.

423
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,879
- It's a little odd
having all of Austria

424
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:59,056
cares about who you're dating.

425
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,884
- Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

426
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,060
I didn't know who you were
until 12 hours ago.

427
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,932
- Don't feel bad.

428
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,629
If it makes you feel any better,

429
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,502
I didn't know who you were
12 hours ago either.

430
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,462
- Two cups of the
best Heyse Schokolade.

431
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,898
- Danka Schoen.

432
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,728
- Thank you.

433
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,730
- You know,
other Viennese may argue,

434
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,472
but personally I think
there is nothing better

435
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,257
during the holidays
than a hot chocolate.

436
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,739
- The secret is the egg yolk.

437
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,741
That's what gives
the rich texture.

438
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,917
- I don't usually do eggs...

439
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,487
but here's to
trying new things.

440
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,142
- All right.
To new things.

441
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,976
- Mm.

442
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,457
- Mmm. Mmm.

443
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,502
I think I'm okay with eggs now.

444
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,243
This might be the best thing
I've ever tasted.

445
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,072
- Thank you.

446
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,639
I'll leave you to enjoy.

447
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:09,823
- I need to thank
you for tonight.

448
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,520
Nobody's really
ever done anything

449
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:12,913
that nice for me before.

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,523
- That's sweet.

451
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,047
I do enjoy making
you smile, Amy.

452
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,401
- You do?
- Very much so.

453
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,579
- Sorry to interrupt,

454
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,755
but that young lady wanted
me to hand you this.

455
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:37,894
- Well, uh...

456
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,330
This is awkward.

457
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,333
- You know, I don't know
what I'm doing.

458
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,510
I really...
I can't get strung along again.

459
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,816
- Amy...
- I don't know.

460
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,297
It seems like you have
a lot of girls around.

461
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:52,953
This hang out...whatever
it is is over, okay?

462
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,345
- Amy, please, just...

463
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,695
- And I can pay
my own bill, okay?

464
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,740
- Just wait, please?
- I got to go.

465
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,568
- Hey, Amy!

466
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,231
- Finished, sir?

467
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,624
- Thank you, Dominik.

468
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,887
- You got in late last night.

469
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:16,629
- Yes. Amy and I
went to Café Sluka

470
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,195
after we went
to the Christmas market.

471
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,720
- You really seem to like her.

472
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,027
- Yes, I do,

473
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,203
but I think I mucked it up.

474
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,858
- Does she have any
potential as a dance partner?

475
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:36,692
- She does have talent and that
American stubborn determination.

476
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:40,217
- Americans can be
quite annoying,

477
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,568
but very determined, too.

478
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,048
Maybe that's what you need.

479
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,963
You may not win this year,

480
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,792
but the connection you two share
could help you win for years.

481
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:52,491
You need to tell her that.

482
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:55,102
- Hm. And here I was thinking
you didn't even like her.

483
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:58,148
- It's nice to see
you smiling again.

484
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,847
With Lydia, you would
just go from

485
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:03,893
sulking about the mansion
to dancing to sulking again.

486
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,722
I don't want
that old Lukas back. Do you?

487
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,858
- She did leave
her wallet last night,

488
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:15,514
so I will have
to see her eventually.

489
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,865
- Maybe that was on purpose
so she could see you again.

490
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,736
- Maybe we should
try to find her.

491
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,880
- Hey, I think we
should go to Christmas mart

492
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,534
and get some Gluühwein.

493
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:38,754
- What's glue-wine?
- Gluühwein.

494
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,278
It's hot spiced wine.

495
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,498
- Yes. That's what I want.

496
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,022
- Oh, you're thinking about
Lukas, aren't you?

497
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,328
- No.

498
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:51,462
Yes!

499
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,508
- Come on, I thought you said
that you walked out on him.

500
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,641
- Well, I did.
I don't know what I'm doing.

501
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,643
The whole thing was a bad idea!

502
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,253
- Bad idea?

503
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,950
I mean, aren't you ever
gonna see him again?

504
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,952
- I really want
to see him again,

505
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,301
but he deserves to
have a partner

506
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:05,955
with some modicum
of waltz ability.

507
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,915
- Oh, will you stop
selling yourself so short?

508
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,438
Jeez!

509
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,614
Look, the deal we made
when you came here

510
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,747
is that you're gonna have some
fun and try some new things.

511
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,836
And not try and win at every
new thing that you do try!

512
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,099
I mean, think of everything that
you've done since you got here.

513
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:21,710
You learned to waltz,
you head-butt a rich guy,

514
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:22,755
and you tried stuff
with eggs in it.

515
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:23,799
That's huge!

516
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:26,149
- Okay, yeah, I know.

517
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,108
- Shall we get some Gluühwein?
A little liquid courage?

518
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,588
- Yes, let's do it.

519
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,940
- Ah!

520
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:37,987
Ja. Guten morgen, Uncle Markus.

521
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,728
Yeah, yeah.

522
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,472
That was Uncle Markus.
He's in town.

523
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,865
He wants to see if
we want to grab some lunch.

524
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:50,565
- You go see him
and have some bonding time.

525
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:54,525
I'm gonna go explore, okay?

526
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,615
- Okay.
- Let's go.

527
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,589
- Thank you.

528
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,202
- Oops!
- I'm so sorry!

529
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,769
- So sorry.
I'm such a klutz.

530
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,076
- Whoa, are you American?
- Yeah.

531
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,991
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

532
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,819
- Really? Me too.
Hal Stenson.

533
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,429
- Amy Michaels.

534
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,387
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

535
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,172
- What brings you here?

536
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:36,524
- Oh, vacation...
getting away from...

537
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:40,006
I am spending
Christmas with my brother.

538
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,748
You don't happen to know
about these places

539
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,751
that have Glu or glow wine...

540
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,188
- Gluühwein, yes.
- Yes.

541
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,580
- They're amazing.
There's a place up here.

542
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,495
Wanna grab it?
- Yeah.

543
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,107
- Let's go grab some.

544
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:05,988
- So you're the
Chief Nursing Officer

545
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,990
for the Lakeshore
Pediatric Hospital?

546
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:09,862
- That's why I'm here.

547
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:14,431
It's the latest in medical tech,
huge conference.

548
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,085
- What made you decide
to become a nurse?

549
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:18,435
- When I was 10,
I got appendicitis

550
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:22,439
just before Christmas and
I was admitted to Lakeshore.

551
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:25,791
- You had to spend
Christmas in the hospital?

552
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:29,055
- Yeah, but it wasn't so bad.

553
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,535
The nurses... Oh, my goodness,
the nurses were amazing.

554
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,842
They decorated my room

555
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,673
and even gave me a stocking
with my name on it.

556
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,545
I knew one day I wanted
to return the favor.

557
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:45,636
- That's really nice, Hal.

558
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,292
- Amy...

559
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,120
You know, you really
have beautiful eyes.

560
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,257
- That's really sweet.

561
00:28:57,344 --> 00:29:00,477
And I don't want to seem
presumptuous in any way,

562
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,133
but I don't really know
what I'm looking for right now.

563
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,048
- No, no.

564
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:09,573
- But I'm so happy that I got to
share some glow wine with you.

565
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,228
- Gluühwein, Gluühwein, yeah.

566
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,971
- Say no more.

567
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,192
I've got to get going.
- Okay.

568
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,149
- I actually promised some
people at the conference

569
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,542
I'd meet up with them.

570
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,065
Let me grab the check.

571
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,285
- No, no, no, no, I got it.
It's on me.

572
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,634
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

573
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,288
You helped me find
the place, so...

574
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,116
- It's great meeting you, Amy.

575
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:32,771
Merry Christmas to you.
- Merry Christmas.

576
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,337
Bye.

577
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,735
I have to pay.

578
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,224
I can't find my wallet.

579
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,965
- Oh...
- I must have lost it.

580
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:54,531
I'm so sorry.

581
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:57,447
I promise I'll come back
and I'll pay you.

582
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,362
I promise.
- Okay.

583
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,806
I found it.

584
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,133
Hey, Lukas.
- Hey, Amy.

585
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,048
You, uh, left your
wallet yesterday.

586
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,357
You weren't trying
to trick your way

587
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,749
into seeing me again, were you?

588
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,449
- No.

589
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,629
But I do want to apologize
for how I behaved.

590
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,812
Thank you.

591
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:06,386
And I have to say I...

592
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:09,824
I know
I'm not the best dancer.

593
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:13,306
I really want you
to be able to win this.

594
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:15,308
- I feel like I
need to apologize

595
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,657
'cause it was
a misunderstanding.

596
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,051
I want you to be my partner.

597
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,357
I just feel like winning
will come in time.

598
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:24,926
- Okay.

599
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,625
You been waiting long?

600
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:34,109
- Amy, Lukas is on his fourth
hot chocolate waiting for you.

601
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,632
Can I get you one as well?

602
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,679
- Yes, please.

603
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,207
So what do we have
to do to get up to speed

604
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:47,514
with the competition
in two days?

605
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:50,560
- Practice, practice, practice.
- The waltz is simple.

606
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:54,825
All you have to do
is keep your center steady.

607
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,872
Don't forget to take
big sweeping steps.

608
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,483
Your turn.

609
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,964
- Oh, okay.

610
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,055
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

611
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,211
Hey, Daniel.
Is everything okay?

612
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,260
Okay. Yeah.

613
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:41,176
Yeah, I'll be right there.

614
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:44,310
I gotta go.

615
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,789
- Everything okay?

616
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,096
- Yeah, yeah.
It's nothing serious.

617
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,533
I just... I have to go now.

618
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:55,190
So I'll see you tomorrow?

619
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,411
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,155
Bye.

621
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,679
Thank you for returning
my wallet.

622
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,779
Hey, what's going on?

623
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:19,954
What's wrong with Uncle Markus?

624
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,912
- Wrong? No, nothing.

625
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,741
He's fine except I invited
him over for dinner.

626
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,526
- You said this
was an emergency.

627
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,615
- Yeah, it is.

628
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,139
Look, I have no idea how to cook
a traditional Austrian feast.

629
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:33,620
He's from one of the oldest
families in Vienna.

630
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,100
He's gonna disown me.

631
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,624
- Daniel, you're being silly.

632
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,365
- Am I? Am I?

633
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,106
I think I should go back
to Chicago...like now.

634
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:45,327
- Okay. Uncle Markus is
the reason that you're here.

635
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:46,981
- Right.

636
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,287
- He doesn't care about
what you cook for him.

637
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,462
He just wants to
spend time with you.

638
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,594
- Yeah.

639
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,509
- I've got Mom's Christmas
ham recipe, we'll make that.

640
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,597
Be nice to make it for somebody
who actually appreciates it.

641
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,338
- Ham?

642
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,513
Okay.

643
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,993
- Yeah.
- Okay.

644
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,560
- Okay. We can do that.
That'd be great.

645
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:03,780
- Okay, can you
handle buying me a ham?

646
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,695
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Totally.

647
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,262
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah, yeah.

648
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,177
- Awesome.
- The one with feathers, right?

649
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,005
- Go!

650
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,361
- This looks delicious.
- Who knew Amy could cook?

651
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:23,104
- Oh, that's funny.

652
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,933
Good thing I have my
brother's support at all times.

653
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:32,070
- Speaking of brothers, I want
to show you something, Daniel.

654
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,906
Daniel? Amy?

655
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,212
Meet your family.

656
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,092
Our family settled in Vienna
in the early 1800s.

657
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,358
This is your
cousin, Uli

658
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,187
and your great aunt,
Aunt Mavis, on the family farm.

659
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,711
- Wow, a cousin and an aunt.

660
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,325
- They took such great
pride in it.

661
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:13,111
It was one of my favorite places
to visit growing up.

662
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,982
It's why I moved there

663
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,418
after I retired from city life.

664
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,463
- It's beautiful.

665
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:20,857
- Oh, who's that?

666
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:23,338
- That's me and my wife, Greta.

667
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:26,080
This was taken
at the Christmas Eve Ball

668
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,301
years ago at the Kursalon.

669
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:32,260
Where we all danced
the famous...

670
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,435
This was such fun.

671
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:37,047
One of my fondest memories.

672
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,528
- Look at that dress.

673
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:41,051
That gown is amazing.

674
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,357
They don't make
them like that anymore.

675
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:46,361
She wears it well.
She's beautiful.

676
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,712
- Yes.
Yes, she was.

677
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:55,283
- Oh, I'm sorry.

678
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,809
- Oh, it's ok. We had
a very happy life together.

679
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,598
What a dancer!

680
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,904
- You know, Amy's
actually taken up ballroom.

681
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:12,692
- Well, I'm trying to
get in to the Midnight Show

682
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,694
so that I can go to
the Christmas Eve Ball.

683
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,479
- Christmas Eve Ball?

684
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,394
That's the biggest one in town!

685
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,710
- All right, guys.

686
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:34,061
You know I don't expect
anything less than perfection

687
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:36,542
from you tomorrow
at the competition.

688
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,021
No pain, no gain.

689
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:40,241
Let's get to work.

690
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:45,028
And always think while you're
dancing of this beautiful room.

691
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,205
You have to feel it, okay?

692
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,120
From the beginning,
starting position, please.

693
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,254
- Scary.
- This one is the must.

694
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,517
Like he said,
try to feel the room.

695
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:57,127
- I will.

696
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,402
- Good.

697
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:17,365
- I'm glad to see that you two
are more in the steps today.

698
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,803
Good job, good job, very good.

699
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,373
All right.
Okay, thank you!

700
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,202
- All right, how do you feel?

701
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,812
- Thanks, everybody.

702
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,162
Remember, the one who place
in the top four

703
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,296
get to dance at
the midnight show.

704
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,994
for a chance to get crowned
King and Queen

705
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,779
of this year's
Christmas Eve ball.

706
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:42,042
Thank you very much.
See you tomorrow.

707
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,831
- This could just be
our year, Vicky.

708
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:51,617
- Yes, especially
if Lukas dances with her.

709
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,407
- Don't listen to them.

710
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,801
Your dancing has
gotten much better.

711
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,325
- Yeah? Better enough
to get into the Ball?

712
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,371
- Well, your movement
and technique are there,

713
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:10,288
but it's a little sloppy.

714
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,942
- Sloppy?

715
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,161
That's blunt.

716
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,120
- Blunt is the Austrian in me.

717
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:20,080
I apologize for saying it,
but it's true.

718
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,647
Hey, I mean it in a funny way.

719
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:27,740
- Ha-ha. Funny.

720
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:31,134
- You know what they say about
Austrian humor.

721
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,311
- No. What?

722
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,617
- It's no laughing matter.

723
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:42,624
- What can I do?

724
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:43,930
I want my waltzing
to get better.

725
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,323
I want to do this right.

726
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,194
- Okay, listen.

727
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:49,675
The waltz is about emotion
and precision coming together,

728
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,894
and about practice,
practice, practice.

729
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,635
- Lukas? Are we going?

730
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,594
- Hey, Tommy.

731
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:59,380
Sorry. Is there any way we
can stay a little longer today?

732
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,034
- Sure.

733
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:03,689
I'll give you the keys,
but keep it between us

734
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,473
and lock up after.

735
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,083
- Thanks.
- And remember...

736
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,738
You break it, you buy it.

737
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,479
But's that not
a problem, right?

738
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:18,094
And, Amy, this was
much better today.

739
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,793
Good job.
See you tomorrow guys.

740
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,666
- Coming from the mean guy.
- Yes.

741
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,886
- Come on.
Stretch out a little bit.

742
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:30,759
And then we'll do it
without shoes this time, okay?

743
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:33,327
- Okay.

744
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,938
- Okay, so the Vienne Waltz
is one of the oldest forms

745
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,376
of ballroom dancing
in the world.

746
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:42,771
Steps are pretty easy, but
the details are complicated.

747
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,643
I'll lead.
When I go forward, you go back.

748
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,253
When I go right, you go left.

749
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,386
But we're going
to spend a little more time

750
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:52,215
on posture and feeling it.

751
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,695
So here we go.

752
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:58,221
Elbows up, shoulders down,
beautiful.

753
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,702
I'm gonna count.

754
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:03,966
Three, two, one, go.

755
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,842
That's it.
Nice, nice.

756
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,064
Nice.

757
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,722
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

758
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,637
No worries.
Let's take it again.

759
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,031
- Okay.
- Everything up.

760
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,294
Perfect.

761
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,775
Feel it.
Feel the music.

762
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,733
Here you go.

763
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,605
One, two, three.

764
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,565
Nice.

765
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:41,439
That's it.

766
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:44,877
Right here.

767
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,024
There you go.

768
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,030
- Yeah.
- Oh, gosh. Amazing.

769
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,427
- The dip.

770
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,041
- Ooh, hi.

771
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:26,005
- Okay, we did
enough for today.

772
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,920
It was amazing.

773
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,618
- Do you think we got a
chance of winning or, you know,

774
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:34,230
at least getting fourth and
getting in the Midnight Show?

775
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,406
- We'll just keep practicing.

776
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,626
- Okay.

777
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:43,065
- I also would like
to ask you to dinner tonight

778
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:45,372
as a thank-you.

779
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,853
I just need to make
one quick call.

780
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,119
- What does the great Lukas
Hofbauer have planned now?

781
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,860
- Surprise.

782
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,420
- So, enjoy Vienna so far?

783
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:36,205
- It's more beautiful every day.

784
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,080
- Well, let me show you
my favorite view.

785
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,256
And it's not from
the Danube Tower.

786
00:42:57,966 --> 00:43:00,534
- These are amazing.

787
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,536
- Not as amazing as you are.

788
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:09,891
- That was a little corny.

789
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:13,155
- Well, I'm a corny kind of guy.

790
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:15,375
What can I say?

791
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:17,290
I'm sure you've been
on one of those, right?

792
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,900
- Of course, yeah.

793
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:20,510
I try to go on the one
in Chicago

794
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,947
at least once every summer.

795
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:25,254
- But not during Christmas.
- No.

796
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:26,995
- See? I think
we should change that.

797
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,302
- All right.

798
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,146
- Huh?

799
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,538
- It's cool.

800
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:01,377
- I told you I wanted
to thank you.

801
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:04,032
- This is...
This is too much!

802
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,992
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's beautiful.

803
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,603
Thank you, but it's too much.

804
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,171
- No, it isn't, not for you.

805
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:13,999
Come on, we worked
so hard all day.

806
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:17,959
Let's just enjoy the night
and enjoy the view.

807
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,396
Let me get you out
of your jacket. Come on.

808
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:09,532
- I bet you it's even more
beautiful in the summer.

809
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,230
- Oh, it sure is.

810
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:14,842
You know, the kids out there
picnicking on the shore,

811
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:18,716
boats in the water.
It's great.

812
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,282
You should really see it.

813
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:25,679
- I'm only here
for another week.

814
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,942
My real life is in Chicago.

815
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,946
- So this isn't real life now?

816
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,259
- I have had the best
time with you, Lukas.

817
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:44,176
And this has been incredible.

818
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:47,919
But I can't pretend

819
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:50,095
that this is what
my life's gonna be from now on.

820
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:53,751
- Okay.

821
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,234
Well, then let's just enjoy
your time here in Vienna.

822
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,456
You know what? Here.

823
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,328
Let's drink to that.

824
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:09,679
To Christmas in Vienna.

825
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,205
- Christmas in Vienna.

826
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:23,824
- Sorry I have to do that,
but I need one last dance.

827
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:26,435
- Oh, I thought
we were done practicing.

828
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,743
- Well, if we can dance in
a swinging Ferris Wheel car,

829
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,790
we'll be so much better
tomorrow on solid ground.

830
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,269
- All right.

831
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,539
Thank you so much for tonight,

832
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:48,762
for dinner and the dancing.

833
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:52,984
I'm never, ever going
to forget it.

834
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,993
It's so beautiful.
I'm bummed.

835
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,473
I'm not gonna be
able to decorate

836
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,171
for Christmas this year,
you know.

837
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:10,610
- Okay. You know what?

838
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:13,004
You've brought so much
Christmas spirit into my life.

839
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:16,398
Why don't
we just decorate my house?

840
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:27,845
It's gonna be fun.

841
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:28,846
Let me get your jacket.

842
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:29,847
- Oh, thank you.

843
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,196
- Here we go.

844
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:34,764
- Hello, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry.

845
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,288
I didn't realize
you had company.

846
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,159
- Oh, no. Hey, Dominik.
We need your help.

847
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,204
Get all the Christmas
decorations

848
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,945
out of the cellar, please.

849
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:44,078
- Christmas decorations?
- Yes! We're gonna decorate!

850
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,211
- Let's do this.

851
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:47,473
- Go!

852
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,649
He's all excited!
- Okay!

853
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:16,894
So, what do you think?

854
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:20,898
- I love it.

855
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:25,250
You know, this is
the first time

856
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,861
I decorated this house
without my parents.

857
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,690
- You okay?

858
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:33,040
- Yes. I'm super happy.

859
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:34,520
I'm glad you brought
some holiday spirit

860
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,348
back into this lonely house.

861
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:39,046
Thank you.

862
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,569
- Of course.

863
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,231
You're forgetting one
important thing, though.

864
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:52,364
- What?

865
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,670
- Christmas tree.

866
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:56,063
- Oh.

867
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,717
We'll save
that for tomorrow.

868
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,599
- Hey.
- Hey.

869
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:12,123
Where you been all day?

870
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,298
I thought you just had
your dance lesson.

871
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:16,823
- I did.
The day got away from us.

872
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,173
Do you know how to get to
the woods outside of Vienna?

873
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,263
- I don't, but I could
ask Uncle Markus. Why?

874
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,787
- Lukas doesn't
have a Christmas tree.

875
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,354
Thought I'd surprise him
with a real one.

876
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,705
What?

877
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,403
- You really like him.

878
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,144
Yeah, you do!
You like him!

879
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:37,017
- Nothing is going on, okay?
Stop!

880
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:38,758
I leave for Chicago in
a few days.

881
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,368
I just want to do
something nice for the guy.

882
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:42,718
- Sure.

883
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:45,286
- Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go and iron

884
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,549
the only formal dress
that I brought

885
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,725
so that I can go to
the competition tomorrow.

886
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:51,205
- Hm.

887
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,902
- Mind your own business.

888
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,035
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

889
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:08,788
Wow, they all look
so professional.

890
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,312
- Don't worry about them.

891
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,835
You see the lady in the middle?

892
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:14,837
The other two are
sticklers for precision,

893
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,753
but she, she judges
on chemistry,

894
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,366
emotion and
overall performance.

895
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,846
- So you're saying
we actually do have a shot

896
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:26,023
at the Midnight Show and
the Christmas Eve Ball?

897
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,026
- I sure hope so,
or my parents

898
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:31,550
will come back from
their grave to haunt me.

899
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,685
- Well, looks like
we're about to be haunted

900
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,339
by a ghost of Christmas
past right now.

901
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:42,561
- Good luck.
You will need it.

902
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:45,259
Nice dress.
- Excuse me...

903
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:51,874
- Why don't you just
go sign us in?

904
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,486
I'll be with you
in a second, okay?

905
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:57,837
- Okay.

906
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,669
- Chicago, I hardly
recognized you.

907
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:05,236
You've certainly come a long way

908
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:07,107
and I wanted to wish
you good luck.

909
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:09,936
- Oh, thank you, but you
can't wish me good luck.

910
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,677
- Why not?

911
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:13,374
- Because in America,
when there's a performance,

912
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:15,159
it's bad luck to wish good luck.

913
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:16,812
- And what do you say instead?

914
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:18,379
- Break a leg.

915
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:20,642
- Right.

916
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:21,774
That makes sense.

917
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,764
- Wow!

918
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:05,122
- And now, welcome our next
couple, Lydia and Philippe.

919
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,760
- Oh...

920
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:44,639
- Ah, Lydia will definitely
not be happy with that.

921
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,650
- Thank you, Philippe.
Thank you, Lydia.

922
00:52:55,737 --> 00:53:00,829
And now, please welcome our
next couple, Lukas and Amy.

923
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:26,888
- Oh my God.

924
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:38,160
- Oh my God!

925
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:43,644
- Do you want to do this?

926
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:45,298
- No, no.
I'm too nervous.

927
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:49,041
You go ahead.
I'll be right behind you, okay?

928
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,484
- Yes! Yes! We did it!

929
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:59,051
We're going to the Ball!

930
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,055
We did it!
We're going to the Ball!

931
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,019
- Oh!

932
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:14,371
- What happened?
Are you okay?

933
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,417
- I slipped on this champagne
and I think I sprained my ankle.

934
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:18,897
- No. I'm gonna go
get an ambulance.

935
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:20,333
- No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

936
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,944
It's just twisted.
- Are you sure?

937
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:24,729
- Yeah.

938
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:26,557
- Get a chair or
something, please!

939
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:29,647
That's it.

940
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:33,520
- Oh, okay.

941
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,308
I am so sorry.

942
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,181
- Don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

943
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:44,183
I'm gonna go get you
some ice, okay?

944
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:48,056
- Too bad about
your dance partner.

945
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:51,582
- Lydia, not now!
Come on, please!

946
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:54,149
- You know, Philippe
is a great dance partner,

947
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,891
but we don't have
the same spark that we had.

948
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:58,850
- Lydia...

949
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,373
- You saw what he did
to me on that lift.

950
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,158
You would never
embarrass me that way.

951
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:04,682
And I know what
winning means to you.

952
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,687
You know that
there's a rule that allows you

953
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:12,646
to switch dance partner if one
gets physically unable to dance?

954
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,343
I'm just saying.

955
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:38,846
- I feel so stupid.
I can't believe I fell.

956
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:41,196
Lukas and I actually make
it into the Midnight Ball

957
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:43,329
and I screw it up
with my clumsiness!

958
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,548
- Well, at least
there's a bright side.

959
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:45,810
- Do tell?

960
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,246
- You get to stay here with me.

961
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:51,642
- You have a point.

962
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,165
- Sure.

963
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,612
- Oh, wow.

964
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:07,614
- Amy insisted you have
a real tree

965
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:09,486
sourced from the Vienna woods.

966
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,531
- It's beautiful.

967
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,145
Merry Christmas.

968
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:24,413
- Now we gotta keep ice on this.

969
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,460
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

970
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:29,027
- Look, I don't know.

971
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:31,290
I think that maybe you
should go to the doctor.

972
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:33,031
- It'll probably
be better in the morning.

973
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:34,685
- If it's still swollen,
you promise that you'll go?

974
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:36,034
- I promise.

975
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:40,255
- Who's that?

976
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:43,520
"Hi, Amy. I hope that
your ankle is feeling better.

977
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,260
"And, by the way, thank
you for the tree.

978
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,958
It was so thoughtful."

979
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,308
That's really sweet.

980
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:50,483
"Are you free
tomorrow morning?"

981
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,789
I like him.

982
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:53,660
- Give me my phone.

983
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:55,488
I'm glad.
It's good that you like him.

984
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:09,284
- Sir, you missed a call
from your lady friend.

985
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:12,418
- Thank you, Dominik.

986
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,115
It's amazing, isn't it?

987
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:15,726
- "Good morning, Lukas.

988
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,466
"Just wanted to let
you know I'm on my way

989
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,556
"to the hospital right now.
Nothing serious.

990
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:22,123
"My ankle's still
a little swollen.

991
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,038
"So I just want to make
sure it's healing properly.

992
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,910
"I'm sorry I can't
meet up this morning,

993
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:29,348
but I'll call you as soon
as I'm done. Bye."

994
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,612
- I think we should go
to the hospital.

995
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:34,875
- Mm-hmm.
I go prepare the car.

996
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,355
- Thank you, Dominik.

997
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,501
Thank you, Vienna.
Not gonna cost a thing.

998
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,503
- Thank you for making me
go to the doctor.

999
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,549
- No problem.

1000
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:58,333
Hey, by the way,
Uncle Markus said

1001
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,118
he's gonna stay with us through
the holidays to help out.

1002
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:02,337
- That's really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1003
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,078
- The doc said
it's just a mild sprain.

1004
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,254
It should heal pretty quick.
- Yeah, well, he insists.

1005
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,387
Says it's gonna
be great to spend Christmas

1006
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:09,693
with family again.

1007
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,129
- That's great.

1008
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:13,261
- Yeah, Wunderbar!

1009
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:14,915
- All right, let's do this.

1010
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:16,743
- Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1011
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,617
You got to stay off of it
for at least a couple of days.

1012
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,401
- Goodbye, Christmas Ball.

1013
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:31,802
- Whatever you need, okay?

1014
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:49,733
- Thanks.

1015
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,259
- Hello, Lukas, have
you given any more thought

1016
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,087
to my proposition?

1017
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,396
- Hey, Lukas, it's Amy.

1018
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,529
I'm at home recuperating.

1019
01:01:06,053 --> 01:01:09,796
I'm sorry, again,
this has happened.

1020
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:13,017
I would really, really
love to see you again soon.

1021
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,499
I know that you are
preparing for the Midnight Show,

1022
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,677
so I totally understand
if you're too busy.

1023
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:26,030
But, yeah, I hope you're well.

1024
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:27,292
Merry Christmas.

1025
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:45,005
- Come on, sis.
What are you doing back there?

1026
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:46,703
We gotta hang stockings.

1027
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:55,581
Still nothing?

1028
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:58,976
- No, not even a text.

1029
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:09,726
- Perfect.

1030
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:49,243
- Lukas Hofbauer,
nice to see you again!

1031
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:50,854
We're about to close,

1032
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,899
but I can still make
you two hot chocolates.

1033
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:56,207
- Oh, that would be nice,
Sophia, but one only, please.

1034
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:57,774
- What happened?

1035
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:00,907
- I think I trusted
Amy a little too much.

1036
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:03,127
She was with someone
else the whole time.

1037
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:04,389
- I'm sorry.

1038
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:06,086
She seemed to like you,

1039
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:10,134
the you, you,
not the rich, stuffy you.

1040
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:12,136
- Yes, I guess you're right.

1041
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:15,226
She was...is...different,

1042
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,316
but it doesn't matter now.

1043
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:20,144
I'm back with my ex.

1044
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:22,711
I will be dancing in
the Midnight Show with her.

1045
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,845
- Where is she now?

1046
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:27,760
- She doesn't like
hot chocolate.

1047
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:32,025
- All I know is
hot chocolate isn't very much

1048
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:34,941
fun to drink alone,
especially at Christmas.

1049
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,265
- Hey, are you sure you're
gonna be okay at the market?

1050
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:55,570
You really should
have let

1051
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:56,528
Uncle Markus and
me come with you.

1052
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:58,269
- Daniel, it's fine.

1053
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:00,445
How else was I gonna be able
to get you both gifts?

1054
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:03,622
And I have to get Mom
and Dad Christmas gifts.

1055
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:06,146
- Okay, but I'm picking
you up in an hour.

1056
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:07,713
Those crowds are no joke.

1057
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,194
- I'll be fine.

1058
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,718
I'll see you in an hour.
Bye.

1059
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,244
- Oh, my gosh.

1060
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:19,464
Hey, Amy?

1061
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:21,858
- Hey!
How are you?

1062
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:24,164
- What happened to your leg?

1063
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:28,038
- I overdid it in
a waltzing competition.

1064
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,823
- Eee.
- Yeah, it's a long story.

1065
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,085
- Does it hurt?

1066
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,695
- Yeah, it's still throbbing.

1067
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:35,306
- Here.
You know I'm a nurse, right?

1068
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,960
- Yeah.
- Here's a bench over here.

1069
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:38,613
Let me take a look at it.
Let me grab your stuff.

1070
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,224
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1071
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,142
Okie-dokie, that should do it.

1072
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:49,798
- Wow. That actually
feels a lot better.

1073
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,671
- It's just a minor
sprain anyway.

1074
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:56,153
- Still, do you think
I could dance on it?

1075
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,764
- It's totally up to you,
but it might hurt.

1076
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,113
Just take a little Ibuprofen

1077
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,419
and you'll be good
to go, though.

1078
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,464
- I appreciate it,

1079
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:06,685
but I don't think I'm gonna
be dancing any time soon.

1080
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,426
Thank you, Hal.

1081
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,993
- Happy to help.

1082
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,864
Well, I need to be heading...

1083
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:13,431
I actually put my
name in a raffle

1084
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:14,998
and won tickets
to a party tonight.

1085
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:16,651
- Cool.

1086
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,479
- So when do you
head back to Chicago?

1087
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:23,049
- After Christmas, after
my doctor clears me to fly.

1088
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,443
- Get well soon, Amy.

1089
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,358
Be well.
I'll see you soon.

1090
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:29,490
- Have fun.

1091
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:52,644
- Good job, guys!
Thank you.

1092
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:54,602
We will do one last one

1093
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:57,779
before our Christmas Eve Ball
at Kursalon.

1094
01:05:57,866 --> 01:05:59,868
Is this all right?

1095
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,480
- Can I say something?

1096
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:06,092
Just because I'm gonna
be crowned

1097
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:09,008
as the Queen of
the Christmas Eve Ball

1098
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:12,403
doesn't mean I can't return
to my humble beginnings.

1099
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:17,321
I want to say that I appreciate
every single one of you.

1100
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:22,282
I mean, you're all so wonderful.

1101
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:23,762
You make us look so good.

1102
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:37,994
- Lukas, have you
heard from Amy?

1103
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,343
- Who?

1104
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,084
- Chicago?
The charming American?

1105
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:43,564
Quick learner?
Feisty spirit?

1106
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:46,350
With her, I could have
sold classes the whole winter.

1107
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:50,615
- You mean the crass, clumsy one
with the two left feet who fell?

1108
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:52,530
I mean, I hope she's all right.

1109
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:55,141
- She's fine.
She's well taken care of.

1110
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:01,278
- Come on, guys.
One more time.

1111
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:21,254
- I gotta get back to Chicago.

1112
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,909
This trip has been such a mess.

1113
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:28,479
- Ames, hey, look.

1114
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:31,090
I haven't seen you
this happy in years.

1115
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:34,485
- Do I look happy
to you right now?

1116
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:36,835
I don't even get
to go to the Ball.

1117
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:38,054
- Yeah, I know.

1118
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,274
That wasn't really the point,
though, was it?

1119
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:47,976
Look, all I'm saying
is that I see you happy.

1120
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,676
You're doing stuff
because you want to do it,

1121
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:54,244
not because
it's on some schedule,

1122
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:56,420
not because you feel
like you have to.

1123
01:07:56,507 --> 01:07:58,683
That's a good thing, right?

1124
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,294
- Why are you always
so annoyingly right?

1125
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:03,079
- I think I get it
from my sister.

1126
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:12,175
- My ankle's actually
feeling a lot better.

1127
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:15,003
- Oh, this is wonderful news.

1128
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,832
Seems like you've got a
late visit from St. Nicholas.

1129
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:19,921
- Santa Claus came early.

1130
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:23,273
- I would like to give
a toast to my new nephew,

1131
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,276
Daniel, who may not have
hunted our Christmas goose

1132
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:29,496
in the woods, but,
thank goodness,

1133
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,716
it was still open season
at the butcher's!

1134
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:39,941
We'll get 'em next year,
Daniel, and...

1135
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:41,421
to Amy's recovery.

1136
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,902
You'll be back to
waltzing in no time.

1137
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:45,686
Prost.
- Prost.

1138
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:57,916
- What's the matter?

1139
01:08:58,003 --> 01:09:00,571
- I can't help but
think the Ball is tonight

1140
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:03,704
and it's setting in
that I won't be going.

1141
01:09:07,404 --> 01:09:10,407
- Hold on a second.

1142
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:12,887
You know, I was
the head groundskeeper

1143
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:15,499
of the palais where the ball
is held for over 40 years.

1144
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:17,153
- Really?

1145
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,590
- And for my lifetime
of service,

1146
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:25,291
every year I'm given these.

1147
01:09:25,378 --> 01:09:28,425
Brought them along just in case.

1148
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:34,735
- What's that?

1149
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,611
- It's tickets...

1150
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:42,003
to the Christmas Ball!

1151
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,396
- They're yours.
Merry Christmas!

1152
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,485
- Oh, my goodness,
Uncle Markus!

1153
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:47,357
That's amazing!
Thank you so much!

1154
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:51,709
- Nothing would give me greater
joy than for you to go.

1155
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:54,059
- Thank you!

1156
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:55,321
I wish I could.

1157
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:56,757
I don't have a dress.

1158
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:58,585
- Oh, yes, you do.

1159
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:04,025
Your dress, my dear.

1160
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:06,027
- Is that...

1161
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,727
- It was Greta's
favorite gown.

1162
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:12,164
I can think of no one
better to wear it.

1163
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:15,776
- Oh, my goodness!

1164
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:18,301
I would be honored.

1165
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:21,434
Thank you, thank you!

1166
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,567
- Now let's all go to the Ball!

1167
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,714
- Amazing!

1168
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,455
I feel like a princess!

1169
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:28,371
- I think Greta
would be very happy.

1170
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,416
- Thanks, again, Uncle Markus.

1171
01:11:30,503 --> 01:11:32,984
I'm so glad you're a
part of the family.

1172
01:11:33,071 --> 01:11:36,509
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1173
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:40,078
- You guys ready to do this?

1174
01:11:40,165 --> 01:11:41,906
- You look great in a tux.

1175
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:44,604
- Oh, thank you.
Markus says it was my father's.

1176
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:47,041
- You really look like him.

1177
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,173
- Hopefully, I
don't disgrace the family

1178
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,696
too much with my dancing.

1179
01:11:49,783 --> 01:11:51,132
- You could never.

1180
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:53,091
- Shall we?
- We shall.

1181
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:27,343
It's magnificent.

1182
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,736
- Have you ever seen
anything so magical?

1183
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,695
- Only in fairy tales.

1184
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:38,876
- A waltz, my dear?

1185
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:40,791
- Indeed, good sir.

1186
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:42,967
- All right, let's see how
those dance lessons paid off.

1187
01:13:22,006 --> 01:13:25,575
- Hi.
My name is Vira.

1188
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:27,403
- I'm Daniel.

1189
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:28,534
- Nice to meet you.

1190
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,538
- This is my sister, Amy.

1191
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,715
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Nice to meet you.

1192
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:37,587
- I'm gonna get some air.

1193
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:39,023
Looks like you have to dance.
Good luck.

1194
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:54,038
Sorry...

1195
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:57,824
Lukas!

1196
01:13:57,911 --> 01:14:03,395
- Hi, Amy.
I didn't expect you here.

1197
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:05,832
- Yeah, well, I might
have fallen down.

1198
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:08,574
But I managed to get
myself back up again.

1199
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,576
- I can certainly see that.

1200
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:13,579
How did you manage
to get a ticket?

1201
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:18,454
- Look, I just want to
know what happened.

1202
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,456
Then you can go back to
pretending I never existed!

1203
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:24,460
- Hi.
I want to say, "Ashley"?

1204
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,636
You look very classy tonight,

1205
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,420
A really, really
phenomenal dress.

1206
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:30,117
But we'd better get going.

1207
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:32,903
Let's get some practice
before the crown is ours.

1208
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,436
- Don't let her get to you.

1209
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:46,133
- It's not easy.

1210
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,135
- You should be proud
of your dancing.

1211
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:50,007
There are not a lot of people
who could learn

1212
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:52,400
as much as you did
in such short time.

1213
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,402
Thank you, Amy.

1214
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,710
You helped me remember why I
teach waltz in the first place.

1215
01:14:59,669 --> 01:15:00,931
Excuse me a moment?

1216
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,759
I have to set up
this competition.

1217
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:12,812
- Amy!

1218
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,640
- Hal, what are you doing here?

1219
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:17,904
- That party I told you about?
This is it!

1220
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:20,167
- Wow!
Well, you look great.

1221
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,909
- My mom always told me to pack
at least one nice suit

1222
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,824
because you never know
when you're gonna need it.

1223
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:26,565
- Looks like she was right.

1224
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,829
- True. She's been
wrong before, though.

1225
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,701
Hey, this is Eva.

1226
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:33,485
Tonight we're having
a great time.

1227
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:36,488
- Great. Nice to meet you.

1228
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,924
- Hey, how's your leg?

1229
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:40,274
- It's much better, thank you.

1230
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,146
- I'm very happy
you're here tonight.

1231
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:45,410
- Thanks. I'm happy that
we met here in Vienna.

1232
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,846
You're a great guy.

1233
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:48,892
You guys have
a great night, okay?

1234
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:52,678
Bye.

1235
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,130
- Hey.

1236
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:56,176
- Have you seen Lukas?

1237
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:57,482
- What? Lukas Hofbauer?

1238
01:16:57,569 --> 01:16:59,789
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I...

1239
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:01,573
I saw him on the balcony.

1240
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:04,402
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1241
01:17:57,498 --> 01:18:01,677
- This is just like
in the old days.

1242
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:03,722
- Yeah, just like the old days.

1243
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,203
- Did you ever think
we'd be dancing

1244
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,857
at the Christmas Ball together?

1245
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:12,078
- Lydia, I think I need a break.

1246
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:13,210
- No!
We need to keep practicing!

1247
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:14,515
- I'm sorry.
Listen...

1248
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:15,603
- We need to keep practicing!

1249
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,953
- I need to get some fresh air!

1250
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:58,385
- Lukas?

1251
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,431
Please, why won't
you talk to me?

1252
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:01,562
What's your problem?

1253
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:03,347
- My problem?

1254
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:04,609
- Ever since I got hurt, you've
completely blown me off!

1255
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:05,828
- Excuse me?

1256
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,438
- I mean, I get it.

1257
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,309
You just wanted to be
crowned King of the Ball.

1258
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:10,746
But you could have at least
said thank you and goodbye!

1259
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,356
- Hey, listen!
I came to see you!

1260
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:13,966
I just didn't know you
were with someone else.

1261
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:16,839
- Someone else?
What are you talking about?

1262
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:18,188
There is no one else!

1263
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:21,104
- Yeah, right.
I know what I saw.

1264
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:23,280
You know, with girls like Lydia,
I know what I'm getting.

1265
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,630
She's not just pretending
to be nice,

1266
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:28,285
to be clawing her way to the top
just like all the other ones!

1267
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:30,417
- Is that what you think of me?

1268
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:55,965
- Without further ado,

1269
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,923
the moment we all have
been waiting for.

1270
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,490
- Let's win this crown.

1271
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:02,493
- Please welcome our
Midnight Show dancers.

1272
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:14,157
- I knew you'd come around.

1273
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,403
- Please welcome our
final waltzing couple.

1274
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,797
- I'm glad you came
to your senses.

1275
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:48,104
You would never won
that crown with her.

1276
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:10,213
- Hey.

1277
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:13,825
- Hey.

1278
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:16,872
- Is everything okay?

1279
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:18,351
- No. I'm sorry.

1280
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,700
- What is he doing?

1281
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:11,274
- What are you doing?

1282
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:16,061
- Lydia, you deserve
to dance with somebody

1283
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:18,368
who wants the crown
as badly as you do.

1284
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:20,109
- But this has been your dream
for years!

1285
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:21,849
- I need to do this
for myself.

1286
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,113
I can't live my life
for everybody else.

1287
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,941
This is it!

1288
01:22:35,254 --> 01:22:36,560
Amy, I am so sorry.

1289
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:37,909
- Lukas, I...I...

1290
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:39,780
- I never planned
on meeting you.

1291
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:43,132
But now that I have, I can't
imagine my life any other way.

1292
01:22:43,219 --> 01:22:45,264
- I don't know.
I don't know, Lukas.

1293
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:46,874
- I'm sorry for what
I said outside.

1294
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,615
I didn't mean it.

1295
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,400
It was out of hurt.

1296
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:53,838
I just needed to let
you know how I truly feel.

1297
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,885
Listen, take good
care of her, okay?

1298
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,149
You're a lucky man.

1299
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:05,937
- Wait. You think Daniel's
my boyfriend?

1300
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:08,374
- Ah, no...
- Daniel's my brother.

1301
01:23:10,463 --> 01:23:12,161
- What? Daniel is your brother?

1302
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:14,815
- Yeah.

1303
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:18,906
- Amy is your sister?
- Yeah.

1304
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,082
- You guys are
brother and sister?

1305
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:21,387
- Yeah!
- Yes.

1306
01:23:21,474 --> 01:23:23,389
- No!

1307
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:27,915
That's amazing!
I mean, I'm such a fool!

1308
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1309
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:32,616
- I didn't want
to get hurt again.

1310
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:34,313
Could you ever forgive me?

1311
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,011
I am so sorry.

1312
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:40,972
- You could start
by asking me to dance.

1313
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:46,804
- May I have this dance?

1314
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:48,501
- Yes.

1315
01:24:53,392 --> 01:24:55,090
- This is beautiful.

1316
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:32,344
- I thought it was dangerous to
look your partner in the eyes.

1317
01:25:32,431 --> 01:25:34,825
- Not if she is as beautiful
as you are.

1318
01:25:40,657 --> 01:25:42,572
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1319
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,148
- Chicago!

1320
01:26:01,373 --> 01:26:03,941
- It's the best
Christmas Ball ever!

1321
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:28,574
- Shall we dance?
- Love to.
