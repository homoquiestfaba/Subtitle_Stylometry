1
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:17,558
"Taboo: A prohibition against
touching, saying or doing something...

2
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:22,128
...for fear of immediate harm
from a supernatural force."

3
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:26,523
It's creepy.
And I don't... I don't really get it.

4
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,829
The thing about taboos
is that society shuns them.

5
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,939
But there's something
very tempting about them.

6
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:36,338
The game will test whether
we succumb to the taboo.

7
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:38,440
- Such as?
- Such as:

8
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:40,915
Would you cheat on your spouse?

9
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:45,781
That's taboo? I thought that was
considered good country-club etiquette.

10
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,787
- You belong to some sick clubs.
- Everyone in?

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,115
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,788
All right.
The rules are easy.

13
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:56,692
You get one card.
Don't let anyone look.

14
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:59,799
You answer "yes" or "no"
to the question on it.

15
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:02,095
How do we know who answers what?

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,104
We don't. Nobody reads their own card.
It's anonymous.

17
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,766
A total and complete lack
of accountability. I like it.

18
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,571
- Like voting.
- Like voting.

19
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:17,150
After we've answered the cards, we'll
shuffle them and pick one to read...

20
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:20,219
...and we'll see
what we're all truly made of.

21
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,856
I'm not so sure about this.

22
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:25,852
- It's just a game.
- Rather play dress-up?

23
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,393
It'll be fun, trust me.

24
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:38,262
Oh, that's nasty.

25
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:45,612
This is the most disturbing question
I've ever been asked.

26
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,243
Is "maybe" a good answer?

27
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,813
Don't look at me like that.

28
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,578
- Who goes first?
- Not me.

29
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:30,349
Would you guys shut up, already?
Okay. Let's read them.

30
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,626
Question: "Would you have sex
with a minor?" Answer: "Yes."

31
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:38,630
We begin our slide into the moral abyss.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,893
Oh, naughty, naughty.

33
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,233
Shit, I had sex before I was 14.
I don't see what the big deal is.

34
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:48,739
I didn't think they had altar boys
in the Jewish faith.

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,707
Okay, Piper. Your turn.

36
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,611
Question: "Would you sleep
with a person of the same sex?"

37
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,307
Answer: "Yes."

38
00:02:57,485 --> 00:03:00,852
What a great game to play
with our best friends.

39
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,583
- Fuck Taboo. Let's have an orgy.
- Or enroll in group therapy.

40
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,792
Maybe you need new friends.

41
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:10,988
Actually, we all seem pretty
well-suited for each other, so far.

42
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:12,990
Your turn.

43
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,496
All right, the question is,
"Would you have a threesome?"

44
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,300
The answer is yes.

45
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,071
- Two girls and one guy?
- Does it matter?

46
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,043
Mr. Right-Wing Conservative
over there...

47
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:30,673
...looks like he might think
two girls would be fun.

48
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:32,410
Okay, my turn.

49
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,283
Question:
"Would you have sex for money?"

50
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:38,285
Answer: "Yes."

51
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,653
I like sex, okay?
That does not make me a hooker.

52
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:47,494
- It also doesn't make me a bitch.
- That's my baby.

53
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,492
Question:

54
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,202
"Would you sleep
with your partner's best friend?"

55
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,378
Answer:
A very disappointing no.

56
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:02,377
There is one good person
amongst us sinners.

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,949
Christian.

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,748
Don't you have to be less educated
to be in the Christian Coalition?

59
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:11,414
So says the prep-school anarchist.

60
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,686
No, I'm just a shallow,
materialistic party girl.

61
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:18,263
And at least I don't pretend
to believe in principles.

62
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,299
Well, I believe in principles.

63
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,767
True, he just doesn't have any.

64
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,500
Christian, stop pouting
and read the last question.

65
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:32,646
I think he's scared to read the question.

66
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:39,112
- Just read the card.
- Okay. "Would you sleep...

67
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,248
...with a relative?" Answer: "Yes."

68
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,857
That's fucking disgusting.

69
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:18,669
I'm glad that you all could make it.
We're glad that you all could make it.

70
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:24,409
That's so cute, Christian.
We're glad everyone could make it.

71
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,983
We are.

72
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,716
- Grow up, Piper. Things change.
- Easy for you to say.

73
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,725
Ladies, please. We haven't
seen each other since graduation.

74
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,089
Could you be nice?

75
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:39,926
Stop the whiny, insecure,
competitive bullshit. Please?

76
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,797
Yeah, I'm the Jew. It's my job.

77
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:47,135
Oh, you like that, Christian? Jew.

78
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,936
It's funny, Jewish. It's good. Right?

79
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,672
Yeah, I bet you know
a lot of good Jew jokes, huh?

80
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,411
- Yeah, there's the...
- Christian. He's kidding.

81
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,317
No, no, let him finish.
Hey, I mean, it's his new house, huh?

82
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,095
He owns this big thing.
He's the sole heir.

83
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,630
Who's the big winner, Christian?

84
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,762
Don't worry about him, Christian.
He's just a sore loser.

85
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,071
What the fuck did I lose?

86
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,176
The ultimate trophy wife. Elizabeth.

87
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:25,943
- Slut.
- Bitch.

88
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,715
- Like there's a difference.
- But there is.

89
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,683
You see, a slut gets to sleep
with anyone she wants to. Moi.

90
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,519
And a bitch...

91
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:38,988
...well, a bitch sleeps with no one.
Not even with her fiancÃ©.

92
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,693
Vous.

93
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,558
Look at that. One minute.

94
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:49,095
One minute left
and this year is finally over.

95
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,965
- I thought it was a good year.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,370
No, baby, it was a great year.

97
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,135
Spare me.

98
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,279
Excuse me?

99
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,408
Fifty seconds.

100
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,019
Anybody have any New Year's resolutions?

101
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,655
Mine never come true.

102
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:13,260
Maybe you should shoot for something
a little more reasonable, like...

103
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,758
...stop drinking...

104
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,624
...every other day.

105
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:21,166
- There's always next year.
- Yes, there is.

106
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,697
Here. A toast.

107
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:32,306
To the four people in the world
that I most love to hate.

108
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,210
And to the one that I hate to love.

109
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,778
To relationships that last as long
as we live. As short as that may be.

110
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,357
- Another 12 seconds.
- "12 seconds."

111
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,687
I'd like to make a toast to bread.

112
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:50,922
Because without bread,
there would be no toast.

113
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:58,566
A toast for the cure to cancer.
And ending world hunger.

114
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,606
And everything else
I'll never be involved in.

115
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:05,211
To special people. And special times.

116
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,040
Special Olympics.

117
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,412
- Here, here.
- Lt is five...

118
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:15,419
...four, three, two, one.

119
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,087
Christian?

120
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:23,393
- Oh, my God.
- Christian?

121
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,529
It's really not a bad house. It's...

122
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:31,099
Here, I'll just light this.
Let's do this the right way.

123
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:37,639
Just relax, there's a storm
outside, remember?

124
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,280
Come on, let's do this right.

125
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,485
Toast. Happy New Year's.

126
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,185
Happy New...

127
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,293
For God's sake!

128
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,388
This is ridiculous.

129
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,660
- Are you expecting anyone?
- Not a soul.

130
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,546
How's work, Benjamin?

131
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,992
- I quit.
- Good for you.

132
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,152
Good for me because
I would have been fired.

133
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,695
Sorry, I didn't know.

134
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:34,561
I really didn't think you were cut out
for investment banking.

135
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,637
You're creative, and banking's
just about money and power, so...

136
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:40,933
What are you gonna do now?

137
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:44,333
Investment banking...

138
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,277
...at a firm where I'll make more money
and have more power.

139
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:52,579
What about you, Adam? How's Boston
and law school treating you?

140
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,189
Law school sucks.
I miss New York.

141
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,256
- Why?
- There's not enough hookers in Boston.

142
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:03,192
- It's a fucking Catholic city.
- Good drinkers though, right?

143
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:08,324
This is true. But what good is getting
drunk if you can't get a hooker?

144
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:12,529
- Piper, how's everything...?
- Elizabeth. I know what you're doing.

145
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:16,198
Trying to make polite, grown-up talk.
Stop. We hate it.

146
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:20,837
I'm sure we'd prefer uncomfortable
silence and shocking statements...

147
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,280
...to tiresome pleasantries
and chitchat banter.

148
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:29,411
- Well said. A mouthful, but well said.
- What do you want to talk about, then?

149
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,057
- Dirt.
- Gossip.

150
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:33,193
I like rumors. Anyone have any?

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,351
Benjamin and I are breaking up.

152
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,191
No shit. And why is that?

153
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,662
Benji?

154
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,234
It's because my penis is too big.

155
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,967
Yeah, it is.

156
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,700
Somebody rained on you.

157
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:54,245
Got a package marked
"personal and confidential."

158
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:58,317
I didn't think anyone delivered
on New Year's after midnight.

159
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:02,319
- Well, it's here.
- Well, what is it?

160
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,685
Christian, what is it?

161
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:12,228
"Prostitute. Infidel.

162
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,299
Homosexual.

163
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:19,038
Rapist. Hypocrite."

164
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,438
Which one of you did this?

165
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,668
Let me see those.

166
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,213
- Who sent it?
- There's no return address.

167
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,819
How do you know it's for you?

168
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,314
Let me see those.

169
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,150
Excuse me.

170
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,453
They're the answers to that
Taboo game we played.

171
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:45,029
They're not answers, Christian.
Those are accusations.

172
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,861
Somebody here is obviously
fucking with us.

173
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,730
Who would be so juvenile?

174
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,063
Not it.

175
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:55,231
- I hated that game.
- There you go, Piper. Revenge.

176
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,407
Now, that's a good motive.

177
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,742
No, it's probably someone
who enjoyed the game...

178
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:04,440
...and now they want
to play round two.

179
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:07,644
I liked it. I didn't do this.

180
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:15,255
Well, I guess whoever isn't either
a prostitute, a rapist...

181
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,728
...a gay, an infidel or a hypocrite...

182
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,891
...is, you know, the likely candidate.
Right?

183
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,472
Can I, please?

184
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,679
I'm gonna get some more wine.

185
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:33,032
Hey, do you guys want red or white?

186
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:49,517
- Asshole. What are you doing?
- Asshole?

187
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,387
Elizabeth, that's not a very nice word
for you to use.

188
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,720
I wanted to ask you...

189
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,593
...why the fuck did you send
that package?

190
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,993
What makes you think I did that?

191
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,233
It's because you think you're so much
better than the rest of us, don't you?

192
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:13,710
Elizabeth, we went out for, what,
two years, right?

193
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:19,385
And we slept together... Never.
Not once.

194
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:24,388
You know you just think you're as pure
as the Virgin Mary, don't you?

195
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,150
That's not true.

196
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:30,729
I was wondering if you and Christian
were playing hide the sausage.

197
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:34,561
Wrong again. I'm waiting
till I get married and you know that.

198
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:38,695
- I'm going to scream.
- Yeah, I know, you said that.

199
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:43,741
But you know what? I think that
probably would be the best idea.

200
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:48,314
Because, I mean, after all,
I am the "rapist."

201
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,582
Help!

202
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,987
- Try it again. Do it again.
- Christian!

203
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:02,455
Listen, Elizabeth, there's two
reasons why that's stupid.

204
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,224
One, it hurts my ears
when you scream that loud...

205
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,463
...and two, these walls, Elizabeth,
they're soundproof.

206
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,869
So no one can hear anything
that you're saying.

207
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:20,503
Oh, by the way, do you know
what "statutory rape" is?

208
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:27,049
Last year, after we left this house,
I got caught with an underage girl.

209
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,621
She was 14 going on, like, 24.

210
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:35,424
Lt just seemed fine. She was a hell
of a lot more mature than I was.

211
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,657
We only had sex once.
And, really, it wasn't even that good.

212
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,496
- Why are you telling me?
- Because the girl blackmailed me.

213
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,299
One week later I received a videotape
in the mail...

214
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:50,500
...of us screwing at her apartment.

215
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:53,475
Or, actually, her parents' apartment.

216
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,510
There was also an address to a P.O. box
for me to send my monthly check.

217
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,511
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

218
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:05,815
I'm sorry no one ever told me
I had such a hairy ass.

219
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,002
Christian?

220
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,776
- No vino?
- Where's Christian?

221
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:36,320
Don't worry about that.
I decided to make margaritas.

222
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,187
- Where is everybody?
- Drinking, smoking and fucking, I hope.

223
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,954
Why do you always have to be so crass?

224
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,294
My manner isn't pleasing.
Do you want me to change it? I will.

225
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,126
I can be just as prim and proper as you.

226
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:54,865
I'll feel guilty for anything bad
and resent anyone having a good time.

227
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,576
It's called growing up, right?

228
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,507
Have you seen Christian?

229
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,084
I was telling Elizabeth how we're happy
we got the group together. You okay?

230
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,719
You bitches are killing me.

231
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:10,948
Margaritas in the wintertime?
What's wrong with you people?

232
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:12,557
What? I like them.

233
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:17,720
Piper, a margarita is a summer drink.
This is totally inappropriate.

234
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,957
Tropical drink.

235
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:24,900
- Mexico is fun. I love para-sailing.
- Have any of you seen Christian?

236
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,539
- No.
- No.

237
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,970
- What's wrong?
- She doesn't like margaritas.

238
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:33,544
No, it's Adam. He attacked me
down in the wine cellar.

239
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,650
- What did...? He touched you?
- No, he insulted and threatened me.

240
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:42,551
Did he insult you or attack you?
There's a big difference.

241
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,750
Unless, of course,
he attacks your character.

242
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,558
Elizabeth. What did he do?

243
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,213
Adam?

244
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,182
Hello?

245
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,782
- Nobody's down here. This is stupid.
- This is stupid.

246
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:24,920
I never wanted to have this
reunion weekend in the first place.

247
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,632
This house is for entertaining.

248
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:32,166
Tomorrow night, it's just
gonna be me and you.

249
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,366
We'll have a nice big steak
and a bottle of Lafitte Rothschild.

250
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,408
Our favorite.

251
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:43,807
Oh, my God.

252
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:51,957
Jesus.

253
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,355
- Is he dead?
- You should know! Jesus!

254
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,830
What are you talking about?

255
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,601
When you said he attacked you,
Elizabeth...

256
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:12,108
...I guess you were telling the truth,
only you had it backwards.

257
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:18,215
Except for the note-card and the fact
that he has a hole in his stomach.

258
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,252
Okay. Take this.

259
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,784
- Who goes first?
- Question:

260
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:31,762
"Would you have sex with a minor?"
Answer: "Yes."

261
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:34,662
We begin our slide into the moral abyss.

262
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,427
Oh, naughty, naughty.

263
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:41,267
Shit, I had sex before I was 14.
I don't see what the big deal is.

264
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,235
All right. What are you gonna do?

265
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:45,901
What am I gonna do?

266
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:49,545
What are we gonna do?
I did not do this. I swear.

267
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:51,980
- Who did?
- I don't know.

268
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:57,013
Did you have something to do
with those cards? Tell me.

269
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,057
No! lt doesn't...
Why does that matter?

270
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,663
Adam's dead.
Somebody in this house killed him.

271
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:07,363
And the only one that wasn't
in the bar was you.

272
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,095
All right. Just, don't worry, okay?

273
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:17,004
Don't worry? Somebody in this house
is a murderer. And we're stuck here.

274
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:18,701
Listen to me.

275
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:24,977
We're gonna go upstairs and you're
gonna pretend like nothing is wrong.

276
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:28,985
- How am I supposed to do that?
- However you can.

277
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,588
Obviously, Adam did something
to deserve this.

278
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:38,021
Unless there's something
you're not telling me...

279
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:42,635
...I cannot think of a reason why
someone would want to do this to us.

280
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:47,671
- But what about the others?
- What about them?

281
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,142
All right, just stay close to me.

282
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:58,842
All right, as soon as this storm
breaks, we are leaving. Okay?

283
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:01,487
Here. Wipe your hands.

284
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:13,557
Okay, Benji. Why don't you show me
how you hold yours?

285
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,325
Like this.

286
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:19,230
That's good. You can show me
on the table now.

287
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,000
Did you find your rapist?

288
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,003
- What?
- Didn't you say Adam tried to rape you?

289
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:30,843
No, I didn't. I said he attacked me.

290
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,713
I think he found some porno mags
in the basement.

291
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,156
- Party pooper.
- Lt doesn't mean the fun is over.

292
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:44,092
- What do you propose?
- Naked Twister.

293
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:48,499
There are consequences for acting foolish.

294
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:52,934
Immortal... Imm...
Immorality doesn't pay.

295
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:56,701
Okay. Fine, Piper. Spin the bottle?

296
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:59,606
I really don't feel like
playing any games.

297
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,306
I didn't ask you.

298
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,576
Truth or dare, Benjamin?

299
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,148
- Truth.
- Okay, let me think.

300
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,719
I got it. Are you...

301
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,891
...or are you not...

302
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:22,362
...a raging, full-blown, butt-humper?

303
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,365
Excuse me?

304
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,805
Faggot. Honey, she wants to know
if you are one.

305
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:32,740
I mean, I don't know...

306
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:37,042
...but do Republican senators
with openly gay children...

307
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,014
...ever get reelected?

308
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:43,815
I mean, not that anybody would
want to leak that information.

309
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,051
Me and Kate have been going out
for three years. Okay?

310
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:52,630
- That really isn't an answer.
- No, it's not.

311
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:57,135
- Silence equals death.
- "Silence equals death."

312
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:00,839
You know what? Fuck you.

313
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:09,406
- That's my man.
- You guys are disgusting.

314
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:11,015
Bye.

315
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:14,078
- Want to play, Christian?
- Sure.

316
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:32,404
- Sorry about that in the game room.
- I'm sure you are.

317
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,465
She looks very happy, huh?

318
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:39,411
"Virtue, honesty and justice."

319
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,016
Christian's family motto.
Words to live by.

320
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:46,118
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:52,282
Or to die by. You know,
at least if the story's true.

322
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:56,892
Come on, Elizabeth. Don't pretend
you never heard the story.

323
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:59,463
Lt was such a big scandal.

324
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,431
Christian's polo-playing father.

325
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:08,336
Vanished after the family found out
that he was romping a prostitute.

326
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:12,000
Lt was a rumor.
The case never even went to trial.

327
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:15,207
You are so fucking naive.

328
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:19,550
Hey, wake up. They probably
bought the fucking judge.

329
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:24,179
My father's a politician. Believe me,
I know how the system works.

330
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:29,818
Supposedly, he banged that cheap whore
in this house and got her pregnant.

331
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:32,988
This isn't the time or place
to talk about this.

332
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,192
- I wonder which bedroom they used?
- Stop it.

333
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:41,636
The thing about old-money families is,
they can clean up any mess.

334
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,571
How dare you?

335
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,345
How dare I? Let me tell you
something, Elizabeth, okay?

336
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,950
I know the lengths people will go to
to protect their reputations.

337
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,089
You can take that as a threat.

338
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,598
Do you hear that thudding?

339
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:57,279
I think someone...

340
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,783
...is having sex
in the next room.

341
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:03,684
- Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
- No.

342
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:08,754
You don't think sex is fun?

343
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,659
I don't know.

344
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,956
You don't know?

345
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,767
Do you think Christian...

346
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,404
...would ever cheat on you?

347
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:21,237
No.

348
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:26,902
Do you think that he would have
a threesome with you and me?

349
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,481
No, he learned his lesson
last time with Kate and you.

350
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,515
I remember.

351
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:36,382
You know, like the note-card
and the mystery package.

352
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,283
Infidel.

353
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,851
You drink too much.

354
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:46,795
No. I just get tipsy,
every now and then.

355
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,560
Now and then, every day.
You're a lush.

356
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:53,695
That's what you told Christian
to make him break up with me.

357
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:54,965
You're paranoid.

358
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,133
You told Christian that I was a slut.

359
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,644
That only a slut would have a threesome.

360
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:06,877
- Or a drunk.
- So now I'm a drunk slut? Great.

361
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,851
Great. Wonderful. You know what?

362
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:12,924
I know what you've done.

363
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:16,528
I'm not as stupid as I look.

364
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,857
No, I think you have it backwards.

365
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:22,433
I think you don't look as stupid
as you really are.

366
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:29,166
God, you're just, like,
a fucking piece of work.

367
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,037
Ditto.

368
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,343
Stupid, I'm not stupid.

369
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:46,046
Christian, what are you doing?

370
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,943
- Okay, Piper. Your turn.
- Question:

371
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,613
"Would you sleep with a person
of the same sex?" Answer: "Yes."

372
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,420
Now it's getting fun.

373
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:33,725
- Where's Kate?
- I don't know. Why?

374
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,099
- She was the last one to see Benjamin.
- No, I was the last to see Benjamin.

375
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:45,510
Okay. Once again, another fact
that does not work in your favor.

376
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,643
Here's a little tip, honey.

377
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:52,649
Stay away from people that don't
like you and end up dead.

378
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:55,585
I'm gonna go look for Kate.

379
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:57,684
Elizabeth.

380
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:04,460
You've got this all wrong. I'm not
the person you need to be afraid of.

381
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:08,895
- Who should I be afraid of?
- Don't leave this room.

382
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,794
- Why?
- Because I said so, Elizabeth.

383
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,831
Don't answer the bedroom door
until you hear this knock.

384
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:18,943
What's going on?

385
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:22,604
- Nothing.
- Where's Benjamin?

386
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,682
He's taking a bubble bath.

387
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:28,685
Yeah? What are you guys
doing in here?

388
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:31,981
Where's Kate?

389
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:37,460
She's downstairs playing
with some of your daddy's old rifles.

390
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:44,335
- What do you think of my nightie?
- I don't.

391
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,667
Really? What about you, Elizabeth?

392
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,104
I think you should sit down.

393
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,636
Okay.

394
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:55,713
I'm going downstairs. Only open
the door if you hear me knock.

395
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:36,949
Hello.

396
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,753
The two of you are having fun, aren't you?

397
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:45,796
Just two sorority sisters
talking about the good old times.

398
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:49,126
- Christian was looking for you.
- You look nervous.

399
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:51,566
Why is Benjamin taking so long?

400
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:55,002
Would you mind leaving us alone
for a minute? Piper?

401
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:57,301
Oh, you're right.

402
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,473
- Time for a refill.
- We should go downstairs together.

403
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:07,608
We should stay here. Have
a little chat. Just the two of us.

404
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:10,255
- Bye, Piper.
- Bye.

405
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,757
You can put an end to all of this,
Elizabeth. It's all up to you.

406
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,330
What are you talking about?

407
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:25,331
We're all guilty as sin, okay?
Remember the little game we played?

408
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:29,167
I just don't think that we really
deserve what we got.

409
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,435
Sexual preference and frequency...

410
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,012
...shouldn't be a matter
of life and death, should it?

411
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:38,207
- What's your point?
- The note-cards?

412
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:44,087
Don't.

413
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,850
I know what you did, Elizabeth.

414
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,255
I know about you.

415
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:55,791
I know about you too. I know how you
can afford to live so extravagantly...

416
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,233
...even though you're broke
and officially unemployed.

417
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:03,273
You mean the money Benjamin
pays me to play his girlfriend...

418
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:07,742
...because he's scared his parents
will take away his inheritance...

419
00:35:07,913 --> 00:35:10,473
...if they find out he's gay?
That money?

420
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,678
Whatever he pays you doesn't even
come close to covering your budget.

421
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:18,050
Is Prada a crime?

422
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:24,356
I mean, I hope not. Because good taste
is so damn expensive, Elizabeth.

423
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,990
But you know all about that, don't
you? You spend way more than I do.

424
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,603
But now you've gone and done it.
You've married money.

425
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,707
Congratulations...

426
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,600
Elizabeth!

427
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,599
No.

428
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:12,908
Damn it.

429
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,944
Oh, my God.

430
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,489
Oh, my God!

431
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,287
Shit!

432
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,942
Your turn, Adam.

433
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:56,210
All right, the question is,
"Would you have a threesome?"

434
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,083
The answer is yes.

435
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,452
- Two girls, one guy?
- Does it matter?

436
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,856
Mr. Right-Wing Conservative there...

437
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:06,555
...looks like he might think
two girls would be fun.

438
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,992
Elizabeth.

439
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:11,966
Elizabeth.

440
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,305
Elizabeth!

441
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:23,147
Elizabeth!

442
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:26,540
Elizabeth, open up.

443
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,912
Elizabeth, hurry!

444
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,082
Elizabeth!

445
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,299
Don't shoot your eye out.

446
00:39:30,476 --> 00:39:34,071
- What are you doing?
- Having a smoke.

447
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:36,746
Do you want one?

448
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,248
Oh, that's right, you don't smoke.

449
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,979
Good girls and vices
just don't mix, do they?

450
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:46,352
Where's Christian?
I heard a gunshot. What happened?

451
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:49,961
- Hair trigger, could've been killed.
- You still might.

452
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:54,259
I'll give you 10 seconds to tell me
where he is before I shoot you.

453
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,699
- Ten, nine, eight, seven...
- Don't pretend like you don't know.

454
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:01,502
- ...six, five...
- You know where he is.

455
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:06,373
- ...four, three, two, one.
- You guys murdered Adam and Benjamin!

456
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:12,943
I'd have told you it wasn't loaded
if you'd have asked.

457
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:16,087
Now, let's play a new game, okay?

458
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:21,056
You're not the one with the loaded gun,
so you're not calling the shots now.

459
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:26,391
Oh, I made a pun. I am feeling
very charitable at the moment...

460
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:31,696
...so I'll help you find Christian
if you play this game with me, okay?

461
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,000
- Then you won't find Christian.
- You've already killed him too.

462
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:38,268
Christian is alive and well.

463
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:42,813
But I'm gonna tell you some
information. I haven't killed anyone.

464
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,480
Yet.

465
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,386
Let's play the game.

466
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,689
Put this on.

467
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:56,818
Elizabeth, this is how the game
is played. Put it on.

468
00:40:57,396 --> 00:41:01,162
You'll try and find Christian.
As you're getting closer...

469
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,029
...I'm gonna say
"warm, " "warmer, " "hot."

470
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:09,334
When you go in the wrong direction,
I'll give a "cold, " "colder, " "dead."

471
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,100
You got it?

472
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:14,039
I'm gonna get you for this.

473
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,176
You already have, Elizabeth.

474
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,875
- You already have.
- What are you talking about?

475
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:24,580
You'll find out soon enough.
Okay, let's play.

476
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:28,124
Cold. Cold. Cold.
I'm losing my patience.

477
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:31,592
Okay, why don't I cheat for you.
Turn to the right.

478
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:36,792
There you go. Step to the side.
Another one. Go forward.

479
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:38,897
Forward.

480
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:44,071
Open the door.

481
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,273
There you go.

482
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,018
Forward.

483
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:58,147
- Hurry. Hurry, hurry.
- I can't go any faster.

484
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:02,054
You afraid you might fall and go boom?
That would be awful.

485
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:04,718
Lt would also be a fucking accident.

486
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,422
Elizabeth, relax.

487
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,467
If I wanted to kill
you, I'd have done it much earlier.

488
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:14,572
Have you thought more about
the mystery package?

489
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,903
- No.
- Really? Because, you see, I have.

490
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,707
Benjamin turned out to be gay, Adam's
the rapist and Piper's the infidel.

491
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:27,682
That leaves us and Christian to fight
over the prostitute and the hypocrite.

492
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,185
- Warm. Warmer. Colder!
- Sorry.

493
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:35,088
- Sorry.
- What was that? "Sorry"? Wow.

494
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,660
That's a whole new word for you.

495
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:43,234
A new emotion. Way to go.
Very proud of you. Hurry.

496
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:47,266
Very warm.

497
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:52,103
- Christian?
- I didn't say "hot." I said "warm."

498
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:56,043
Why are you doing this?
What did they ever do to you?

499
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:59,343
That's a good question.
Ever asked yourself that?

500
00:42:59,518 --> 00:43:02,510
What have they ever done
to you, Elizabeth?

501
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:06,784
But then, this is all just a big,
fun, happy game, isn't it?

502
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,392
Warmer.

503
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,990
I think you've done it. Hot.

504
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:17,529
Oh, my God!

505
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:26,142
- What are you doing?
- Taking her body downstairs.

506
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:28,506
We have to do something with her.

507
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,444
She killed everyone. Everyone's dead.

508
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:34,677
Yeah. I guess you might want this.

509
00:43:35,187 --> 00:43:38,020
Question:
"Would you have sex for money?"

510
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:41,090
Answer: "Yes."

511
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:46,120
I like sex. Okay?
That does not make me a hooker.

512
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:48,789
Lt also doesn't make me a bitch.

513
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,965
What's going on, Christian?

514
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,733
We have to do something
about these bodies.

515
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:58,342
- Why?
- Why do you think?

516
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,378
You can't have dead bodies
littering about the living room.

517
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:04,448
What would the neighbors think?

518
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:08,609
- Why can't we just wait for the police?
- It's not their problem.

519
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:10,584
It's not our problem.

520
00:44:10,756 --> 00:44:13,350
In a roundabout, kind of complicated...

521
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:17,962
...for-richer-or-poorer way,
it is, Elizabeth, our problem.

522
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:26,269
I did this, Elizabeth, for you.

523
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:30,706
- No. Christian, no.
- They knew.

524
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,709
Elizabeth, they knew about what you did.

525
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:36,042
You were smart...

526
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,184
...but you were also sloppy.
Next time...

527
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:43,378
...send someone else to pick up
the checks from the P.O. box.

528
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:47,116
- Whatever they told you, it's not true.
- It's over.

529
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,589
They knew about you.

530
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,161
They planned on getting
their revenge this weekend.

531
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:57,030
But I wasn't gonna let
that happen, now was I?

532
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,639
- But why...?
- Taboo. They found out about Taboo.

533
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:05,606
That's why we all came up here.

534
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:09,543
That's why they were confronting you
with their sexual sins...

535
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:12,946
- ...to try and scare you to confess.
- Confess what?

536
00:45:13,118 --> 00:45:16,019
Exactly. They knew you'd say that.

537
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:20,852
That's why they planned on tormenting
you, tricking you into admitting it.

538
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:26,760
You blackmailed them, Elizabeth.
They found out. Okay?

539
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:31,028
You don't need to lie to me anymore.
All right? It's over.

540
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:34,934
- You won. Game is over.
- No, we won.

541
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,667
I'm supposed to think you did this for us?

542
00:45:37,843 --> 00:45:39,606
- Yes.
- Don't patronize me.

543
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,541
But that is why I did it.

544
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:47,011
Okay. You know what, convince me.

545
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:50,712
I stacked the note-cards
in an order so that...

546
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:55,622
...each person would draw the question
they'd answer "yes" to, their vice.

547
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,428
And?

548
00:45:57,596 --> 00:46:01,965
And then I set up a situation
over the past year where they had...

549
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,035
...a golden opportunity
to pursue that vice.

550
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:06,227
When they did...

551
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:10,136
- ...you were there to document it.
- Yes.

552
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,244
So you tapped
into their sexual fantasies...

553
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:16,870
- ...and you blackmailed them.
- That was an afterthought.

554
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,380
You are evil.

555
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,692
No, just poor and desperate.

556
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:32,755
All I ever wanted was to win your love.

557
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,694
At their expense!

558
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,299
They're degenerates.

559
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:41,030
An infidel, a prostitute,
a homosexual and a rapist?

560
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,536
You were always the good one,
the strong one, the moral one.

561
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:50,148
- They didn't deserve you.
- Yes, I know that...

562
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:53,341
...but did you have
to punish them so severely?

563
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:57,352
No. lt seems you did that.

564
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:03,158
You don't think blackmailing people who
considered you a friend was punishment?

565
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:09,062
Exposing their private lives without
their consent, that's not punishment?

566
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:15,707
Okay, that's the "why." Tell me how.

567
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,240
Adam was a horny little bastard.

568
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,005
You should know that.
You went out with him after all.

569
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,377
I paid a 14-year-old girl
to hit on him at a bar...

570
00:47:26,785 --> 00:47:29,379
...and have sex with him.

571
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:33,115
- And what?
- And videotape it.

572
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:37,787
How poetic. Next victim.

573
00:47:38,363 --> 00:47:43,767
Benjamin. I'd bet he'd pay a lot to
keep his sexual identity in the closet.

574
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:46,699
There's this bar he liked
to go to where...

575
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:51,104
...nobody knew your name as long
as you were a guy and good-looking.

576
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,102
And Kate?

577
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,839
Nothing to tell, she was a prostitute.

578
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:02,611
Come on, she wasn't a streetwalker.
She had a few select European clients.

579
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:06,087
- How do you know so much?
- I know everything.

580
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,316
I doubt it.

581
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:12,896
Shouldn't you have given Kate a little
leeway for her humble upbringing?

582
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:15,359
Just kidding.

583
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,263
And my dear little Piper,
how did you fuck her life up?

584
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:25,099
Hold on.

585
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:34,712
You set up that three-way between her,
me and Kate, didn't you?

586
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:37,855
You knew me.
You knew I'd break up with her...

587
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:40,491
...that I'd never look at her
the same.

588
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:44,186
Same with Adam, or Benjamin,
and anybody else.

589
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:51,330
And speak of the devil, what about me?

590
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:54,036
Question:

591
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:58,140
"Would you sleep
with your partner's best friend?"

592
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:03,078
Answer:
A very disappointing no.

593
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:06,183
I said one thing, I did another.
I'm a hypocrite.

594
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:09,654
- But I forgive you.
- Why?

595
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,357
Why not blackmail me, ruin my life?

596
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:19,759
Because I wanted you more
than anything else in the whole world.

597
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:25,502
And it was always about you, Christian.
I wanted my family.

598
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:30,265
Our family. A new beginning.

599
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:32,602
Yeah.

600
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:36,278
Well, you know,
I think we're pretty much done.

601
00:49:36,948 --> 00:49:39,178
Talking about this.

602
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:44,382
There is just one more little thing.

603
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:50,861
- I know you're not going to shoot me.
- How are you so sure?

604
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:54,487
We're family, remember?

605
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:58,228
I just have one surprise for you.

606
00:49:58,403 --> 00:50:01,065
I promise you, you're gonna like this.

607
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,471
Everything is gonna
make sense in a moment.

608
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:14,514
Christian?

609
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,985
Morning, sunshine.

610
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,618
Christian, are you okay?

611
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,783
- Where is she?
- She ran upstairs.

612
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,452
- I'm gonna go get her.
- I say let's kill her.

613
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,825
- I'd like her dead.
- Not in the plan.

614
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:03,297
- Change the plan.
- If we change it...

615
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,335
Nobody touches her.
I will go up there alone.

616
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:11,203
Go up alone? That's a great way
to think on your feet. Very smart.

617
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:14,004
She's still my fiancÃ©e.
I'll deal with it.

618
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,443
Is this guy fucking serious?

619
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:18,711
Here, you never know.

620
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:21,878
Is he okay?

621
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:25,782
Yeah, he's okay. He's just uptight...

622
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,620
...anal-retentive, conservative,
and he's got a very tweaked...

623
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:34,322
...and twisted moral imperative.
Go get 'em, big guy!

624
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:53,544
Elizabeth.

625
00:52:23,915 --> 00:52:26,543
It's time for Elizabeth's greatest hits.

626
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:29,278
- I'm going to enjoy this.
- Nice.

627
00:52:29,454 --> 00:52:31,581
Champagne, anyone?

628
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,951
Good job, actually.

629
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:39,295
- Here's to living in sin.
- And to good girls gone bad.

630
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:43,230
We're here, we're queer
and we're not going shopping.

631
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:47,069
- Kate?
- Fuck it, I'm thirsty.

632
00:52:47,238 --> 00:52:50,366
- Something doesn't feel right.
- Lt feels very right.

633
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,103
- Come here, you little bitch.
- I thought you'd never ask.

634
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:58,147
I don't ask. I am a rapist.

635
00:52:58,783 --> 00:53:01,149
- What was the sixth question?
- To what?

636
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:04,550
The game, Benjamin.
What was the sixth question?

637
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:07,257
I've got a new question. Yeah.

638
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:11,660
Would you get naked
with your sexiest friends?

639
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,731
- Listen to me.
- You want a piece of this, Benji?

640
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:17,629
Listen to me,
what was Elizabeth's question?

641
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:19,633
You want a piece? Go ahead.

642
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:22,432
What was she trying to do with this game?

643
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:27,510
She wanted to expose all of our moral
weaknesses. There were six cards.

644
00:53:27,846 --> 00:53:31,543
Kate, do you really think
that bitch would expose herself?

645
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:35,277
- Why not?
- Because then, Mr. Virtue, Honesty...

646
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:39,446
...and Justice would find out
she wasn't perfect and dump her.

647
00:53:39,624 --> 00:53:43,253
He wouldn't because she forgave him
for his transgressions...

648
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,953
...which means he'd have
to forgive her.

649
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:51,296
I know how Christian thinks. Where do
they keep the games in this place?

650
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:55,798
Maybe in the game room!

651
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:57,202
Thanks.

652
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:04,111
Elizabeth?

653
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,641
It's over.

654
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:17,719
House is locked tight.
There's nowhere else to go.

655
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:23,161
You had your chance to confess
and come clean.

656
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:30,070
I realized they were right. You were
the one who blackmailed them...

657
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:35,435
...ruined their lives. I had no choice.
You understand, don't you?

658
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,956
Oh, my God.

659
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,683
Let me out!

660
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:48,584
Jesus Christ!

661
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:58,086
Oh, my God.

662
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:06,769
I paid a 14-year-old girl to hit
on him at a bar and have sex with him.

663
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:10,396
- And what?
- And videotape it.

664
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:15,239
How poetic. Next victim.

665
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:21,613
Benjamin. I'd bet he'd pay a lot to
keep his sexual identity in the closet.

666
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:24,584
There's this bar he liked
to go to where...

667
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,988
...nobody knew your name as long
as you were a guy and good-looking.

668
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:34,223
Looking for me?

669
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:40,170
Elizabeth.

670
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:44,065
- I don't think so.
- "You don't think so, " what?

671
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:50,002
- Keep your blouse on.
- Why?

672
00:56:51,382 --> 00:56:55,079
I'm not really in the mood, so to speak.

673
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:58,450
You don't find me attractive now?

674
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:01,023
Not particularly.

675
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,254
But you've wanted me ever since we met...

676
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,865
...the whole year we dated,
and this is your chance.

677
00:57:09,434 --> 00:57:13,871
- No, it's over.
- Lt doesn't have to be.

678
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:16,063
Elizabeth.

679
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:17,974
I'm sorry.

680
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:25,142
If it's over, then why not have one
last hurrah? The first and the last.

681
00:57:28,286 --> 00:57:31,187
Is it bad or immoral?

682
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:34,115
Not now.

683
00:57:35,259 --> 00:57:39,355
Moral absolutism's
a tricky proposition, isn't it?

684
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,727
Do you like that?

685
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:48,636
Yes.

686
00:57:51,242 --> 00:57:53,267
You want to kiss me?

687
00:57:54,946 --> 00:57:56,413
Yes.

688
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,074
Then, kiss me.

689
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:11,424
Hello? Let me in.

690
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:17,229
Guys, it's Benjamin. Let me in.

691
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:21,967
Can't be much of a threesome
with just the two of you.

692
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:31,505
All talk and no Benjamin.
You're playing with my emotions!

693
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,888
I said one thing and did another.

694
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:50,294
- I'm a hypocrite.
- But I forgive you.

695
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:53,698
Why? Why not blackmail me,
ruin my life?

696
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,807
Because I wanted you more
than anything in the whole world.

697
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:04,574
- Wait. Wait.
- I can't.

698
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:08,013
I need you to tell me that you love me.

699
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:14,523
I hope you can forgive me for this.

700
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:21,589
Not right now, please. I want more.

701
00:59:23,568 --> 00:59:26,594
This means everything to me.

702
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:29,905
Oh, my God.

703
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:53,994
All I ever wanted was your love.

704
00:59:54,832 --> 00:59:57,562
But as my brother.

705
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:08,673
- Now you...
- What?

706
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,974
Well, now you know why I never
let you sleep with me.

707
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,486
What?

708
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:26,655
Now you know why I did it.

709
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,423
And what...?

710
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:31,534
What were you just talking about?

711
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:37,441
Now you know why I never slept with you.

712
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,571
Question:

713
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:45,714
If your father and the woman he was
having an affair with had a daughter...

714
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:48,408
...what would her name be?

715
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:50,549
Answer:

716
01:00:50,922 --> 01:00:52,685
Elizabeth.

717
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:57,958
What?

718
01:00:58,129 --> 01:01:02,031
That's disgusting. I don't find
those jokes funny at all.

719
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:05,327
They killed my mother and our father...

720
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,070
...but they didn't kill me.

721
01:01:09,173 --> 01:01:13,872
Stop it, you're fucking sick in the head.

722
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,616
You got everything and I got nothing.
It's not fair.

723
01:01:20,618 --> 01:01:24,247
I wanted you, but never like this.

724
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:31,093
Now I just want what
I think is rightfully mine.

725
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:36,825
- Half sister means half of everything.
- Elizabeth, shut up. Okay?

726
01:01:37,201 --> 01:01:39,897
It's fucking psycho. It's not funny.

727
01:01:40,304 --> 01:01:44,707
It's gonna be fun telling
the newspapers and the TV stations.

728
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,345
Everyone's gonna know
about you and your family.

729
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:51,945
I waited years to find out
who my family was.

730
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:55,916
When I found out, I had no choice
but to go in for the kill.

731
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:01,023
I'm really sorry your mom had to die,
but an eye for an eye.

732
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:03,989
And, now, we pretend here...

733
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:08,655
I swear she's fucking psycho.
You're fucking crazy, you know that?

734
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:12,997
To think, you, of all people, will
have their reputation destroyed.

735
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,799
- Tell me you're fucking lying to me.
- I can't.

736
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:21,035
Fucking say it!
You're lying to me. Tell me!

737
01:02:21,245 --> 01:02:22,769
Elizabeth?

738
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,472
- It's the truth, Christian.
- No, it's not.

739
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:31,015
I've got the proof inside me.

740
01:02:31,555 --> 01:02:34,251
I should just kill you right now.

741
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:38,451
That would make an even
better story, if you killed me.

742
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,963
You can't get away with this, Christian.

743
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,805
But, on the other hand, I could
keep my mouth shut and we could...

744
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,405
...live happily ever after.

745
01:03:09,293 --> 01:03:12,956
We're the only ones
that need to know about this.

746
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,190
Just you and me.

747
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,732
Just you and me.

748
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,952
Just you and me.

749
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:43,791
Knock, knock.

750
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:50,160
People, you're supposed
to say, "Who's there?"

751
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:55,267
Who's there?

752
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,031
Homo.

753
01:03:59,477 --> 01:04:03,641
Christian, work with me.
You're supposed to say, "Homo, who?"

754
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:10,152
What is it? Fag season?

755
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:19,359
- You go look.
- I'm in the shower.

756
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:25,495
You know, if Christian shot him, good.
I'm gonna stay right here.

757
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:28,604
- Well, what if she shot him?
- Even better.

758
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:34,338
- Fuck them both.
- You're just a pussy.

759
01:04:35,513 --> 01:04:37,003
Okay, I'm a pussy. Fine.

760
01:04:37,181 --> 01:04:39,775
Get some wine while you take a look.

761
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:44,478
You know, generally, Pipes, you ask
for favors before you put out.

762
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:48,614
That was a warm-up, an hors d'oeuvre,
a snack, a nibble.

763
01:04:48,826 --> 01:04:51,761
All right, I get the point.
But listen...

764
01:04:51,962 --> 01:04:55,261
...don't you fuck anybody else
while I'm gone.

765
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:57,491
You'd better hurry.

766
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:29,799
- And Kate?
- Nothing to tell, she's a prostitute.

767
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,664
She wasn't a streetwalker.
She had a few select Eu...

768
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:02,225
Hey, Christian. Hello.

769
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:06,964
Jesus Christ.

770
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,574
Hey, buddy, she got you good, huh?
You might need some stitches...

771
01:06:11,775 --> 01:06:13,970
...you fucking idiot.

772
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,612
Oh, God.

773
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:23,009
Hi, Benji.

774
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,683
Jesus.

775
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,523
I know what you've been
wanting, you fruitcake.

776
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:36,490
Hey.

777
01:06:39,637 --> 01:06:43,266
Jesus, did you hear that
gunshot a few minutes ago?

778
01:06:45,075 --> 01:06:48,567
- I dropped the gun.
- All right, okay, great.

779
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:52,738
Did you take care of Elizabeth?

780
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:56,944
- You could say that.
- No, you could say that.

781
01:06:57,154 --> 01:07:01,818
I'd hate for our scheme to fall
apart because the psycho got away.

782
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,621
- She's not going anywhere.
- All right.

783
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:09,265
Perfect, but...

784
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:14,631
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some
important business to take care of.

785
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:27,506
Oh, I got soap in my eyes.

786
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:33,356
Adam, baby, can you give me a towel?

787
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,586
Is that you?

788
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:40,289
Adam, I really need a towel.

789
01:07:40,965 --> 01:07:44,457
I can't see a damn thing
and it really hurts.

790
01:07:44,635 --> 01:07:46,569
Adam.

791
01:07:47,137 --> 01:07:48,764
Sorry.

792
01:07:49,173 --> 01:07:51,334
Christian, is that you?

793
01:07:51,508 --> 01:07:52,770
In the flesh.

794
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:56,276
- Where's Adam?
- I think it's called a "fuck and run."

795
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,313
Like all the others.

796
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:02,408
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

797
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,953
Why don't you reach out and touch someone?

798
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:10,985
You're cold.

799
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:15,497
You know what they say,
"Warm heart, cold gun."

800
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:20,667
- Why do you have a gun?
- I use it for killing people.

801
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:23,466
- Well, put it away.
- Aren't we bossy.

802
01:08:26,543 --> 01:08:29,842
What's wrong? What do you need?

803
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:31,236
Huh?

804
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:35,010
- You, you're scaring me.
- I'm sorry.

805
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:39,053
You want me to take you out
for dinner and make up for it?

806
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:42,715
- Just hand me a towel, okay?
- Okay.

807
01:08:45,262 --> 01:08:49,255
Hold your horses. Don't get
your panties in a bunch.

808
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:56,905
Think you're so great because you're
rich. You were lucky to have me.

809
01:08:57,107 --> 01:09:02,238
And judging from your attitude, you'd
be lucky to get a little pleasure.

810
01:09:02,413 --> 01:09:07,476
God knows this little choir boy
bullshit's gonna make you blow one day.

811
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:11,416
You'll never do better than me.
I mean, look at Elizabeth...

812
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:14,250
...you picked a real winner there.

813
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:52,420
Fucking perfect.

814
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:16,980
Kate.

815
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:21,687
- Stay there, Elizabeth.
- No, it's not me that's doing this.

816
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:23,621
- It's Christian.
- Shut up!

817
01:10:24,928 --> 01:10:29,524
I found Adam and Benjamin.
I saw the old note-cards.

818
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,932
I know, and I'm sorry, but I'm not
the one that's doing this.

819
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,510
Would you sleep
with a relative, Elizabeth?

820
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:43,612
So now you're just gonna kill all of us?

821
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,043
No.

822
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:47,683
- Elizabeth!
- No, Kate, stop it. No!

823
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:08,963
Do you want to break, honey, or should I?

824
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:13,872
I'll do it.

825
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,746
How's your steak?

826
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:25,580
Delicious.

827
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:32,421
And the polenta?

828
01:11:32,963 --> 01:11:34,089
It's good.

829
01:11:38,368 --> 01:11:39,858
And the wine.

830
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:46,205
It's Lafitte Rothschild, 1954.
The year that our father was born.

831
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:51,011
- The wine's perfect.
- It's your favorite, isn't it?

832
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:53,716
Yes.

833
01:11:58,755 --> 01:12:02,282
- To my incestuous sister.
- Don't say that.

834
01:12:12,669 --> 01:12:15,467
Oh, God, it's delightful.

835
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:21,074
Have another sip.

836
01:12:22,913 --> 01:12:28,317
Savor a wine like this, because you
never know when you're gonna have it.

837
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:34,081
Do you remember last year
when you said that...

838
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:37,318
...I believed in principles,
but I didn't have them?

839
01:12:37,494 --> 01:12:39,928
- Yes.
- Well, do you still think that?

840
01:12:40,097 --> 01:12:43,658
- Why?
- Because...

841
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:48,234
...I want to do the right thing.

842
01:12:50,874 --> 01:12:55,811
I would hate to think that our family
has lost what we most cherish:

843
01:12:56,013 --> 01:13:01,178
- Virtue, honesty and justice.
- Then do the right thing.

844
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:11,794
- Well, what would that be, exactly?
- Giving me half of everything you have.

845
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:19,568
I would, but you're illegitimate...

846
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,433
...and you know how
I feel about such things.

847
01:13:28,178 --> 01:13:29,645
Then marry me.

848
01:13:34,851 --> 01:13:37,945
Both of us are guilty, Christian.

849
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,157
Yes, we are.

850
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,960
We are both guilty.

851
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,023
Guilty as charged.

852
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:50,290
To both of us.

853
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,297
Cheers.

854
01:14:01,912 --> 01:14:04,039
It's agreed...

855
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:07,213
...we're both guilty.

856
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:12,415
And the guilty must pay.

857
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,153
We don't have to.

858
01:14:21,932 --> 01:14:25,197
That would make me a hypocrite.

859
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:28,432
You are a hypocrite, Christian.

860
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:31,271
No, I'm not!

861
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:35,605
I'm a man of my word.

862
01:14:47,391 --> 01:14:49,757
You poisoned me?

863
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,797
How could you kill me?

864
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,338
I thought you'd be honored.

865
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:09,273
Being murdered is one of our family's
oldest traditions, after all.

866
01:15:10,013 --> 01:15:13,107
You can ask our father when you see him.

867
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,914
We're no better than him, Elizabeth.

868
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:24,391
We failed our family.

869
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:29,458
What's gonna happen?

870
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,532
Well...

871
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:39,439
...in a few more seconds, you won't
be able to get a breath at all...

872
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:45,405
...then you'll lose consciousness and
you'll float away to never-never land.

873
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,322
It's the best way to go.

874
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,117
Trust me.

875
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:03,828
No, I mean, what's gonna happen to you?

876
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,592
Good night.
