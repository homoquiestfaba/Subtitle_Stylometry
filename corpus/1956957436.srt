Why don't you try giving us
something funny?

1027
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:59,611
Okay, so I'm from Ohio.

1028

- Boo.
- Come on.

1029
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:05,350

'Cause I want to be prepared.

They're performing with Billy G.

Alright.

1061
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:17,289
What the fuck?

1062
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:22,528
Did you eat my éclair?

1063
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,532
Yes.

1064
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:29,134
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't know it was yours.

1065
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,402
I can just go get another one.

1066
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:32,504

go get another one for you?

Always good to see you, buddy.

1069
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,309
Was it at Wrigley's Donuts?
I'm so sorry. I really didn't...

1070
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:40,212

he was yelling at you.

online too, dawg.

Oh, come...
That is uncalled for.

- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

Okay, maybe just
change the channel.

- Yeah, of course.
- Course.

1101
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,614
RANDY: He ate the only thing
I wanted in that box of donuts.

1102
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:50,582
I looked forward to it all week.

early to do press.

- Sure thing.
- Will.

Well, I-I didn't know
he was going to get...

1124
00:50:45,638 --> 00:50:48,641
That was live on the radio.
The whole city heard it.

1125
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:50,208
This is my business.

1126
00:50:50,242 --> 00:50:52,344
And you made my business
look really bad.

1127
00:50:52,377 --> 00:50:54,479
Well, I thought maybe
I was just making myself

1128
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:57,784
- look really bad and...
- And you're working at my club,

1129
00:50:57,817 --> 00:51:00,753
hence my club looks bad.

Eh, just have some great sets.

1133

into the city tomorrow

1138
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,545
and hit up that Warhol Museum?

00:51:26,578 --> 00:51:27,914

So there's coleslaw and fries
inside of the sandwich?

1142
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,353
How did you find this place?

1143
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,289
Well, when you're on the road
40 weeks a year,

1144
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:38,825
you get to know the spots.

1145
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:42,294
Philly, Geno's cheese steaks.
Cinci, Skyline chilli.

1146
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:43,963
D.C., Ben's Chili Bowl.

1147
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:46,632
San Jose, Original Joe's.

1148
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,902
Plus there's
a lot of ass in here.

1149
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:52,437
- She is so hot.
- I think she can hear you.

1150
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,306
Oh, I hope so.

1151
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:56,008
How about you? How do you write?

1152
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:57,810
CHRIS: Well, I think of
something that I think is funny,

1153
00:51:57,844 --> 00:51:59,544
and then I go on stage
and I talk about it.

1154
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:00,713
And then I talk
until they laugh.

1155
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,982
- That's it. Easy.
- That's brave.

1156
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:04,984
I-I don't know if I can
trust myself that much.

1157
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:06,719
I need to plan everything out.

1158
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:08,721
Well, look, I got three weeks
left on the road,

1159
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:11,289
and then I am moving to L.A.,
baby.

1160
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:12,658
- L.A.?
- CHRIS: Mm-hmm.

1161
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:13,893
Why not New York City?

1162
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,996
So you make 50 bucks
a show emceeing.

1163
00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:18,597
And then you're going to emcee
for a few years

1164
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:20,599
to build your way up
to featuring like me.

1165
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:22,334
And then you do that
for a few years,

1166
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:23,870
making a 100 bucks a show,
which is still shit money.

1167
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:25,604
And then you're going
to want to headline

1168
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:27,039
to make the big bucks, right?

1169
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:29,008
Well, nobody's going to
book you to headline

1170
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,643
unless you've got a TV credit.

1171
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:31,944
And you don't get a TV credit

1172
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:34,412
unless you go to New York
or L.A.

1173
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,982
And L.A. has sunshine.

1174
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:38,684
Plus L.A.'s the big show, okay?
And I'm ready for it.

1175
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:41,721
Get me an agent,
be seen, kill it.

1176
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:44,489
Then you got fuck you money.
It's mailbox money, okay?

1177
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:47,927
You get a Lambo,
pussy all the time.

1178
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,929
That's it. What about you?
What's your plan?

1179
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:51,898
I just recently
went all in on stand-up.

1180
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:54,100
So that's why this weekend
is so important to me.

1181
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:56,636
I'm hoping Chip
will book me again.

1182
00:52:56,669 --> 00:52:58,037
Hey, ever work
with Billy G before?

1183
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,839
Once, a long time ago.

1184
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:01,473
Look, I liked that dude
when I was a kid,

1185
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:04,076
but he hasn't done shit
in what, 15 years?

1186
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,577
Well, I think he's incredible.

1187
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,647
Look, Will, I get it.

01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:53,879
We watched stand-up.
We watched Eddie Murphy,

1355
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:55,547
we watched you,
we watched Billy G.

1356
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:59,084
Like, when I was 8 years old,
that was, like, my shit, man.

1357
01:00:59,118 --> 01:01:01,487
- BILLY: Yeah.
- And, I mean,

1358
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,523
I've always wanted
to be a stand-up.

1359
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:07,259
I just... I just love it.

1360
01:01:07,293 --> 01:01:09,862
How much you work a night?

1361
01:01:09,895 --> 01:01:11,997
I do like a 12-minute set.

1362
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:15,901
12 minutes? That's it?

1363
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,303
So how much time
do you think

1364
01:01:17,336 --> 01:01:20,572
that the people
who come see our shows work?

1365
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:23,242
Every week? What do you
think they work a day?

1366
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,511
- Eight hours a day?
- Eight hours.

1367
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:27,579
- Yeah.
- Five days a week.

1368
01:01:27,613 --> 01:01:31,383
Alright, so now do you think
that you deserve a shot

1369
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:33,485
before you go and do 12 minutes?

1370
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,621
When somebody's been
working all week?

1371
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:37,589
If you put it that way,
no, I guess not.

1372
01:01:37,623 --> 01:01:39,892
No, you do not deserve a shot.

1373
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:41,560
You want to be a party guy,

1374
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:43,929
turn up, as the kids say...

1375
01:01:43,962 --> 01:01:45,030
that's what y'all say, right?

1376
01:01:45,064 --> 01:01:46,565
"I'm going to turn up."

1377
01:01:46,598 --> 01:01:48,400
And that's fine.
You know, some people come down,

1378
01:01:48,434 --> 01:01:50,469
that's all they want to do
is have a good time,

1379
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:53,405
hang out in the green room,
get laid, you know?

1380
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:55,240
And eat some Cheetos.

1381
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:57,109
But you got to respect
that audience.

Yeah, I'm actually working on
this bit. So it's about...

1405
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:54,099
Look, I don't want to hear
about your bits.

I don't want to hear
about your bits.

You got a new bit, great.

But don't...
don't tell me about no bits.

Okay.

1411
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:06,178
So you want to know
when do you become a comic?

1412
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:08,313
Most young kids, they believe

1413
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,315
it's about when they
a headliner, right?

1414
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:13,051
Even being a headliner
don't mean you a comic.

1415
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,487
When you find
your own point of view,

1416
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:18,257
get your own voice,
get selfish with that shit.

1417
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,693
Get... Say stuff that means
something to you on the inside

1418
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:22,194
and make you laugh.

1419
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:24,664
Larry the Cable Guy. Gaffigan.

1420
01:03:24,697 --> 01:03:26,331
Chris Rock. Katt Williams.

1421
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:28,967
When I say these names,
you can already envision

1422
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:30,402
- their audience, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1423
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:32,337
That's 'cause
they talking to their audience.

They audience find them.
That's what you got to do.

1425
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,208
Find your voice.

1426
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:40,012
You find your voice,
your audience will find you.

1427
01:03:40,045 --> 01:03:44,049
And that's when
you're a comedian.

1428
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:45,451
What about you?

1429
01:03:45,484 --> 01:03:47,519
The funny thing is
when I first started this,

1430
01:03:47,553 --> 01:03:51,089
I used to think
that I had to make them laugh

1431
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:53,091
so that I could feel good.

1432
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:57,095
But over time, I realized
that I make them laugh

1433
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:59,331
so that they feel good.

1434
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:01,433
It's the best job in the world.

Go on. Go on.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1697

go ahead on.

Bye. Bye. Who gives a damn?

1699

You saw me.
It went terrible.

1700
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:22,975
You actually should
be proud of yourself.

Y-You going quick.

1702
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:26,345
You... You... You actually quit
your job, man.

1703
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:28,047
Quit your job,
drove your ass down here.

1704

Been getting on the stage.
You're actually doing it.

1705
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,751
One, two bad shows,
and now that's it.

1706
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:34,019
That's all it take?

1707
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:36,055
Ain't the last no
you going to get.

1708
01:16:36,088 --> 01:16:37,489
You're going to hear
a whole avalanche

1709
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:39,391
of no's you stay
in this business.

1710
01:16:39,425 --> 01:16:41,827
There's going to be shows
that you want going to be a no.

1711
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,229
You're going to get shows
that you're hired on,

1712
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:45,197
they're going to fire you.

1713
01:16:45,231 --> 01:16:47,466
You're going to have things
that your friends book

1714
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:49,134
that you thought
you should book

1715
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:50,903
because you believe
you funnier than they are.

1716
01:16:50,936 --> 01:16:52,171
You're going to
write a new joke,

1717
01:16:52,204 --> 01:16:54,273
you're going to be out on that
stage, you're going to try it,

1718
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:55,541
and that audience
is going to be like,

1719
01:16:55,574 --> 01:16:57,977
"No, I want to hear
all the old shit."

1720
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:03,282
But guess what is more powerful
than all of those no's.

1721
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:05,117
Your belief in yourself.

1722
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:09,388
You know, what happened
to you last night, sure,

1723
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,257
it's the worst thing
that can happen to a comic.

1724
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:15,227
You bombed.
And in a spectacular fashion.

1725
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:19,231
I mean, boom.

1726
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,432
You in pain?

1727
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:24,370
No, not really.
Just a shiner.

1728
01:17:24,403 --> 01:17:27,873
No, no, no, you in pain.

1729
01:17:27,906 --> 01:17:29,975
You in pain, I'm in pain.

1730
01:17:30,009 --> 01:17:32,978
That's... That's what
the life of a comic is, man.

1731
01:17:33,012 --> 01:17:35,481
We take our pain.
We got to find that stuff.

1732
01:17:35,514 --> 01:17:37,216
That's what we take on stage.

1733
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:40,119
When we find that pain,
got to learn to embrace it.

1734
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:42,488
Take what's personal and
you give it to that audience,

1735
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,490
and it makes them laugh.

1736
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:49,194
But the thing about stand-up,
son, you listening?

1737
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:53,198
Is that you have a chance
to be better today

1738

This is all I got, man.
Stand-up is all I got.

1765
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,546
Then you don't got much because
you're not good at stand-up.

01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,649
I started off okay, right?

this is me telling you...

1872

I need an emcee
in two weeks in Kansas City.

1873
01:25:14,339 --> 01:25:16,876
- You free?
- Absolutely.

1874
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:18,778
I'm in.

1875
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:22,849
And I think we confirmed that
you've got my cellphone number.

1876
01:25:22,882 --> 01:25:26,318
Let's just do e-mail.
It's a little more professional.

1877

Okay, but you know you can
call me anytime you want.

1878

Thanks, sir.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1887
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:06,324
You know, I used to be
a full-time physician.

1888
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:08,627
And I was doing stand-up comedy
on the side.

1889
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:12,932
And, uh, I was always scared
to make that next step.

1890
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:15,067
I was a waiter.
It was the greatest job ever.

1891
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:17,402
I officially never quit.

1892
01:26:17,435 --> 01:26:19,038

01:26:24,777 --> 01:26:27,847
I'm going back to Golden Corral
in Tallahassee.

1896
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,050
My first night doing stand-up,
I actually did really well.

1897
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:32,685
Like, by accident.

1898
01:26:32,718 --> 01:26:35,353
And then I bombed
for like two years after that

1899
01:26:35,387 --> 01:26:38,825
before I was, you know,
able to get laughs again.

1900
01:26:38,858 --> 01:26:42,394
I was terrible. Horrible.
Just horrendous.

1901
01:26:42,427 --> 01:26:43,763
You got five minutes,

1902
01:26:43,796 --> 01:26:46,933
and I think I did four
at the most maybe.

1903
01:26:46,966 --> 01:26:48,835
And the second time,
I did three.

1904
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:52,071
You would have thought
I would have gotten longer,

1905
01:26:52,104 --> 01:26:53,505
but I actually got shorter.

1906
01:26:53,538 --> 01:26:55,942
I did some editing.

1907
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:57,542
So yeah, I guess
it was kind of hard.

1908
01:26:57,576 --> 01:27:01,413
But it was fun
because I loved it.

1909
01:27:01,446 --> 01:27:05,483
And I guess if
I looked at it logically,

1910
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:07,153
I probably wouldn't
have done it.
