00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,281
"...thirst is more powerful
than the fear of poison..."

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,976
Beyond Desire

3
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,263
Come  in.Come  in.

4
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,266
What do you need?

5
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,367
Rogelio. I'm Elvira Fuentes.

6
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,537
Don't you remember me?

7
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,707
- Oh my, so much time has gone by.
- Yeah.

8
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,382
How are you?

9
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,352
- Well, well.
- What do you need?

10
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,016
Lola left me a message,
something about a job.

11
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,423
- Lola?
- Yes.

12
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,565
Lola. Lola.

13
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,293
What?

14
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,301
- Elvira.
- Hello.

15
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,771
Elvira, you're so beautiful.

16
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,675
You were just a kid
the last time I saw you.

17
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,805
At your poor dad's birthday party.

18
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,939
Before the war.

19
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,449
You remember?

20
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,213
She looks like him, right?

21
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,757
Tell me. How is your mother?
And your sister, and Julio?

22
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,987
Well. Julio is still in Carabanchel,
but he'll get out soon.

23
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,496
My mom is still the same.
We're doing okay.

24
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,130
And your son?

25
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,035
In Mexico, since the war ended.
He's lucky he found a good job.

26
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,733
- But he's far away.
- Not that far.

27
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,833
We're getting old and
we're so alone.

28
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,939
Stop that. Elvira is here
for another reason.

29
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,810
It's a good job, I think.
Right, Rogelio?

30
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,113
Of course it is.

31
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,584
It pays 50 pesetas per week.

32
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,986
The time is 9 to 12.

33
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,252
The man lives alone, an Argentine.

34
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,158
He's a business man
and he's single.

35
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,891
He travels a lot,
business related, you know.

36
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,866
You'll do the usual:
cleaning, ironing, cooking.

37
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,971
It's a good job.

38
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,899
Can you start tomorrow?

39
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,673
Yes, of course.

40
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,245
- Good morning, Pedro.
- Good morning, miss.

41
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,315
Hello.

42
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,941
I already took the coal
to your mother's.

43
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,781
Thank you so much.

44
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,867
So?

45
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,959
It's settled. I have a job.

46
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,504
I'm so happy, Elvira.

47
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,097
Be happier,
it pays 50 pesetas per week, mornings only.

48
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,506
You're so lucky.

49
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,745
- How are they? How is Lola?
- Same as usual. The same.

50
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,913
She sends you a lot of kisses.

51
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,800
This way, please.

52
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,703
Thank God. I finally made it.

53
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,471
The claustrophobia nearly drove me insane.

54
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,739
You shouldn't complain so much,
Herr von Bibrach.

55
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,872
These are rough times for everyone.

56
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,044
You're right, Frau Henkel.
Please, forgiver me.

57
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,618
These are the names,
the most important ones.

58
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,750
I'm sorry, but we have to
get back to Madrid tonight.

59
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,159
We should take a look
at these documents immediately.

60
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,562
A good meal is waiting for us at home.

61
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,964
And a hot bath if you like.

62
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,729
They seem all right.

63
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,137
Rogelio has gained some weight.

64
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,402
He's as bitter as ever.

65
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,342
But I found them very well.

66
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,581
It's so great, Mother.
I start tomorrow.

67
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,833
This is the kitchen.

68
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,764
What do you think?

69
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,269
Beautiful.

70
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,634
Let me show you the rest of the house.

71
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,140
This is the dining room.
That way.

72
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,874
A lot of money, a lot of luck.

73
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,749
Be careful not to break anything,
we'd get in trouble.

74
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,015
Don't worry, it won't happen.

75
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,785
Okay, I'll leave you alone.
You enter the library that way.

76
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,384
It's big, but don't worry.
Lola will help you.

77
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,485
Thank you.

78
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,591
- See you later, Elvira.
- See you later.

79
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,749
"How can I tell my soul not to touch yours"

80
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,053
"How I lift it over..."

81
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,768
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

82
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,694
- Elvira?
- Yes.

83
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,273
I'm Pablo Balther. Nice to meet you.

84
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,842
- Rogelio told me you'd be here.
- Nice to meet you.

85
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,336
Hello.

86
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,945
- Do you like Rilke?
- Yes.

87
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,751
I do too.

88
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,016
Do you need me to explain
anything else about the house?

89
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,059
No, if you'd excuse me.

90
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,287
Yes, of course.

91
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,059
Rilke?

92
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,870
You think it's normal a maid
likes to read Rilke?

93
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,942
Pardon me.

94
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,617
I've finished.
Your lunch is ready.

95
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,090
If you don't need anything else...

96
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,291
No, nothing else.
Excuse me.

97
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,994
You can take it if you'd like.

98
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,069
Return it later.

99
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,336
Thank you very much.

100
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,538
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Whenever you want.

101
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,842
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

102
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,947
He's handsome.

103
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,079
Very polite.

104
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,713
Well dressed.

105
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,755
But that's easy being rich, right?

106
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,990
The library is the best, Mother.

107
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,630
It's beautiful.

108
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,431
Ours was bigger.

109
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,098
And it had more books,
I'm sure of it.

110
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,973
Do you remember how Father
would make us take care of it?

111
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:30,116
Hopefully, this will end soon so
we may have a decent home.

112
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,819
I'll go get more water.

113
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,481
- Hello, Rogelio, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

114
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,455
- Rogelio.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,461
What are Elvira's references?
The new maid.

116
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,394
My wife took care of it.
Is anything the matter?

117
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,693
No, no, but tell Lola
I want to see her.

118
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,268
She's buying groceries.

119
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,393
Tell her to see me
when she returns.

120
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,995
Sir, there's nothing to worry about.

121
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,041
We've known Elvira since
she was little.

122
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,303
She comes from a good family.

123
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,705
Her father was an extraordinary man,
a doctor.

124
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,408
The world's kindest man.

125
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,110
But he died and...

126
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,845
... the family lost everything.

127
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,684
Things happen.

128
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,118
But they're good people.

129
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,290
Very good. Thank you, Rogelio.

130
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,920
Sir, do you still want to see Lola?

131
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,328
No, it won't be necessary, thank you.

132
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,562
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

133
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,175
Good morning.

134
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,579
Good morning.

135
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,782
Great, it had been a while since
someone cleaned the library.
