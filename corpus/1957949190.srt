that's how they do it.

They wanna see how we react.

I'm not showing any radiation.

133
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,346
- [Zoe] Proceed 1580.

134
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:52,358

157
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,823

00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,820
- There's about five
of them, probably more.

162
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,670
Heavily armed, explosives.

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,903
There's a while panel truck approaching.

00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,888
(alarm blaring)

169
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
- Good evening, I'm Robert Covasik.

170
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,410
We are interrupting your
regularly scheduled programming

171
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,970
with a breaking story
in Southern California,

172
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,140
where we have several unconfirmed reports

173
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,530
of shots fired at the San
Juan Nuclear Power Plant.

174
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,280
We have been told that SWAT
teams and police are responding.

175
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,120
The San Juan Nuclear Plant
is located on the coastline

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,150
that's about halfway between
Los Angeles and San Diego,

177
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,010
and it provides nearly 20% of the power

178
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,490
to more than 15 million
people in Southern California.

179
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,980
Once again, we have reports of shots fired

180
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,070
and police responding at the
San Juan Nuclear Power Plant.

181
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,737
(alarm blaring)

182
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,723
(rifle pieces clicking)

183
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,455
(keys jingling)

184
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,268
(door thudding)

185
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,601
(light dramatic music)

186
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,895
(desk rattling)

187
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,793
- Hands in the air.

188
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,553
Down on your knees or I'll shoot.

189
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,423
- Please, if leave now,
we will not kill you.

190
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,630
Go home to your family.

191
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,173
Go!
(boots thudding)

192
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:45,711
(Khalid sighs)
(door thudding)

193
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:49,330
- Calibrating feed pumps.

194
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,780
- I got 911.

195
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,870
Uh, yes, listen.

196
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,810
We're in the control
room at San Juan Nuclear.

197
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,010
- [Technician] Initiating
pre-shutdown mode.

198
00:12:58,257 --> 00:12:59,489
(car engine rumbling)

199
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,156
(door slamming)

200
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,518
(tires screeching)

201
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,713
- [Man] All right, keep moving this way.

202
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:09,546
(helicopter whirring)

203
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:12,879
(muffled radio chatter)

204
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:23,865
- [Man] Clear the line, huddle up.

205
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:25,536
- Yes, sir!
(car door slamming)

206
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:29,786
(soldiers talking over each other)

207
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,515
- [Woman] Don't hit your head.

208
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:37,765
(soldiers talking over each other)

209
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,769
- [Man] All right, people,
we're running out of time.

210
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,050
- [Secret Service]
Madame Attorney General,

211
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,850
we need you to come with us, please.

212
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,930
- We're elevating the
threat level to red, right?

213
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,928
- When, Mr. Secretary?
- Immediately, that's when.

214
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,595
(phone beeping)

215
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:05,772
(truck engine rumbling)

216
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:08,772
(brakes screeching)

217
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,832
(door clanking)

218
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:16,490
(brakes screeching)

219
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,240
(speaking foreign language)

220
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:27,555
(tires screeching)

221
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:30,888
(light dramatic music)

222
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,899
(bomb timer beeping)

223
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:45,360
(helicopter whirring)

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,015
- Yeah, we need the NRC on their way.

225
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:48,848
Oh, I know.

226
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,453
Just, just, yeah, call my
wife, tell her I'll be late.

227
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:02,852
Tell me this is a drill.

228
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,600
- It doesn't look that way, sir.

229
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,860
- [Tom] Oh, shit.

230
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,693
Thanks.

231
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,741
- [Man] Oh, yeah, we need a satellite

232
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,812
hook-up and feed us in.

233
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:13,519
Repeat, satellite hook-up
and then feed us in.

234
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
- All right, let's get full
comm up on the staging area.

235
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,590
I need a secure satellite for DC.

236
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,420
Someone start scanning with frequencies.

237
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,800
I bet these guys are
talking to each other.

238
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,077
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, son?

239
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:23,450
- [Steve] Agent Richie, Steve.

240
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,360
- Agent Richie, I need you
to get me all the witnesses

241
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,193
you can on this thing.

242
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,610
I need specific details
like height, weight, number,

243
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,840
accents, whatever you can get.

244
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,673
All right?

245
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,660
You're in charge of that, okay?

246
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,129
That's plenty, get going.

247
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,429
(Steve sighs)
- Yes, sir.

248
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,700
- We have just gotten
official confirmation

249
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,950
from the Department of Homeland Security

250
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,030
that the national terror
alert has been raised to red,

251
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,650
its highest level.

252
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,160
The department statement says
only that the threat level

253
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,410
elevation is due to quote
"unfolding events at the San Juan

254
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,780
Nuclear Power Facility
in San Juan California."

255
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,020
Once again, the Department
of Homeland Security has,

256
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,690
for the first time since its inception,

257
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,666
elevated our national terror alert to red.

258
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,999
(police sirens wailing)

259
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:26,791
(tires screeching)

260
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,874
(heartbeat pounding)

261
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,870
- Outside of the main gate.

262
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,771
Spotting 911.

263
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:36,604
(gunshot banging)
(window shattering)

264
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:39,016
(dramatic music)
Shots fired, shots fired!

265
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,683
(gunshot banging)
Stay down.

266
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,000
- Looking at this guy, I
want this one right here.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,072
Okay, I want that.

268
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,000
I want me in the foreground,
the plant in the background.

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,833
Okay?

270
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,753
Let's get this thing going.
- I can get the shot.

271
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,220
- [Cameron] Yeah, this
Cameron Clark reporting

272
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,278
to you live from the San
Juan Nuclear Facility.

273
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,445
- Okay, ready?

274
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,493
- [Cameron] Where we've had an evacuation.

275
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,410
- We're on?

276
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,664
Some people are leaving,
and yet still others-

277
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,680
(muffled radio chatter)
- I want you to get it fixed.

278
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,568
- I don't care if their
responding to 911 calls.

279
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,373
I don't want people getting shot.

280
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,207
You gotta button this place up.

281
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,340
- [Jansen] 911's got the
plant supervisor on the line.

282
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,620
He's inside in the reactor control room.

283
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,710
- What's his name?
- Syed Kahn.

284
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,660
- Mr. Kahn.
- Don't put me on hold.

285
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,970
And do not transfer me to anybody else.

286
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,110
I want to speak to somebody
in charge right now!

287
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,910
I'm Tom Shea, I'm
Special Agent in command.

288
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,743
Tell me how you are.

289
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,020
- They're coming down the
stairs to the control room.

290
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,090
The door is steel and
I think it should hold.

291
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,960
But they've already gotten
through the one outside.

292
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,640
- Well, what's happening with the reactor?

293
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
- It is in shut down sequence now.

294
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,650
- So is it safe?

295
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,710
- For now it is.

296
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,690
- We need a tactical team
ready to go in and secure

297
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,590
that control room right now!

298
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,717
- Hello?

299
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:46,920
Hello?
- Mr. Kahn.

300
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,997
Yeah, I'm gonna try and
stay on the line with you,

301
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,850
but I'm doing a couple other
things at the same time.

302
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,640
Okay?
- I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
- Yeah, we're getting a team ready

304
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,120
to go in and secure your area.

305
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,325
I'll stay on the line with
you until they come in.

306
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,325
Is that a fair deal?

307
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,320
- Deal.

308
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,420
- How long until we can get a
force in to secure that area?

309
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,440
- CAG's on the way.

310
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,810
Going over the plan, I'd say 20 minutes.

311
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,130
- 20 minutes? I need 'em in there now.

312
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,370
Get me someone from CAG command.

313
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,870
- We've got a CHP officer
shot dead at the gate.

314
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,340
Partners inside, lost contact.

315
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,370
Sniper in the crane, several explosions.

316
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,480
We also got their broadcast frequency.

317
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,020
They appear to be speaking Arabic.

318
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,720
- Well, let me put on
my big surprise face.

319
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,230
- Everything they say streams here.

320
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,063
- Let's get the FAA.

321
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:22,830
We need to ground all
commercial air traffic.

322
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,670
We need satellite surveillance help.

323
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,010
- Hello.

324
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,060
They're, they're coming down the hallway.

325
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,513
They're outside the door.

326
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,660
Hello!
- Mr. Kahn, you all right?

327
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,623
- Oh my god.

328
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,483
They're not blowing the door!

329
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,449
(explosion booming)

330
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:44,529
(wall thudding)

331
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,612
- [Man] Unit four, east wall breached.

332
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:47,445
All right.

333
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:49,475
- They're in.

334
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:54,965
(speaking foreign language)
(dramatic music)

335
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,882
(shouting in foreign language)

336
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:05,300
(speaking foreign language)

337
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,200
- What did he say?

338
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,153
- He says they are in control.

339
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:13,597
(dramatic music)

340
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,360
- [Man] Why don't you call in a plane?

341
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,058
- So they brought this
truck and they parked here.

342
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,540
So we've gotta assume it has explosives.

343
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,513
Now, what are these?

344
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,530
- Those are spent fuel pools.

345
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,070
They blow that up and we got a huge

346
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,523
cloud of radioactive steam.

347
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,413
- Thanks.

348
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,724
And when you call Charlotte,
get her to call Jess.

349
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:48,223
I mean, they should get as
far from the zone as possible.

350
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,420
- President's been briefed.

351
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,910
Air Force One should be on
its way from Japan by now.

352
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,910
VP's in the bunker.

353
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,580
AG and Utley in the sit room.

354
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,013
- Find out who's supposed
to know about this.

355
00:19:57,013 --> 00:20:00,080
CIA, NSA, we're not taking
the heat on this alone.

356
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,380
- Right.
- Who's SAC on the ground?

357
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,900
- Tom Shea.
- No, no, Nisa.

358
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,970
- No, daughter's wedding in Ireland.

359
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,330
Shea's number two.

360
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,116
- Watch Utley.
- Yeah, that prick.

361
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,783
(phone ringing)

362
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,250
- Good evening, gentlemen.

363
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,550
- Evening.
- Evening.

364
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,760
- NRC is recommending a five
mile evacuation for now.

365
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,790
Local law and media already have it.

366
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,850
- Right now, we have to assume these guys

367
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,970
are melting the reactor.

368
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,620
- We're pulling plans as fast we can.

369
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,420
You just focus on your end.

370
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,105
- They're telling me Tom Shea is on this?

371
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,010
- Nisa's out of town.

372
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,240
Shea's SAC on the ground.

373
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,073
- Shea?

374
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:32,150
Tom Shea who punched out the
under-secretary in Yemen?

375
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,370
- He was not pleased when they shut down

376
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,080
the Cole investigation, yes.

377
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,913
- Well, do we trust this guy?

378
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,270
- Unless we get someone else in there,

379
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,668
he's Special Agent in charge.

380
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:39,890
- Well, if you're gonna
pull him, do it now.

381
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,723
We get in the middle of this thing

382
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:43,410
and the public finds out
that we've switched command,

383
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,550
not gonna reassure 'em.

384
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,403
- Agent Hall?

385
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,410
- He speaks the language.

386
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,070
His father worked for an oil company,

387
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,300
so he did most of his
elementary school in Dubai.

388
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,600
He knows these people.

389
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,150
And he's our guy on the ground.

390
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,370
- It's your call, Madame Attorney General.

391
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,660
Okay, defenses on site.

392
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,390
State and Langley are
checking sponsorship.

393
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,130
Treasury's doing economic impact.

394
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,750
National Guard's being stationed around

395
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,490
all national nuclear facilities.

396
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,330
White House, Capitol, Pentagon

397
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,549
are the class A targets,
including federal buildings.

398
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,882
(light dramatic music)

399
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,270
- Come over here.

400
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,548
(Zoe hushes)

401
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,131
(Zoe grunting)

402
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,720
Come on, Manolo, you gotta help me.

403
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,590
Okay, that's it.

404
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,906
You're all right. Here we go.

405
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:01,005
We're going back.

406
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:01,838
Okay, come on Manolo.

407
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:02,820
Come on, that's all right.

408
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,653
I gotcha.

409
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:04,540
Try to help me out here.

410
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,515
I'm gonna try and lay you down, okay?

411
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:07,945
Here we go.

412
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:09,110
Here we go. Easy, easy, easy.

413
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,963
Okay, okay.

414
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,820
You're gonna be all right.

415
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,430
- The president has cut short his trip

416
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,740
from Japan and is returning
to the United States

417
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,710
with F-15 fighter escorts.

418
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,700
We are told he will
make no public statement

419
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,770
until he lands, but that
he is in constant contact

420
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,960
with all senior government officials.

421
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,260
Meanwhile, here we know
that the National Guard

422
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,690
has been dispatched to secure

423
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,060
all nuclear facilities in the country.

424
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,893
- [Tim] That's right Robert.

425
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,210
In additional, all nuclear power plants

426
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,300
have been ordered to shut down,

427
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,030
resulting in power brownouts and blackouts

428
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,910
from coast to coast, particularly
affecting the Northeast.

429
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,020
It's important to keep in mind

430
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,050
that these are to be expected-

431
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,670
- I'm sorry to interrupt
you right here, Tim.

432
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,730
But we do have an update
now about evacuations

433
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,100
to give our viewers.

434
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,270
We are now being told that the

435
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,740
Department of Homeland Security
has ordered an evacuation

436
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,350
of all nonessential personnel
within a five mile radius

437
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,390
of the San Juan Nuclear Plant.

438
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,420
Now, nonessential personnel would mean

439
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,360
that all citizens who are not under

440
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,270
the Homeland Security
umbrella, police officers

441
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,680
and firefighters would
be under that umbrella.

442
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,410
But all citizens within a five mile radius

443
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,090
of the San Juan Nuclear Plant

444
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,870
are now asked to evacuate immediately.

445
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,200
You can see the area up
there on your screens.

446
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,840
This does include the
entire city of San Clemente

447
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
to the north down to the Agra
freeway exit to the south.

448
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,660
So if you are in that area,

449
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,980
you are asked to go
immediately to your vehicles.

450
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,420
Do not wait to collect any personal items.

451
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,870
Please go to your vehicles
and head to a main road

452
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,240
where we are told that you will be guided

453
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,340
by police out of that area.

454
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,630
We have also been advised to stress

455
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,100
that this is a precaution only.

456
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,370
But apparently, it is a
precaution you should take.

457
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,637
- Do not think I would help you.

458
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,540
I'd be killing myself, too.

459
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,610
You may as well put a
bullet in my head right now,

460
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,483
because I'm not going to melt down.

461
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,880
I left Pakistan because
of people like you.

462
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,290
- Syed, just let them be.

463
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,920
- They will do whatever they will do.

464
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,806
- Let them do what they-
- Just shut up.

465
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:10,320
Shut up.
- Let them.

466
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,506
(Zoe grunting)

467
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:14,506
- All right.

468
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:19,456
Okay, here we go.
(dramatic music)

469
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,378
Put your head up just a little bit.

470
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:21,493
I'm gonna put this under you.

471
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,415
Here you go.

472
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:24,387
You're gonna be all right, here you go.

473
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:25,367
Okay.

474
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,536
(Zoe sighs)

475
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:30,119
(Zoe groaning)

476
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,815
All right, there we go.

477
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:34,938
Okay.

478
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:39,938
(soldiers talking over each other)

479
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:42,586
- [Boggs] Alpha and
Bravo, the main perimeter.

480
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:45,460
Delta, south gate, we're
gonna have an echo-

481
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,390
- Colonel Boggs, Tom Shea, FBI.

482
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,680
- We're gonna have several
responses to have options in 15.

483
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,010
- What does it look like so far?

484
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,610
- Problem is once they
got the security center,

485
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,110
they got a lock on every way in.

486
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,310
Post 9/11, NRC shut crawlspaces,

487
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,770
sealed underground piping,

488
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,930
the perimeter's been electrified,

489
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,780
the gates can stop
Bradley assault vehicles.

490
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,640
- Yeah, that's a great system.

491
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,710
It's too bad they left the
goddamn front door open.

492
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,590
So you guys don't run scenarios on this?

493
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,423
Is that?

494
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,640
- They train for insertion assault

495
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,040
on Al-Qaeda bases, mostly in Afghanistan.

496
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,390
- All right, so they train for Tora Bora.

497
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,223
They don't run a drill on

498
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,893
the nuclear facility down the street.

499
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,360
- I thought that was the FBI's job?

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,670
I know who you are, Shea.

501
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,633
You're not the only one
who can throw a punch.

502
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,410
- It's good to be working
with you, Colonel Boggs.

503
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,275
- Where were we?

504
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,543
- [Zoe] Dispatch 1580.

505
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,323
Dispatch 1580.

506
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:41,620
(Manolo wheezing)

507
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,420
- Yeah, is five miles enough of an evac

508
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,957
if the thing is melting down?

509
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,450
- No, if it's melting down,

510
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,923
no evac's gonna make a difference.

511
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,060
- 'Cause the NRC can't give
us any straight answers

512
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,267
on how much info these guys could have.

513
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:55,190
- That's 'cause most plant
plans were classified post 9/11.

514
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,640
- [Jansen] But they were public before?

515
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,360
- Yeah, so basically available

516
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,662
to the world at BombOurAss.gov.

517
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,495
(dial tone dinging)

518
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,930
God!

519
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,490
Lines are clogged.

520
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,950
Did Charlotte reach Jess?

521
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,250
- She said she was trying.

522
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,023
- Because I want her out of here.

523
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:12,740
- There's a high percentage
we get in before they see us.

524
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,140
- A high percentage.

525
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,360
If they do see it, there's a
high percentage we get nuked.

526
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,670
- They're in the control room.

527
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,780
They've got a bomb by the spent fuel.

528
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,330
- Yeah, they haven't blown it.

529
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,430
The longer we wait.

530
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,470
The more we're gonna know.

531
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,180
The easier it's gonna be
for us to make a judgment-

532
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,080
- The longer we wait,
the deeper they dig in.

533
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
Now look, we've got a
viable action option here.

534
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,600
I suggest we take it.

535
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,700
- [Jansen] Agent Shea.

536
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,793
- I'll keep it in mind.

537
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:33,640
- We got something.

538
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
- Dust around that side too.
- Here you go, sir.

539
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,263
- Yeah, thanks.

540
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,370
- Witnesses saw two vehicles
pick up Middle Eastern

541
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,970
looking men from this rental.

542
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,650
Car rental closed at 9:00,
looking for the manager.

543
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,753
- It's the Quran in Arabic.

544
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,670
The bookmark, the day of wrath is coming.

545
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,490
- Coming?
(Jansen scoffs)

546
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,460
It's here.

547
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,770
- This was so damn easy to find.

548
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,653
- This is Jansen.
- So close by.

549
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,410
- Thanks.

550
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,103
Rental home office got
a name, Khalid Jara.

551
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:09,920
(muffled police radio)

552
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,753
What?

553
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,533
- It's a compilation of 9/11 names.

554
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,270
There's no good end to this thing, man.

555
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,390
- We do not know if those
alleged militants arrested

556
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,830
in Pakistan are in any
way connected to what

557
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,150
is happening right now in California.

558
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,190
But we do know that in the last hour

559
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,980
we have seen several of these arrests.

560
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,120
Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf

561
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,070
promising to do anything
and everything to help

562
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,650
the United States in this crisis.

563
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,520
Meanwhile, in and around San Juan

564
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,250
evacuation of civilians is continuing.

565
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,510
Let's go to our local
affiliate in San Juan.

566
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,090
Mica Sultan is there.

567
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,923
Mica.

568
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:47,960
- Some people are leaving,

569
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,580
and still others are hunkered down,

570
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,970
hoping that this will all end quietly.

571
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,730
But the confusion seems
to be growing by the hour.

572
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,563
Robert.

573
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:57,430
- We've been told officials are insisting

574
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,280
everyone in the evacuation
zone must leave.

575
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,060
But we're also getting reports of people

576
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,610
are stuck at road blocks.

577
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,800
What can you tell us?

578
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,900
- The highways are jammed,

579
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,140
and authorities are
asking people to stay put

580
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,020
unless they are in the
official evacuation zone.

581
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,880
As well, they do not want
us clogging the phone lines.

582
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,280
They know that people
will want to call family,

583
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,890
however they are requesting
that we keep the phone lines

584
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,270
open for emergency services.

585
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,450
- All right, thank you, Mica.

586
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,470
And again, if you are trying to reach

587
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,050
family within the evacuation-

588
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,030
- [Khalid] Marwan.

589
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,980
- There is a Red Cross phone
number for you to call.

590
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,347
It's right there up on your screen.

591
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:33,482
And authorities are
urging everyone to please-

592
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:37,149
(speaking foreign language)

593
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:01,140
(speaking foreign language)

594
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,763
- Your accent, Kashmiri, by the border.

595
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,290
- You've been there?

596
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,460
- I've been everywhere.

597
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,090
- No, I don't want to relay
through someone on the radio.

598
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,990
I just, yeah, put her
through direct to me,

599
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,140
and let them listen in.

600
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,598
Yeah.

601
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:23,431
- [Man] Bring it to me.

602
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,110
You need to watch out.
- Officer, this is Tom Shea,

603
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,320
FBI, I'm the SAC.

604
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,310
- I'll notify Alpha.
- You okay?

605
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:32,310
- Uh, no my vest took
the hit, but it hurts.

606
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,460
And security guard's
been hit, Manolo Chavez.

607
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,720
- Is it bad?
- Very.

608
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,750
- Now, are you guys in a safe place?

609
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,543
- I don't know, but I'm,
um, I'm afraid to move him.

610
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,150
- You know, officer, I'd like
to get you off your radio.

611
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,330
Have you, you got a cell phone with you?

612
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,897
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

613
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:53,680
I'm gonna give you a
number and I'd like you

614
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,750
to call me back at that number.

615
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,583
Can you do that?

616
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,913
- Yes, I can.
- Okay.

617
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,260
- Got it, hang on.

618
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,636
(Zoe groaning)
(Zoe sniffling)

619
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,585
(phone beeping)

620
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:09,918
(truck engine rumbling)

621
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,740
(phone ringing)

622
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,870
- [Tom] Now, can you tell me how

623
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,990
many guys they got in there?

624
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,913
- Mm hm.

625
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,010
I saw four, but I heard
gunfire at the same time,

626
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,610
so I would say at least two more.

627
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,053
At least six altogether.

628
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,110
- Okay, did you happen to
notice how they were armed?

629
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,833
- Uh, automatic weapons, grenades.

630
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,070
Sure know how to clear place out, huh?

631
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,430
What's going on here?

632
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,540
- Well, that's, that's just
what we're trying to find out.

633
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,530
Hey, officer.

634
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,920
You're doing good in there, okay?

635
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,870
You're doing great.

636
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,013
- Uh huh.

637
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:54,328
Listen, I, um, I think he might be dying.

638
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,220
- Okay, listen.

639
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,053
You know what I'm gonna do?

640
00:30:58,053 --> 00:30:59,490
I'm gonna put you on with a medic,

641
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,323
and he's going to give you some things

642
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:01,880
that you can do for him, okay?

643
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,462
Can you do that?

644
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,962
- [Zoe] Yes I can.

645
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,503
- Now, I'm here any time
you want me, all right?

646
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,253
Have you got a family we can call?

647
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:13,242
- Don't tell my mother.

648
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:15,080
She'll try and come get me herself.

649
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,840
- Hey, you know what?

650
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,151
Sounds like we've got the same.

651
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:22,484
(light dramatic music)

652
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:30,642
(speaking foreign language)

653
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,131
(flag rustling)

654
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,382
(speaking foreign language)

655
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,083
(bomb beeping)

656
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,593
(light switch clicking)

657
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,640
- Well, NRC issued a statement saying

658
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,410
that if there is a meltdown,
containment will hold.

659
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,243
- That true?

660
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:13,400
- I don't care if it's true.

661
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,680
I got 16 highway deaths.

662
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,060
I got looters in Pomona.

663
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,310
I've got a mother and kids
nearly suffocated trying to seal

664
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,261
themselves up inside a room.

665
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:22,012
If the statement keeps people
calm it's fine with me.

666
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:22,845
- Yeah.

667
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,730
- Got an address from a
rental agency going now.

668
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,780
And I think they're in there without you.

669
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,770
- Agent Ritchie, I need
everything you got in the tent.

670
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,603
Two minutes.

671
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:33,473
- Do we have time?
- No, sir.

672
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,850
- The sooner we move,
the better our chances

673
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,683
are at containing this whole thing.

674
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,650
- Listen, we have name,
we have an address.

675
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,190
It doesn't make sense to move

676
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,380
before we know what's going on.

677
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,850
- We know what's going on.

678
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,120
- You said the name was fake.

679
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,770
- Yeah, they left it for a reason.

680
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,420
If these guys wanted to blow the fuel,

681
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,890
we'd all be choking on
radioactive dust by now.

682
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,352
These guys want something.

683
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,108
- If the CAG team is ready to go-

684
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,820
- Yeah, no, no, I'm not
saying kill the raid.

685
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,320
I'm just saying hold back
until we at least get

686
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,810
a sense of who these guys are.

687
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,960
- They're Arab terrorists
in a nuclear power plant.

688
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,010
How much more do we need?

689
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,843
- [Tom] Well, if-

690
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:03,850
- How long are you asking for?

691
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,190
- [Utley] I wanna know why he's asking.

692
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,790
- We need to go in immediately.

693
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,826
- If CAG on sight is

694
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:08,659
willing to take responsibly-
- Did you put it up?

695
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:09,548
- Yeah.
- Okay, good, good work.

696
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:12,080
This is security footage
that just came in.

697
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,967
Have a look.

698
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,353
- [Zutrow] Hm, how long
does this feed go on?

699
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,440
- Uh, they cut it when they
get to the security station.

700
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,840
- Colonel, are you going
to need time to study this?

701
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,050
- We will, but it looks like it already

702
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,200
confirms everything we
know; weapons, training-

703
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,210
- They're wearing masks.
- What?

704
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,320
- In every report the
terrorists and on the tape,

705
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,700
they're wearing masks.

706
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,720
Suicide bombers don't hide their faces.

707
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,290
These guys have an agenda.

708
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,320
If CAG goes in, they're
gonna blow the place.

709
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,280
If we wait, maybe we'll
find out what it is.

710
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
- How long do you feel we need to-

711
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,310
- Sorry it interrupt.

712
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,440
Carlton Mansfield, NRC.
- Ah.

713
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,210
- Agent Shea.
- Yeah, join the joy, please.

714
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,050
- Colonel Boggs, Special Agent in command.

715
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,883
Why don't you have a seat over here.

716
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:54,040
- Mansfield, we've got
the records on the plant.

717
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,320
And have you guys even run a
full security test since 9/11?

718
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,920
- We've run tests.
- Scenarios or actual

719
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,570
simulations on the ground?

720
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,320
- We are to code.
- Yeah, to code.

721
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,830
With costumes and three hostiles

722
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,160
and giving the plant
six months warning code.

723
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,600
- And they still fail half the time.

724
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,230
- Less than half, and that's how we-

725
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,430
- Okay, hey, hey, guys.

726
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,670
What are we looking at?

727
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,700
Bottom line, worst case,
what are we looking at?

728
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,610
- We're working up current numbers now.

729
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,060
But we ran a containment
breach scenario in '81,

730
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,600
50 mile contamination zone.

731
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,683
Health defects, 910,000 people.

732
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,990
Within a few miles of the plant,

733
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,323
we get maybe 130,000 prompt fatalities.

734
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,000
- Population's doubled since '81.

735
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,530
- Police are reporting
incidents of widespread panic

736
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,050
throughout Southern California.

737
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,300
Convenience stores and all
night supermarket shelves

738
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,600
have been stripped bare.

739
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,860
Authorities are urging all those outside

740
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,770
the immediate evacuation area

741
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,613
to remain calm and inside their homes.

742
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,200
As assurances now come
from official sources

743
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,530
about the safety of nuclear power plants

744
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,500
to withstand this sort of crisis,

745
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,900
with us now from
Cambridge is Dr. Jim Walsh

746
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,360
of Harvard University.

747
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,370
Dr. Walsh, thank you for being here.

748
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,660
- Thank you, Robert.

749
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,140
- Dr. Walsh, what are the
consequences of a meltdown?

750
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,120
- Well, a meltdown by any
definition would be horrific.

751
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,133
We have some experience with Chernobyl.

752
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,800
If a meltdown happens, what
that means is that there will be

753
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,030
radioactive debris that is lifted up into

754
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,240
the atmosphere and carried
for miles and miles.

755
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,940
Certainly, the folks around
the plant, the workers,

756
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,000
the emergency responders,
will face the greatest risk.

757
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,830
But others will face risks as well.

758
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,690
And then there are other economic,

759
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,910
psychological consequences, and of course,

760
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,970
consequences for the
nuclear power industry.

761
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,450
So it's something we want
to avoid at all costs.

762
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,010
- This is something the United States

763
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,050
has never dealt with before.

764
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,170
- Nothing quite like this.

765
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,090
Of course, there was Three Mile Island.

766
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,670
But never have we had a terrorist attack

767
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,210
on a nuclear power plant.

768
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,750
And so we are in uncharted
territory right now.

769
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,000
- Uh, I'm sorry, Dr. Walsh.

770
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,220
I gotta cut in here for a minute.

771
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,120
We are getting reports of
a broadcast to, hang on.

772
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,590
A webcast?

773
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,640
Okay, we are now getting reports

774
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,270
of a broadcast via the internet.

775
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,750
This is coming in live.

776
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,840
It is raw footage.

777
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,000
We don't know what to expect here.

778
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
It appears to be from those inside

779
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,313
the control room at the San Juan Plant.

780
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,850
- They're saying it's a internet access

781
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,850
on a prepaid mobile phone,

782
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,430
server somewhere in Croatia.

783
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,150
- [Khalid] If you should die or be slain

784
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,540
in the cause of god, his
mercy and his forgiveness

785
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,950
would surely be better than all riches.

786
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,360
You see where we are.

787
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,377
- [Tom] That's straight from the Quran.

788
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:51,610
- [Khalid] You see how easy it was.

789
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,900
So we ask you, are you afraid?

790
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,573
Because today, America, it
is the day you should fear.

791
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:07,640
(muffled talking)

792
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,720
- [Tom] What's going on?

793
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
- There's blueprints, manuals, plans,

794
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,380
photographs all over the place.

795
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,583
It's not San Juan, but it seems familiar.

796
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,313
With a lot of Arabic notes.

797
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,080
We've got a translator flying it.

798
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,669
- Well, shoot it and leave it to me.

799
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,150
- We will, but we got a lot of stuff here.

800
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,740
- [Tom] Yeah, why did they leave it?

801
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,090
Why leave it for us to find?

802
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,185
- Maybe they didn't care.
- No, they care, they care.

803
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,350
You got neighbors?

804
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,000
- [Jansen] We're in an evac zone.

805
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,440
Looks like the parking lot
at a Dead concert out there.

806
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,450
We're looking.

807
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,930
- Well, find out who owns the building.

808
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,443
- [Jansen] I got a lead on the super.

809
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,690
- And in addition to
their disturbing message,

810
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,110
terrorists inside San Juan
Nuclear broadcast disturbing

811
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,240
video images showing just
how easy it was for them

812
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,910
to take over one of our
nation's nuclear power plants.

813
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,390
Jim Walsh is still with us from Cambridge.

814
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,830
When you look at all of
this today, Dr. Walsh,

815
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,380
how has this all changed since
the events of September 11th?

816
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,570
- Well, there has been change.

817
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,970
And some of it, a lot of
it has been for the better.

818
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,600
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission I think

819
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,180
was slow to respond at first.

820
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,040
But eventually, February after 9/11,

821
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,450
issued orders requiring
nuclear power plants

822
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,150
to upgrade their security.

823
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,670
I think there were changes.

824
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,860
There are positive changes.

825
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,680
The NRC was taking the threat
of terrorism seriously.

826
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,710
But the question was speed of action.

827
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,340
It's not simply acting.

828
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,920
It's acting quick enough.

829
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,270
And we'll have to wait
and see whether they acted

830
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,320
quickly enough in this case.

831
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,070
- And I'm sure there'll be
plenty of debate on that

832
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,700
in the coming weeks and months ahead.

833
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,380
But I'm sure you also
understand that at present,

834
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,400
our focus is entirely on
the situation at hand.

835
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,700
So we're gonna go back now to Mica Sultan,

836
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,480
who is live at the San Juan Nuclear Plant.

837
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,440
Mica, the video images
the terrorists broadcast

838
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,500
included footage of a truck.

839
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,840
It was seemingly packed with explosives

840
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,510
and positioned in a very
specific part of the power plant.

841
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,860
Near, what I am told, are
these spent nuclear fuel pools.

842
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,080
So what can you tell us about that?

843
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,040
- Apparently the area where
they keep the spent nuclear fuel

844
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,697
is designed to withstand
an earthquake of up to 7.0.

845
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:13,420
However, no one knows
exactly how it would handle

846
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,400
a bomb detonated right at its center.

847
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm told that an explosion
here would create

848
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,290
a plume of radioactive steam
that could affect people

849
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,380
across the entire southwest.

850
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,300
One expert said that we could be looking

851
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,150
at a catastrophe on par with Chernobyl.

852
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,740
- And Chernobyl, of course,
which we spoke of earlier,

853
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,980
was the Russian nuclear
reactor that burned

854
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,670
for several days back in 1986,

855
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,490
poisoning an area roughly
the size of Kentucky.

856
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,910
In addition to the explosive
laden truck, of course,

857
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,270
we heard disturbing words,
words from the Quran.

858
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,870
- [Khalid] If you should die or be slain

859
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,140
in the cause of God, his
mercy and his forgiveness

860
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,850
would surely be better-
- How dare you

861
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,000
desecrate the Quran.

862
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,580
You think your police give
you the right to hurt people?

863
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,140
It's an affront to Allah.

864
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,320
- I'm not hurting people.

865
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm saving them.

866
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,630
- You are a weak man who grabs power

867
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,470
to make yourself feel stronger.

868
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,600
- I have fought for my people.

869
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,410
I have killed for my people, I
have watched my brothers die,

870
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,763
and it has changed nothing.

871
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,483
Today, we will make things change.

872
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,669
(Manolo panting)

873
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:25,586
- [Zoe] It's all right.

874
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:29,736
(Manolo gasping)

875
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:40,004
(Manolo exhaling)
(Zoe gasps)

876
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,620
- [Khalid] You see where we are.

877
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,600
You see how easy it was.
- Well, he sounds educated.

878
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,780
- Still working on the accent.
- Still, you got a region?

879
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,100
Well how about a country?

880
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,650
- They're debating.

881
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,270
- You know, it feels like
Syrian, but that's not quite it.

882
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,750
And Al-Qaeda doesn't issue
statements during events.

883
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,550
So maybe we're dealing with someone else.

884
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,730
Like Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah.

885
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,520
- Shit, there's over 30 organizations

886
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,110
on the states hot foreign terror list.

887
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,420
- Some of the guys jumped in.

888
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
That's new.

889
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,880
That takes sophisticated training.

890
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,970
Does any of the groups in the hot list

891
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,627
have operatives with that kind of profile?

892
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:22,210
- No, there's very little human
intel on any of these cells.

893
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,043
- We got anything on the plane?

894
00:41:23,043 --> 00:41:27,700
- The FAA says the plane went
down in the ocean due west.

895
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,280
Flight originated in Mexico.

896
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,040
But private aircraft, no flight
plan, working on a recovery.

897
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,960
But that's, that's a couple of days off.

898
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,810
- Can we control his communications?

899
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,900
- We found his server.

900
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,410
We shut down his IP address.

901
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,740
That should keep him off for a while.

902
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,760
- Any luck on the face?
- No it's in shadow.

903
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,603
He knows exactly what he's doing.

904
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:52,308
(speaking foreign language)

905
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,200
He wants us to know they're ready for us.

906
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,410
They know our protocols.

907
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,430
Pull anyone on the hot
sheets that has US training.

908
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,480
See what that turns up.

909
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,946
- [Ritchie] Yes, sir.

910
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:09,500
(light dramatic music)

911
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,250
(Velcro ripping)

912
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:15,593
(Zoe panting)

913
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:21,380
(keyboard clicking)

914
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,620
- Would you please let him turn his cell

915
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,920
phone on to call his wife?

916
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,457
Just to talk to her for a minute?

917
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,273
- Thanks.

918
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,423
(Chuck sighs)

919
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:39,526
(phone beeping)

920
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:42,193
(phone ringing)

921
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,043
Hello?

922
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,723
It's for him.

923
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:16,646
(speaking foreign language)

924
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,420
(phone clicking)

925
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,253
- Gone.

926
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:34,320
- Let's try to get him back.

927
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,630
- Well, he said we'd speak again later.

928
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,463
That's a good sign.

929
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:37,830
- Unless he's just buying time.

930
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,200
- No, these guys don't buy time.

931
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,660
The average terrorist incident

932
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,210
is over inside of three minutes.

933
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,270
We all know that.

934
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,560
Something else is going on here.

935
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,870
- My CAG teams can get in
there, control these guys,

936
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,703
put an end to this.

937
00:43:47,703 --> 00:43:48,650
- Yeah, I know you
wanna send your guys in.

938
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,810
I heard you.

939
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,240
- You think my first
move is to send my guys

940
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,380
in to get shot at every time?

941
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,690
It's my last move, every time.

942
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,270
I'd love to stand back, keep my guys safe,

943
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,600
and let the FBI wait
it out or screw it up.

944
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,137
But I don't believe we
have that luxury here.

945
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:03,150
- No, we don't.

946
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,070
They've been one step
ahead of us at every turn.

947
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,870
I'd like to catch up before we move.

948
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,063
- Sir, it's your officer inside.

949
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,690
- [Tom] Officer Cox, you okay?

950
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,000
- Listen, he's dead.

951
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,883
So, um-

952
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,420
- I'm sorry.

953
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,380
- My chest is really hurting.

954
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,140
I think I might have
some internal bleeding.

955
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,285
- That, that hit may
have cracked some ribs.

956
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:30,967
- I'm having a hard time breathing.

957
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:31,954
- Well, you know, I tell you what.

958
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:33,400
I took a hit in the vest
on time, and I mean,

959
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,790
it hurts like a son of a bitch.

960
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,240
But it's, it's not gonna kill you.

961
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,623
I can promise you that.

962
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:38,456
- Okay.

963
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:40,150
Sorry.

964
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,930
- Hey, hey, no, you're doing
great out there, officer.

965
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,130
It's just, I just want
you to get someplace safer

966
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,620
and to keep your cell phone on for me

967
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,890
and turn it on to silent,
if you haven't already.

968
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,983
- No, I don't, I don't
wanna leave him here.

969
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,962
- He would want you to protect yourself.

970
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:56,440
Wouldn't he?

971
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,643
- Listen, my partner was
just there outside the gates.

972
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,533
- He's fine.

973
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,380
(Zoe sighs)

974
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,363
- Okay, thanks.

975
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,060
- You may kill someone simply
because that person will,

976
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,010
that his death or her death
will produce a political effect,

977
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,030
which is useful for your particular cause.

978
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,880
- What do you think fuels terrorism?

979
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,520
- What fuels terrorism is hope,
not discontent, not hatred.

980
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,320
It's hope of success.

981
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,400
- All right, Professor Rapoport.

982
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,290
I do wanna come back
and ask you more about

983
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,940
the thinking of these terrorists.

984
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,000
But right now we have just been informed

985
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,060
that throughout Asia and
Europe all financial markets

986
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,280
have suspended trading at this hour.

987
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,560
The entire world focused
on the nuclear power plant

988
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,543
on the coast of Southern California.

989
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,560
- We're already getting
reports from emergency rooms

990
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,490
with people who think they've
got radiation sickness

991
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,580
as far away as Arizona.

992
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,560
- Guy in Riverside thought
we were being invaded.

993
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,500
Shot two of his neighbors.

994
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,050
I think we should send in the guard.

995
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,467
- Can't do it, already stretched too thin.

996
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,500
- The NRC says potential damage is way

997
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,980
outside the five mile zone.

998
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,080
Shouldn't we start at least
evacuating more people?

999
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,090
Get them the hell out of there?

1000
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,370
- Evacuate 25 million people
with what, 24 hours notice?

1001
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,150
You wanna run some logistics on that?

1002
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,560
- Even if we could, do you
want to send the message

1003
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,060
that half a dozen terrorists can affect

1004
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,220
the lives of this many people?

1005
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,190
- They have affected the
lives of this many people.

1006
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,750
- You want more panic?

1007
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,140
What if we suddenly find ourselves
with 25 million refugees?

1008
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,550
- All we can do is tell
everyone they're safe

1009
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,380
and then pray to God it's true.

1010
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,600
People find out the real risks,

1011
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,840
we'll have thousands dead in the panic.

1012
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,330
- NRC just came in with some new numbers.

1013
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,440
Have a listen.
- Go.

1014
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,970
- We've got a wind blowing off shore.

1015
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,390
Our weather people say it should hold

1016
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,570
a couple of hours, at least.

1017
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,310
Get a RAD cloud during that window,

1018
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,360
we're looking at vastly
reduced casualties.

1019
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,400
- Numbers.

1020
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,233
- Well, that should depend on-

1021
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:53,543
- Mansfield, plain-English.

1022
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,020
- Offshore wind, 150 to
200,000 prompt fatalities.

1023
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,390
Onshore wind, 500 to 750.

1024
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,106
Right now, the wind's in our favor.

1025
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:05,480
- We go in now, we reduce our
worst case numbers by 75%.

1026
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,180
We wait, wind shifts, numbers go back up.

1027
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,050
- Yeah, but these guys will spot it.

1028
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,310
They've been inside five hours.

1029
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,140
All they've done is lock us
out and broadcast online.

1030
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,140
You know, they're leaving
really easy to follow clues.

1031
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,520
Al-Qaeda, they're not using
the Al-Qaeda playbook.

1032
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,180
Our best guys still can't
figure out their accents.

1033
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,260
The guy, Khalid, just told
me we're gonna talk later.

1034
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,400
That gives us time.

1035
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,440
- And we're supposed to trust him?

1036
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,150
He could be trying to
melt the core right now.

1037
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,510
- And if he is and we could've
gotten in and stopped it.

1038
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,580
- Well, yeah, but this is it.

1039
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,000
Are they or aren't they?

1040
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,360
'Cause we've got two nightmares here.

1041
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,610
Either they blow the spent
fuel or they melt the core.

1042
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,010
And if they're melting, yeah, we go in.

1043
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,520
We take the risk on the fuel
bomb and we try and stop them.

1044
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,700
If they're not, we don't
wanna piss 'em off.

1045
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,960
We wanna know who they are.

1046
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,770
Now, I mean, are there, are there gauges

1047
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,060
like not in the control
room that will tell us

1048
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,410
if they're trying to melt.

1049
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,460
- Sure, but they're all inside the plant.

1050
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,600
- I got a pair of eyes inside.

1051
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,690
- I'm right here.
- Yeah, so,

1052
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,990
if you look west now-
- Mm hm.

1053
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,630
- You got an idea of where west is?

1054
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,110
Yeah, you're gonna see to your right

1055
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,440
a whole long section of pipes.

1056
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,900
You wanna follow that section
of pipes about 50 yards.

1057
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,830
- Okay.

1058
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,050
- [Tom] You can do this.

1059
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,383
(light dramatic music)

1060
00:48:24,477 --> 00:48:26,270
- [Jansen] Are you the building super?

1061
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,103
- [Building Super] Yeah.

1062
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:29,110
- [Jansen] What can you
tell me about apartment 5-D?

1063
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,750
- There's a bunch of
Arab guys staying there.

1064
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,320
But the Khalid guy pays the rent.

1065
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,000
- You run a credit check on the rental?

1066
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,400
- He paid cash.

1067
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,870
First, last, security...

1068
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,750
Look can um, we do this in the morning?

1069
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,210
I kinda got something
going on here, you know?

1070
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,610
- It's sorta time sensitive.

1071
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,910
Anything else?

1072
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,650
Vehicles, girls?

1073
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,230
- Saw him at Scarlet's once.

1074
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,120
Tried to hide, got all embarrassed.

1075
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,724
Girls are against his
religion or something.

1076
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:54,830
- Scarlet's?

1077
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,303
- Yeah, the strip club.

1078
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,502
I think that Khalid guy was
seeing one of the dancers.

1079
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,270
- Some Islamic fundamentalist, huh?

1080
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,058
Mind if I come inside?

1081
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:09,627
(suspenseful music)

1082
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:10,760
- [Zoe] All right.

1083
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,593
- That's it.

1084
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:13,040
- [Zoe] I think I see it here.

1085
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,660
- Yeah, this route, Zoe, it's
the long way around, okay?

1086
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,743
But it's gonna get you past
most of the security cameras.

1087
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,523
You can do this.

1088
00:49:25,487 --> 00:49:26,320
- Okay.

1089
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,220
- Isolated reports of looting have come in

1090
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,490
from Los Angeles and San
Diego as airports across

1091
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,490
the nation have been shut down,

1092
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,730
and hospital emergency rooms are flooded

1093
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,300
with patients fearing they
have radiation poisoning.

1094
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,020
We have been told definitively
that there has been

1095
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,480
no radiation detected in that area,

1096
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,330
and that the five mile
evacuation in progress

1097
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,790
is strictly a preventative
precautionary measure.

1098
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,290
Mica Sultan is on the
ground now in San Juan,

1099
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,090
and can tell us how the
evacuation is going.

1100
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,923
Mica.

1101
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:11,680
- It is just after midnight
and the 405 is a parking lot.

1102
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,740
And it's the same story for
the 10, the 110, and the 710.

1103
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,150
Nothing is moving.

1104
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:17,983
- Thank you, Mica.

1105
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,520
We are now taking you
live to Washington DC,

1106
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,870
where we are told that
Homeland Security Secretary

1107
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,320
Frank Utley is speaking with reporters

1108
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,230
outside the situation room at the...

1109
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,670
Do we have that feed?

1110
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,820
We do.

1111
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,840
Homeland Security Secretary Frank Utley.

1112
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,480
- Oh, I think the best
thing is for everybody

1113
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,841
to stay calm and stay put.

1114
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:38,590
- [Reporter] Is there, is
there a danger of a meltdown?

1115
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,600
- No, no, in order for there
to be, as you say, a meltdown,

1116
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,800
it would require the simultaneous failure

1117
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,308
of two separate cooling
systems, and that's simple not-

1118
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:47,720
- Mr. Utley.
- Yes?

1119
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,330
- [Reporter] Just how safe is
it in the immediate vicinity?

1120
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:54,520
- Well, a containment
dome is built to contain.

1121
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,050
And even this five mile evacuation

1122
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,540
is considered by many of our
experts to be overly cautious.

1123
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,450
Uh, we are of course-

1124
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,350
- This is not true.

1125
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,960
They know you can dump the
water and the spent fuel.

1126
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,110
- You said yourself, they know.

1127
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,383
See if they warn the people.

1128
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,410
(reporters talking over each other)

1129
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,876
- [Frank] Ladies and gentlemen,
that's all the questions-

1130
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:17,999
(speaking foreign language)

1131
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:20,832
(dramatic music)

1132
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,383
(bomb beeping)

1133
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:47,341
(suspenseful music)

1134
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,500
- Still nothing from your officer inside?

1135
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,679
- Not yet, no.

1136
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,400
- Colonel Boggs, your team's ready to go?

1137
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,233
- They are, sir.

1138
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:57,180
- We cannot go in while we-

1139
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,810
- It was a good play, Shea.

1140
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,230
It really was.

1141
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,280
But we can't wait.

1142
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,600
- We're not gonna just stand by.

1143
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,920
- We're not just standing by.

1144
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,753
We have someone on the inside.

1145
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,400
- Decision's been made.

1146
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,772
Colonel Boggs, send them in.

1147
00:52:08,772 --> 00:52:12,022
(light dramatic music)

1148
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:34,420
- [Soldier] 06 this is 21 Alpha.

1149
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,663
Baseline one clear.

1150
00:52:36,784 --> 00:52:38,317
Moving forward.

1151
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:39,150
Out.

1152
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:43,457
(light dramatic music)

1153
00:53:05,144 --> 00:53:07,894
(static buzzing)

1154
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:14,004
06 this is 21 Alpha.

1155
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:15,354
Breach general perimeter.

1156
00:53:15,354 --> 00:53:16,187
Out.

1157
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:20,382
(Geiger counter beeping)

1158
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:21,215
Hold up.

1159
00:53:21,215 --> 00:53:22,373
They're getting readings.

1160
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:23,411
Pull back.

1161
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:24,759
The zone's hot.

1162
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:26,525
We're pulling back.

1163
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:28,025
Back!
- 12 o'clock.

1164
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:31,703
- Let's move.
- It's radioactive.

1165
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,600
They're getting RAD readings.

1166
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,433
- It's melting.

1167
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,786
- [Man] We gotta help 'em.

1168
00:53:42,163 --> 00:53:45,242
(camera clicking)

1169
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:47,137
(helicopter whirring)

1170
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,170
- Satellite surveillance says it's clean.

1171
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,270
Didn't pick up a thing.

1172
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,040
- What, CAG gets radiation on the ground,

1173
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,660
and the satellite says it's not here?

1174
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,620
- We're trying to figure it out.

1175
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,709
Give us 10 minutes, and I'll
give you a new action response.

1176
00:53:57,709 --> 00:54:00,376
(phone ringing)

1177
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,340
- Jansen, what do you got there?

1178
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,173
- Not much.
- Well, it's getting

1179
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,850
pretty hot down here.
- You holding up?

1180
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,540
- CAG tried going in, and
they got RAD readings.

1181
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,170
And the satellite aren't
picking up any readings.

1182
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,450
So nobody knows what the hell's going on.

1183
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,630
- Oh, man.

1184
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,560
- Listen, I need somebody up in Sacramento

1185
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,540
that I can trust to deal
with the guys in DC.

1186
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,200
I want you to chopper up there.

1187
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,070
Okay?

1188
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,290
Bring Charlotte and Jess
if you can find her.

1189
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,630
- Tom.
- 'Cause I need someone

1190
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,180
I can trust up there.

1191
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,270
- [Jensen] I think you need me here.

1192
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,730
- I don't need you here.

1193
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,616
Look, if something happens,
I don't want you here.

1194
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:32,516
- I'm not leaving.

1195
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,685
I've got your back.

1196
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:37,470
I'll have a composite for you any minute.

1197
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,370
- If this happens, we'll
need to quarantine the area.

1198
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,159
That means a military perimeter.

1199
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,867
- Well, how many people are
we talking about fencing in?

1200
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:45,160
- Is the wind still with us?

1201
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,620
- The weather people say that it is.

1202
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,820
- They've asked us to
prepare possible responses.

1203
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,200
- Working on it.
- International responses.

1204
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,710
After 9/11, we hit Afghanistan
with about 10% of US power.

1205
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,150
Iraq, about 20.

1206
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,460
We get nuked, and the
Arab world may have to see

1207
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,003
a proportional response; nuclear.

1208
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,750
President wants to have that option.

1209
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,850
I'll be back as soon I have TC

1210
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,420
on our subs off the coast of Yemen.

1211
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,920
They're spinning the missiles.

1212
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,300
They want them hot and ready.

1213
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,133
(dramatic music)

1214
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:24,491
(phone ringing)

1215
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:31,876
(keyboard clicking)

1216
00:55:39,657 --> 00:55:41,490
- [Khalid] The more people you send in,

1217
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,090
the more people will die.

1218
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,780
- Are your hostages all right?

1219
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,784
- [Khalid] It seems we have
quite a few of you hostage.

1220
00:55:47,784 --> 00:55:48,920
- [Tom] Yeah, yeah, you do.

1221
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,030
You want to share why that is?

1222
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,970
- [Khalid] You don't know?

1223
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,610
- You're showing your strength.

1224
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,690
- [Khalid] Showing your weakness.

1225
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,630
Using your technology against
you, just like before.

1226
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,670
Showing how your government
fails you, safe in bunkers,

1227
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,930
leaving all of you exposed.

1228
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,520
They don't care about you.

1229
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,530
They only care about themselves.

1230
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:10,771
- He's on the air.

1231
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:11,940
He's on the air.

1232
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,860
Shut him down.

1233
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,210
- We can't shut him down.

1234
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,830
- Set up on a duplicate server.

1235
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,530
- Figure it out and shut him down.

1236
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,210
- Shea, get him off the line.

1237
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,310
- Well, you've certainly got
everyone's attention here.

1238
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,540
- [Khalid] I hoped I would.

1239
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,373
- But for what?

1240
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:25,460
I mean, you're obviously very smart.

1241
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,490
You're very committed.

1242
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,500
- [Khalid] They teach you to flatter

1243
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,740
like that in the academy?

1244
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,870
- It doesn't mean it isn't true.

1245
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,170
- [Khalid] Sounds like
you have some others

1246
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,003
who need flattering over there.

1247
00:56:32,003 --> 00:56:33,360
- You know, I'm talking to you.

1248
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,480
I'm not talking to them.

1249
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,823
- [Khalid] I want people to
see how America lies to them.

1250
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,453
Says they're safe, all the while they-

1251
00:56:41,453 --> 00:56:43,367
(static buzzing)

1252
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:44,284
- He's off.

1253
00:56:47,773 --> 00:56:49,483
- [Khalid] You cut my broadcast.

1254
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,533
You cut my broadcast!

1255
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,418
Get it back up.

1256
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,955
- Go!
(door slamming)

1257
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,018
- [Agent] Federal agents,
stay where you are.

1258
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,463
- Clear.
- Federal agents,

1259
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,098
you're under arrest.

1260
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:07,999
Come on, get up.

1261
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:08,832
Right now.

1262
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,200
- Yeah, so you're on your way, then.

1263
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah, good.

1264
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,477
No, no, no.

1265
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,880
No, just take the, yeah take the freeway

1266
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,980
and use my badge, and yeah, yeah.

1267
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,813
That'd be nice.

1268
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:24,600
That'd be, yeah make a fire.

1269
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,526
What's happening with the reactor-

1270
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,110
No, it's just...

1271
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,970
And our guys still, they still
can't place the guys accent.

1272
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,810
It's been, Jess?

1273
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,182
Jesse?

1274
00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:36,015
Jess?

1275
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:46,298
(muffled police radio)
(siren wailing)

1276
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,220
Hey.
- Sorry, sir.

1277
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,270
Your CHP officer's on.

1278
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,373
- Thanks, got it.

1279
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,430
Zoe, you near the gauges?

1280
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,720
- I think so, almost.

1281
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,000
- And how are you doing?

1282
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,800
- Okay, a bit better now
that I got something to do.

1283
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,810
How about you?

1284
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,861
- Oh, well, they haven't demoted me yet.

1285
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:13,110
- Like that's gonna happen.

1286
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,500
- Oh, it wouldn't be the first time.

1287
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,340
- You?

1288
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,847
- Yeah, I was on the USS
Cole bombing in Yemen.

1289
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:19,400
Trace fibers matched DNAs,

1290
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,760
got two of the cell heads in custody.

1291
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,843
Had more leads, then they shut us down.

1292
00:58:23,843 --> 00:58:25,180
Then the terrorists walked,

1293
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,458
and the ambassador cared
more about playing politics

1294
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,417
than getting the bad guys.

1295
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:32,000
- So, how'd that get you demoted?

1296
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,930
- Before I left the country,

1297
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,030
I might have punched someone out a little.

1298
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,212
(light dramatic music)

1299
00:58:41,212 --> 00:58:42,045
- Okay.

1300
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,875
I think I'm here.

1301
00:58:50,142 --> 00:58:51,592
Okay.

1302
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,630
I'm here and I'm going in.

1303
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,000
- Zoe, I'm going to put
you on with Mike Krinsky.

1304
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,900
Mike, Mike, it's Zoe.

1305
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,550
He's gonna walk you through this.

1306
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,640
Put her on the com, would you?

1307
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,390
- [Mike] Hello, Zoe?

1308
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,090
- Hello.
- Uh, okay.

1309
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,410
Where you are, there
are two rows of gauges.

1310
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,610
- Okay.

1311
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,810
Yeah, two, two rows.

1312
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,060
I see 'em, I'm right in front of 'em.

1313
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,870
- Okay, start reading me the information

1314
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,780
on the first one on the bottom left.

1315
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,160
It's labeled Core Temp.

1316
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,993
- Okay, hang on.

1317
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,623
Okay.

1318
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,993
Core Temp.

1319
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,910
It's, um, it's green.

1320
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,743
It says normal.

1321
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:28,230
That's, that's good, right?

1322
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,440
- That's great.

1323
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,290
Just what we wanna see.

1324
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,293
Just above that?

1325
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:37,010
- Yeah, um, Turbine Trip and Reactor Trip.

1326
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,968
And they're both green,

1327
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:42,220
and there's um, Primary Feed Loop,

1328
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,053
but it's way below the red.

1329
00:59:43,053 --> 00:59:46,630
- I need you to find Reactor Pressure.

1330
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,463
You see that?

1331
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:49,270
Right below the last one you read.

1332
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,103
- Okay.

1333
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,650
But I, I, I can't see it.

1334
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,510
The glass is totally clouded over.

1335
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,400
What do you want me to do?

1336
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,440
Is it safe to break the glass?

1337
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,740
- It's not gonna affect the system,

1338
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,240
but it will send an alarm
to the security station.

1339
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:05,919
- Agent Shea.

1340
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,730
- Hi, Zoe, hi.

1341
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,563
Yeah, it's me.

1342
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,920
Listen, some of our guys got in close,

1343
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,990
and they got some RAD readings, right?

1344
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,800
But the satellites are
not picking that up.

1345
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,950
Now, we're making some big decisions here,

1346
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,070
and they're really riding on whether

1347
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,180
or not the reactor is bleeding.

1348
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,013
- Okay.

1349
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,330
So I break it, read it, and get out.

1350
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,163
Right?

1351
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:32,367
(light dramatic music)

1352
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,323
Okay, I'm gonna do this.

1353
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:44,485
(glass shattering)

1354
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:47,152
(alarm beeping)

1355
01:00:59,064 --> 01:01:02,814
(speaking foreign language)

1356
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,124
It looks like it's about 1,100 PSI.

1357
01:01:07,124 --> 01:01:08,390
- 1,100?

1358
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,387
Way below normal.

1359
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,950
Everyone, the reactor's cooling down.

1360
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,080
- So they're not melting it?

1361
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,440
They're not doing anything to it?

1362
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,740
- Absolutely stable.

1363
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,790
- All right, alert DC.

1364
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:17,623
- Sir, I got it.

1365
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:19,003
I picked up radio calls.

1366
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,450
I think they found her.

1367
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,870
- Zoe, you gotta move.

1368
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,533
- Okay.
(dramatic music)

1369
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,810
- [Sam] Nine hours into the crisis.

1370
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,500
And as we await news from the power plant,

1371
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,760
the toll of the dead and injured

1372
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,160
in panic across the
country continues to grow.

1373
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,220
Looting in Los Angeles
and San Diego counties

1374
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,250
has escalated into full blown rioting,

1375
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,920
and violence continues to
erupt around the nation.

1376
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,600
- Terrible to hear, Sam.

1377
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,010
We're also getting reports now of violence

1378
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,610
as far away as Baltimore,

1379
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:52,820
where, according to our
reports from a local affiliate,

1380
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,610
a mini riot, if you will,

1381
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,530
has broken out as police are
trying to hold back crowds

1382
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,860
who are storming stores
for supplies there.

1383
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,820
And meanwhile, all the
world can do is watch

1384
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,120
and wait to see what will happen next

1385
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,600
at the San Juan Nuclear Plant.

1386
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,090
- So how could their tags go positive

1387
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,180
if there isn't radiation?

1388
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,870
- Are you questioning my guys?

1389
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,973
- No, I'm asking.

1390
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,360
Look, you made your best call.

1391
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,560
If I was in your shoes, I
would have done the same thing.

1392
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,760
- No, you wouldn't have.

1393
01:02:23,754 --> 01:02:28,160
- You know, whatever goes on
in DC, it's you and me here.

1394
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,330
So even if we live through this,

1395
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:32,370
they could still hang our asses
out to dry if they need to.

1396
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,380
So the tags, I mean, is there something

1397
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,580
that can make them turn?

1398
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,910
- There's an iodine
isotope that special ops

1399
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,570
uses in training that can trigger

1400
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,000
these meters without radiation.

1401
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,980
- So somebody uses them in
the field, they can't tell.

1402
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,930
They'd pull out?

1403
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,680
- They're trained to pull
out when the meters turn red.

1404
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,460
- Well, who can get their
hands on the training isotope?

1405
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,293
- That's not easy.

1406
01:02:51,293 --> 01:02:52,490
It's totally classified.

1407
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,250
- [Jansen] Khalid's stripper
friend, we got her here.

1408
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,083
- Copy that.

1409
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,631
- Like I was saying, totally classified.

1410
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:02,793
(dramatic music)

1411
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:05,293
(Zoe panting)

1412
01:03:26,154 --> 01:03:27,720
- If you don't tell me
everything you know,

1413
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,210
you're gonna spend the rest of your life

1414
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,823
in a cell on Guantanamo.

1415
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:40,576
- I don't know.

1416
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:43,571
- That's not good enough.

1417
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,960
- We met in the club a few months ago.

1418
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,090
I felt sorry for him.

1419
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,990
- Sorry?
(stripper sighs)

1420
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,893
- He was sick, cancer.

1421
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:03,150
So I sleep with him to
make him feel better.

1422
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,183
It's not a crime.

1423
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:06,570
- Hm.

1424
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:07,907
What kind of cancer?

1425
01:04:10,737 --> 01:04:15,310
- Syndrome, he called
it, from Afghanistan.

1426
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,300
Uranium in the bomb shells, he said.

1427
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,410
- What, he talked about Afghanistan?

1428
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,860
Did he talk about training on small bases

1429
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,293
or fighting for the Taliban?

1430
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,500
- Taliban?

1431
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,623
No, for this country.

1432
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,780
- Khalid's an American soldier?

1433
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,873
- Of course.

1434
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,590
But, Khalid?

1435
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,253
This is Eddy, Eddy Sands.

1436
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:51,850
- He's a decorated officer.

1437
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,683
- What country?

1438
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,900
- The US of A.

1439
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,403
Major Edward Sands, Delta Force.

1440
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,503
I'm betting they're all
vets, his whole team.

1441
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,712
Our terrorist is GI Joe.

1442
01:05:11,712 --> 01:05:14,350
(dramatic music)

1443
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,300
- While celebrations continue
across the Middle East,

1444
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,210
offers of help are flooding
into the White House.

1445
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,970
Canada and Mexico are
working in cooperation

1446
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,740
with our military to secure the borders.

1447
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,360
We also have reports that
Israeli jets are on their way,

1448
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,290
carrying hundreds of thousands
of potassium iodide tablets

1449
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,340
from Israel's own stockpiles.

1450
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,210
Potassium iodide is believed
to be the most effective

1451
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,810
medication to protect against
radioactive poisoning.

1452
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:44,820
FEMA, facing a critical shortage,
will now route those pills

1453
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,510
to areas throughout Southern California.

1454
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,720
- He's got a Silver Star
with oak leaf cluster

1455
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,860
for bravery, two Purple
Hearts, trained in anti-terror.

1456
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,250
He grew up in Fort Wayne.

1457
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,730
- Why all the Al-Qaeda leads?

1458
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,700
I don't get it.
- Well, for some reason

1459
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,330
they want us to believe
they're Arab terrorists.

1460
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,680
Your guess is as good as mine.

1461
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,782
- How the hell do we have
highly decorated soldiers

1462
01:06:01,782 --> 01:06:03,360
in there posing as Arab terrorists?

1463
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,250
- Well, Sands and his guys
were early into Afghanistan.

1464
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,240
The rumor is they had Bin Laden cornered,

1465
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,480
and they got word to lead a convoy

1466
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,820
through to let them escape.

1467
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,260
And it was some part of
a State Department deal

1468
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,170
for access to air bases in Pakistan.

1469
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,230
He was there, he reported
it through channels.

1470
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,063
He got reprimanded.

1471
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:19,420
That kinda thing that change a man.

1472
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,491
- You're justifying him?

1473
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:21,980
- I understand him.

1474
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,790
The terrorists that
walked when they shut down

1475
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:27,130
our investigation in Yemen,
I think about them every day.

1476
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,150
How are they gonna come back?

1477
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,560
Biological, chemical, a nuclear plant?

1478
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,340
I think he's trying to make a point.

1479
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,770
That's why the reactor's stable.

1480
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:34,890
- Do we have IDs on all of them?

1481
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,890
- They all served under Sands in Delta.

1482
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,530
- All diagnosed with cancer
in the last two years.

1483
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,013
Depleted uranium syndrome
from our own munitions.

1484
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,870
- That goes public, could get ugly.

1485
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,440
- We have reports that
American fighter jets

1486
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,940
have been scrambled in the Persian Gulf,

1487
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,010
and US battleships are already

1488
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,250
on the move in the Middle East.

1489
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,110
We are told that the
United States military

1490
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:06,190
has declared an official
defense emergency,

1491
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,900
meaning that an overt attack has been

1492
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,510
or is being made upon the United States.

1493
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:17,510
All military forces are on
high alert and prepared to act.

1494
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,540
- Where are we on their
broadcast capabilities?

1495
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,373
- We got 'em shut down for now.

1496
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:21,350
- Yeah, but he's smart.

1497
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,367
He's going to come right back up again.

1498
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:23,457
- How do we end this thing?

1499
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:26,280
- You know, I think the
truck is riding too high

1500
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,810
for the weight of real explosives.

1501
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,810
I think the bomb's a fake.

1502
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:29,643
- They can't blow anything up.

1503
01:07:29,643 --> 01:07:31,080
- And we've been here for 11 hours.

1504
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,910
We sit it out another day and a half,

1505
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,700
the reactor will be cool
and nothing will go off-

1506
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,030
- In 11 hours, we've had
115 confirmed deaths,

1507
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:41,640
more injured, shooting,
looting, this is breaking down.

1508
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,540
- Mr. Shea, this country cannot afford

1509
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,560
to wait another day and a half.

1510
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:51,041
(dramatic music)

1511
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,490
- Okay, let's do it.

1512
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,390
- We'll start now.

1513
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:59,433
(dramatic music continues)

1514
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:13,220
(light dramatic music)
(Jesse sighs)

1515
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:20,008
- Jess?

1516
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,603
Jess?

1517
01:09:24,603 --> 01:09:26,823
- Uh, I'm sorry.

1518
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:33,560
- Nothing to be sorry for,
everything to be proud of.

1519
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,787
- I, I can't make it.

1520
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:37,473
I know I'm letting you down.

1521
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,610
- We're here.

1522
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,080
Whatever else happens, we did this thing.

1523
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,913
- I know.

1524
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,214
- You're a great soldier, Jesse.

1525
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:56,073
(Jesse gasping)
- I'm a dead soldier.

1526
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,923
- We all are.

1527
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,200
We're combat dead.

1528
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,100
Don't forget that.

1529
01:10:03,217 --> 01:10:05,723
- You know, I don't even
mind getting the cancer.

1530
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,613
All I ever wanted to do was, was fight.

1531
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,563
- Come on.

1532
01:10:16,222 --> 01:10:17,055
(Jesse groaning)

1533
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:19,805
(dramatic music)

1534
01:10:30,648 --> 01:10:33,793
(Jesse groaning)

1535
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:34,877
How are you doing?

1536
01:10:34,877 --> 01:10:36,210
- I'm okay, sir.

1537
01:10:39,124 --> 01:10:40,457
- Not long, now.

1538
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:44,466
(dramatic music)

1539
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:55,779
- [Soldier] Go!

1540
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:05,967
(Zoe sighs)

1541
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:10,967
(static buzzing)
(speaking foreign language)

1542
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:14,752
(bomb beeping)

1543
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:24,802
(dramatic music)

1544
01:11:31,612 --> 01:11:34,800
- Marwan, you left your sector.

1545
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,860
- Couldn't raise Jesse on the radio.

1546
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,720
- He's not doing so good.

1547
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,553
How about you?

1548
01:11:40,886 --> 01:11:42,323
- Yeah, well I'm ready to die.

1549
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,090
- Go back to your post.

1550
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,322
We're gonna end this thing soon.

1551
01:11:47,322 --> 01:11:48,155
- End it? What do you mean?

1552
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:49,330
What do you mean end it?

1553
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:52,110
- Make the broadcast, let
people know what we did.

1554
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,350
Walk out of here and get Jesse some help.

1555
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,950
- We're not walking out of here.

1556
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,387
- I'll stay until you guys are out.

1557
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,530
- We die here today.

1558
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,273
You know that, Khalid.

1559
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,320
- Okay, listen, Zoe,
we've got guys coming in.

1560
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,270
I need to know where you are

1561
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,010
so I can pull you out of there.

1562
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:21,843
- I'm on my way out.

1563
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:24,650
- I need you to work your way
around the back perimeter.

1564
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,060
Where are you?

1565
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,704
- Primary pump LB2N.

1566
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:29,530
(bomb beeping)

1567
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,893
- Zoe?
- Hang on.

1568
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,630
I think I see something.

1569
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:36,630
- [Tom] Okay, just tell me what you see.

1570
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,333
Zoe?

1571
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,120
What do you see?

1572
01:12:44,009 --> 01:12:45,840
(Zoe groaning)

1573
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,970
- I don't know. It looks
like an explosive device.

1574
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,420
It's black, it's taped
to the side of the pipe.

1575
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,840
- That's the primary pump system.

1576
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,310
If they've set one of these on
the secondary system as well,

1577
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:57,020
and they blow them both,
it's gonna meltdown.

1578
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,990
(gunshots banging)

1579
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,823
Zoe?

1580
01:13:06,307 --> 01:13:07,140
Zoe!

1581
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:17,748
(light dramatic music)

1582
01:13:22,504 --> 01:13:23,850
Boggs!

1583
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,430
- He says it's already happening.

1584
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:28,680
There's no way to stop it.
- We get full clearance.

1585
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,692
- Go through!
- That's a go.

1586
01:13:29,692 --> 01:13:31,320
- [Soldier] On my cue.

1587
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,670
- How long before we're up again?

1588
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:35,350
- We'll have you online in three minutes.

1589
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,423
- What the, who are you people?

1590
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,110
- American soldiers.

1591
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,260
- You're militia?

1592
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,310
- No, we're...

1593
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,870
Imagine someone had hijacked
the planes before 9/11

1594
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,693
and flown them past the towers.

1595
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,163
- That's what this is?

1596
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,723
A warning?

1597
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,243
All this for that?

1598
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,590
- All of this for that.

1599
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:05,170
A lot of people could have died tonight.

1600
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,780
Why?

1601
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:10,880
Nuclear power plants, chemical
plants, container ships,

1602
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,410
water supplies all vulnerable
while we confiscate

1603
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:16,193
tweezers from grandmother's.

1604
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,863
Nothing changes until people are afraid.

1605
01:14:25,313 --> 01:14:27,980
(phone ringing)

1606
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:33,401
Time to end this.

1607
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:35,901
(phone beeps)

1608
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:38,883
Yes?

1609
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:43,950
- Major Edward Sands, we have a problem.

1610
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,120
- Let us explain ourselves.

1611
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,090
We have no problem.

1612
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,450
- You need to tell me about the bombs.

1613
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,680
- The reactor is safe.

1614
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,513
The truck is a-

1615
01:14:50,513 --> 01:14:51,830
- Not the truck, that's a dummy.

1616
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,060
I know.

1617
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,170
The bombs on the pumping system.

1618
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:57,170
- There are no bombs on the pump system.

1619
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,520
- Where's Boggs?

1620
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,240
- They're moving, they can't be stopped.

1621
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,603
- Pull him back.

1622
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,490
Listen, you have bombs at
the primary pumping station.

1623
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,450
- You got a reason to
draw my men out there?

1624
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:09,283
- It's there.

1625
01:15:09,283 --> 01:15:11,780
Listen, I just lost an
officer who was staring at it.

1626
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,180
Now you need to tell me
exactly what's going on.

1627
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:18,470
(suspenseful music)

1628
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:27,000
- One of my men.

1629
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,630
When we pulled up the plans,
he was looking for the pumps.

1630
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:30,490
I'll deal with him.

1631
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,100
- No, you can't just take care of it.

1632
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,510
If both pumps blow, the
reactor is gonna meltdown.

1633
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:38,260
Now, you need to tell me what is going on.

1634
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,093
- Marwan.

1635
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,253
His name is Raul Lida.

1636
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,000
He was held by Pakistani
extremists for three years.

1637
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:47,680
Who knows what happened.

1638
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,133
- Well, they turned him.
- I'll deal with him.

1639
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:52,310
- Listen, our guys are not
gonna trust you to deal with it.

1640
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:53,530
We have guys going in there.

1641
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,920
You need to get your guys' to stand down.

1642
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,753
- If he set those bombs,

1643
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:58,210
I don't know why he waited till now.

1644
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:59,973
But he sees CAG coming in, he'll blow it.

1645
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:01,330
- [Tom] Listen, when you see me,

1646
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:03,081
just get your guys to open the gates.

1647
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:05,999
(dramatic music)

1648
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:08,582
(bomb beeping)

1649
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,410
- Why hasn't it already been detonated?

1650
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,810
What are they waiting for?

1651
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,820
- They must be waiting
for a coordinated event.

1652
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,160
- [Man] We got an FBI
agent at the main gate.

1653
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,487
- I sure hope to God he
knows what he's doing.

1654
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:26,880
(suspenseful music)

1655
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,953
- [Man] Team leaders, stand down.

1656
01:16:27,953 --> 01:16:29,841
FBI agent entering main gate.

1657
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:30,990
End message.

1658
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,580
Repeat, team leaders, stand down.

1659
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,790
FBI agent entering main gate.

1660
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,209
End message.

1661
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:38,141
(static buzzing)

1662
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:38,974
- Let him pass.

1663
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,594
- [Man] It's Bravo leader, I copy.

1664
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:47,613
- [Man] Delta leader, roger that.

1665
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:52,823
(light dramatic music)

1666
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,530
- On his own, he just went in?

1667
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,770
- He's got no authority.

1668
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,100
I want that on the record.

1669
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,880
- There is no record, Susan.

1670
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,720
- This changes nothing.

1671
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,760
We're still going in.

1672
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,930
- Secretary Utley, he's
Special Agent in charge.

1673
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:11,967
We can't just let the
CAG team go in there-

1674
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:13,910
- You're the one to let him walk in there.

1675
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:15,070
He knows what's happening.

1676
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:16,410
If he gets hit, he gets hit.

1677
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,140
- I've been working
with the man all night.

1678
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,330
He's been right every step of the way.

1679
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,130
If he says we're in trouble, I trust him.

1680
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:22,963
Bottom line.

1681
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:27,719
(light dramatic music)

1682
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,090
- Where is he?

1683
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,223
- Primary pump system.

1684
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,350
- Can we get in there?

1685
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,980
- No.

1686
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,030
He'll feel us coming.

1687
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:55,230
Backup system's gotta be wired, too.

1688
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,580
- We'll go there.

1689
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,630
- Come on, try him again.

1690
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,011
- [Jansen] Shea, come in.

1691
01:17:59,011 --> 01:18:01,360
- He's the federal agent in
charge of this operation.

1692
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,600
He's on the inside.

1693
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,420
- You put it off, it's daylight there.

1694
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,253
Then what?
- Sir!

1695
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:06,086
- Decisions done, Colonel.

1696
01:18:06,086 --> 01:18:06,973
Get it done now.

1697
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,695
- Yes, sir.

1698
01:18:09,695 --> 01:18:12,820
(light dramatic music)

1699
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,010
- Listen, you know this guy.

1700
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:15,100
Tell me why he waited.

1701
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,900
Why didn't he just blow it
the minute he wired the pipes?

1702
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,540
I mean, is there a chance
he doesn't wanna do it?

1703
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,640
- I don't know.

1704
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,930
- Well, we, we need to know.

1705
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,530
We need to know what the hell...

1706
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:31,654
(flag pole clanking)
(flag rustling)

1707
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,250
Maximum damage.

1708
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,410
That's what he was waiting for.

1709
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,243
- What?

1710
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,860
- Raul was waiting for the wind.

1711
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,910
- They're coming.

1712
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,995
He sees them, he's not
gonna wait for the wind.

1713
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:44,412
(intense dramatic music)

1714
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,543
(Tom groaning)

1715
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:26,557
Shea.
(bomb beeping)

1716
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:28,110
- Oh, shit.

1717
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,890
- It's wrapped with primer cord.

1718
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,200
Detonator goes off, it'll
slice clean through.

1719
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,410
- What do you need me to do?

1720
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,920
- I gotta cut the cords, every one.

1721
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,713
You've gotta hold the
detonator extremely still.

1722
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,190
- Extremely still.

1723
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,570
- It's a mercury switch.

1724
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,113
Slightest movement, it blows.

1725
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:50,219
- Okay.
(beeping continues)

1726
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,690
What do you think I'm gonna do?

1727
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:06,117
Shoot you in the head and
then let the bomb go off?

1728
01:20:11,801 --> 01:20:14,301
(Sands sighs)

1729
01:20:15,348 --> 01:20:17,320
(gun clanking)

1730
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,153
- No!

1731
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:20,983
Two hands.

1732
01:20:22,346 --> 01:20:24,846
(Tom panting)

1733
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:37,323
Raul.

1734
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,220
I should have known.

1735
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,700
He shouldn't have been here.

1736
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,500
- None of you should have been here.

1737
01:20:46,364 --> 01:20:49,114
(dramatic music)

1738
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,131
(suspenseful music)

1739
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:05,714
(bomb beeping)

1740
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:11,764
(beeping continues)

1741
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,851
(cords snapping)

1742
01:21:31,281 --> 01:21:36,281
(Sands grunting)
(cord snapping)

1743
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:49,551
(Sands grunting)
(cord snapping)

1744
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:50,873
(Tom gasps)
(gun clanking)

1745
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:55,790
(gunshots banging)
(Raul groaning)

1746
01:21:55,790 --> 01:22:00,790
(Raul grunting)
(explosions booming)

1747
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:05,051
(building creaking)

1748
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:08,410
- We've got a major explosion
on the primary pump.

1749
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,080
The secondary systems appear stable.

1750
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,423
Repeat, the primary systems are offline.

1751
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:14,565
(pipes hissing)

1752
01:22:14,565 --> 01:22:16,384
(Sands groaning)

1753
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:18,090
- I should put a bullet
in your head right now.

1754
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,450
- Go ahead.

1755
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,990
Cancer, gunshot, meltdown,
it doesn't matter.

1756
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,860
- What are you doing here?

1757
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,290
- My men and me were poisoned

1758
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:28,500
by weapons made of uranium
waste from places like this.

1759
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,110
And Washington just lets
it sit here, unprotected,

1760
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,103
not a word of warning to people.

1761
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:37,213
They don't care.

1762
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:39,230
Like they didn't care
about us in Afghanistan.

1763
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:41,103
- You care.
- That's why we did it!

1764
01:22:41,103 --> 01:22:43,413
- All the people that died tonight,

1765
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:48,280
in the panic, on the streets!

1766
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,880
- People die so others can live.

1767
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,698
It's what we do.
- That's what you do!

1768
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:55,198
That's what you signed up for.

1769
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,050
The people out there
expect to be protected.

1770
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,440
- I've been here 11 hours.

1771
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,730
And what has the government done?

1772
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,363
A five mile evac?

1773
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,570
Real terrorists could have
killed millions tonight.

1774
01:23:15,339 --> 01:23:17,213
It was the only way to show them.

1775
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:21,830
- What real terrorist wouldn't say that?

1776
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:26,097
(dramatic music)

1777
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:44,420
(pipes hissing)
(water splashing)

1778
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,750
- Kill the power.

1779
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,389
Insert Bravo and Delta squad.

1780
01:23:48,389 --> 01:23:52,028
(helicopter whirring)

1781
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:55,160
(lights whooshing)
(alarms beeping)

1782
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,640
- Water's draining from the core.

1783
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,211
Primary pumps are down.

1784
01:23:58,211 --> 01:24:00,134
Backup's not coming on.

1785
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:03,422
(dramatic music)

1786
01:24:03,422 --> 01:24:05,815
(alarms beeping)

1787
01:24:05,815 --> 01:24:06,670
- [Tom] Drop your weapon.

1788
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,400
Drop your weapon right now.

1789
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,350
- Lower the weapon.

1790
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,563
- Are you Shea?
- Yeah, what's it doing?

1791
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:13,840
- Primary pumps are down.

1792
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,990
Secondary's not responding.

1793
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,350
- Soon as they cut the power for the raid.

1794
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,510
- We're leaking water.

1795
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,343
It's getting very hot.

1796
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:20,220
- We have to get the
emergency generators online.

1797
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,352
- Look, you do what you need to do.

1798
01:24:21,352 --> 01:24:25,652
(pipes hissing)
(water splashing)

1799
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:27,459
(lights whooshing)

1800
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:31,907
(gunshots banging)
(man groaning)

1801
01:24:31,907 --> 01:24:34,824
(gunshots banging)

1802
01:24:36,684 --> 01:24:37,784
(gunshot banging)
(man groaning)

1803
01:24:37,784 --> 01:24:41,077
(power whooshing)
(gunshots banging)

1804
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:41,940
(man groaning)
- Where is the generators?

1805
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,734
- Okay, just wait?

1806
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:46,780
Okay, the number one emergency
generator has just started.

1807
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,150
Safety injection pump is online.

1808
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,484
- I've got it too. It's coming on.

1809
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:50,780
- Come on, come on, please.

1810
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,630
- Okay, the reactor cooling temperature

1811
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,840
is moving down toward normal.

1812
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,420
- Okay, pumps are going.

1813
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,253
Let's secure it.

1814
01:24:56,253 --> 01:24:57,927
(explosion booming)

1815
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:58,817
- [Man] On on the ground!

1816
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:00,100
On the ground.

1817
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,031
Nobody move!
- Do not move!

1818
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:03,287
(gunshots banging)
- I'm FBI, hold your fire.

1819
01:25:03,287 --> 01:25:04,470
Hold your fire!
- You don't understand,

1820
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,134
the core will explode.
- Federal prisoner in custody!

1821
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,170
- I have to save the injection
pump, I have to secure it.

1822
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,003
- Do not move!

1823
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:09,836
No one move!
- Please.

1824
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:11,130
- He's the engineer!
- Please.

1825
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:13,403
- Just call command, tell Boggs it's Shea.

1826
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:15,320
- The pump, the core is exposed.

1827
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,714
You've got to let me do this.

1828
01:25:16,714 --> 01:25:18,200
(gunshots banging)
- That's a hostage!

1829
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,110
God damn it!

1830
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:21,500
He's a hostage!
- No one move.

1831
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,260
- You gonna shoot me too?

1832
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,740
He's my prisoner.

1833
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,573
Mine.

1834
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:26,920
- Forget it, Shea.

1835
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,680
They're not gonna let me walk out of here.

1836
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,280
American soldiers doing what we did.

1837
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,960
We're dead Arab terrorists.

1838
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,880
That's the story.

1839
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,350
- You call Boggs.

1840
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,410
You tell him he's my prisoner,

1841
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:38,310
and I'm walking him out of here alive.

1842
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:44,102
(light dramatic music)
(heartbeat pounding)

1843
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:47,019
(Chuck whimpering)

1844
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,700
(keyboard clicking)

1845
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,913
(light dramatic music)

1846
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:38,361
Just stay close. We're
gonna walk out of here.

1847
01:26:58,888 --> 01:27:00,638
- Shea, it ends here.

1848
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:08,281
- Don't.

1849
01:27:17,777 --> 01:27:21,054
(gunshots banging)

1850
01:27:21,054 --> 01:27:26,054
(body thudding)
(heartbeat pounding)

1851
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,180
- [Newscaster] At 6:22
a.m. Pacific Standard Time

1852
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,380
in a daring predawn raid,

1853
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,690
all seven terrorists were killed,

1854
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:58,020
and the San Juan Nuclear
Power Plant was secured.

1855
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:59,210
According to authorities,

1856
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,370
the terrorists were
part of a fundamentalist

1857
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:05,610
Islamic splinter group operating
inside the Philippines.

1858
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,760
At the White House, the President
encouraged all Americans

1859
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,760
to go about their normal
lives; work, play, and shop.

1860
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,520
And the President reiterated his pledge

1861
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,223
to once again defend the
American way of life.

1862
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,950
- I don't know how it could have happened.

1863
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:26,970
Clearly, in this race,
the race between the folks

1864
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:30,080
who wanna do us harm
and the race between us

1865
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,220
who are trying to improve

1866
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,100
and defend ourselves from those folks,

1867
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:36,540
we appear to have lost
this particular battle.

1868
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,490
There was always a chance
that a nuclear power plant

1869
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,700
could be subject to attack.

1870
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,310
There was controversy within
the intelligence community

1871
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:45,050
as to whether it was a real target or not.

1872
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,520
But I think most of us would have said,

1873
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,670
would have said, given
what Bin Laden had said

1874
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,160
about symbolic targets and
trying to cause economic damage

1875
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,270
to the US, that it was at
least possible, plausible,

1876
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:59,270
that a US nuclear power plant
would have been attacked.

1877
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:02,370
And now I think we're gonna
have a lot of what ifs.

1878
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,840
You know, after the 9/11 disaster,

1879
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,790
there were hearings and
questions were asked.

1880
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:09,700
Well, did we do everything
we should have done?

1881
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,220
And the, a lot of the folks
who answered those questions

1882
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,390
said, well, we, we didn't
know that they were coming.

1883
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,220
We didn't have actionable intelligence.

1884
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,860
Well, you're not gonna be
able to say that this time.

1885
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,740
People knew there was a problem.

1886
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,210
They simply weren't addressing the problem

1887
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:24,443
as completely or as quickly
as they should have.
