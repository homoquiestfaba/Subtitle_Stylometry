1
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,518
<i>(1 st man) Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?</i>

2
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,232
<i>(2nd man) Never heard of her.</i>

3
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,559
<i>(3rd man) The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.</i>

4
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,399
<i>- Have a think, Barley.
- Don't know a Katya.</i>

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,670
<i>Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,</i>

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,190
<i>never proposed to one,
never even married one.</i>

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,118
<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

8
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,312
<i>(1 st man) She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.</i>

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,351
<i>(4th man) Audio fair?</i>

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,552
<i>(Barley) Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.</i>

11
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,832
<i>- (4th man) So why didn't you go?
- (Barley) l can go. l can not go.</i>

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,997
<i>l'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.</i>

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,148
<i>(American man) Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...</i>

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,475
<i>Why didn't you show up?</i>

15
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,273
<i>(Barley) l have a board.
l have family shareholders.</i>

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,076
<i>The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.</i>

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,156
<i>(4th man) lt is.</i>

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,349
<i>Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?</i>

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,991
Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,830
<i>Yeah, l know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.</i>

21
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,633
Barley? Sure, l know Barley.

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,116
House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

23
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,117
A gent. One of the best.

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,391
l must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
lt is very urgent.

25
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,112
He's not here, darling.

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,595
But he was not here yesterday.

27
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,953
Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>(Barley) lrritating little sod.
l'm quite fond of him really.</i>

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,037
l have an important manuscript for him.
lt is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,075
Listen, l'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as l may.

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,034
<i>(3rd man) Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?</i>

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,993
<i>(Barley) l don't know. l don't know her.</i>

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,315
<i>(4th man) So you know Niki,
but not Katya?</i>

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,988
Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,232
- ls that Scotch over there?
- Help yourself.

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,476
Hold everything.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,194
OK.

38
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,592
You must be very kind and help me.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,917
A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,350
lts message is important
for all of mankind.

41
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,629
Nice.

42
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,276
ln spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

43
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,834
in the Soviet Union.

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,750
Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

45
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,030
Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

46
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,472
your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,999
lf you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,634
- lt is a gift of trust.
- lt is better that you smile.

49
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,436
- Excuse me?
- Smile.

50
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,189
This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

51
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,596
Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,030
This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

53
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,310
Smile.

54
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,672
We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,756
That's right.

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,191
Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,196
October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

58
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,110
<i>And l have given you Shakespeare's
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.</i>

59
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,711
Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,710
lt is not convenient.

61
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,390
Thank you.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,150
<i>(1 st man) You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova</i>

63
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?</i>

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,199
Barley?

65
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,470
Who said... ''risk her neck''?

66
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,316
l did.

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,550
- Must be quite a book.
- lt is.

68
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,752
- May l see it?
- Let's begin with the letter.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,915
<i>(groans)</i>

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,592
<i>''Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent. ''</i>

71
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,998
We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,352
beginning ''My beloved Barley'',
and sign herself ''Your loving K''.

73
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,869
She's potty. Certifiable.

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,077
Where is this manuscript?

75
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,998
<i>- That's none of your business.
- Like hell it isn't.</i>

76
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,111
<i>She sent it to me as a publisher.</i>

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,798
- lt's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
- Please calm down.

78
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,675
lt's in safe hands, Barley.

79
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,949
The manuscript was in three notebooks.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,234
<i>When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.</i>

81
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,076
The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

82
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,996
Oh?

83
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,113
Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

84
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,676
lt has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,916
Absolutely barking.

86
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,635
<i>- Would you say?
- lt's not a medical term, sir.</i>

87
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,637
Unstable, perhaps.

88
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,070
- As for notebooks two and three?
- Genuine science.

89
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,748
Written by someone in the business.
No question.

90
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,154
The business?

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,991
Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

92
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,590
Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,836
<i>What the hell does it purport to describe?</i>

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,795
ln a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

95
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,039
And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,559
Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

97
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,069
So it's their baby, not ours.

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,312
- Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
- Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

99
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,270
Eureka! We've got him.

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,873
A Lisbon bank account, my dears!

101
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,069
- We've got him.
- Lisbon.

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,992
<i>- Why did you run away?
- (Barley) Run away? l own a flat here.</i>

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,998
<i>(American accent) Why Lisbon, Barley?</i>

104
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,236
<i>(mimics accent) Why Langley, Bob?</i>

105
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,871
You brought a woman?

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,073
What's it to you if l brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,831
What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

108
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,838
Well, l was having a drink.

109
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,430
<i>Until l was interrupted.</i>

110
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,916
<i>(Barley chuckling)</i>

111
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,591
- Mr Blair?
- Eh?

112
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,589
l believe l'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

113
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,393
- Yes.
- l'm Merrydew. l'm from the embassy.

114
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,513
We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

115
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,313
Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

116
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,432
No. That would be consular.
l'm commercial.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,356
Well, l never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,677
Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

119
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,476
l say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

120
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,958
Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

121
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,470
- l'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
- Mr Blair, sir?

122
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,670
My name's Ned.

123
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,075
l'm about to move the goal posts.

124
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,399
There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

125
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,590
l'm from British lntelligence.

126
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,870
Come and meet the others.

127
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,676
This is Clive. This is Walter.

128
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,157
<i>Over here is Bob, who is almost family.
Meet Barley, everyone.</i>

129
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,113
- Hello, Barley!
- Proud to know you, Barley.

130
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,949
l'm the odd man out here. l work
for the Central lntelligence Agency,

131
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,358
which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

132
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,358
Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

133
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,550
Now isn't that jolly?

134
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,397
So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? lran?

135
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,114
Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

136
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't rant. Sit down.

137
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,075
Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

138
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,032
- Recognise the handwriting?
- Read it slowly.

139
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,549
Take all the time in the world, Barley.

140
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,912
She's barmy.

141
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,949
<i>(Barley) Who is she?</i>

142
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,958
Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

143
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,672
- Never heard of her.
- The patronymic's Borisovna.

144
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,476
Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

145
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,034
l don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

146
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,358
<i>never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.</i>

147
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,392
<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

148
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,559
<i>So, she wrote you a letter
signed ''Your loving K'',</i>

149
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,196
- and you tell me you don't know her?
- l told you. l never met the hag.

150
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,390
She's off her tree.

151
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,750
She wasn't even there.

152
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,392
- Where?
- At Peredelkino.

153
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,995
<i>lt's a Soviet writers' village.</i>

154
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,716
<i>They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.</i>

155
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,795
l was lucky enough to be a guest.

156
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,516
When was this?

157
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,029
Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

158
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,355
But there wasn't any Katya.

159
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,280
<i>- What happened?
- l was brilliant.</i>

160
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,960
<i>- Yes?
- Oh, yes.</i>

161
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,358
<i>How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. l was flying.</i>

162
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,475
<i>l believe in the new Russia.
You may not, but l do.</i>

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,469
20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

164
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,830
We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

165
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,951
Gambling with the fate of the human race.

166
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,516
Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

167
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,358
Oh, rubbish. What peace?

168
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,758
Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

169
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,237
No. lf there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

170
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,550
We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

171
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,433
And none is more equal than others.

172
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,830
lt's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

173
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,598
A heroic thought, Barley.

174
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,393
Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

175
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,035
just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

176
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,638
And did you believe this nonsense?

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,877
l don't know. l believe it when l say it.

178
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,790
But you've got to be there.

179
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,797
You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,993
and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

181
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,918
or freedom versus responsibility.

182
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,511
So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

183
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,878
And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think ''What a great country.''

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,434
That's why l love them.

185
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,835
And they're very fond of me.

186
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,749
Anyway,... later we talked about jazz,
and l played some.

187
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,113
What, somebody had a saxophone?

188
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,232
What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

189
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,114
<i>(* saxophone effect
through a comb and paper)</i>

190
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,200
<i>(* improvised jazz continues)</i>

191
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,349
How many women were there?

192
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,629
Three or four. But no Katya.

193
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,438
<i>But there was someone, wasn't there?</i>

194
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,633
Yes. There was someone.

195
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,718
Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

196
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,911
- A man or a woman?
- Name?

197
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,676
Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

198
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,996
<i>(amplified swish)</i>

199
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,391
<i>(amplified crashing)</i>

200
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,756
<i>(amplified)</i>

201
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,035
They called him... Dante.

202
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,512
<i>As in ''lnferno''.</i>

203
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,553
<i>The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.</i>

204
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,274
He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

205
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,791
<i>Everyone deferred to him.</i>

206
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,435
<i>He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.</i>

207
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,037
- Stared?
- Mm. At me.

208
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,799
<i>Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?</i>

209
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,591
l don't know.

210
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,676
Keep going.

211
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,951
Then l decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,435
let them talk Russian for a while.

213
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,677
There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

214
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,109
<i>lt's a place of pilgrimage.</i>

215
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,510
<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

216
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,918
''lf there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.''

217
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,270
Ah, Dante, old chum.

218
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,914
Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

219
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,996
Boris Pasternak.

220
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,513
Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

221
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,918
''All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others.''

222
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,077
<i>Yes, well,... some write better than others.</i>

223
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,149
''How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

224
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,389
and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth.''

225
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,753
- Pasternak?
- No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

226
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,148
Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

227
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,236
lf you say so.

228
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,636
l love my country.

229
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,433
<i>l love it too - your country.</i>

230
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,269
And l'm reasonably fond of my own.

231
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,076
To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

232
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,794
Because you and l, we love truth.

233
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,476
Who are you, Dante?

234
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,389
What do you do for a living?

235
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,471
l am a moral outcast.

236
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,194
Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

237
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,793
And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

238
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,876
Lies.

239
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,396
l am the lie.

240
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,074
Really?

241
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,436
You spoke the truth.

242
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,351
Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then l will make you a promise in return.

243
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,390
l'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

244
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,072
You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

245
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,908
Dante, l'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

246
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,595
l'm nobody's spy.

247
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,750
Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

248
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,715
Oh, chess. ln chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

249
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,112
What game is that?

250
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,550
The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

251
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,591
You are in danger only from our lies.

252
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,792
l commit the lie every day.
l lie even to my masters.

253
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,278
So, promise me that if l ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

254
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,598
then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

255
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,589
- Dante, leave me out, will you?
- Hey, you cannot reject me.

256
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,995
Because l am strengthened
by your rejection.

257
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,270
So, promise me.

258
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,151
What the hell am l promising,
for God's sake?

259
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,196
Promise.

260
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,476
All right.

261
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,555
lf you ever manage to be a hero,

262
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,797
l'll be a... decent human being.

263
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,075
OK?

264
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,713
Promise?

265
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,796
l promise.

266
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,272
Why didn't you come to us?! l know why.
You put your head in the sand.

267
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,960
<i>Don't know because don't want to know.</i>

268
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,750
l'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

269
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,548
<i>Then l asked him ''What am l supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?''</i>

270
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,275
<i>Why didn't you come to us?! l know why.
You put your head in the sand.</i>

271
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,709
<i>Don't know because don't want to know.</i>

272
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,594
- Who the hell is that?
- Walter? He's a character.

273
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,474
<i>l'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.</i>

274
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,512
- That's it.
- And the notebooks?

275
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,837
The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

276
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,758
con man or intelligence peddler we know.

277
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,190
Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

278
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,676
- And?
- They failed.

279
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,356
Try harder, Russell.

280
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,318
No.

281
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,758
No.

282
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,193
No.

283
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,356
Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

284
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,190
No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

285
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,836
All right.

286
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,392
ls that Katya?

287
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,512
- That's her.
- You remember her now?

288
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,796
No such luck.

289
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,197
Choose someone else.

290
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,959
We didn't choose you. Dante did.

291
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,396
Because l wasn't a spy.

292
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,956
We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

293
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,514
Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

294
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,235
And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

295
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,716
l thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

296
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,671
Oh, my dear Lord!

297
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,509
Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

298
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,677
Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

299
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,314
All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

300
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,910
Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

301
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,270
Well, that's where l disagree.

302
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,717
l'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

303
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,950
Nah.

304
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,514
l'm sorry, Ned. No go.

305
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,237
Bloody woman. l must've given offence.

306
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,716
She has a point.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,230
Worry about Dante.

308
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,112
He reached out for you.

309
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,549
Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

310
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,989
Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

311
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,556
The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

312
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,910
How will you live with yourself?

313
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,235
<i>l don't live with myself.</i>

314
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,194
ln fact, l try to give myself a wide berth.

315
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,869
l'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

316
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,274
Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

317
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,550
This is something people write in for.

318
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,229
The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

319
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,318
You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

320
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,513
Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

321
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,235
You're a fool to use me.

322
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,916

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,353
<i>Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,</i>

334
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,358
<i>except for the benefit
of their microphones.</i>

335
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,112
<i>lf you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.</i>

336
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,993
That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

337
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,033
And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

338
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,831
This is fun. ls that why you keep it secret?

339
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,955
Did you spot our watchers?

340
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,230
The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

341
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,193
and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

342
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,392
You scored nil. Out of a possible 1 2.

343
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,791
The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

344
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,392
lf you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

345
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,189
That leaves no impression.

346
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,551
How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

347
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,558
Well, including the windowsill... four.

348
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,718
Seven.

349
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,035
This is often easiest.

350
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,638
Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

351
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,591
<i>The issue is why.</i>

352
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,038
That's what you're looking for all the time.

353
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,879
lf we trust the motive, we trust the man.

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,150
Then we can trust the material.

355
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,909
Why did Dante pick on Katya?

356
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,754
Why does he put her life at risk?

357
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,916
Why does she let him?

358
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,198
<i>ls she a spy?</i>

359
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,552
- lt's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
- l know all this. l've had it up to here.

360
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,148
l just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

361
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,794
lt's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

362
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,310
- Sounds like the pot of gold.
- Sounds like a crock of shit.

363
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,229
Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

364
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,352
they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

365
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,950
Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

366
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,637
Russell?

367
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,797
lt could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

368
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,956
Let the Brits run with it for a while.

369
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,119
Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

370
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,835
l'll go with that, Russell. But l want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

371
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,791
Friendly observers, OK?

372
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,635
You'll do us proud, Barley.

373
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,316
l've brought you a present.

374
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,114
lt's not to keep. lt's just to sniff.

375
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,388
- Am l supposed to offer to publish it?
- Offer him anything he wants.

376
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,512
Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

377
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,835
Except the truth?

378
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,150
Bon voyage, Barley.

379
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,759
<i>Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,</i>

380
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,872
<i>and l'll get you a knighthood for literature.</i>

381
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,156
The Russia House.

382
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,909
Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

383
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,430
<i>London. The publishers.</i>

384
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,275
l believe you know Niki Landau.

385
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,389
<i>Yes.</i>

386
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,672
Well, Niki was very insistent that l should
give you a call. How do you do?

387
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,712
<i>How do you do?</i>

388
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,593
l'll tell you why l'm calling.
l'm here in Moscow.

389
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,633
And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

390
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,716
l hope you like tea.

391
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,550
l was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

392
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,353
<i>- A handover?
- Do you ever escape for lunch?</i>

393
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,630
Yes. Of course.

394
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,911
<i>Well, how about today?
l'm at the Ukraine Hotel.</i>

395
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,676
<i>- That would be convenient.
- Good. Marvellous.</i>

396
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,030
Well, l'll be outside from 1 2.30 on.

397
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,470
<i>- How will l know you?
- Oh, listen, l'm easy to recognise.</i>

398
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,639
l look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

399
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,555
We're off.

400
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,116
Hi. Hello.

401
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,072
You're Katya, of course.

402
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,192
Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

403
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,357
Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

404
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,079
Well, er... where shall we go?

405
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,158
l brought your stuff from Niki,
but l'll carry it.

406
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,919
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

407
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,278
<i>Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the Venus de Milo.</i>

408
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,196
That is ridiculous.

409
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,112
l was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

410
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,393
They said l was photographing
a military subject.

411
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,990
- And were you?
- No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

412
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,429
They asked me to take their picture.

413
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,639
Obviously l received the manuscript.

414
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,995
l will take you to where
we can have lunch.

415
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,634
lf you do not mind, l will first buy shoes.

416
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,830
Shoes?

417
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,595
Today there is a shipment of shoes.

418
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,474
With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

419
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,998
- Really? l thought things were improving.
- Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

420
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,351
Perhaps different people
are now stealing. l don't know.

421
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,277
Keep your voice down.

422
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,595
Complaining is our new human right.

423
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,076
Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

424
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,475
but it doesn't make more shoes.

425
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,192
Tell me about your new Russian book.

426
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,831
Oh, yes. The book.

427
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,998
Well, my problem is that, er,
l don't know the author's real name,

428
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,192
let alone where he gets
all his information from.

429
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,153
Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

430
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,234
Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

431
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,113
Some writers can only work in obscurity.

432
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,796
But you know publishing, hm?

433
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,152
lf a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

434
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,193
well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

435
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,438
Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

436
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,196
Dynamite, in fact.

437
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,310
The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

438
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,715
concerning world peace.

439
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,671
Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

440
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,392
lt is not known. This can be established.

441
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,353
<i>The publisher would like
to meet him again.</i>

442
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,718
How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

443
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,718
Seven days,... Mrs Katya.

444
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,390
<i>(* plays mournful tune)</i>

445
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,714
- Where do you live?
- With my children.

446
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,274
Your children? How many?

447
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,188
l have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

448
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,276
lt is not relevant.

449
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,430
What does your husband do?

450
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,791
lt is not important.

451
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,309
- ls he a publisher too?
- No.

452
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,317
ls he a writer?

453
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,475
No.

454
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,795
A composer? A cook?

455
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,994
ls he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

456
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,434
His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

457
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,439
We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

458
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,234
<i>(* mournful tune continues)</i>

459
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,116
Unfortunately, l have
to return to my children now.

460
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,310
lsn't someone looking after them?

461
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,398
Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

462
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,353
that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

463
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,232
l'm sorry. l cannot.

464
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,669
Oh, look, we've hardly met.

465
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,353
l need time.

466
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,359
l've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

467
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,675
with a beautiful Russian woman.

468
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,556
l don't bite, l don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

469
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,069
- At least show me something of Moscow.
- lt is not convenient.

470
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,839
- Then give me your home number.
- lt is not convenient.

471
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,916
- Will you call me, then?
- Perhaps.

472
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,995
When?

473
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,395
Perhaps l shall call you late tonight.

474
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,397
No, not ''perhaps''.

475
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,476
l shall call you.

476
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,795
You forgot to give her the tea.

477
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,795
- Mr Blair, sir?
- Wicklow.

478
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,231
Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

479
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,831
Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word ''convenient''.

480
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,632
ln Russian it's ''udobno''.
But it also means ''proper''.

481
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,357
- A bit confusing really.
- Yes, it is indeed.

482
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,432
We have an interim, sir.

483
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,634
Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

484
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,755
<i>(phone rings)</i>

485
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,998
<i>Da?</i>

486
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,633
<i>Da, eta Alina.</i>

487
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,870
<i>- Dobry dyen.
- Barley!</i>

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,309
- Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap!
- Alik.

489
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,911
Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

490
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,112
How did you know, Alik?

491
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,994
Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

492
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,680
Alik Zapadny of VAAP,

493
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,395
the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

494
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,035
- How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
- Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

495
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,357
Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

496
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,357
and they throw money at us.

497
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,031
Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

498
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,390
And how about translators?

499
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,435
On fiction we will use our own
and take another 5% royalty. How's that?

500
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,673
- We'll consider it.
- No, l don't think so.

501
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,356
We don't have the margin.

502
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,436
Exactly.

503
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,876
Well done, Wickers.

504
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,636
- Jesus, Barley!
- Yuri.

505
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,911
What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

506
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,192
Yuri, l want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

507
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,276
Hello. You a spy?

508
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,392
- Only in my spare time, sir.
- Jesus, l like him.

509
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,829
Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

510
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,436
Let's deal direct, OK?

511
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,358
To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

512
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,677
Stay away from them.
Especially Zapadny.

513
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,917
l don't say he's KGB.

514
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,953
All l say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

515
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,911
Know what l mean?

516
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,110
<i>- Cheers.
- Na zdorovye.</i>

517
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,792
Oh, Barley... l have something for you.

518
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,231
Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But l'm working on it.

519
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,036
l'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

520
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,154
<i>(phone rings)</i>

521
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,235
lt's me.

522
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,358
Do l disturb you?

523
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,275
Deeply. Come over.

524
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,638
You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, l think.

525
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,836
l did. Where do l send the glass coach?

526
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,873
l have the tapes, and l've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life!

527
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,470
Barley has gotta tell Katya:
no more Greta fucking Garbo.

528
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,875
And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

529
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,389
<i>l'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here!</i>

530
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,239
All right, Russell, message understood.

531
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,073
Brock?

532
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,237
Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

533
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,113
Signal Paddy at the embassy.
l want him to talk to Barley.

534
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,916
Er, we're this way.

535
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,835
l hope you like churches.

536
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,396
ln Russia we don't ask that.
lt is not convenient.

537
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,557
Ah. l think you mean ''proper''. No?

538
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,636
- Proper?
- Mm.

539
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,230
<i>Nyet. Convenient.</i>

540
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,078
Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

541
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,836
One more to go. This way.

542
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,356
This is just like school.

543
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,631
Dear old, bloody old... school.

544
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,269
Who is that man down there?

545
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,834
Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

546
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,389
Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

547
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,559
Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

548
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,432
Well...

549
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,951
Do you drink this stuff?

550
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,672
No.

551
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,756
Me neither.

552
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,993
What's Dante's real name, huh?

553
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,996
Who is he?

554
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,396
Does he test things?

555
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,072
ls he a physicist?
An engineer? ls he army?

556
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,277
Does he like ice cream?

557
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,436
Does he like the movies?

558
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,476
<i>ls he one man? ls he two? ls he a group?</i>

559
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,471
Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

560
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,956
Come on, Katya. You started this, l didn't.

561
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,354
Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
l do jokes, l do bird noises, l drink.

562
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,676
l'm a friend.

563
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,389
- Who is he?
- l don't know what l may tell you.

564
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,669
What did he tell you to tell me?

565
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,553
Whatever is necessary.
That l should trust you.

566
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,433
He was generous. lt is his nature.

567
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,630
Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

568
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,279
lt was for him that l sent it.
l did not select you, he did.

569
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,393
Oh.

570
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
He is... my friend.

571
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,554
ls this what you usually do for friends?

572
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,319
Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

573
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,715
Risk your life, your children?

574
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,837
Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

575
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,871
He is reconciled.

576
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,560
- Are you?
- Of course.

577
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,636
And your children?

578
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,394
lt is for them and their generation.

579
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,999
He is inspired by the new openness here.

580
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,192
But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

581
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,911
- And you agree?
- Yes! And so do you!

582
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,237
You spoke for him.
lt is for you we are here!

583
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,150
That's worth a drink.

584
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,634
He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

585
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,430
<i>- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
- Better! Ha-ha!</i>

586
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,233
Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

587
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,231
Where was he trained?

588
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,078
He went to the LlTMO.

589
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,317
Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

590
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,475
What's the LlTMO?

591
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,192
Leningrad lnstitute of Mechanical and
Optical Science! Write that down, fellas.

592
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,433
LlTMO is the Leningrad lnstitute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

593
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,429
He was extremely brilliant.
At 1 4 he won a mathematics olympiad.

594
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,516
Mathematics.

595
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,313
When l was at school,
they were the people l couldn't stand.

596
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,712
Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

597
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,674
<i>(hugely amplified clanging)</i>

598
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,756
<i>(bells ring)</i>

599
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,951
From university he went
to Academgorodok,

600
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,640
the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

601
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,116
He was... like a meteor there.

602
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,276
ls that where you met him?

603
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,192
No!

604
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,279
ln Leningrad. l was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

605
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
- l met Yakov at the club...
- Yakov?

606
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,428
- Yakov is Dante?
- Yes. Yakov.

607
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,717
- First name Yakov!
- Jacky.

608
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,872
We met at the Club of Scientists.

609
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,276
lt was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

610
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,756
<i>lt was by Godard.
À bout de souffle. Breathless.</i>

611
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,030
l went with my father.

612
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,555
And what year are we talking about now?

613
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,272
1 968.

614
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,675
You remember '68?

615
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,509
The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

616
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,632
and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

617
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,869
Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

618
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,753
the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

619
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,189
lt was the start of a new age.

620
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,400
He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

621
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,636
- From where?
- From the military.

622
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,796
They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

623
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,873
They had corrupted him.

624
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,518
He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

625
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,516
He was beautiful.

626
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,915
Not like a scientist, like an...

627
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,156
artist.

628
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,715
So you fell in love with him.

629
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,628
He was my first lover.

630
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,036
lt was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

631
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,519
There was no more innocence anywhere.

632
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,912
Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

633
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,555
And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

634
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,758
l did not talk to him for many years.

635
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,718
Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

636
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,915
Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

637
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,989
He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

638
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,634
<i>ls he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?</i>

639
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,758
<i>No.</i>

640
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,792
<i>- None of his drinking friends?
- No.</i>

641
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,750
How can you be so certain?

642
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,230
Because l am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

643
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,436
Are you happy with him?

644
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,470
- Please?
- l mean, er... do you like him?

645
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,718
As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

646
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,718
l believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

647
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:18,234
who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

648
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,435
Oh.

649
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,638
Jesus Christ, Mother of God! lt's Savelyev!

650
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,958
Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev!

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,998
Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

652
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,950
He talks about ''the great lie''.
Everything is part of the great lie.

653
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,718
Ah. Go on.

654
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,559
Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

655
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,351
What?

656
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,677
l think l am also allowed to ask questions.

657
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,750
Oh, of course. Ask.

658
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,394
Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

659
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,909
- Aw, for God's sake...
- Are you?

660
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,110
- Yes.
- Are you a publisher?

661
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,158
Yes.

662
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,991
Are you a spy?

663
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,432
No.

664
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,236
Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

665
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,756
Answer her.

666
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,277
l'm alone.

667
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,915
Jesus! Fuck.

668
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,268
l'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

669
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,590
Never been more alone.

670
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,717
Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

671
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,752
He has proposed three places
and three times.

672
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,351
He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

673
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,352
Good.

674
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,759
<i>(cork pops)</i>

675
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,474
Reconstruction. Openness.

676
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,514
He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

677
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,996
and open the ultimate can of worms.

678
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,751
Savelyev?! My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got!

679
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,269
<i>- Yes, we do. Trouble.
- (phone rings)</i>

680
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,358
Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

681
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,678
<i>(scientist) And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?</i>

682
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,233
<i>And look at this.</i>

683
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,989
- They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
- Honour is due, Ned.

684
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,793
<i>Russell, l need your money.
And your love.</i>

685
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,629
l want an American partner for Barley.
l want him in Leningrad on Friday.

686
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,199
l hear you, Ned. l'll get right back to you.

687
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,716
lf he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

688
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,277
Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

689
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,996
to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next 50 years.

690
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,516
But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

691
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,791
when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

692
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,996
<i>(phone rings)</i>

693
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,516
The night train to Leningrad.

694
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,668
l may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

695
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,759
Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

696
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,913
<i>- Powwow?
- l thought you knew English.</i>

697
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,750
''Powwow'' is not English.

698
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,073
<i>- You must sit down.
- Sit down? Why?</i>

699
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,795
lt is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

700
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,750
Well, l'm lying down. Won't that do?

701
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,235
Well,... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

702
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,033
and sigh a little and cross yourself.

703
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,596
Hold everything.

704
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,558
OK.

705
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,432
<i>(sighs)</i>

706
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,270
l was more comfortable lying down.

707
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,595
Are you coming back to Moscow?

708
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,632
<i>No, not this time.
l have to fly straight back to school.</i>

709
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,318
School?

710
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,671
<i>Work. England.
lt's a stupid expression of mine.</i>

711
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,230
l hope l didn't bore you last night.

712
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,590
<i>You did not bore me.</i>

713
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,950
Oh. Perhaps next time.

714
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,432
l'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

715
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,755
l wish you a good journey, Barley.

716
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,188
l'll miss you.

717
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,392
l want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

718
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,272
l smell hope here.

719
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,789
l smell change. l smell commerce.

720
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,752
And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
l'm proud. Proud.

721
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,755
0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

722
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,871
Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

723
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,710
<i>Good. We're on schedule.</i>

724
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,434
<i>Barley's got three chances
to make contact.</i>

725
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,630
<i>Now it's up to Dante.</i>

726
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,915
You want to sell me something?

727
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,789
Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

728
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,990
No, thanks. Cheerio.

729
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,157
You get lost?

730
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,794
<i>That's a good idea. Why don't you try it?</i>

731
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,479
One down, two to go.

732
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,598
Where are you, Dante?

733
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,755
Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but l think we are acquainted.

734
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,194
Good God! The great Dante,
as l live and breathe!

735
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,589
We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

736
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,915
The only two sober people there.

737
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,109
- How are you?
- l'm very well.

738
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,037
Welcome to Leningrad.

739
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,311
You can walk a little?
lt is safest to keep moving.

740
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,635
Yes, they told me that.

741
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,156
Barley's made contact! He's done it.

742
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,996
Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

743
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:04,194
So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

744
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,596
You have betrayed me.

745
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,076
Nobody's betrayed you.

746
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,355
l told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

747
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,109
<i>Our authorities admire your book.</i>

748
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,229
But they need to know if it's true.

749
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,108
The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

750
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,272
You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

751
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,595
Dante, you're going too fast.

752
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,631
Russia has no time.

753
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,752
When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

754
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,110
To lose time is to lose everything.

755
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,678
And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. l will be the first corpse.

756
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,149
And Katya second. What about her?

757
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,236
She also chose.

758
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,352
lf we act together,
we will survive together.

759
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,396
Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

760
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,871
l am not the man you thought l was.

761
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,838
You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

762
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,428
Our new people talk about openness.

763
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,070
Disarmament. Peace.

764
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,996
Words.

765
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,480
You like graveyards, Barley?

766
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,118
Look. Here is ours if we fail.

767
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,599
Chose a monument.
