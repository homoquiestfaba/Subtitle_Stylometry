And l save a family?

1176
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,938
Come on,
we both know it was you the whole time.

1177
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,189
Some kind of a plan, right?

1178
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:45,567
lt was you, too, Jake.

1179
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,278
Justin needed a soldier,
he needed someone who had been there,

1180
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:51,573
-someone who understood.
-But no coincidence, right?

1181
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,158
Good! Yeah.

1182
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,537
You know, maybe, sometimes
things just happen for a reason.

1183
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:01,291
Life isn't so much a puzzle as it is a plan.

1184
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,669
So, tell me the truth.

1185
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,504
You first.

1186
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,758
About Rachel, your girlfriend.

1187
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:14,512
You told Cindy that she was the one
driving the night that she died.

1188
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:15,680
But it was you, wasn't it?

1189
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:17,682
Yeah.

1190
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,645
Yeah, l lived, she died. That's...

1191
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,107
And you've been
driving around this country

1192
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,442
trying to run away from it,

1193
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,360
and that really hasn't worked
out for you, has it?

1194
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:35,033
Not until you got out of your own head
and you helped someone else.

1195
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,036
lt's funny how that works out, isn't it?

1196
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,205
How, when you help someone else,
you heal your own wound.

1197
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:48,254
l have an opportunity in a little town
down south that needs a mechanic.

1198
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,216
-You interested?
-l don't know.

1199
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,147
Okay, l'll go.

1200
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,485
Come on.

1201
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:19,452
Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, l'm with you.
l'm with you.

1202
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,872
-You ever been on a Ferris wheel?
-What's that?

1203
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:25,249
You know, for someone
who pretty much knows everything,

1204
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,793
you sure don't know much.

1205
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,420
-lt's pretty ironic, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

1206
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,048
l think it makes life more delicious.

1207
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:33,966
Yes, it does.

1208
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,388
Jake, l think we're going to
get along just fine.

1209
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,521
