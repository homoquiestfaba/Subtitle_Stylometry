(inmates chattering)

72
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,879
Do you have any idea how I was able

73
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,061
to hold down the street to
my city for all that time?

74
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:53,275
This nigga go stalling and shit.

75
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,262
What's up, man?

76
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,029
I figured out the key to life.

77
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,048
- Um-hmm.
- And it was real simple.

78
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:04,049
See now, you don't have to be
the strongest or the smartest

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,407
or even the quickest to
be epic in this life.

80
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:10,491
What you gotta be then?

81
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,628

82
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:18,723

(blows thudding)
(foreboding music)

84
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:30,009
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa.

85
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:37,797
See the thing about paying
somebody to protect you,

86
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:40,073
it's that there's a price to
be paid for that protection.

87
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:43,428
It ain't fear, it ain't
love, it's just money.

88
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:46,442
And the funny thing about that

89
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:49,943
is that there's always somebody with more.

90
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,620
(blows thudding)

91
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,371
Can you get this cleaned up for me please?

92
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,372

93
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,451

96
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,105
All the walls is talking.

97
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,353
Oh, yeah?

98
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,498

99
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,148

100
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,460

103
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:59,063

104
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,899

106
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:04,078
I know how that go.

107
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,591
Give him that.

108
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,138
That's a number.

109
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,226
When you get outside,

110
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,200
I want you to call that number.

111
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,665
When you get to Houston,

112
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,698
I want you to let them know who sent you.

113
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,032
They gonna take care of you.

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,447
Okay, bet.

115
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:28,198

118
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:42,735
You can't trust a soldier
that's only loyal to the dollar.

119
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:45,543

172
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,687
Please tell me again, why
did we send him in there?

173
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,299
Obviously, he wasn't
man enough for the job.

174
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Hey.

175
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:12,565

Hmm.

00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,160
Did you get anything we could use?

180
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,661
You already know the answer.

181
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:42,522
So, this is what we need to
know about the Jones Brothers.

(car engine roaring)

183
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,832
Lamar Jones, the eldest of the brothers,

184
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,923
and although we have no physical proof,

185
00:08:56,924 --> 00:09:00,380
word is Lamar is the
brain of the operation.

186
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:03,518
Did six years for drug
distribution when he was 18.

187
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,436
But since he's been out, his
record has been squeaky clean.

188
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,785
Lamar owns a rehabilitation facility

189
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,653
where he teaches the neighborhood kids

190
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,252
how to box and play sports.

191
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,091
But we have an informant that tell us

192
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,730
Lamar is still very much
into the narcotic game.

00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:29,418
(gentle music)

360
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,958
(door creaks)

361
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:03,144
(gentle music continues)

362
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,067
(plastic crinkling)

363
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,345
(birds chirping)

364
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,226
I'm about to introduce
you to my girl, Kenya.

365
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:45,091
She's the common ground

366
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,929
between my family and the partners.

367
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,126
So, you don't do business
with them directly?

368
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:56,127
Long story, but we ain't
got the best history.

369
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:01,257
And on top of that, them
niggas trust is shit.

370
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,258
Heard.

371
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,949
(dog barking)

372
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,162
(knocking on door)

373
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,888
(blinds clanking)

374
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,193
Hello to you, too.

375
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Hey.

376
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,638
What you got for me today?

377
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,443
Huh, yeah, right.

378
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,027
Where the money at?

379
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,359
This Clarence.

380
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,093
He was locked up with my old man.

381
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:32,344
Came to Houston to see how
the real hustlers do it.

382
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:35,165
Nice to meet you, Clarence.

383
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,166
I'm Kenya.

384
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,054
Nice to meet you, too.

385
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:45,791
Well look, glad to see
y'all getting along and shit,

386
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,577
'cause he gonna be
staying here for a minute.

387
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:49,745
- What?
- What?

388
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,988
You can put your bag in, in the back.

389
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:53,989
It's cool.

390
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,120
What the fuck, Melvin?

391
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,881
Look, this ain't no motherfucking daycare.

392
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:07,161
I'm not about to be
watching no grown-ass man.

393
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,125
You ain't look like

394
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,792
you was having a problem
watching him to me.

395
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:16,925
Look, don't let him out of your sight.

396
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:18,707
If he checks out,

397
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,356
and you say we can trust him,

398
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:21,717
then we bring him in.

399
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:22,801
And if not?

400
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:27,412
Shit, either way he's out of your house.

401
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,210
Fuck!

402
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,247
I didn't know.

403
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:53,572
I know, but it's cool.

404
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,906
I just don't like surprises, that's all.

405
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,767
But you're here now.

406
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:02,702
That's the restroom through
that door over there.

407
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,226
There's a shower and everything.

408
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:07,060
If you need anything, let me know.

409
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:26,211
(Clarence sighs)

410
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,357
We already talked about this.

411
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,570
Come on, man, just let me see him.

412
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,614
Look, you said I could see him.

413
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,448
[Melvin] I told you

414
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,807
how this shit gonna work.

415
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:38,697
My way or no way.
(Clarence clears throat)

416
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,125
Fuck, you understand?

417
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,876
(Kenya whimpers)

418
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:47,245
Just, just let me see him.

419
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,451
I just wanna see him.

420
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:49,851
Look, I promise I won't leave this time.

421
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,619
And fuck all that.

422
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,251
You lucky I ain't kill you last time

423
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:55,094
and left you on your cousin doorstep.

424
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:57,101
The shit you're doing,
the shit is uncalled for.

425
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,341
It's different this time.

426
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,592
How the fuck is different?

427
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:00,907
I did everything you asked.

428
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:04,780
'Cause you ain't have no fucking choice.

429
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:07,793
Look, we got some unfinished
business with your uncle.

430
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:11,397
When that's all wrapped up you
get to see your fucking son.

431
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:12,398
Fuck.

432
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,641
(Kenya cries)

433
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:27,735
(somber music)

434
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:39,477
(car engine revs)

435
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,766
(melancholy music)

436
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,584
Who was that?

437
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,354
Nobody.

438
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,022
Just go back to bed.

439
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:11,016
(Kenya whimpers)
(melancholy music continues)

440
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:15,974
(skillet sizzling)

441
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,853
(utensil rattling)

442
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:52,853
Ahem.

443
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:57,006
Hmm, just made yourself at home, huh?

444
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:58,007
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:02,642
I just thought you needed
a home-cooked meal.

446
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:04,977
You cook?

447
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:08,404
Pancakes and eggs.

448
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:12,171
What?

449
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,171
It's not gonna kill you.

450
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,673
It's not that.

451
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:20,005
I just never had a man cook for me before.

452
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,535
Well, good.

453
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:22,670
Then I'm the first.

454
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:26,358
(chuckles) Nah, nigga you ain't special.

455
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,367
Nah, I mean, if I'm the first,

456
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,868
then I'm the best.

457
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,960
Well, if these eggs ain't
good, you're disqualified.

458
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,511
All right, all right.

459
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:49,595
(laughs) I'm back in the game.

460
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:52,415
You gonna try this too?

461
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:01,628
It's good, ain't it?

462
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,945
(Kenya chuckles)

463
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,113

485
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:58,393
The new girl with the big old booty.

486
00:27:58,394 --> 00:27:59,394
Nicole?

487
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:05,384
Little bro, don't even waste your time.

488
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,031
You cut or something?

489
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:08,310

500
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,507
Look man, I know y'all got
your ways of doing things

501
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,591
and I get it.

502
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,795
I feel like I'm wasting my time.

503
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,395
You know the people that run this show,

and we don't take no chances.

507
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:53,241
Hmm.

508
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:56,453

(window whines)

514
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:45,563
Hop in the driver's seat.

515
00:29:45,564 --> 00:29:46,564
Follow me.

516
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,450
All right.

517
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:57,337

518
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:13,178
(engine rumbling)

519
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,559
Let's go.

520
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,155
What about the car?

521
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,975
It'll sit there for a couple of days,

522
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,726
then it'll disappear.

523
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,592
Let's go.

524
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,184
(engine rumbling)

525
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:56,009
(upbeat music)

526
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,498
Gentlemen, a toast.

527
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:13,297
To better business,

528
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:17,965
better sex,

529
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,522
and better luck.

530
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,080
(speaking in foreign language). Salute.

531
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:30,339
Salute.

532
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,757
(upbeat music continues)

533
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,510
[Marcus] Kenya, I need to holler at you.

534
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,094
Okay, about what?

535
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,364
Who the fuck is this nigga, man?

536
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:06,767
Ah, shit.

537
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,952
I'm right here man.

538
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:10,854
You can ask me.
Yeah.

539
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:11,687
Yeah.

540
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:12,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa.

541
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:13,512

Look, it's nothing.

549
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,435
All I know is that Melvin
brought him to the house

550
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:34,962
and said Big Dog wanted him to
get familiar with the family.

551
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,186
That's it.

552
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:37,437
Whose family?

553
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:42,073

00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:04,923
I'm just saying, he's nice, respectful.

721
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:05,916
You can tell he ain't been

722
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,001
through the shit we've been through.

723
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,003
He the law.

724
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:10,479
No he's not.

725
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,976
I ain't saying all that.
You ain't have to.

726
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:15,757
All I'm saying is that he's
nicer than what I'm used to.

727
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:18,667
Look, we trust your uncle.

728
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:21,079
He wouldn't send the feds our way.

729
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,739
I know that.

730
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,078
But I don't know him,

731
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,741
and I don't trust shit I don't know.

732
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,401
And what you want me to do about it?

733
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,902
Get to know him like only a woman would.

734
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,803
Eventually he'll start pillow talking

735
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:38,061
and tell all the business.

736
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,812
But, if he check out,
show him the kingdom.

737
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,036
(rap music)

738
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,867
What happened? I don't understand.

739
00:41:58,868 --> 00:41:59,838
We was good.

740
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,500
What did they tell you
to make you wanna stop?

741
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:02,497
I don't understand.

742
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:03,330
What happened?

743
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,163
Look, I don't wanna,

744
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:05,705
I don't wanna talk about it.

745
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:06,745
I know.

746
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:09,075
I know you just met me, all right.

747
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,768
Hey, I know you just met me,

748
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:11,867
and I'm not gonna tell you to trust me.

749
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:13,942
Hell, I don't know if I
should be trusting you,

750
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:16,335
but what I do know is you
deserve better than that.

751
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,169
Oh yeah?

752
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,258
How you know what I deserve, huh?

753
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,700
I know you don't deserve that,

754
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:23,368
not from them, not from anybody.

755
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:26,805
And who you supposed to be.

756
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:29,056
My knight in shining armor?

757
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:33,150
That's what you're using, right?

758
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,630
I never leave you, bae.

759
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:39,747
I love you bae, going on shopping sprees

760
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:41,581
and trips every month.

761
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
I'll never hit you, bae.

762
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:47,921
I treat you like a queen, bae.

763
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:49,706
That's what you're saying, right?

764
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:50,813
Fuck outta here.

765
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:54,145
Wow, somebody really fucked you up,

766
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:55,229
and I get it.

767
00:42:56,594 --> 00:42:58,438
And you get the short end of the stick

768
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:00,272
time after time again.

769
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,244
But you don't deserve that.

770
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:07,822
I do deserve it.

771
00:43:07,823 --> 00:43:09,851
You have no clue who I am.

772
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,102
Then tell me.

773
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,319
Why you so scared?

774
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,647
Because if I tell you, you
gonna hang it over my head.

775
00:43:16,648 --> 00:43:17,481
Why would I do that?

776
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:20,398
Because that's what y'all all do.

777
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:24,686
That's exactly why I want you to leave.

778
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:25,950
Just leave.

779
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,093
What?

780
00:43:27,094 --> 00:43:29,368
Get the fuck outta my house.

781
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:30,707
Why you acting like this?

782
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,585
Because every time I
start to feel like this,

783
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:35,485

(Kenya screaming)

00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,435
You know I can tell that
you're different, right?

822
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:54,554
Yeah.

823
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:55,676
Yeah.

824
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:56,510
How?

825
00:45:56,511 --> 00:45:58,208
How can you tell I'm different?

826
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:02,660
First, let's talk about
what happened last night.

827
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:03,494
Mm.

828
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,190
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

829
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,624
(both chuckling)

830
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,891
But I can tell you had
some good in your life.

831
00:46:10,892 --> 00:46:12,559
I mean, unlike mine.

832
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:15,057
Hmm.

833
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,856
Anyway.

834
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:21,091
I can tell by the way you walk,

835
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:23,819
the way you talk,

836
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,618
and how you treat a woman.

837
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:33,669
And everything you say, so genuine.

838
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:36,795
Look,

839
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,595
I know I just met you but,

840
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:47,052
I feel like you're the
only person I can trust.

841
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:52,922
What's wrong?

842
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:54,912
Nothing.

843
00:46:57,891 --> 00:47:00,629
What's up with old boy who
came over here the other night?

844
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,365
What you mean?

845
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:04,233
I mean y'all used to date or something,

846
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:06,885
'cause I mean from what I saw,

847
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:09,219
things seem pretty personal?

848
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,682
Can we please talk about something else?

849
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:15,683
Yeah.

850
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:18,510
Let's talk about how you can trust me,

851
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:20,417
but you won't allow me to trust you.

852
00:47:20,418 --> 00:47:21,418
What?

853
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:25,428
Clarence.

854
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:26,472
Clarence.

855
00:47:26,473 --> 00:47:27,473
Clarence.

856
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:38,207
What are you doing?

857
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,397
I thought you was different.

858
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,668
So you saying I'm not?

859
00:47:40,669 --> 00:47:41,962
No, you not different.

860
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:43,765
You just like every other
girl running around here,

861
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:46,798
dumping her problems off on
anybody who willing to help.

862
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:48,112
I put myself through that shit before.

863
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:49,282
I ain't doing it again.

864
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,124
From now on, whatever energy
I get, I'm giving back.

865
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,992
What are you even
talking about Clarence?

866
00:47:53,993 --> 00:47:56,390
You know what I'm talking about.

867
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:57,807
Exactly.

868
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,308
(Kenya cries)

869
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,115
What's going on?

870
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,424
I can't say anything.

871
00:48:08,425 --> 00:48:10,439
Look, my son life depends on it.

872
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,107
Where is your son?

873
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:15,149
(cries) I can't tell you.

874
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,491
It's complicated.

875
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:18,242
What's complicated?

876
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:22,117
(somber music)

877
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:27,784
Tell me something.

878
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,407
When I was younger

879
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:33,859
I had a baby.

880
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:39,225
My baby daddy wasn't shit,

881
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:44,459
but I loved him so.

882
00:48:46,394 --> 00:48:48,397
I guess I wasn't shit either.

883
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:52,065
He stashed a brick in
my car for a drop off.

884
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,624
But later that night a friend of ours

885
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:01,458
came to our house and
told me he was murdered.

886
00:49:07,454 --> 00:49:10,371
They shot him over a fucking chain.

887
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,393
I grabbed my keys

888
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,926
and hopped in the car

889
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:28,010
and rushed out the house.

890
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,549
I tried to get to where he
was as soon as possible.

891
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,580
It wasn't until I got there

892
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,053
I realized I,

893
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:46,665
I'm just gonna be raising my son alone.

894
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:51,750
That I actually forgot my
baby at home by himself.

895
00:49:55,937 --> 00:49:58,298
So I hop back in the car,

896
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,594
and I started speeding on the freeway.

897
00:50:01,595 --> 00:50:03,735
Just trying to get home to him.

898
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:06,236
Just to make sure he was safe.

899
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:13,055
But on my way I got stopped by the cops.

900
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,978
They saw the blood all over my clothes,

901
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,812
so they decided to search the car.

902
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:26,495
And they found the dope.

903
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:27,496
Yep.

904
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:31,930
But we got a friend.

905
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,147
He claimed he was so
fucking loyal to Blaze.

906
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,166
He took the charge.

907
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:48,421
He said it was so I
could get home to my son.

908
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:51,005
(Kenya crying)

909
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,590
When I got there

910
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:54,591
my baby was,

911
00:50:56,688 --> 00:50:57,771
he was sleep.

912
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,472
He was safe, sleeping all peacefully.

913
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:08,743
But the fucked up part is,

914
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:15,108
I've been paying for it ever since.

915
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:24,166
What that got to do with old boy?

916
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:26,724
Marcus?

917
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,167
His name is Marcus.

918
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:36,502
He's one of our friends too.

919
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:43,772
But the guy who took the charge,

920
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:48,946
it's Marcus's big brother at the bar.

921
00:51:52,788 --> 00:51:55,608
They've been controlling
my life ever since.

922
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:58,192
(Kenya crying)

923
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:06,943

00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:06,111

I'm ready.

952
00:53:09,448 --> 00:53:10,448
Let's go.

953
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:14,155

This right here is
what we call the factory.

959
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:28,482
This where all the shipments come in first

960
00:53:28,483 --> 00:53:31,949
before they broke it down
into two different groups.

961
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,190
That over there?

962
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:34,471
That?

963
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:37,694
That's what stays in the city.

964
00:53:37,695 --> 00:53:40,612
And this, this is what we ship out.

965
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:44,774
How you ship this out?

966
00:53:44,775 --> 00:53:47,568
Now that's the answer that
nobody in this room knows.

967
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:49,069
Hell, not even me.

968
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:54,658
So how do the police
not know about this place?

969
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:55,849
Hmm.

970
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,910
We're always under surveillance.

971
00:53:57,911 --> 00:54:00,440
So how we move is important.

972
00:54:00,441 --> 00:54:03,759
Detective might see a woman
walking the sub apartment,

973
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,183
but it's all just the front,

974
00:54:05,184 --> 00:54:07,920
because we own 70% of the building.

975
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:10,229
We have underground tunnels that are

976
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,120
for each and every operation.

977
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,446
Workers go into one door

978
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:19,195
and then go into an apartment
that no one knows about.

979
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:20,544
So the police would have to raid

980
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:22,720
every apartment on the first floor.

981
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:23,721
Exactly.

982
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,800
What about the cash?

983
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:31,470
Second floor.

984
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,682
So what's this place called?

985
00:54:36,683 --> 00:54:37,683
This?

986
00:54:40,256 --> 00:54:42,091
This is called the gardens.

987
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:42,989
Hmm.

988
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,996
Looks like a nursery.

989
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:49,076
You know these are the
apartments that I grew up in.

990
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,476
For it to be so-called
for the poor people,

991
00:54:52,477 --> 00:54:56,060
shit I never seen so
much money in my life.

992
00:54:58,137 --> 00:55:01,838
You know, if I can grow into
a rose from this concrete,

993
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,089
it ain't shit you can't do.

994
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:08,134
So when do we get started?

995
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:13,805
All right.

996
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,429

Yeah, but he don't know y'all like I do.

1029
00:56:39,756 --> 00:56:41,173

Tomas, we're friends.

1046
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,243
I was told that your
brother was seen in town

1047
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:35,440
setting up a meeting with my competition.

1048
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,524
Is that true?

1049
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,000
It's not so much a competition.

1050
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:43,756
I mean you're here for another 10 years.

1051
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:46,464
Look, besides you're
making millions of dollars

1052
00:57:46,465 --> 00:57:47,728

1059

1060
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:08,336
you and I would not.

1061
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:27,771

Shit.

1062
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:41,617

1069
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,804
We? We ain't doing
a motherfucking thing.

1070
00:58:57,805 --> 00:58:59,935

motherfucker, you hear me.

1071

00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:30,178
he may have been robbed of several cases

1080
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:32,401
of prescription narcotic medication.

1081
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,392
[Reporter] I'm looking
at who I think it was.

1082
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:34,819
You know there was
nothing I could do, right?

1083
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,548
But you could have told me something.

1084
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:37,618
Give me a heads up.

1085
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,452
Anything.

1086
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,306
A heads up?

1087
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:42,872
Clarence, look, I really, really like you,

1088
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:44,532
but you know there's no way I can mix

1089
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:46,698
business with pleasure.

1090
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:48,874
If they found out I was
giving you information,

1091
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,252
man they'll kill me.

1092
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:54,253
And you know I got too much to lose.

1093
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:07,624
You know no matter what
I'm gonna protect you, right?

1094
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,599
From who?

1095
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:09,599
Marcus?

1096
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:14,380
Not just him,

1097
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,964
anyone or anything.

1098
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:20,538
You're so cute.

1099
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,463
(phone vibrating)

1100
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:55,216
(soft jazzy music)

1101
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:15,848
(elevator bell dings)

1102
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:26,530
Look, just remember, don't
ask no questions, okay.

1103
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:28,498
Just try to blend in and have fun.

1104
01:01:28,499 --> 01:01:31,884
I mean this is a very,
very important event.

1105
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:33,922
All the important people are here,

1106
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,633
and you're this close to
being a part of the family.

1107
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:39,031
Don't fuck this up.

1108
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:42,032
(soft lounge music)

1109
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:55,319
Put me in the game, coach.

1110
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:05,889
(laughing) So I heard
that the owner of this house

1111
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:07,881
is a Mexican drug lord.

1112
01:02:07,882 --> 01:02:10,091
And he throws this party every year

1113
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:13,822
just to get in good with the locals.

1114
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:15,054
Excuse my wife.

1115
01:02:15,055 --> 01:02:18,420
Alcohol seems to give her
a bit of a imagination.

1116
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:19,921
No, it does not.

1117
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:24,288
Whoever it is, I heard he's loaded.

1118
01:02:24,289 --> 01:02:26,699
Yeah, perhaps I heard he had

1119
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,590
bits of powerful friends as well.

1120
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:32,341
(gasps) Is that the mayor?

1121
01:02:35,356 --> 01:02:36,189
Excuse me.

1122
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,772
I'll be right back.

1123
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:40,574
Excuse me.

1124
01:02:45,014 --> 01:02:46,014
Follow me.

1125
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:50,894
(soft lounge music continues)

1126
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:16,622
Fucking serious.

1127
01:03:16,623 --> 01:03:18,357
Listen, I'm not here for you.

1128
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:20,584
There's a girl inside who
didn't make it to check in.

1129
01:03:20,585 --> 01:03:21,911
I was hoping to see her here,

1130
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,848
but there's no sign of her.

1131
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:25,516
Did you check the safe houses?

1132
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:26,415
Nothing there.

1133
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:29,238
I'm starting to think
maybe her cover was blown.

1134
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,087
Well what's her name?

1135
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:32,602
Maybe I can dig something up for you.

1136
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:34,696
You don't trust me.

1137
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:36,668
That's not protocol.

1138
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:40,644
We protect all our deep
covers with 100% anonymity.

1139
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:41,712
And that's the only way we can keep it.

1140
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:44,196
Cut the bullshit, Kim.

1141
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,324
You know as well as I know,

1142
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,612
as deep as these guys' pockets are,

1143
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:49,257
they have ways to find out other links.

1144
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:53,711
Hell, you can be a link just
as much as any one of us can.

1145
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:55,176
Give me a name.

1146
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:57,389
I'll see what I can do.

1147
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,390
Nicole.

1148
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:01,269
Wait, Nicole.

1149
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:04,816
- You knew her?
- No.

1150
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:08,487
I'm just trying to remember
where I know that name.

1151
01:04:08,488 --> 01:04:10,018
Probably the other day at the bar.

1152
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:11,823
She was the one serving the drinks.

1153
01:04:11,824 --> 01:04:12,824
Oh, okay.

1154
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:14,611
I'm sorry.

1155
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:16,379
I didn't know you were seeing someone.

1156
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,506
What?

1157
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:19,917
Your girlfriend, she
must be a lucky girl.

1158
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:21,335
Sorry, I imposed.

1159
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:27,495
Yeah, no problem.

1160
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,329
Nice seeing you again.

1161
01:04:42,152 --> 01:04:44,055
Who's that bitch?

1162
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:45,834
Oh no, that was just some woman I met

1163
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:47,070
at the club the other night.

1164
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:49,811
She said she knew me definitely,

1165
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:52,311
but I don't remember her.

1166
01:04:52,312 --> 01:04:56,312
Besides, I had to tell
her I was seeing someone.

1167
01:04:58,058 --> 01:05:00,455
I like how you don't make me crazy.

1168
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:03,941
Crazy, with all these people here?

1169
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,623
Shit, about 40 more seconds,

1170
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:09,502
I was gonna fuck it up for all of us.

1171
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:12,695
Anyways, they're about to have a toast.

1172
01:05:12,696 --> 01:05:15,075
I wouldn't miss it.

1173
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:16,487
I finna to go to the ladies room.

1174
01:05:16,488 --> 01:05:17,765
I'll meet you up there.

1175
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:19,433
- All right.
- Okay.

1176
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,189
May I help you?

1177
01:05:45,084 --> 01:05:48,289
I know exactly what you are.

1178
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,707
And what am I, little girl?

1179
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,163
You just like all the other women.

1180
01:05:54,164 --> 01:05:58,157
Want something that don't belong to them.

1181
01:05:58,158 --> 01:06:00,623
Girl, your man is too young.

1182
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,693
I was just looking for
a little excitement.

1183
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:05,277
I got your excitement, bitch.

1184
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:10,565
Wow, you had me fooled for a second.

1185
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,590
Look at you with that beautiful dress.

1186
01:06:13,591 --> 01:06:15,393
You look amazing.

1187
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:19,644
For a second I thought you
was a respectable woman.

1188
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:23,077
You can take the bitch out the hood,

1189
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:25,814
but you can't take the hood out the bitch.

1190
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,732
(foreboding music)

1191
01:06:30,168 --> 01:06:33,073
(Kenya groans)

1192
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:34,157
That bitch.

1193
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,221
As mayor of this amazing city,

1194
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:39,482
I'd like to celebrate
these two brilliant men

1195
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:41,251
for helping Houston continue its reign

1196
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:44,493
as one of the finest
cities in the country.

1197
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:47,523
Between the countless donations

1198
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:49,361
and the heartfelt contributions

1199
01:06:49,362 --> 01:06:50,850
with the inner city youth,

1200
01:06:50,851 --> 01:06:53,713
these two have achieved
their very own day.

1201
01:06:53,714 --> 01:06:56,075
So congratulate these two

1202
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:58,183
by giving them a big round of applause

1203
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:01,243
and here for today,
being known as Jones Day.

1204
01:07:01,244 --> 01:07:04,679
(audience applauding)

1205
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,168
Wow.

1206
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:08,003
Thank you for such a
prestigious honor, Mayor.

1207
01:07:08,004 --> 01:07:08,889
Appreciate it man.

1208
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,999
Looking forward to continue

1209
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,077
to building this beautiful
place we call home.

1210
01:07:12,078 --> 01:07:15,019
Thank you.
(audience applauding)

1211
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,787
I'd like to thank
everyone for coming out.

1212
01:07:16,788 --> 01:07:17,699
I'm sure y'all didn't come to hear

1213
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,398
about all the contributions
that my brothers

1214
01:07:19,399 --> 01:07:20,467
and I have done for the city.

1215
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:22,254
Y'all come to celebrate a good year.

1216
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:24,919
And what better way to
do that other than party?

1217
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,995

1231
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:57,761
Ciao.

1232
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:01,992
Everything all right?

1233
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:08,243
Yeah, will be, if we can
handle the new shipment.

1234
01:08:08,244 --> 01:08:10,183
New shipment?

1235
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:11,967
I ain't green light a new shipment.

1236
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:13,447
Neither did I.

1237
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:16,137
But evidently my people back home

1238
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:19,404
have a load that never
made it to its destination.

1239
01:08:19,405 --> 01:08:20,393
Fuck it.

1240
01:08:20,394 --> 01:08:21,476
Send it back.

1241
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,401
It's not that easy.

1242
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,775
You know this, Lamar.

1243
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:29,193
You can't just send back 600.

1244
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:37,047
You can't just ship 600
kilos back to Mexico.

1245
01:08:37,048 --> 01:08:38,940
You know this.

1246
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:42,233
You know we don't work like this.

1247
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:43,317
We need time.

1248
01:08:44,442 --> 01:08:46,245
Speaking of time,

1249
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:48,693
when that shit supposed
to get here anyway?

1250
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:49,694
Two days.

1251
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,077
Not happening.

1252
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:55,457
What's not gonna happen?

1253
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:59,208
Hernandez trying to
force a shipment on us.

1254
01:09:01,157 --> 01:09:02,430
Not happening?

1255
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:05,267
Did you forget how powerful my family is?

1256
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:07,665
What do you think they're
gonna say if you say no?

1257
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:09,916
Sound like a you problem.

1258
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:14,276
Are you ready for what might happen

1259
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:16,860
if you don't take the shipment?

1260
01:09:18,002 --> 01:09:19,543
Crazy.

1261
01:09:19,544 --> 01:09:22,644
I think I speak for my
brothers when I say this.

1262
01:09:22,645 --> 01:09:25,123
You love doing business
with you and your family,

1263
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:27,563
but we don't take orders
or lay down for nobody.

1264
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:28,922
Look, Lamar.

1265
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:33,089
No one's asking you to
lay down for anyone.

1266
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,923
Consider this a favor for a favor.

1267
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:43,221
And what exactly do we get
in return for this favor?

1268
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:44,222
See?

1269
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:46,759
Now, we're talking.

1270
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:49,241
When you take the load-

1271
01:09:49,242 --> 01:09:50,791
- If.

1272
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,459
If we take the load.

1273
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,240
If you take the load,

1274
01:09:58,249 --> 01:10:00,133
all 600 kilos will be given

1275
01:10:00,134 --> 01:10:02,713
to you at half the price.

1276
01:10:02,714 --> 01:10:05,559
And after that, the next five shipments

1277
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,736
will be delivered to you.

1278
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:08,923
I'll take full risk

1279
01:10:08,924 --> 01:10:12,206
and responsibilities for all deliveries.

1280
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:14,374
If we decide to do this,

1281
01:10:16,373 --> 01:10:17,864
we do this under our terms.

1282
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:22,292
Absolutely under your
terms, gentlemen. (laughs)

1283
01:10:22,293 --> 01:10:24,297
Now, if you don't mind,

1284
01:10:24,298 --> 01:10:27,152
I'm gonna go catch up with
a few ladies downstairs.

1285
01:10:27,153 --> 01:10:30,689
And Dedrick, man, I
always love your parties.

1286
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,273
You never lack the essentials.

1287
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:36,414
Oh, yeah, and what's that?

1288
01:10:36,415 --> 01:10:40,887
(inhales) Pussy. (laughs)

1289
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,765
This guy, man.

1290
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:46,266
Listen, I need an answer by the morning.

1291
01:10:48,836 --> 01:10:51,169
(rap music)

1292
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:55,320
So what y'all think?

1293
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:58,792
I mean, it ain't how things usually go,

1294
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,861
but half off, that's a lot.

1295
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:01,862
Shit.

1296
01:11:02,577 --> 01:11:03,651
You know how I'm rock,

1297
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:05,902
and I'm ready for whatever.

1298
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:09,047
It's a big risk, man.

1299
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:10,278
Risk?

1300
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,931
What shipment we ain't
had ain't been a risk?

1301
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:14,357
It's either gonna come with bullets

1302
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,108
or in handcuffs, man.

1303
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:21,596
Yeah, but our system
cut 90% of that risk down.

1304
01:11:22,877 --> 01:11:26,578
Bullshit, two days ain't
enough time to set up shit.

1305
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:29,708
Man, what's that shit Pop used to say?

1306
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:32,192
When confused with a choice,

1307
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:34,526
go with what helps tomorrow,

1308
01:11:36,033 --> 01:11:38,700
because
That's where we headed.

1309
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:42,425
Facts.

1310
01:11:43,489 --> 01:11:46,299
Shit, Pops ain't never led us wrong.

1311
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,278
You right about that.

1312
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:53,020
But tomorrow, let's figure out
how to make this shit happen.

1313
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:54,516
Let's get it.

1314
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,452
We do this shit right,

1315
01:11:56,453 --> 01:12:00,370
we can be bigger than
the fucking mob ever was.

1316
01:12:02,366 --> 01:12:03,366
Babe.

1317
01:12:05,512 --> 01:12:08,045
We should go see that new
movie that's out today.

1318
01:12:08,046 --> 01:12:10,860
Which movie is that again?

1319
01:12:10,861 --> 01:12:11,861
Deep Cover?

1320
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:17,171
(laughs) No, I think
the name of that movie

1321
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:18,505
was In Too Deep.

1322
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:28,798
- Where is-
- Judging by the tail

1323
01:12:28,799 --> 01:12:31,672
we put on her, she's meeting Marcus.

1324
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:32,826
But you need to be worrying

1325
01:12:32,827 --> 01:12:35,077
about where she's gonna go.

1326
01:12:36,107 --> 01:12:38,758
You know, I'll be honest with you.

1327
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:41,614
I'm highly disappointed in you.

1328
01:12:41,615 --> 01:12:43,032
William Shephard,

1329
01:12:44,472 --> 01:12:48,139
or what is it you calling
yourself nowadays?

1330
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:50,238
Clarence.

1331
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:56,304
Since you've been on this
case, you've given us nothing.

1332
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,468
Not one thread of the
information that we can use

1333
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,719
on any one of the brothers.

1334
01:13:03,053 --> 01:13:05,825
So since you can help us indict them,

1335
01:13:05,826 --> 01:13:09,409
we're just gonna go to
the next best thing.

1336
01:13:14,426 --> 01:13:15,889
Oh, you act like you don't even know

1337
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,807
what she talking about.

1338
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,192
Kenya Thompson.

1339
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:22,930
It's all there in the folder.

1340
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:25,465
Distribution of narcotics.
Mmhm.

1341
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:26,785
- Conspiracy.
- Mm-hm.

1342
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:28,527
Threatening a government agency.

1343
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:30,735
Oh and my favorite,

1344
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:33,153
the murder of Layla McKinney.

1345
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:35,306
Who?

1346
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:37,349
[Kim] Keep looking.

1347
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,922
You may know her as Nicole.

1348
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:41,157
Ah, she didn't kill Nicole.

1349
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:42,363
See the fact that you didn't

1350
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:45,119
even acknowledge her being dead,

1351
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,531
but you were reacting to the girlfriend

1352
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:51,449
tells me everything I need to know.

1353
01:13:55,574 --> 01:13:59,866
Look, you know how hard
this say is pen, right?

1354
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:01,110
And you told me to get information

1355
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:03,361
on the brothers, not Kenya.

1356
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:05,899
Now if I get Kenya outta the way,

1357
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,774
how am I gonna get to the brothers?

1358
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:11,108
There's no other way, and you know that.

1359
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,987
I know you think I'm in too deep,

1360
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,676
and that's fine.

1361
01:14:15,677 --> 01:14:18,312
But don't penalize me for
being great at my job.

1362
01:14:18,313 --> 01:14:21,288
(officer laughing)

1363
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:24,416
Once I get something that can stick,

1364
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,834
you'll know I'm on your team.

1365
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:29,688
You have 24 hours

1366
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:32,290
to get us some valuable information.

1367
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:34,838
If not by the 25th hour,

1368
01:14:34,839 --> 01:14:36,624
your precious little girlfriend will be

1369
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,818
on her way to a federal facility.

1370
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:40,600
Her son will be in a group home

1371
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,184
or wherever they send kids these days.

1372
01:14:43,185 --> 01:14:44,185
And you,

1373
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:50,108
you might just find yourself
behind bars with her.

1374
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,706
You know what, Will,

1375
01:14:53,707 --> 01:14:55,187
I ain't gonna lie to you.

1376
01:14:55,188 --> 01:14:57,772
I cannot help you this time,

1377
01:14:57,773 --> 01:14:59,940
but you can help yourself.

1378
01:15:02,991 --> 01:15:04,324
Get us something

1379
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:06,675
real solid.

1380
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,470
All of this go away.

1381
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:15,226
Come on, Kim.

1382
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:17,977
Let's go get something for lunch.

1383
01:15:34,575 --> 01:15:35,575

Man, mind your business, man.

01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:37,779
Hey bro, for real.

1407
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,604
I think they got some top secret
shit going on, you hear me.

1408
01:16:40,605 --> 01:16:42,409
Shit, gotta be.

1409
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,993
Why you say that?

1410
01:16:45,044 --> 01:16:47,744
'Cause all them niggas
pull up at the same time?

1411
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:50,162
Man, that shit don't go, bro.

1412
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:53,221
What you think going on?

1413
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:54,748
You ask a lot of questions, nigga.

1414
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:56,105
You feel it.

1415
01:16:56,106 --> 01:16:58,779
Nigga, we don't get paid
to ask no questions on what.

1416
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,925
Fuck we get paid for then?

1417
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:04,948
In a minute you gonna find out.

1418
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:06,282
For shit sure.

1419
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,684
[Reporter] Fighting broke out overnight

1420
01:17:10,685 --> 01:17:13,948
between rival factions along
the Israeli Syrian border.

1421
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:14,949
Hey, baby.

1422
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:17,705
I am so, so, so tired.

1423
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:21,092
[Reporter] And 13 civilians.

1424
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:22,705
How was your day?

1425
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:24,312
Boring as shit.

1426
01:17:24,313 --> 01:17:25,371
[Reporter] Reported to have made it back

1427
01:17:25,372 --> 01:17:28,042
to their headquarters.
What did you do?

1428
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:28,895
Nothing.

1429
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:31,836
Just did a bunch of drop
offs and pickups all day.

1430
01:17:31,837 --> 01:17:33,247
That's it?

1431
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,499
Yep.

1432
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,142
You should be happy.

1433
01:17:36,143 --> 01:17:38,157
Did I told you the
deeper you get into this

1434
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:40,555
harder it is to get out.

1435
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:42,215
Like quicksand.

1436
01:17:42,216 --> 01:17:43,647
What?

1437
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:44,648
Nothing.

1438
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,195
Anything worth mentioning?

1439
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,319
Yeah, but I gotta question first.

1440
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,241
[Reporter] Animal rights
activists have been pushing for-

1441
01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:57,385
- If I asked you, drop everything

1442
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,886
and run away and start a new life with me?

1443
01:18:06,074 --> 01:18:08,045
What about your son?

1444
01:18:08,046 --> 01:18:09,129
About that.

1445
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,973
So I spoke with Marcus today.

1446
01:18:12,974 --> 01:18:15,230
He told me after I do
this last drop with him,

1447
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:18,372
then I'll be able to get my son.

1448
01:18:18,373 --> 01:18:19,373
Last drop.

1449
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,713
Dang, all these questions.

1450
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:27,519
But you know what, they don't even matter.

1451
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,922
He wants me to run a
decoy shipment with him.

1452
01:18:31,923 --> 01:18:33,491
Decoy shipment?

1453
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:35,488
[Reporter] Was out for
three hours in Eastern Metro

1454
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:36,405
because of down-

1455
01:18:36,406 --> 01:18:38,308
- He said we were gonna do a drop

1456
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:39,472
and sit and wait.

1457
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:41,186
[Reporter] No injuries were reported.

1458
01:18:41,187 --> 01:18:43,243
Cleanup is expected to
take at least two days.

1459
01:18:43,244 --> 01:18:45,827
Then after that I'm done,

1460
01:18:45,828 --> 01:18:47,161
completely done.

1461
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:49,625
[Reporter] And there was another

1462
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:51,883
drive by shooting today downtown.

1463
01:18:51,884 --> 01:18:55,791
I can only get my hands
on like 50 Gs though.

1464
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,023
It's something.

1465
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,445
[Reporter] Unconscious but
expected to recover fully

1466
01:18:59,446 --> 01:19:00,665
and should be able to help with-

1467
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:01,666
- What?

1468
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:07,572
I've been saving this
for about three years.

1469
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:09,483
[Clarence] How much is this?

1470
01:19:09,484 --> 01:19:10,484
About 2.2.

1471
01:19:11,907 --> 01:19:12,907
Million?

1472
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:16,740
Look, we can take this
money, start a new life.

1473
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:19,919
Hell, I can even put my
baby in private school.

1474
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,841
And make more babies.

1475
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:23,259
Ooh. Come here.

1476
01:19:24,836 --> 01:19:28,959
[Reporter] Chances are we're
in for another riot tomorrow.

1477
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,765
The benefits of laughter.

1478
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,599
It's no secret that...

1479
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:53,793
Clarence, we figured
you see things our way.

1480
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:55,027
What you got for us?

1481
01:19:55,028 --> 01:19:56,119
Not much really.

1482
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,225
But it might be something.

1483
01:19:57,226 --> 01:20:01,018
It's gonna have to be, because
it's the best I've got.

1484
01:20:01,019 --> 01:20:03,960
There's gonna be a decoy
shipment going out tomorrow.

1485
01:20:03,961 --> 01:20:05,490
Are you kidding me?

1486
01:20:05,491 --> 01:20:06,574
A decoy load?

1487
01:20:07,874 --> 01:20:09,845
He's a fucking waste of time.

1488
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:10,846
Hey.

1489
01:20:13,926 --> 01:20:15,502
And think about it.

1490
01:20:15,503 --> 01:20:16,831
Why would they go through all that trouble

1491
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:18,716
with the decoy load
unless they didn't want

1492
01:20:18,717 --> 01:20:21,550
to get caught with the real thing?

1493
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:25,040
Continue.

1494
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,994
So the decoy load is meant to send you

1495
01:20:26,995 --> 01:20:29,411
in the other direction
of the real shipment.

1496
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:32,148
So all you have to do is figure out

1497
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:33,704
which one is the decoy load.

1498
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:36,288
So you know who the decoy is.

1499
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:39,592
All right.

1500
01:20:39,593 --> 01:20:40,632
But you gotta promise me

1501
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:42,454
that you won't put charges on Kenya.

1502
01:20:42,455 --> 01:20:43,624
Done.

1503
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,156
We never cared about her anyway.

1504
01:20:45,157 --> 01:20:47,976
We just needed you to do your job.

1505
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,283
You know what?

1506
01:20:49,284 --> 01:20:50,867
Hold on one second.

1507
01:20:51,703 --> 01:20:55,746
Everything's gonna be just
fine, if you can stop this load.

1508
01:20:55,747 --> 01:21:00,747
Kenya will be exonerated of all
charges predated from today.

1509
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:05,642
Kenya and Marcus are
gonna be in the decoy truck.

1510
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:07,102
Now, I don't know where
the real one is going,

1511
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:09,142
but I know it's not going be with them.

1512
01:21:09,143 --> 01:21:11,976
You better hope this checks out.

1513
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,340
Go ahead.

1514
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:10,399
We got movement.

1515
01:22:18,178 --> 01:22:19,928
You see what I see?

1516
01:22:32,223 --> 01:22:33,806
Kenya and Marcus.

1517
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:38,339
We gonna catch them red handed.

1518
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,423
We got 'em.

1519
01:23:05,933 --> 01:23:07,566
[Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

1520
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:09,921
Oh my god, oh my god.

1521
01:23:09,922 --> 01:23:12,971
I just saw a man force a
white woman into a car.

1522
01:23:12,972 --> 01:23:14,399
[Dispatcher] Have you been harmed?

1523
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,333
Are you okay?
Uhhuh, uh-huh.

1524
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,851
[Dispatcher] What is your location?

1525
01:23:16,852 --> 01:23:18,195
We're going down I-10 west now.

1526
01:23:18,196 --> 01:23:20,204
We're following them.

1527
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:21,515
[Dispatcher] We're sending units now.

1528
01:23:21,516 --> 01:23:22,516

(intense music)

1549
01:24:00,687 --> 01:24:03,854

(ominous music)

1554
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:15,488
Waste of tax dollars.

1555
01:24:16,579 --> 01:24:20,079
(ominous music continues)

1556
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:37,009
I appreciate it.

1557
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,865
You did everything I asked you to do.

1558
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:42,197
Don't I always come through for you?

1559
01:24:42,198 --> 01:24:45,899
Oh, I been meaning to
ask you about old boy.

1560
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,233
Who, Clarence?

1561
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,137
You love him?

1562
01:24:51,122 --> 01:24:52,928
We vibing.

1563
01:24:52,929 --> 01:24:54,512
Just vibing, huh?

1564
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:58,065
Did you know he was a cop?

1565
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,825
(soft tense music)

1566
01:25:00,826 --> 01:25:01,826
A cop?

1567
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,975
Nah, I don't believe that.

1568
01:25:06,795 --> 01:25:09,106
I mean, ain't no way he a cop.

1569
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:10,799
He can't be a cop.

1570
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,050
The crazy part I know you ain't know.

1571
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,850
A cop.

1572
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,570
No.

1573
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:23,687
All that fucking pillow talking.

1574
01:25:23,688 --> 01:25:27,271
You ain't leave me no
motherfucking choice.

1575
01:25:30,977 --> 01:25:34,195
Come on, Marcus. (cries)

1576
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:36,965
You know I ain't know he was a cop.

1577
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:39,037
Marcus, come on.

1578
01:25:39,038 --> 01:25:41,650
Marcus, you been knowing me my whole life.

1579
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:43,132
That's the fucked up part, Kenya.

1580
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:45,476
I really trusted you.

1581
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:47,945
You know you don't
have to do this, right?

1582
01:25:47,946 --> 01:25:48,779
You don't.

1583
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,935
You don't have to do this.

1584
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,186
Marcus, please.

1585
01:25:53,076 --> 01:25:56,231
(Kenya cries)

1586
01:25:56,232 --> 01:25:58,899
Look, I'll disappear, all right.

1587
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:02,067
You know it don't work like that Kenya.

1588
01:26:02,068 --> 01:26:04,281
Can't betray my brothers for you.

1589
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:07,389
Marcus, you know I
didn't know he was a cop.

1590
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:09,381
Marcus, you know I didn't know that.

1591
01:26:09,382 --> 01:26:11,946
Marcus, please. What about my son?

1592
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:14,290
If you kill me, who's
gonna take care of my baby.

1593
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:16,006
Marcus, come on.

1594
01:26:16,007 --> 01:26:17,318
Fuck Kenya.

1595
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:18,402
I don't know.

1596
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:24,237
(Kenya cries)
(somber music)

1597
01:26:26,937 --> 01:26:29,478
(gun fires)

1598
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:33,062
(downcast music continues)

1599
01:26:58,108 --> 01:27:01,025
(knocking on door)

1600
01:27:25,985 --> 01:27:27,176
Yo, what's up fellas.

1601
01:27:27,177 --> 01:27:29,198
It's about Kenya, man.

1602
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,676
Come on.

1603
01:27:30,677 --> 01:27:31,844
What happened?

1604
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:36,246
You still trying to
see how we live, huh?

1605
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:37,747
Of course he is.

1606
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:40,998
Do I have a choice?

1607
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:44,660
(gun cocks)
Not today.

1608
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:46,175
See, the homie got killed

1609
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,136
for fucking with your punk ass.

1629
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:21,632
