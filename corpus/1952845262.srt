1
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:39,328
There, I saw it again

2
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:42,003
Ren! Come down from up there!

3
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,954
No, I think I see someone out there!

4
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:47,601
Ren, enough foolishness!

5
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,232
Do I have to drag you inside?

6
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:55,561
Wait! If somebody's out there, I have to make sure!

7
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:01,829
So where is this fool who would brave such a storm?

8
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,241
There, by the rocks!

9
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:12,602
Look!

10
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,154
He's alive, he made it to the shore!

11
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:19,883
Ren, wait!

12
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,009
No, Bloth, you'll never take me again!

13
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,457
You're safe now, old man. I'm a friend.

14
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,429
Blast his soul to the abyss, he's been helped!

15
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,834
He was your charge and you allowed him to escape!

16
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:59,496
Bloth, most majesty!

17
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,691
For 17 years I have guarded him and never a mistake!

18
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,633
I took my eye off him for but a moment...

19
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:09,562
And a moment is all you've left to live.

20
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,996
No, NO!

21
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,407
Eat well, my pet!

22
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,118
Are you hungry?

23
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,696
I'll make you a deal...

24
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,262
Tell me, this is Octopon.

25
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:32,242
It is.

26
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,888
Then the circle is complete...

27
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,897
Come on, let me get you inside.

28
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:39,482
There's no time.

29
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:45,841
Look to Octopon...what do you see?

30
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,570
I s-see the c-city reborn!

31
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,052
No, you see your destiny.

32
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:57,628
Only you can bring our city back to its former glory.

33
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,534
Go to the one called Alomar.

34
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:05,683
Tell him Primus has escaped the pirate king Bloth.

35
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,452
Alomar? Where will I find this man?

36
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:15,124
Seek him in fire and smoke, Ren...my son.

37
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,260
Old man!

38
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:37,630
So all I could do was comfort him in his final moments.

39
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,635
Clearly he'd lost his mind, but...

40
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,635
for some reason I felt a powerful bond with him.

41
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:46,076
It's because he knew you, Ren.

42
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,676
It was I who looked after you these 17 years,

43
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:54,960
but it was Primus the King who fulfilled his prophecy and returned to his son.

44
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:56,988
He was your father.

45
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:58,399
My father?

46
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:02,825
And that which was his is now yours.

47
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,518
What is my role in this prophecy?

48
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,859
You've spent your youth tending the flames of this lighthouse.

49
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:13,538
Now you will be the guiding light for all Octopon.

50
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,454
If you know all this, then you must know where
I can find the one called Alomar.

51
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:21,832
The one you seek dwells within the Abbey of Galdebar.

52
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,333
Ren!

53
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,844
Let me go, let me go you

54
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:00,094
My meal looks...undercooked.

55
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:05,156
Just one moment, what about my food? We had a deal!

56
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:09,285
The deal was for you to bring me the old man.

57
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,575
Old man, young man, what's the difference?

58
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,328
I wanna be fed!

59
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:20,125
Niddler, when have I ever lied to you?

60
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:23,732
I'll feed you, to the constrictus!

61
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,359
Put an end to him!

62
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,992
This won't be the last you see of me, fish-lips!

63
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,185
I apologize for this outburst.

64
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:58,474
I hope my guest understands that the pressures of leadership weigh heavily.

65
00:06:58,715 --> 00:06:59,849
Why have you brought me here?

66
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:04,238
I saw your heroic rescue of the old man. I had to meet you!

67
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,555
Did you know him?

68
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,617
Intimately.

69
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:10,873
He was a long term...guest of mine.

70
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:12,665
Then...you would be Bloth.

71
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:18,752
Yes...but you have me at a disadvantage. I don't know who you are.

72
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,506
That's not important.

73
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh, but it is if the old man told you more than my name

74
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:27,190
secrets, perhaps?

75
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:31,153
Then why should I tell his jailer information he died to protect?

76
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,380
Enough of this dancing about!

77
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:37,549
The old man hid the Thirteen Treasures of Rule within the realm of Dark Water

78
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,455
and I mean to have them!

79
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:40,900
You won't get any help from me!

80
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,789
What? The Treasure's no good to a dead man

81
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,167
why won't you join me?

82
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,779
The old man was my father.

83
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:54,002
Was he now? And I thought I had eliminated all his heirs

84
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:58,264
well, here's an opportunity to finish the job!

85
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,367
He is as stubborn as his father.

86
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,123
Stop him!

87
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:44,425
Noo!

88
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,923
Bloth, you'll have to do better than that to catch me!

89
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,136
I shouldn't have been so quick to boast...

90
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:26,175
You can run no farther, Son of Primus.

91
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,223
Well, looks like you're in a bit of a spot!

92
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,417
Yes, and I wonder who it was that got me into it?

93
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,898
If you want revenge against Bloth, help me escape!

94
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:44,240
After them!

95
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,751
Release the dagrons!

96
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,025
Bring me that monkeybird's head.

97
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,317
I owe you my life, Niddler.

98
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:01,961
You have my deepest thanks.

99
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,144
Keep your thanks

100
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,977
I only saved you on the chance you could find me some food.

101
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,399
But there's no time for that!

102
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:10,202
The future of Octopon in my hands!

103
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:12,827
Funny, my greep seems to be getting weaker

104
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:16,957
All right, all right! I know where we can find some food.

105
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,098
It's called the Abbey of Galdebar.

106
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,551
Galdebar? Hmm...that doesn't sound very appetizing...

107
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:31,914
Is this the place?

108
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,860
I think so!

109
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,891
I hope you're right, my stomach's growling!

110
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:46,870
But this place is deserted! You lied to me...

111
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:50,060
Who dares enter the Abbey of Galdebar?

112
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,478
Two hungry travelers!

113
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:56,114
Shh! I am Ren, son of King Primus.

114
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,938
Good story, that makes us sound important!

115
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,118
Why have you come?

116
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,139
It was the will of my father.

117
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,785
What do you seek?

118
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,137
You. Alomar.

119
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:15,476
Wrong!

120
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:17,753
Oh, bad answer!

121
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:22,241
I am not Alomar, but he is here.

122
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,889
Oh, great! Maybe now we eat!

123
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:41,450
In darkness and in light, this will be your guide.

124
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:45,417
Alomar awaits.

125
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:55,998
What kind of man would live like this?

126
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,490
Maybe he's a meat-eater.

127
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:58,928
Alomar!

128
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,326
Yes?

129
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,335
Alomar! Call off your beast!

130
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,122
I am Alomar!

131
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,196
You? I expected a

132
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:19,025
A man? You have a lot to learn, Son of Primus.

133
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,358
It is not only men who direct the fate of this world.

134
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,425
Forgive my ignorance.

135
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,377
I know of the Thirteen Treasures of Rule,

136
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:31,153
but how do I find them? And once found, what do I do with them?

137
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,684
All will be revealed.

138
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:44,701
Thirteen Treasures of Ancient Time

139
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:47,418
Thirteen Lessons of Rule in Rhyme

140
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:50,763
To find the jewels in secret places

141
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,129
Follow where the Compass faces

142
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,497
If returned from the shore beyond

143
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,572
A new day dawns for Octopon

144
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,134
But if they fall into evil hands

145
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,417
Darkness descends on all the lands

146
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,722
For these riches two shall vie

147
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,902
In the realm of Dark Water where the Treasures lie

148
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:10,808
What's that last part mean?

149
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,668
There is another seeking the Treasure of Rule.

150
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,810
Don't waste another moment, go!

151
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,322
Thank you for your cooperation, Your Holiness.

152
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,628
Flee! I will see that you're safely away!

153
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,617
Alomar! Look out!

154
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,564
You should have run, when you had the chance

155
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,401
it's too late for me

156
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:19,470
No!

157
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,831
Fifty gold pieces to the swab who takes the boy's life.

158
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,081
I want that Compass!

159
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:30,081
You'll have to earn the gold pieces before you can spend 'em!

160
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:45,574
Now's our chance! Come on!

161
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:47,145
I can't just yet!

162
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,459
Oh, please, Bloth, prince of villians,

163
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,399
monarch of the seas and all that swims and...

164
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:56,239
Monkeybird, save your breath.

165
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,979
Pretty nice marksmanship, eh, Niddler?

166
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,446
You could've skewered me!

167
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,284
Shall we go after them, Bloth?

168
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,402
No, curse you, find me some water!

169
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:13,310
The Compass is still pointing out to sea

170
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,299
so I guess the first order of business is to buy a boat.

171
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:17,410
Any ideas?

172
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:21,225
Well, if you think I'm going to carry you there, forget it!

173
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,225
No, I've got another idea...

174
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,899
You've been sitting here for over an hour.

175
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,133
If you're not going to eat, leave!

176
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,887
My friend is having trouble selecting from your large bill of fare.

177
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,870
I don't know why the innkeeper tolerates these

178
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,233
things.

179
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,749
I'll be back.

180
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,909
Maybe we should eat as long as we're here

181
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,480
Don't start that now! We can't lose sight of our

182
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:57,931
This is it.

183
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,368
I still say you're reading it wrong! This is north!

184
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,649
No! This is north!

185
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,164
Hmph, with your sense of direction, we'll never find the Treasure!

186
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:08,726
Shh.

187
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,071
Perhaps I may be of assistance?

188
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:14,063
I don't think it's any of your business!

189
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:16,558
I don't talk to mutant beasts.

190
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,668
Uh, wait wait wait, we didn't order anything.

191
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,039
No. He did.

192
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,088
A gesture of friendship.

193
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,456
What makes you think we need a friend?

194
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:32,257
These eyes can spot landlubbers
who could use the experience of a true seaman.

195
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,752
And these ears know when they hear talk of Treasure.

196
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,751
Ahh, this is men's business, off with you, wench!

197
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:41,386
You have a boat?

198
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:46,158
The finest in the harbor, for a cut of the take. 70-30?

199
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,873
80-20.

200
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:48,066
60-40!

201
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,459
50-50!

202
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:51,458
Done and done.

203
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,426
Call me Ioz.

204
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:57,165
Wait a minute! Now what do I get out of this?

205
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,952
Three meals a day, monkeybird

206
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,584
and my promise not to pluck you bald!

207
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,266
What more could I want?

208
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,298
She's a beauty! What's her name?

209
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:11,040
Uh, the Wraith.

210
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,672
Hurry with that. We must sail with the tide.

211
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:14,814
Thieves! Stop them!

212
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,595
Stop them, they're getting away! They're stealing my boat!

213
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,900
We're casting off! Ren, take the wheel!

214
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:28,285
Ioz, what's this all about? You'd think we stole this boat...

215
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:29,424
...we did!

216
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:30,420
What?

217
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:32,846
Steer for open water!

218
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:44,255
What? Five days at sea and now you tell me the map's a fake?

219
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,199
Well, we're all full of surprises, aren't we?

220
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,833
Oh! What is this witchcraft?

221
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,461
We must be near the first of the hidden Treasures!

222
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:55,696
Ahh, then there are riches to be found!

223
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,654
Yes, the Thirteen Treasures of Rule!

224
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,898
Bilge! They're nothing but a myth!

225
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:02,187
Tell that to the Compass.

226
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:05,131
The First Treasure must be beyond those rocks.

227
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,630
God's Tears! You didn't say anything about the bloody Dragon's Maw!

228
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,743
No treasure's worth dying for.

229
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:19,255
Bloth.

230
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,682
You know that sun-blistered sea scavenger?

231
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,212
Yes, and you?

232
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,300
Used to crew for him, ended ugly.

233
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,744
Why am I not surprised?

234
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:29,413
Look out!

235
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,618
This is a swift craft. We can outrun him in the open sea.

236
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:38,636
No. We're within reach of the First Treasure.

237
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,615
We're going into the Dragon's Maw.

238
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:47,000
Well, one of you had better decide before we have the ship burn out from underneath us.

239
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,930
I wanted to get away from the drudgery of life on land.

240
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,642
Oh, and now a woman aboard!

241
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:02,373
And it looks like I picked the right ship. I'm Tula!

242
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,286
Well, uh, Tula, I'm throwing you overboard!

243
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,445
No, we need every hand. Look!

244
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,629
We must slow the Wraith.

245
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,772
We need less sail.

246
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,017
What does a serving wench know of sailing?

247
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,286
Now aren't you glad you didn't throw her overboard?

248
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,488
Halt! I see something ahead on the starboard bow

249
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,358
a light of some sort!

250
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,091
The First Treasure of Rule!

251
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,393
Perfect! They're leading us to the First Treasure!

252
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:52,431
Quick, Niddler! Get the gem!

253
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:01,482
Twist my soul! Keep that monkeybird from getting the gem!

254
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:10,660
Niddler!

255
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,635
Boy! There are twelve Treasures left

256
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,782
join me and we'll find them together!

257
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,557
Never!

258
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:32,407
Incredible!

259
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,994
Insanity, you mean, I'm surprised we came through it safely.

260
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,495
Not all of us. We were four, now we're three.

261
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:46,099
Niddler! You're all right!

262
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:53,183
Your failure to take the first gem is my victory!

263
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:01,067
It's not a victory for you or me, but one for Octopon!

264
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:05,901
Konk, take the scout ship, and get that Treasure!

265
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:20,063
I can't ask you to continue with me on this dangerous quest.

266
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:22,675
Name the port of your choice and I'll take you there.

267
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:24,155
Which way does the Compass point?

268
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,184
To the second Treasure of Rule, east.

269
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,554
Then east it is, for adventure!

270
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,198
For Treasure!

271
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,640
For Octopon!

272
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,888
For crying out loud! When are we gonna eat?
