5
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,583
[driver] First time in Croatia?

6
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,708
- [woman] Yeah.
- This is the old city.

7
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,833
It's beautiful.

8
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,333
[somber music continues]

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,166
We're here.

10
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,583
Uh, in case you need a taxi
while you're here.

11
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh. Thank you, Zain.

12
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,500
- Enjoy,
- Wait, I need to pay you.

13
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,250
Uh, it's been taken care of.

14
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,375
Oh, well, at least let me tip you then.

15
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,875
Please.

16
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,625
Thank you.

17
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,583
You made it!

[laughs]

19
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,583
Aw, it's so good to see you.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,125
You too. [gasps]

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,833
- Look at you.
- [laughs]

22
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,166
I can't believe we're finally here.
We're doing this.

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,625
I know. Come on.
I've been waiting to open the duty-free.

24
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,583
Yeah. Oh, you waited. That's a first.

27
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,916
Hey, uh...

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,875
Thanks for paying for the taxi.

29
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,333
Thank Jay. It's all on him.

30
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,750
Wow! Kate, this is incredible.

31
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,083
Can we move in? Stay forever?

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,833
- Okay.
- [Kate] Whoo-hoo!

33
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,396
- [woman] That's it.
- [Kate chuckles]

34
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,583
Never going home. Think Rob would notice?

35
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,333
Probably. But who cares?

36
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,125
- Hope you brought your swimsuit.
- Oh, uh...

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,625
- I think I forgot.
- Well, you'll just have to go naked.

38
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,166
Here you go.

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250

- [cork pops]
- [Kate] Whoo!

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,291
- [chuckles]
- [woman] Ooh, fancy.

42
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,583
[Kate] Dom Pérignon.

43
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,083
Okay.

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,583
- Finally!
- [woman] Yeah.

45
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,875
To weekends away.

46
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,750
- With best friends.
- [clinks]

48
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,916
Oh.

49
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
I got you something.

50
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,401
- You didn't have to get me anything.
- I wanted to, though.

51
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,916
I just wanted to say thank you
for planning this whole thing.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,333
And I've... I've really missed you so much.

53
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,833
It's beautiful, Beth. Thank you.

54
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
[Beth] Here. I know you love black onyx.

55
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,291
- [both] Oh!
- [bead dropping]

56
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,875
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
- [laughs]

57
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,458
[groans] Where is it?

58
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,291
I... I got it online.

59
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,750
- I can send it back.
- No. No.

60
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,625
I love it.

61
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,333
I love you.

62
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,666
I love you too.

63
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,291
Ugh.

64
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,750
I don't know what to wear.
Nothing fancy enough.

65
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,392
[Rob] <i>So just go in your granny panties.
You'll still look great.</i>

66

[laughs]

67
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,708
I'm so tired. I just want to go to bed.

68
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,625
<i>So go to bed. It's your holiday too.</i>

69
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,458
No, no. Kate booked a restaurant.
It'll be fun.

70
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,125
Tell me more about Aster.

71
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,916
Are you missing mommy?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,541
[Rob] <i>Are you missing mommy?</i>

73
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,333
<i>- </i>[Aster cooing] <i>Mama.
- Yeah.</i>

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,625
[whimpers]

75
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,625
<i>She misses your boobs, she says.</i>

76
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
[laughs]

77
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,458
- [Rob] <i>So do I.</i>
- [Aster whimpers]

78
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,250
[inhales deeply]

79
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,791
[sighs] It'll have to do.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,625
[Kate] Here I come.

81
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,500
Ta-da!

82
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,125
[Beth] Wow, Kate! [chuckles]

83
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,458
[laughs] What do you think? New dress.

84
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,166
I went on the post-breakup shopping spree
to end all shopping sprees.

85
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,208
- You look amazing.
- [Aster whimpers]

86
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,125
Oh, hey, Rob. How's it going?

87
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,125
- <i>Good.</i>
- [babbling]

88
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,916
Oh, is that my gorgeous goddaughter?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,625
Aw. Hi.

90
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,791
- Give her a kiss from me.
- [Rob]<i> I will.</i>

91
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,583
<i>I've got to put her down actually.
You guys have a good night.</i>

92
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,625
<i>- Don't get too drunk.</i>
- We will.

93
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,708
- And we will.
- We definitely will.

94
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,916
[laughs]

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,916
[clinks]

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,625
Night, sweetie. I love you.

97
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,976
- I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
<i>- Have a good time. Love you.</i>

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,083
I'm half wasted already. [laughs]

99
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,708
You're such a lightweight.

100
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,791
Ah, if I break my neck
in these things, it's your fault.

101
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,291
You look like a supermodel.
You should keep them.

102
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,295
- They'll look great at the supermarket.
- Hello.

103
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,375
- Hi.
- Hi.

104
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,541
Oh. This is, um...

105
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:03,958
Sebastian.

106
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,416
- The owner.
- Oh.

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,833
- Have you settled in okay?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Beth.

108
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,392
- It's nice to meet you.
- [car horn honks]

109
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,541
Everything's great.

110
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
Come on. Taxi's here.

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Bye.

112
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,791
[Croatian tango music playing]

113
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,041
[Kate] Do you know what you want?

114
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,166
[Beth] I don't know,
but I need to eat soon.

115
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,458
- [Kate] Yeah, you do. [laughs]
- [Beth laughs]

116
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
Let's get oysters.

117
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,958
Jesus, are they gold-plated?

118
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,875
I keep telling you it's on Jay.

119
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,135
He still hasn't
taken me off his credit card.

120
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,568
I intend on discovering
what the limit is before he notices.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,708
Won't he be mad?

122
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,791
With any luck, he'll have an aneurysm
and drop dead on top of his assistant.

123
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,958
So, uh, have we decided?

124
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,958
Hello.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,125
Uh, we'll start with a dozen raw oysters
and a bottle of champagne.

126
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,333
- The most expensive one on the menu.
- [chuckles] Excellent.

127
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,916
Mmm...

128
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,875
No? [chuckles]

129
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
What?

130
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,625
I've been a crap friend.

131
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,791
I should've been there for you.

132
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,375
You had a baby. You're forgiven.

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you okay?

134
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,333
Yeah.

135
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm fine. Couldn't care less about Jay.

136
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,083
- And what about polyamory, girl? Ooh!
- Polyamory, huh?

137
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,875
- [cork pops]
- I can barely manage one relationship.

138
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,833
- Who's talking about relationship?
- [chuckles]

139
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,166
Anyway, enough about me. How about you?

140
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,666
[chuckles]

141
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,583
How's things with Rob?

142
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,083
[sighs]

143
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,791
Good.

144
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,083
They're rea... They're good.

145
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
He's really great with Aster.

146
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
Mmm, and what about with you?

147
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,791
Uh...

148
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,208
He's trying.

149
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,083
[Kate] How hard is he trying?

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,166
Are you getting any at least?

151
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,625
Kate. [chuckles]

152
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,708
[Kate] What?

153
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
How long has it been?

154
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,375
Um...

155
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,458
Over a year.

156
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,541
[gasps]

157
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,583
Wow. Oh.

158
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,666
Um...

159
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
Isn't it about time
you got back on the horse?

160
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,333
I... I just don't feel like it.

161
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,291
Is it Rob?

162
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,684
- Is he not doing it for you anymore?
- [Beth] It's not Rob.

163
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,791
A body never lies.

164
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,583
No, no, it's me.

165
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
It's...

166
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,208
It's, uh...

167
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
- Have you thought about leaving him?
- What?

168
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,291
If you're not happy,
take it from me, divorce is the answer.

169
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,625
Especially when it comes
with a big fat alimony paycheck.

170
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,333
We're just going through... [inhales deeply]

171
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,416
...a rough patch.

172
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,583
You've said that before.

173
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,530
- Beth...
- [waiter] Here we are.

174
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
- One for you.
- Thank you.

175
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,125
[waiter] Excuse me, may I?

176
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,791
Yes. Thank you.

177
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,333
- Thanks a lot.
- [waiter] Not a problem.

178
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,875
[Kate] You're such an asshole.

179
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,916
Shut up. Go away. Go away.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm afraid the card was rejected.

181
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,666
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
Okay.

183
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,750
- Oh, wow.
- [Kate] Stop calling me.

184
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,708
- One minute and, uh...
- Of course.

185
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,791
[Kate] Bye.

186
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,000
Everything okay?

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,208
[sighs]

188
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,541
- Jay.
- Did he find out about the card?

189
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,708
Yeah. Turns out I did discover the limit.

190
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,458
- [chuckles]
- Oh!

191
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,375
Do you want me to go halves?

192
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,750
No. No, no, no.

193
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,208
- You get the drinks at the next place.
- [Beth] Kate, I'm so sorry. I'm tired.

194
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,517
- And my boobs are like gonna explode.
- [Kate] No, no, no.

195
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,416
I have to pump. They're full, and I can't.

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,708
- And we have the bike tour tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah, the bike tour.

197
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,083
[chuckles]

198
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,666
[Kate] Oh, come on.

199
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,083
Let's relive our misspent youth.

200
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,125
It took me months
to convince you to come away.

201
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,958
Who knows when we're going to do it again.

202
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,791
[chuckles]

203
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,000
[Kate] Come on.

204
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,583
[Kate chuckles]

205
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
[dance music playing]

206
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Uh...

207
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
The entrance is just around there.

208
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,250
Uh, thank you, Zain.

209
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,708
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I just want to fix
my face and powder my nose.

210
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,416
[Kate sniffles]

211
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,250
- Uh, are you from here?
- [Zain] No.

212
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,625
Syrian.

213
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,708
American?

214
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,916
Uh, yeah.

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,333
California originally, but I've lived
in London the last 15 years.

216
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,041
You left Syria because of the war.

217
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,708
Hm.

218
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
[in Arabic] Do you miss home?

219
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,101
[in English]
Oh, you speak Arabic?

220
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,541
No, not, not very well.
Um, just a little bit.

221
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,041
I work with the Global Rescue Initiative,
or I used to.

222
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,166
I know them.

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
- [phone rings]
- Cool.

224
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,250
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.

225
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,083
- [Beth] Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

226
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,166
[dance music playing]

227
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,833
Okay.

228
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,291
Yeah.

229
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,208
[dance music continues]

230
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
What do you want?

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, just water.

232
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,583
Let me get these.

233
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,333
- No, no, you get the next round.
- [bartender] What can I get you?

234
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,833
Two gin and tonics.

235
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,333
Oh my God, look over there. Hot.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
- [bartender] Here you go.
- We should go over there.

237
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,583
- Follow me.
- [Beth] Okay.

238
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,291
[Kate] Coming through.

239
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,458
- Mind if we join you?
- No, I'm sure they're waiting for someone.

240
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,541
No, no, please, be our guests.

241
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

242
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,736
- Beth. Hi.
- [man 1] Hey, beauty.

243
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,000
[Beth] Yeah. Oh.

244
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,666
- Oh.
- [kisses]

245
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,291
Oh.

246
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
I don't think I've seen you here before.

247
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,125
I would have noticed you.

248
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,916
[both laughing]

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[man 2] I love your dress.
You look like a disco ball.

250
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,500
[laughs]

251
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,125
You want to see pictures of my baby?

252
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,041
[dance music playing]

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,583
When was the last time
you got hit on by someone that hot?

254
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,250
He's not hitting on me.

255
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,458
[Kate] Yeah, he is.

256
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,625
Come on, we were just saying
you need to get back on the horse.

257
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,166
I... I'm married.

258
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,750
[Kate] So? Rob doesn't have to find out.

259
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Are you joking?

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,041
One night of excitement
might bring you out of your rut.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,416
[man 1] Manhattan for the lady.

262
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,291
Thank you.

263
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,250
[chuckles]

264
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
[laughs]

265
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,083
We were just saying
how you should come back to ours.

266
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,041
- [Kate] Bitch!
- [screams, pants]

267
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,208
[groans]

268
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,166
[breathing heavily]

269
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,416
[groans]

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,083
[retches]

271
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,125
[coughs]

272
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,708
[breathing heavily]

273
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,000
[groans]

274
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,541
[breathing heavily]

275
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,791
[seagulls cawing]

276
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,250
[somber music playing]

277
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,666
[bubbling]

278
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,500
[bubbling stops]

279
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,666
Kate.

280
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,875
[knocking]

281
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,291
[door squeaks]

282
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,416
[suspicious music playing]

283
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,291
[on voicemail] <i>Hi, you've got Kate,
or maybe you haven't, so leave a message.</i>

284
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,500
[ringing]

285
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,416
[chimes]

286
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,780
[Beth] Hey, did you get my text?

287
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,083
- What? No. Sorry.
- [Beth]<i> I'm really worried.</i>

288
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,000
<i>It's already noon,
and Kate hasn't come home.</i>

289
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,958
Okay.

290
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,333
<i>So she's probably gone for a coffee
or a wander or something.</i>

291
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,375
<i>- Did you have a good night?
- </i>Yeah.

292
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,375
I did. I drank a bit much.

293
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,875
<i>Honestly, I can barely remember anything.</i>

294
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,041
Right. And what are you doing today?

295
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
We're meant to be doing a bike tour.

296
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,625
There you go. That's why she's vanished.
Should've told her it was a shopping tour.

297
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,958
She... She didn't leave a note,
and she hasn't texted either.

298
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,791
<i>Did you have an argument?</i>

299
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,000
[suspenseful music playing]

300
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,583
- [Kate] Bitch!
- No.

301
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>Then don't hang around waiting.</i>

302
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>Get out. Enjoy yourself.</i>

303
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,541
<i>- I'll speak to you later. Yeah?
- </i>Okay.

304
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,125
- I'll let you know if I hear. Love you.
- [Rob] <i>Bye.</i>

305
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,208
[phone chimes]

306
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,416
- [Beth] Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh...

308
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,166
Have you see my friend?

309
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,291
I'm looking for her. Um, Kate.

310
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,500
I think she went out,
and I can't get a hold of her.

311
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,375
She's not answering her phone.

312
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,750
You haven't seen her, have you?

313
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,833
No.

314
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,916
Okay. Thank you.

315
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,000
You're not allowed to have parties.
It says so very clearly in the rules.

316
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,583
And I have to charge you
for the two extra guests that stayed over.

317
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,750
[uneasy music playing]

318
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
[officer] <i>What was the name of the bar?</i>

319
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,791
[Beth]<i> I can't remember the name.</i>

320
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,541
[officer] Okay, let me see her photo.

321
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,625
So you brought two men back
to your apartment.

322
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,625
- And you don't remember their names.
- [Beth] Well...

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,333
No, I don't...

324
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,458
- Had you been drinking?
- [chuckles] Yeah, a little.

325
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,000
More than a little
if you don't remember anything.

326
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
I'm... I'm just not used to drinking,
that's all.

327
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,041
I... I just had a baby. So...

328
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:17,333
Okay, your friend
probably go out clubbing or to a bar.

329
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,250
[scoffs]

330
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,458
No, uh, we're here together.

331
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,541
So we're supposed to be doing things,
sightseeing and...

332
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,541
[sighs]

333
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,416
She's not answering her phone.

334
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,250
I think I found blood.

335
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,291
Did you check the hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident.

336
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,708
Yeah. I did, but there's no record
of her being admitted.

337
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,916
[woman] Is everything okay?

338
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
[in Croatian] Yeah. Some tourist.

339
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,375
[scoffs] Her friend ditched her
for some guy, and she's upset.

340
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,875
[in English] Does she have her bag
with her? Her wallet, her passport, keys?

341
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,500
Yes. I checked.

342
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,416
[in Croatian] I can handle it.

343
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,086
[in English] Can I file
a missing persons report?

344
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,750
No, you can't
because you need to wait 24 hours.

345
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,750
Most people show up before then.

346
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,708
I'm sure your friend will too.

347
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,791
[unsettling music plays]

348
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,875
[line ringing]

349
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
[Zain on phone] <i>Hello.</i>

350
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,791
Zain.

351
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,083
- Thanks for picking me up.
- It was close by. It's no bother.

352
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,666
[sighs] I couldn't remember the name
of the bar last night.

353
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,416
The Blue Parlour.

354
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
[mysterious music playing]

355
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,125
That's it.

356
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,666
Has something happened?

357
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,791
Did you lose something?

358
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,833
My friend.

359
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,791
[keys jingling]

360
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,041
[engine starting]

361
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,125
Uh, no need.

362
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,083
- You want me to come in with you?
- No.

363
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,166
[Zain] Sure?

364
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,791
Yeah, it's okay.

365
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Thank you.

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,041
<i>You served us.</i>

367
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,000
We were sitting right there with two guys.

368
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,750
She was wearing a blue dress.

369
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,958
No, no. Sorry. No.

370
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,791
What are you doing?

371
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,625
Figured you could use some help.

372
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,625
[speaking Croatian]

373
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,916
[bartender speaking Croatian]

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
Escorts? As in...

375
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,291
[scoffs] I didn't know
that was an actual, real thing?

376
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,833
I didn't hire them.

377
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,958
Then your friend must have.

378
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,000
No, she didn't hire them either.

379
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,583
One night of excitement

380
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,625
might bring you out of your rut.

381
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
Oh my God.

382
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,916
She kept going on and on
about how I needed to have some fun.

383
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,875
I'm such an idiot.

384
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500
I wondered why he was into me.

385
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,375
The barman says
he's seen them there a lot.

386
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,125
Always with different woman.

387
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,291
Tourists.

388
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,958
They joke about it.

389
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,750
[sighs] Does he know
how to get a hold of them?

390
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,750
Uh, he only knew their first names.

391
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,750
Mateo and Luka.

392
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,291
Come on. I'll take you back.

393
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,355
[Rob on phone]
<i>You went to the police?</i>

394
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,125
<i>I mean, this is Kate we're talking about.
She's not exactly reliable.</i>

395
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,625
[Beth] <i>No, no, she wouldn't do this to me.
Leave without telling me?</i>

396
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,541
[Rob] <i>Really?</i>

397
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,708
How many times on a night out did
she ditch you for a bloke she just met?

398
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
[Beth] <i>No,
I've left her dozens of messages.</i>

399
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,708
<i>- Something's happened to her.</i>
- Don't be silly.

400
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,250
<i>I've got some brilliant pictures
to show you of Aster by the way.</i>

401
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>Earlier on, we were watching</i>
The Godfather,<i> and it turns out</i>

402
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,333
she really likes the part where they find
the horse's head in the bed.

403
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,833
[Beth laughs] <i>Great parenting.</i>

404
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,125
I miss her.

405
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,583
[Rob] <i>Are you okay?</i>

406
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
Mm-hmm.

407
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,166
<i>Well, we're seeing you tomorrow.</i>

408
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,506
<i>Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?</i>

409
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,583
Oh my God.

410
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,458
I can't believe
it's nearly Sunday already.

411
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,333
<i>- I'll have to change my flight.</i>
- You can't.

412
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,625
<i>I've got work on Monday.</i>

413
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,250
<i>- What about Aster?</i>
- You don't think I want to come home, Rob?

414
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,666
But Kate's vanished!

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

416
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,208
<i>Yeah. God, of course. Yeah, sorry.</i>

417
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,041
<i>- Do... Do you need me to come over?
- </i>No, It's okay.

418
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll be fine.

419
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,416
[Rob] <i>Okay.</i>

420
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,916
<i>All right. Just call if you need me, yeah?</i>

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,833
- Okay. Good night.
- [Rob] <i>Good night.</i>

422

[suspenseful music playing]

428
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,625
Zain.

429
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,666
I think I found them.

430
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,458
[Zain] <i>I called and said I wanted
to hire them for a private party.</i>

431
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,708
They're meeting us here.

432
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,083
What if they don't know anything,
or what if they won't tell us?

433
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,000
[sighs]

434
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,458
- Maybe we should go to the police.
- No, I'll handle it.

435
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,541
Don't worry.

436
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,666
How'd you two meet?

437
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,416
Kate and me?

438
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,541
Uh...

439
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,916
I was on a semester abroad.

440
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,250
We were roommates.

441
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,041
I met my husband Rob through her.

442
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,708
We hit it off straight away.

443
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,583
You and your husband.

444
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,708
No, me and Kate, actually. [laughs]

445
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,083
[laughing]

446
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,333
We were total opposites,

447
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,000
but just clicked.

448
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,166
You know, right away, she's an extrovert.

449
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,041
- My wife calls it <i>Carneebeh.</i>
- [Beth]<i> Carneebeh.</i>

450
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,208
- Yeah.
- What is that?

451
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>Carneebeh. </i>It's...

452
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,416
She likes to play games. [giggles]

How did you meet your wife?

456
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,041
Mina.

457
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:10,083
She was a doctor at the hospital
where I was doing my nursing training?

458
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,833
She's like you,

459
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,375
very trusting of people.

460
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,125
She believed me
when I say I was a nice guy

461
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,250
and agreed to go out with me. [chuckles]

462
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,083
Is Mina okay with you helping me?

463
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
She's dead.

464
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,291
I'm so sorry.

[Zain] Hey.

467
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,583
Don't worry. I got this.

468
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,166
Hi. Hel...

469
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,541

00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,583
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

482
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,833
- The woman you were with Friday night.
- Kate! What have you done with her?

483
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,500
- I have done nothing.
- So why did you run just now?

484
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,267
- She hired us for a good time. That's all.

- [Zain] They took her handbag?

[speaks Croatian]

494
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,333
[Zain] They pawned it.

495
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,625
Wait. Did you drug me?

496
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,926
Did you put something
in my water at the bar?

497
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,750
- [Zain] Answer!
- No!

498
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,708
I don't need to drug women.
Come on. Please let me go. Okay?

499
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,166
Don't tell the police, please.

Please, I'll get you the bag.
Okay? Please.

<i>I'll take you there.</i>

503
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,166
They're hers.

504
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:31,875
It's dead.

505
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,583
[in Croatian] I didn't know
they were stolen!

506
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,243
- [Zain] You think you were drugged?
- [Beth] I've never been that drunk before?

507
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,291
They got me a glass of water.
They could've slipped something into it.

508
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,125
What if they drugged Kate too,
you know? So they could rob us.

509
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,375
Why didn't they take your bag too?

510
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,791
Maybe Kate drugged you.

511
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,625
Why would she do that?

512
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,666
Well, she did hire them
to have sex with you.

513
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,875
[Beth] No, no. She would never hurt me.

514
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,666
I know they know more.

- Um...

516

Maybe don't mention my name.

I don't want to get in trouble.

518
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,000
If they revoke my visa,
I have no place else to go.

519
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,083
[Beth] I get it.

520
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,708
Listen, I'm sorry
for dragging you into all this.

521
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,166
You're not dragging me into anything.

522
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,583
Stop saying sorry.

523
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,833
Call me if you need me, okay?

00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,708
[Beth] Well, I couldn't wait.

528
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,041
And look, now I have proof.
Something must have happened to her.

529
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,309
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Let's start with details.

530
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,708
- Your friend's name, date of birth...
- No, I gave this to him already yesterday.

531
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,125
You were there.

532
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,416
Where's the report?

533
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,333
[clicks tongue]

534
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,958
Uh...

535
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,000
- You didn't file it?
- He told me to come back in 24 hours.

536
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,416
I figured her friend was out partying.

537
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,958
[scoffing] They brought two escorts back
to their apartment.

538
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,166
They were drunk. Probably high on drugs.

539
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,708
No, I... I wasn't doing drugs.
And... I didn't know they were escorts.

540
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,041
[scoffs]

541
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,750
Something bad has happened to her.

542
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,375
I know it.

543
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,625
[Kate] <i>I don't think
they're serial killers, Beth.</i>

544
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,541
And even if they are,
I don't know if I care. Look at them.

545
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,375
You need to interview these men.

546
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,208
I think...

547
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,291
they might have drugged me
or maybe both of us.

548
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,208
You just said you didn't do drugs.

549
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,166
I... I didn't do drugs. I was drugged.

550
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,916
- There's a difference.
- Funny you didn't mention it before.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,958
'Cause I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

552
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,791
[in Croatian] Can you get her some water?

553
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,541
Then run these names through the system.

554
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:19,833
[sighs]

555
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:20,916
[sniffles]

556
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,333
[in English] I'm sorry about my colleague.

557
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I need to ask,

558
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,875
is it possible
you may have been assaulted?

559
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,958
[suspenseful music playing]

560
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,208
[inaudible]

561
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,541
Well, when we're done here,
we'll take you to the hospital

562
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,875
for a drug test and a checkup.

563
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
Okay.

564
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,666
[sniffles]

565
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,000
This is a real Dior.

566
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,041
It's worth around

567
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,958
10,000 Euro.

568
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,666
And they admitted they stole it,

569
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,125
and then gave it back to you.

570
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,416
[Beth] I, eh...

571
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,500
I explained Kate was missing, and I...

572
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,208
told them I wouldn't go
to the police if they gave it back to me.

573
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,541
Hm.

574
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,041
[nurse] Any signs of sexual assault
are still inconclusive.

575
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,625
We'll have those results and the results
of the blood test within 24 hours.

576
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,250
[sighs]

577
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,666
[ominous music playing]

578
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,875
[Beth] What do you mean, Jay?

579
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,918
<i>- </i>[Jay] <i>It's a classic Kate move.</i>
- Going missing?

580
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,000
Always has to be the center of attention.

581
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,000
She wore red on our wedding day, I mean,

582
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,666
should've taken that as a warning
of sharks in the water.

583
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,500
You haven't talked to her then?

584
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,791
[Jay] <i>No, not for weeks. It's been bliss.</i>

585
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:56,375
- No, no, you talked to her Friday night.
- No, I didn't.

586
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,500
She said you called her
about the credit card.

587
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,416
What credit card? All communication
has to go through our lawyers.

588
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Look, Beth, I can actually guarantee
this whole disappearance act

589
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,583
is a lot of bollocks, all right.

590
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,791
What credit card by the way?

591
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:12,041
What? Are you saying
she's... [scoffs] faking her disappearance?

592
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,083
Why? Why would she do that?

593
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:18,750
Because drama is embedded
in her DNA like an extra chromosome.

594
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,875
She once ran off to New York
for a week after we had an argument

595
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,875
with no word if she was dead or alive.

596
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,791
All right, just trust me,
she likes to punish people.

597
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,208
<i>Look, I gotta go. Just call me,
and let me know what happens, all right?</i>

- Checkout is 11:00.

Oh.

606
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,041
I'm sorry, I forgot.

607
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,958
There are other guests arriving.

608
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,041
I'll do it.

609
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,125
I'll do it.

610
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,083
- Your friend is still missing.
- [Beth] Yeah.

611
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,125
- Did you go to the police?
- [Beth] Yeah, they're looking for her.

612
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm staying till they find her.

613
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,791
- Where?
- [sighs]

614
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,791
I'll find a hotel.

615
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,416
I have a spare room.

616
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,375
Downstairs.

<i>I'll give you a discount.</i>

at least you will be close by.

just let me know
if you need anything else.

627

Thanks.

Yeah. Is that okay?

652
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,750
Of course.

653
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,333
Is that your recording studio?

654
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:17,916
Yes.

655
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,291
I'm a composer.

00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,208
Are you hungry?

00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,791

Good night.

00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,625
Hi. Thanks.

662
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,833
I had to get out of there.

663
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Have you eaten?

664
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,916
Let's get some food
before we start looking.

665
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
- I know a very good Syrian...
- [Rob] Beth.

666
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:55,625
[Beth] Rob?

667
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,958
Uh, what are you doing here?

668
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,541
I've been calling you all day
to let you know I was on my way.

669
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,458
- I was worried about you.
- Where's Aster?

670
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,458
- [Rob] She's with a babysitter.
- Overnight?

671
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,000
My parents are away.
Remember? In the Dordogne. She'll be fine.

672
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,458
- Sorry, am I interrupting something?
- No. This is Zain.

673
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,750
He's a taxi driver.
And he's been helping me look for Kate.

674
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,541
[Zain] Nice to meet you.

675
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:19,458
You too.

676
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,333
- Okay, I'll... I'll go.
- Okay.

677
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,250
Let me know if you hear anything.

678
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,500
- [Beth] I will. Thanks. Sorry.
- Bye.

679
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,583
[Beth] Bye.

680
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,291
Who the bloody hell is he? [chuckles]

681
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,976
- I just told you. He's the taxi driver.
- Who you were going to dinner with.

682
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,625
Give me a break. He's been helping me.

683
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:43,250
He... He drove me and Kate to a bar
the night that she went missing...

684
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,583
Beth, are you kidding?
What if he's involved?

685
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,250
[scoffs] No.

686
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,173
You were just about
to get into a car with him.

687
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,416
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

688
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,583

Come here.

693
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,125
- I'm sorry.

694
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,541
I am sorry, all right?

695
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,333
I didn't mean to upset you.

696
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,791
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've flown straight over.

697
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,267
I couldn't tell you over the phone.

698
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,291
Escorts?

699
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,125
She hired them?

[sighs]

701
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,000
Do the police think
they're involved in her going missing?

702
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,375
They don't seem to have a clue.

703
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,338
And they're barely lifting a finger
to find her.

704
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,541
[Rob] What if Jay's right,
and she's messing with us?

705
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,458
No. I know Kate. She'd...

706
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:38,000
She likes to be the center of attention,
yes, but she wouldn't do this to me.

707
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,333
[phone buzzing]

708
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:44,791
Hello.

709
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,291
[foreboding music playing]

710
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,666
[man]<i> She's been in the water
for some time.</i>

711
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,750
[gasps]

712
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,833
Oh.

713
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,875
[Rob] It's her.

714
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,208
Oh my God!

715
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,458
[crying]

716
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:10,791
[sniffles]

717
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,625
She drowned?

718
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,500
It's too soon to say.
The autopsy will tell us more.

719
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,875
But you think it was an accident?
[sniffles] That she fell in?

720
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,583
Or do you think she was killed?

721
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,833
We need to wait
for the result of the autopsy.

722
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,916
We'll be in touch when we know more.

723
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
[sobbing]

724
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:05,833
What are you doing?

725
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,875
Couldn't sleep.

726
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,541
I keep seeing her

727
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,666
lying there on that slab.

728
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,625
I feel bad, you know,
for finding her annoying.

729
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,666
I should've been nicer.

730
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,791
[somber music playing]

731
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,392
I have to get going soon.
You sure you don't want to come with me?

732
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,208
We talked about this. I have to...

733
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,750
stay till after the autopsy and...

734
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,875
- There's the arrangements to figure out.
- Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

735
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,666
I know. You're right.

736
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,625
[Beth sniffles]

737
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,500
[kisses]

738
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,750
[sniffles]

739
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,833
[Beth] Is the coroner certain?

740
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,500
[officer] Yes.

741
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,750
It's now a murder inquiry.

742
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,083
They can't tell if she was sexually
assaulted given the state of the body.

743
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,375
And the fact
she had sex with multiple partners

744
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,125
on the night she went missing.

745
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,041
Can I see her?

746
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,166
I want to say goodbye.

747
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Properly.

748
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,166
[crying]

749
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,291
Can I have a minute? Please?

750
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:41,750
[clicks]

751
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,208
We need to go.

752
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,291
I... I have to...

753
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,708
[door closes]

754
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,375
[sighs]

755
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,000
[inhales deeply]

756
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,583
[phone clicks]

757
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:20,708
[sniffles]

758
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:33,875
[line ringing]

759
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:39,916
[on voicemail] <i>You've reached Rob,
leave me a message after the tone.</i>

760
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,583
[beeps]

761
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,666
[ominous music playing]

762
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,708
[breathing heavily]

763
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,541
[ominous music continues]

764
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,250
[knocking]

765
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,416
- [officer] Everything okay?
- [Beth] Yes.

766
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:37,791
[door squeaks]

767
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,625
- You ready?
- [Beth] Mm-mm.

768
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,875
Kovac is waiting.

769
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,750
Screen's broken.

770
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,958
[Kovac] <i>The toxicology report came back.</i>

771
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,500
It shows high levels
of cocaine and ketamine in Kate's system.

772
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,541
Did you know she was taking drugs?

773
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:04,458
Yes.

774
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,833
Why didn't you tell us?

775
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,291
You'd already made a judgment
about who she was.

776
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:12,583
I thought it would stop you looking
for her, and it did.

777
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:14,833
Didn't it?

778
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,250
[Kovac] The results of your blood work
came back too.

779
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,875
They also found traces of ketamine.

780
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,291
See. I... I told you I was drugged.

781
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,875
[Kovac] We interviewed
the two men you identified.

782
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,250
They deny giving you
any illegal substances.

783
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,458
Well, they would. Wouldn't they?

784
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,333
Well, they've got no priors.

785
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,625
And they also have alibis
for the time of the murder.

786
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,125
A taxi driver
picked them up outside your apartment.

787
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,125
Their roommate can vouch for them too.

788
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,333
Bad luck.

789
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,166
What about Jay?

790
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,500
It's Kate's ex-husband.

791
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,458
She's divorcing him. Isn't that a motive?

792
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,458
He's in London.

793
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,301
[Beth] It's only a two-hour flight
from here.

794
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,541
We'll look into it.

795
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,750
We interviewed people
from the Blue Parlour,

796
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,541
and several people saw you
and Kate arguing when you left.

797
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,875
What? No.

798
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,583
That's not true.

799
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,083
You didn't argue with Kate then,
hours before she died?

800
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,500
[laughing]

801
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,833
[Beth] <i>They're complete strangers!</i>

802
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,958
Relax! It'll be an adventure!

803
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,250
It wasn't an argument.

804
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,250
It was a conversation.

805
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,291
I thought you didn't recall anything
about that night.

806
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,976
- You were drugged, remember?
- [Beth] No.

807
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,375
I... I passed out in the taxi,
but I remember some things.

808
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,166
Your story keeps changing.

809
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,166
What are you saying?

810
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:42,125
You think I have something
to do with Kate's murder?

811
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,541
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

812
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,166
[tense music playing]

813
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,166
No.

814
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:04,500
[officer] We need your passport
until we can verify your statement.

815
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,166
[officer and Sebastian speaking Croatian]

816
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,916
If you remember anything, call me.

817
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,125
[in English]
Let's hope your story checks out.

818
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
[seagulls cawing]

819
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,416
Jay, you knew.

820
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:32,916
Didn't you?

821
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,416
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

822
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:39,791
Look, I was going to,
but, uh, you were about to have a baby.

823
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:43,041
My husband
was having an affair with my best friend,

824
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,333
and you didn't think
I had the right to know.

825
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,458
Look, Beth...

826
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,708
How long was it going on for?

827
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:51,791
Not long.

828
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,166
Uh... a few months.

829
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,166
<i>I guess she was trying to get back at me.
Tit for Tat.</i>

830
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,250
Wow.

831
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,291
Wow.

832
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,916
You know they had a thing at Uni.

833
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,958
Yeah, yeah, a drunken one-night stand
at freshman week.

834
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,201
- What are you saying?
- [Jay]<i> I'm not saying anything.</i>

835
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,333
<i>It's just, you know,</i>

836
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,708
maybe there
were some latent feelings on her part.

837
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,291
[Beth] How could I have not seen it?

838
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,625
We don't see what we don't want to see.

839
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,583
I've been feeling so guilty for...

840
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,291
for being...

841
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,250
so unhappy. [cries]

842
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,291
Like I'm not grateful enough

843
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:44,500
for my life, for Aster.

844
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,541
I was just too ashamed

845
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,416
to look up and see what
was staring me in the face.

846
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,291
Oh my God.

847
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,791
What if she did drug me

848
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,916
so I would sleep with someone

849
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,666
or not know if I had or hadn't?

850
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,291
Then she could get Rob to leave me.

851
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,416
Do you think he could have killed Kate?

852
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,541
Rob?

853
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,625
[scoffs]

854
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,958
Oh, God, no.

855
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,625
And I spoke to him over the weekend.

856
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,000
He was home with Aster.

857
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,291
You never wondered if it was me?

858
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,833
No.

859
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,041
Too trusting, right?

860
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,458
One thing I've learned,

861
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,875
never trust people,

862
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,041
only your instincts.

863
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:54,166
Where I come from,
we say <i>Alalbek Daleelek.</i>

864
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,458
Your heart is your guide.

865
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,625
Zain.

866
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:05,958
How did...

867
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,458
How did your wife die?

868
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,083
She was working in a clinic.

869
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,333
There was a bombing. Uh...

870
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,666
I was late to pick her up.

871
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,875
It's not your fault.

872
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,375
[somber music playing]

873
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:06,083
[phone ringing]

874
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:13,291
[Robon phone]
<i>You there? Hello? Hi?</i>

875
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:17,625
<i>Hey, um, I was putting Aster down.
Sorry, I got your message. You okay?</i>

876
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,916
I know, Rob.

877
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,333
Know? Know what?

878
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,541
[Beth] <i>About you and Kate.</i>

879
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,750
- What about me and Kate?
- Stop!

880
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,750
Beth, what are you talking about?

881
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:33,791
That you were sleeping
with her for months.

882
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,750
[chuckling nervously] Uh, what?
What you talking about?

883
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:44,500
Stop treating me like an idiot.
I found the text messages on her phone.

884
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:52,625
I... I...

885
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:54,291
<i>I...</i>

886
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,291
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

887
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,416
I...

888
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,083
It didn't mean anything.

889
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,416
<i>I only did it because we...
When was the last time we had sex?</i>

890
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,458
<i>- You were depressed and I...</i>
- No! You do not get to blame this on me.

891
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:13,000
- No, I'm not blam... Look, I'm sorry...
- [Beth] <i>Stop apologizing!</i>

892
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,708
Did you love her?

893
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,500
Of course I didn't...

894
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,208
Look, you've just got to come home.
We can't do this over the phone.

895
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,458
I can't come home, Rob,

896
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,625
because the police have taken my passport
because I'm sure they think I killed Kate.

897
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:32,083
And if they find out about the affair,
they'll have a damn good reason too.

898
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,541
[sighs]

899
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,250
Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth.

900
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,166
- I am so sorry.
- [Beth] <i>Just shut up.</i>

901
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,916
[sniffling] I just want to see Aster.

902
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,000
[line disconnects]

903
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,500
[squawking]

904
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,000
[knocking on door]

905
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,125
[people speaking Croatian]

906
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,125
[door closes]

907
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:07,083
Beth Jenner, we're arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Kate Thompson.

908
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,500
[officer] Put your hands behind your back.

909
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,583
What?

910
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,583
For how long have you known Mr. Zakaria?

911
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Zain?

912
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,458
A few days.

913
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,166
[speaks Croatian]

914
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,291
Why?

915
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,083
How did the two of you meet?

916
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,500
[Beth] He drives a taxi.

917
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,708
He took me and Kate
to the bar on Friday night.

918
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,958
He's been helping me look for her.

919
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,809
Why didn't you tell us he was with you
when you confronted the escorts?

920
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:40,250
Or that he physically
assaulted one of them?

921
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,750
But they stole Kate's bag.

922
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:44,500
He got them to admit it.
He got the bag back.

923
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:48,083
Mr. Zakaria
is connected to organized crime.

924
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,541
He's a member of an Albanian gang

925
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,875
involved in human trafficking,
among other things.

926
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,541
[officer speaks Croatian]

927
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,541
What?

928
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,958
You didn't know this about him?

929
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:03,166
No. No, of course not.
What... What are you saying?

930
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,708
He killed Kate.

931
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,083
- No! No!
- [officer] Yes!

932
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,208
- [Beth] He can't have.
- Yes. Yes.

933
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:09,166
[speaks Croatian]

934
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,000
[in English]
And you hired him to do it.

935
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,916
- What?
- He's also been arrested.

936
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,416
This is insane! This is insane!

937
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,875
How do you... You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this!

938
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,208
Please! Why would I want Kate dead?

939
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,750
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.

940
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:26,958
- [cries]
- [Kovac] Oh.

941
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,208
You didn't think we'd find out.

942
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,333
I only found out yesterday.

943
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,500
Did you talk to Jay?

944
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,583
Jay has known about it for months.

945
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,041
We are speaking to him later today.

946
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,250
[sighs, sniffles]

947
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,000
I want a lawyer. [sniffles]

948
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,083
Can I have a lawyer?

949
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,625
Just because they haven't charged you
doesn't mean they won't.

950
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,458
It is only because they don't
have enough evidence yet.

951
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:59,166
They were hoping they could press you
on your connection to Mr. Zacharia,

952
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,750
and you'd confess.

953
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,291
To what?

954
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,666
I didn't do anything.

955
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:05,708
[sighs]

956
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:11,500
Call me next time before you say anything
to incriminate yourself.

957
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,125
[exhales sharply]

958
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,291
[sighs]

959
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,250
[gasps]

960
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,875
[breathing heavily]

961
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,458
What are you doing here?

962
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,041
Your landlord let me in.

963
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,125
I needed to see you.

964
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,625
They told me you'd been arrested.

965
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,375
[Zain] They let me go.

966
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,166
I was driving all Friday night
until Saturday morning.

967
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,041
The app tracks everything.

968
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,750
They said...

969
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,500
you have links
to an Albanian criminal gang.

970
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,708
You think I killed Kate?

971
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,375
I don't know.

972
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,500
I don't know who to believe.

973
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:19,375
I saved the life of a boy
who'd been hit with shrapnel in the leg.

974
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:22,625
His father has connections
to an Albanian people-smuggling ring.

975
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:27,625
He got me out of Aleppo,
crossed the border into Turkey then here.

976
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,375
Helped secure me a visa.

977
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,833
So you don't work for this person?

978
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,083
No.

979
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,708
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

980
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:43,208
[in Arabic] Your heart is your guide.

981
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
[birds chirping]

982
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,833
[Beth] <i>You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this.</i>

983
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,208
<i>Why would I want Kate dead?</i>

984
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,083
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.

985
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,166
[suspenseful music playing]

986
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,166
[music continues]

987
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,708
[Beth] <i>So what?</i>

988
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,083
My husband was having an affair
with my best friend.

989
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,083
You didn't think I had the right to know?

990
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,083

Are you looking for something?

Oh, uh...

00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,166
Uh, takeout menus.

1002

I'm hungry.

1003
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,083
All the menus are online.

1004
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,166
Uh, my cell data ran out.

1005
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,000
Could I get the Wi-Fi password?

1006
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,791
- Excuse me.
- [Beth] Yeah.

1007
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,041
[objects clattering]

1008
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,041
[Sebastian] What happened with the police?
They let you go.

1009
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,333
Yeah.

1010
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:21,000
[Sebastian] And how much longer
do you think you'll be staying here?

1011
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,791
Um, I... I don't know.

1012
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,208
- Are you going out somewhere?
- [Sebastian] Yes.

1013
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:32,583
A screening for a movie
I supervised the music for.

1014
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,125
Hmm.

1015
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,291
- Goodbye, then.

1079
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,208
You're taping people
in the shower having sex!

1080

And you knew what happened to Kate
this whole time.

1081
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,416
You could have told the police.

1082
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,250
You told them
about my husband's affair, didn't you?

What are you doing?

1084

What is that? No. Don't delete them.

Listen.

1107
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,750
We'll find out where Kate went,

1108
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:24,125
then we can hopefully find out
who brought her home.

1109
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,333
Then we can go to the police.
We will explain. It will be okay.

- She's my height, blonde hair.
- [Zain] On Jerina Street.

[in Croatian] She's dead.

1128

She was murdered.

Where did you take her?

01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,750
We just need
to know where you took her. That's all.

1131
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,875
She made me follow these two men.
She said they stole her bag.

1132

I lost them on a one-way street.

Thank you.

[Beth] If Kate reported her bag stolen,

1139
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:59,517
why wasn't there a record of it
when I reported her missing?

1140
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,916
Maybe it never got filed.

1141

Why didn't he say anything?

Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1167

It was him. It was him.

It was Pavic.

- Don't worry about me.
- [Beth] No.

It was you.

1188
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,541
You killed her.

01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:46,625
What?

1190
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,083
[Beth] You hit on her, didn't you?

1191
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,250
Shut up.

1192
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,500
My God, you did!
You hit on her, and she rejected you!

1193
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:54,416
She was a slut!

1194
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,791
That's what men call women
who won't sleep with them!

1195

- No! No!

Shut your mouth!

Hi.

1203
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,000
Sorry for the wait.

1204
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:44,541
How are you feeling?

1205
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,666
We found security footage.

1206
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,333
A camera on the boardwalk.

1207
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:55,750
And we recovered
some of your landlord's footage.

1208
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,625
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
You were right.

1209
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:03,125
Pavic drove Kate home
after she reported her bag stolen.

1210
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:06,083
We think he did make a pass at her.

1211
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,833
When she rejected him,

1212
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,791
he took it badly.

1213
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,416
[Beth sighs, sniffles]

1214
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,833
So he... he killed her.

1215
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:24,250
[Kovac] Based on the autopsy results,

1216
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,583
we can safely assume
Pavic hit her over the back of the head,

1217
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,416
and then dumped her body in the harbor

1218
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,875
while she was still alive.

1219
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,375
Why?

1220
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,375
I...

1221
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:43,875
I... I don't understand.

1222
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,708
Pavic used to work vice. [sighs]

1223
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:50,041
Several women

1224
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:54,208
he arrested for sex work
claimed he assaulted them.

1225
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,166
Internal Affairs investigated it,

1226
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,750
but the women
all withdrew their statements.

1227
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:04,208
We think he threatened them.

1228
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,541
IA couldn't fire him,

1229
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:09,500
so unfortunately, they moved him over
to the tourist division.

1230
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,625
She didn't deserve this.

1231
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,041

01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,583
I ordered a search warrant

1234
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,458
on Luka and Mateo's apartment
and workplace too.

1235
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,458
We found ketamine.

1236
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:29,791
They've been drugging the women
who hired them then robbing them.

1237
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,958
They drugged Kate too,

1238
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,833
but the cocaine
in her system counteracted it.

1239
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,541
We are charging them.

1240
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:38,625
[sniffles]

1241
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,500
So I'm free to go then.

1242
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:44,666
[Kovac] Wait a second.

1243
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:48,833
[drawer opens]

1244
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,666
In case you want
to press charges against your landlord.

1245
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,250
[sighs]

1246
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,916
[seagulls cawing]

1247
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,666
Are you okay?

1248
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,750
[sighs]

1249
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,458
Thank you.

1250
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,458
[soft music playing]

1251
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,208
[sniffles]

1252
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,083
[speaking indistinctly]

1253
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:06,958
[phone dings]

1254
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,416
[knocking]

1255
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,166
[shushing]

1256
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,708
Sorry, it's...

1257
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,541
a bit of a mess.

1258
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:38,291
Uh, I just put the kettle on.
Do you want to stay for a cuppa?

1259
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,083
I'm good.

1260
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:44,166
Uh, I packed clothes
and Ernie the sheep in the bag.

1261
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,750
I... I didn't bring diapers.

1262
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,250
I figured you had those.

1263
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,583
I can pop out and get some. No worries.

1264
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,666
Okay.

1265
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:57,375
Hey, there's this kids' art thing
at the park tomorrow.

1266
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:00,166
I was thinking
of taking Aster if you fancy joining us.

1267
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:04,500
Maybe we could have lunch after
at Georgio's, the three of us.

1268
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,041
Please.

1269
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:13,875
- Beth.
- [Beth grunts]

1270
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,208
[kettle whistling]

1271
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,458
Uh...

1272
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,791
You know, uh, I think you might
have my spare car key.

1273
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:40,708
Yeah, it's probably
in the bowl in the hallway

1274
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:41,958
or in my jacket.

1275
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,541
[objects clattering]

1276
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:52,916
[Beth sighs]

1277
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,708

1279
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,041
[music intensifies]

1280
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,083
Oh!

1281
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,625
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1282
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:14,083
- [chuckles]
- [Beth grunts]

1283
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:16,875
I... I got it online.

1284
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,208
I can send it back.

1285
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
- [Rob] You all right?
- [gasps]

1286
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,250
You find the key?

1287
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,500
[tense music playing]

1288
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:36,791
Uh...

1289
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,333
Can I use your bathroom?

1290
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,083
[Rob] Sure.

1291
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,958
[door locks]

1292
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,958

1294
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,000
[panting] Oh my... Oh my God.

01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:21,916

01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,541
[line ringing]

1297
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,208
[on phone] <i>Kovac.</i>

1298
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,583
It's me.

1299
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,500
<i>Beth.</i>

1300
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,333
What's wrong?

1301
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,958
- It wasn't Pavic, it was...
- [knocks]

1302
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,416
- [panting]
- [Rob] Beth.

1303
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,375
Uh... [sniffles]

1304
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,166
Just a minute.

1305
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,458
[breathing heavily]

1306
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,666
- [Rob] You okay?
- Yeah.

1307
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,416
I can't find Ernie the sheep.

1308
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,750
Where did you say it was?

1309
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,041
Oh. Uh...

1310
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,625
It's... It's in the bag. I'll... I'll get it.

1311
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,166
I'm gonna stay for that cup of tea.

1312
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,708
If that's, uh, still up for offer.

1313
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,916
- Yeah.
- [Beth] Yeah.

1314
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,458
Cool? Okay.

1315
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,166
[sinister music playing]

1316
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,541
- Right here.
- [Rob] Oh. Thanks.

1317
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,333
Sorry.

1318
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:05,833
Suppose you've got a lot to do
before you start work on Monday.

1319
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:07,791
Did you get the child-minding sorted?

1320
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,666
You're looking at me strangely. Do you...

1321
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,833
want more milk or...

1322
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,291
You killed Kate.

1323
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,458
[chuckles]

1324
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,583
- What?
- It wasn't Pavic.

1325
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:26,166
It was you.

1326
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,833
Is this some kind of joke?

1327
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,500
You flew in Friday night.

1328
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,291
- It's only two hours...
- It's insane.

1329
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:39,375
You flew back Saturday morning.
Won't be hard to check the flights.

1330
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,625
Beth, come on. You can't be serious.

1331
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:48,416
It's from her necklace,
and I found it in your jacket.

1332
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:56,166
[ominous music playing]

1333
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:06,666
Listen.

1334
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,375
I can explain. It was an accident.

1335
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,458
Oh my God.

1336
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:14,958
- What did you do?
- Stop. Wait. Listen to me. Listen to me.

1337
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I flew over.

1338
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,791
And I was waiting outside the apartment.

1339
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,166
I'd been calling and texting.
She wasn't picking up. I thought...

1340
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,708
I was terrified she told you.

1341
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:30,041
She kept threatening to. I thought
if she had, I could at least talk to you.

1342
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,125
Explain things.

1343
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,166
I was about to leave,
but then she showed up.

1344
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,416
Kate.

1345
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,333
Jesus. What the hell are you doing here?

1346
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,333
I needed to see you.

1347
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,291
You know this makes you a stalker.

1348
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,535
I didn't have a choice.
You wouldn't answer your phone.

1349
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,125
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

1350
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:54,416
Went for a walk.

1351
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:58,166
We ended up down by the water,
and we talked.

1352
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,291
Kate.

1353
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:00,375
[Kate] What?

1354
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,208
Have you told her?

1355
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,083
[sighs]

1356
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You going to?

1357
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:11,125
You're gonna ruin her life.
You wanna do that? I don't.

1358
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,500
Not unless...

1359
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,666
we're doing this. You and me.

1360
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,333
For God's sake, Rob.

1361
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,250
How many times? It meant nothing.

1362
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:24,125
How can you say it meant nothing?

1363
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,083
Why were we doing it if it meant nothing?

1364
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,250
Yeah. Yeah.

1365
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,791
I know. You have feelings for me.

1366
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,416
She told me...
She told me she was in love with me.

1367
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,041
She, she, she... She kept begging me.

1368
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,916
She was begging me to leave you.

1369
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:46,267
She said you were unhappy. I'd be
doing you a favor breaking up with you.

1370
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,250
I told her, I don't know how many times,
that was never gonna happen.

1371
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,333
Stop.

1372
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,833
What happened between us was a mistake.

1373
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,625
It was the biggest mistake of my life?

1374
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,750
[scoffs] It wasn't.

1375
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,375
[Kate] It was a rebound fling, and you...

1376
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:06,750
[sighs]...were in the right place
at the right time.

1377
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:09,208
- That's all.
- You're lying.

1378
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,875
Actually, from now on,
I'm only telling the truth.

1379
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:18,500
- Maybe you should try it too.
- [Rob] Please, please, Kate, please.

1380
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:20,625
- Don't tell her.
- Get off me.

1381
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:21,791
[Rob] Kate, come here.

1382
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:25,708
- Listen.
- [Kate grunts]

1383
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,916
- Stop it! Get off me!
- No, stop, listen to me!

1384
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I was angry.

1385
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,625
I lashed out.

1386
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:35,416
I hit her.

1387
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,583
Will you please...

1388
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,458
It just happened.

1389
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,625
She tripped and fell and banged her head.

1390
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,375
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1391
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,458
[ominous music playing]

1392
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,708
[Beth] <i>No.</i>

1393
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,458
You let her drown.

1394
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,416
No. No, I... I thought she was dead.

1395
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,351
- No, you didn't.
- [Rob] That's why I left her.

1396
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,083
You're lying.
I saw the autopsy report. She drowned.

1397
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,726
- She was alive in the water when you left.
- I'm telling the truth.

1398
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,750
- You have to listen.
- No, I don't have to listen!

1399
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,000
I will never listen to you again.
I should've listened to Kate.

1400
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,666
That's what the weekend was about.

1401
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,750
She wanted to remind me
who I was before I met you.

1402
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:26,833
That I deserve better.

1403
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:31,208
- What are you gonna do now, huh?
- You killed my best friend.

1404
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,041
You're not gonna tell the police, are you?

1405
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:36,958
What would be the point?
The case's closed. That cop's dead.
