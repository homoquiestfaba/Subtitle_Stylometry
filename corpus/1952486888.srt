0
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:03,144
Wolf Recon now completing scan
of Sector 4-1-2. No sign of enemy ships.

1
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,788
Whoa, that Invid Hive is a lot
bigger than I thought it would be.

2
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:18,638
(humming)

3
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,308
Alex, will you stop that humming?

4
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,310
Yeah, sure thing Marcus.

5
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,616
(whistling)

6
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,651
Alex, would you please get serious?!

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,154
What the heck, buddy,
you gotta relax.

8
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,159
(alarm beeps)

9
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,162
Heads up, we've got
an Invid patrol approaching.

10
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,222
Switch to Guardian mode,
we'll take cover in the debris field.

11
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,576
Ok, now hold your position,
and we'll just drift with the debris.

12
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,854
Would you look at that?

13
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,870
It's beautiful. You know, this is
the closest I've ever been to Earth.

14
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,206
It looks so peaceful.

15
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,701
Yeah, peaceful...
But only from up here.

16
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,885
Hard to believe it all started
with a single event

17
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,222
that brought Robotechnology to Earth.

18
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,893
It also brought waves of alien invaders
looking for the secrets of Protoculture,

19
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,830
the power source
behind Robotechnology.

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,334
The Earth was finally
overrun by the Invid,

21
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:59,239
a mysterious alien race obsessed
with obtaining Protoculture.

22
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,243
But nothing has ever stopped us
from fighting for Earth's freedom.

23
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,612
It didn't stop my sister Marlene,

24
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:10,250
her boyfriend Scott Bernard,
or the rest of the Mars Division.

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,255
Scott wanted to marry my sister once
their mission to liberate the Earth was over,

26
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,088
but the mission didn't end
the way we wanted.

27
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,936
They gave their lives trying to save
a homeworld we never knew.

28
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,770
And now it's up to those
who are left to continue the fight.

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,615
Take care, little brother.

30
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,618
Next time we see you,
it will be on Earth.

31
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,287
Goodbye, Marcus.

32
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,622
Marcus, Marcus!

33
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,958
--Huh?
--The Invid patrol's gone.

34
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,426
Right, let's get back to base.

35
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,298
Race you, loser buys drinks.

36
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,233
Race? What do you mean? Hey Alex!

37
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,313
Wolf Recon, you are cleared
to land at Aluce Bay 12.

38
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,822
Woo-hoo, it's finally drinking time.

39
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,181
Took you long enough.

40
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,149
Whatever...

41
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,187
You okay there buddy?

42
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,052
Yeah, I'm fine.

43
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,364
Alex, have you ever thought about
why we're doing all this?

44
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,199
To impress the girls, right?

45
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,369
The only girls we know
are pilots like us.

46
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,859
Here you go.

47
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,540
--Cola?
--What did you expect?

48
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,379
You know, Marcus, you're way too serious.
You need to lighten up, come on.

49
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,210
Alright, alright...

50
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,234
The humans have assembled their fleet
to reclaim their home world.

51
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,245
The final assault should begin soon.

52
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:58,081
Excellent, everything is transpiring
as the Awareness has foreseen.

53
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:10,096
This tactical diagram is from our last recon
flight over the Invid hive at Reflex Point.

54
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,600
All units will proceed to rendezvous
coordinates at T-Vector Delta.

55
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,170
Attack Group Three
will remain behind in reserve

56
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,439
awaiting the arrival
of Admiral Hunter.

57
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,275
Attack Group Two
will continue to objective

58
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,379
using their Shadow Devices
to avoid detection by Invid sensors.

59
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,449
Group One is already in position
on the planet's surface.

60
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,618
We must wait until they have
cleared a path to Reflex Point

61
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,455
before the invasion can truly begin.

62
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,625
Sir? What if they fail to knock out
the Invid defense shields?

63
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,061
If that happens,
we will abort the invasion

64
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,299
and we may have no choice
but to use the Neutron-S missiles.

65
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,969
But, then we'd be decimating
half the Earth just to defeat the Invid.

66
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,200
But sir, there are still several
million people living down there.

67
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,976
Settle down, folks.

68
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,646
I understand how you feel, but my orders
come directly from Admiral Hunter.

69
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,649
The domination of the Invid
must be stopped.

70
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,653
That means the Invid hive
at Reflex Point must be destroyed.

71
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,315
--Now prepare to move out.
--Yes, sir!

72
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,828
Captain Grant?

73
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:20,333
Sir, I'm concerned that Admiral Hunter
and the SDF-3 still haven't arrived yet.

74
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,835
With your permission, I'd like to take
the Icarus and search for him.

75
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,671
You want to search
the galaxy until you find him?

76
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,840
Admiral Hunter is my friend
too, Vince, but we...

77
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,677
General Reinhardt, incoming eyes only
transmission from the Omicron Sector.

78
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,513
It's the SDF-3!

79
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,683
Haha, speak of the devil! Put it on the
main screen, Sparks and stay here Captain.

80
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,186
--Yes, sir.
--Put him through, Sparks.

81
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,855
This is SDF-3,
come in Command One.

82
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,192
This is General Reinhardt.
We read you SDF-3.

83
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,862
General, it's good to hear your voice.

84
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,365
Damn it, Sparks! Can't we get
a better transmission?

85
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
We're trying, sir!

86
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,368
According to Dr. Lang,

87
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,371
the calculations on the latest
Haydonite technology weren't adding up.

88
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,706
Janice agreed, so they're
running a field test.

89
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,708
But it's taking longer than we expected.

90
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,545
Should we delay the attack
until you arrive?

91
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,549
Negative, just proceed as planned,
we'll catch up once-

92
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,150
Rick, what's going on there?!

93
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,220
There's been an accident,
I'm not sure what-

94
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,722
Admiral?! Rick?!
What in the hell!?!

95
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,558
General, we have to launch
a rescue mission!

96
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,062
Okay then, Vince. Take the Icarus
to the Omicron Sector to find the Admiral.

97
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,731
Make sure the Protoculture matrix is safe!

98
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,222
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

99
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,904
And Vince?

100
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,074
Don't tell anyone
but your crew about this.

101
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,735
Understood, sir.

102
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,060
Icarus, stand by for pre-flight.

103
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,761
Captain on the bridge!

104
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,764
Fire up the Protoculture, Louie.
We're moving out!

105
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,768
Technically, Captain,
Protoculture isn't ''fired up''.

106
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,604
But, I know what you mean.

107
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,773
Listen up, everyone,
we've got a change of orders.

108
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,942
Are we leading the first attack wave, sir?

109
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,780
Negative, set course for Omicron
Sector, 3-5-J Vector Delta.

110
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,781
Omicron Sector?

111
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,952
Our orders are to locate and if necessary,
assist Admiral Hunter and the SDF-3.

112
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,283
Aye, aye, sir.

113
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,125
Icarus, you are cleared for departure.

114
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,974
Activate Shadow Device.

115
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,318
The last thing we need
is for the Invid to spot us.

116
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,986
Shadow Device activated, sir.

117
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,656
Shadow dimensional field
now at full strength.

118
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,492
Fold system, standing by.

119
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,484
--Execute hyperspace fold jump!
--Yes, sir.

120
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,198
Hang on, Rick. We're coming!

121
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
So, it has begun.

122
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:24,805
Yes, at long last, the vision
of the Awareness will be realized.

123
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,891
Attention, attention. All pilots to
Shadow Fighters, this is a combat alert.

124
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,189
All stations, we are at Yellow Alert.

125
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,365
You like her...

126
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,855
Go on, say something.

127
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,534
Uh...

128
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:52,378
Say, uh... that's a nice little
''skull'' on your flight suit, there.

129
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,380
You know, it's really
no different than the skull

130
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,882
on any other Skull
Squadron flight suit.

131
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,717
(laughter)

132
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,877
Loser!

133
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,390
Ah... Well, it looks
especially good on you.

134
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,728
You're right, maybe one of these days
you'll be lucky enough to wear one.

135
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,958
That is, if you're good enough.

136
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,234
Whoa, she's a tough one.

137
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,403
Cute, but tough.

138
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,573
I like your ''skull''?!?

139
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,308
What was that, buddy?!

140
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,243
--It's all I could think of.
--You're hopeless.

141
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,653
Wolf Three, you're clear to launch.

142
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,086
Roger that, Control.

143
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,601
Ok, Lieutenant Rush, this is it.

144
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,936
Let's go out there and win
this one for Mars Division.

145
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,767
Yes, sir, Commander Taylor.

146
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,137
Marlene, Scott...
This one's for you...

147
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,534
Invid approaching at Vector 3-2-Niner.

148
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,804
Synchro Cannons, prepare to fire.

149
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,836
All systems activate Shadow Devices
and proceed to attack coordinates.

150
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,770
Shadow systems activated.

151
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,743
Hey, now that the whole fleet
is equipped with Shadow technology,

152
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,313
the Invid don't stand a chance!

153
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:12,184
Yeah, but even if they can't see us,
that still doesn't mean they can't hit us.

154
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,688
Hey, no way buddy,
no one's going to hit me!

155
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,849
Invid deploying at Q Vector Theta.

156
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,371
Attack Division 12, move to intercept!

157
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,239
Wolf Leader to Wolf Squadron.
All units, engage!

158
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,214
Oh, yeah! Six bogies down in a
single pass, try and top that, Alex!

159
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,225
--Marcus, behind you!
--What?

160
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,560
Holy sh-

161
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,226
Relax, I got it.

162
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,757
Whew!

163
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,259
Thanks, I owe you one.

164
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,253
One? Looks more like twenty-four
to me... but, whose counting?

165
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,770
Wow, she's some pilot.

166
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,762
Yeah, well it helps when you've
got a Beta full of missiles!

167
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,116
Blast it! Why in heaven's name haven't
those troops taken out Reflex Point yet!

168
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,620
Sir, the 2nd, 3rd and 5th Divisions
have reported extremely heavy losses

169
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,588
and I can't raise the 14th at all.

170
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,627
Agh... at this rate we won't
be able to hold out against them

171
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
for more than a few hours or so.

172
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,632
Contact Attack Group One on Earth now,
get me Captain Harrington!

173
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,793
--Not responding, sir.
--Commander Reynolds?

174
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,804
Well, damn it! Find somebody,

175
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,640
anybody down there who can tell us
what the hell is going on!

176
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:21,146
This is Command One to Attack Group One.
Come in, please! Any unit please respond!

177
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,249
Command One, this is Lieutenant
Commander Scott Bernard,

178
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,485
21st Combat Squadron,
Mars Division.

179
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,154
Who? Mars Division!

180
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,825
I have it here, sir. He's been
leading a resistance group on Earth.

181
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,487
They've joined up with us
to attack Reflex Point.

182
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,135
Commander Bernard, what's the
status of the First Attack Group?

183
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,170
Have you taken Reflex Point yet?

184
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,007
No, sir. We've encourntered
very heavy resistance.

185
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,677
The Invid have repulsed our main attack.
Recommend we fall back and regroup.

186
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,680
We're sending down a squadron
of Shadow Fighters to assist.

187
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,182
We need to kill all the damned Invid!

188
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,673
Kill them all?
That means I need to find...

189
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,351
There she is!

190
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,354
Why is she going back into the Hive?

191
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,702
Wait!

192
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,048
What are you doing here?

193
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,552
Scott, despite all we have been
through together, I know who I am now.

194
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:38,390
I am Ariel, daughter of the Regess
and Princess of the Invid.

195
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,895
Ariel, it doesn't matter to me
whether you're human or Invid.

196
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:49,068
It does matter, Scott. Only I can convince
the Regess to stop this senseless conflict.

197
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,740
You and I, we're proof that humans
and Invid can co-exist peacefully.

198
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,642
The Regess doesn't believe that.

199
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:01,580
Scott, I sense something that may change
her mind, but I must go before it's too late.

200
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,916
Then let me go with you!

201
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:09,388
The Regess isn't very fond of humans, Scott,
and I'll need to convince her myself.

202
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,822
Then hurry, we don't have much time!

203
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,162
That's going to take
some getting used to...

204
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:37,616
So, Ariel, I see you have accepted your
Invid form and chosen to join me in the Core.

205
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,121
Yes, Mother Regess, but only
to implore you to end this struggle.

206
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,057
The Invid and humans can co-exist.

207
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,294
Your exposure to the humans
has clouded your mind.

208
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:54,967
This world is where the Flower of Life,
the source of all Protoculture, blooms.

209
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,137
This world would have
sustained our people.

210
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,740
But the Protoculture on this world
can sustain many people.

211
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,977
Fighting these humans makes us no better
than the Children of the Shadow

212
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,479
who drove us from our homeworld.

213
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,550
The humans have aligned themselves
with the Children of the Shadow.

214
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,952
Observe their new technology.

215
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,123
Their vehicles are now
invisible to our sensors.

216
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,494
No, co-existence with
the humans is not possible.

217
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:28,167
This planet too strongly retains
the malignant spirit of the Robotech Masters.

218
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,337
Whether one race or the other emerges
victorious is of little meaning.

219
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,507
Such hatred can only breed more hatred.

220
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,532
Are you saying it will never end?

221
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:45,350
My child... this conflict will rage
from generation to generation.

222
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,686
It is not what we seek.

223
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,857
I shall proceed to the world
that even now calls to me.

224
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,295
We shall consume all the Protoculture
and rise to a higher plane.

225
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:01,700
But the humans use Protoculture as an energy
source, taking it would leave them helpless!

226
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203
My decision has been made.

227
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,707
The Protoculture is our life's blood.
It belongs to us.

228
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,198
We shall not leave it behind!

229
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,717
Still no word from the Icarus
or the SDF-3, sir.

230
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,386
We've waited long enough,
move in Attack Group Three.

231
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,221
Yes, sir.

232
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,390
I never should have sent Grant
on that damned rescue mission.

233
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,551
We're going to need
every ship we've got!

234
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,225
Attack Wave Three, move out!

235
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,911
Sir, I'm picking up strange
gravitational readings.

236
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,581
Recommend we adjust re-entry point
to Omicron J-Vector Theta.

237
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,749
Helm!

238
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,843
On it, Captain. Commencing
de-fold operation now!

239
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,764
A black hole!

240
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,100
This wasn't on the
navigational computer, sir!

241
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,769
Never mind that! We're
the rescue mission, remember.

242
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,437
Now, full thrusters!

243
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,405
Aye, aye, full thrusters now!

244
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,446
It's no use, sir. We're
stuck in the gravity field!

245
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,614
Can we fold out, Captain?

246
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,118
With that strong a gravitational pull,
there's no way to calculate where we'd end up.

247
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,120
However, if we create a ''fold sphere''

248
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,456
utilizing the Shadow Device's
dimensional shift field...

249
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,693
We may be able to escape
the black hole's gravitational field.

250
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,795
Ok, crew.
Let's give it a shot.

251
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,631
Helmsman, follow Dr. Nichols'
calculations to the letter.

252
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,968
Actually, there all numbers,
there aren't any letters.

253
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,136
(growl)

254
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,433
Nevermind!

255
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,640
All set, sir!

256
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,316
On my mark! Execute
the Nichols manuever!

257
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,483
Now!

258
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,383
Fold sphere losing integrity!

259
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,990
Shadow dimensional field at 30%.

260
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,158
Sir, we're almost out!

261
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,389
Maintain course,
forward thrusters, full power!

262
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,828
Fold sphere has collapsed!

263
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,342
We're clear!

264
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,844
Nice work! Everyone.

265
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,346
Now, damage report.

266
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,351
Shadow Device is completely inoperable.
Fold systems are offline, but repairable.

267
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,352
Get on it, Louie!

268
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,519
I already am, sir!

269
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,856
Sir, sensors have just picked up
two ships adrift, nearby.

270
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,524
They are both ours.

271
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,016
The science vessel Deukalion
...and the SDF-3!

272
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,901
Captain, we're receiving a short range
transmission, it's Admiral Hunter.

273
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,637
Finally, some good news!

274
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,875
Vince Grant, you old hotshot, I should
have known you'd try a rescue mission!

275
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,211
Admiral... what the hell happened?

276
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,380
There's a big problem
with the Neutron-S missiles,

277
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,717
our test firing nearly destroyed
both the SDF-3 and the Deukalion.

278
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,053
--What's your status?
--We're in pretty bad shape...

279
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,388
Most of the ship's propulsion,

280
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,491
long range communications
and weapons systems are offline.

281
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,326
We'll send over an engineering team.

282
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,029
Negative, Vince. Our first priority
is to warn the fleet about the missiles,

283
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,398
they must not be used!

284
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,567
Rescue the Deukalion,
the information aboard it is vital to us!

285
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,871
Sir, what about the Protoculture
matrix aboard the SDF-3?

286
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,406
This is much more important, Vince.

287
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,409
We've discovered a critical flaw
in the Neutron-S missiles.

288
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,843
I can't believe it...

289
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,947
Under no circumstances should the fleet
use the Neutron-S missiles on Earth!

290
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,917
Understood, stand by Admiral.

291
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,921
Contact the fleet, Priority Channel.
I need to talk to General Reinhardt right now!

292
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,910
Yes, sir.

293
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,094
What was that?!

294
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,296
It appears that we're under attack, sir!

295
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,265
Oh, really, thank you for the
scientific analysis, doctor.

296
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,769
Sir, there's nothing on my scope!

297
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,439
Switch to visual!

298
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,941
What the hell is that?!

299
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,411
I've never seen that configuration,
they're definitely not Invid.

300
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,447
It doesn't matter, battlestations!

301
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,116
Red Alert, all hands to battlestations!

302
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,118
Get Admiral Hunter back on the comm!

303
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,954
Sir, short range communications
are now being jammed as well!

304
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
Damn it!

305
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,459
Louie, get the fold systems back online!
We still have to warn the fleet!

306
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,861
But if we can get
close enough to the SDF-3,

307
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,126
I think we can bring her and the
Protoculture matrix back with us!

308
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,116
Wolf Leader to Wolf Squadron!

309
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,486
We can't let the Invid
get the upper hand.

310
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,386
Now follow my lead!

311
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,008
Huh?

312
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,873
Look out, Wolf Leader!
Behind you!

313
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,849
Aagh!

314
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,339
Commander Taylor!

315
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,194
Commander Taylor!

316
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,525
No!

317
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,696
No!

318
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,225
Sir, the Shadow Fighter Squadrons
are meeting intense opposition!

319
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,227
We've just lost Commander Taylor!

320
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,229
The Invid are overwhelming us!

321
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,066
Sir, we've lost all contact
with our Ground Forces.

322
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,067
Ah...

323
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,570
Then the attack against
Reflex Point has failed.

324
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,071
Well, sir?

325
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,240
I have no choice...

326
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,975
I want all our Neutron missiles

327
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,580
armed and ready for an immediate
offensive on Reflex Point!

328
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,604
Yes, sir!

329
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,583
Ahhhh!

330
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,594
Ahhhh!

331
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,739
Eat this!

332
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,116
Now preparing Neutron-S
missiles for launch.

333
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,352
T-Minus 30 seconds and counting.

334
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,947
What?! They can't be serious!
We still have troops down there!

335
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,788
I know, but the Invid
must be stopped at any cost!

336
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,304
Neutron-S missiles deployed.
All units pull out!

337
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,649
The final attack has begun...
and a terrible error has been made.

338
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,817
We shall not be defeated!

339
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,148
What is it?

340
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,590
I have seen this weapon before!

341
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,328
The humans cannot possibly
understand its destructive power!

342
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,131
Their world will be destroyed!

343
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,166
Mother, are you sure?

344
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,670
Yes, but do not worry my child...

345
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,341
I will not give the Children of the Shadow
their victory over the Invid today.

346
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:02,013
Now, Ariel, we must leave.
Our destiny calls to us.

347
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,016
I'm very sorry, Mother,
but I cannot go.

348
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,019
I believe there is a reason
for me to stay.

349
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,288
Ariel, be warned.

350
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:15,293
If you choose to stay, your fate
will be inexorably tied to the humans

351
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,196
and the Shadows that will
soon fall upon them.

352
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,701
I understand all that, Mother,
but I must stay here on Earth.

353
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,869
Very well, my child...

354
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,872
If that is your decision, so be it.

355
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,376
I will intervene on your behalf.

356
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:36,948
The humans have been influenced too strongly
by the Shadows of the Robotech Masters

357
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:41,352
and are intent only on the
destruction of their entire race.

358
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,877
It shall not be!

359
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,231
Huh?

360
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,077
They're leaving, she did it!

361
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,763
Ariel, my child... behold...

362
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:31,269
The destruction of these weapons is my final
gift to you and the world you so cherish...

363
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,940
We will continue our evolutionary
development elsewhere...

364
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,443
Come with me, my children,

365
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:44,949
discard this world and follow the Spirit
of Light as it beckons us onward!

366
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,452
I don't believe it!

367
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,120
They just fled!

368
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,456
The damned Invid just ran away!

369
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,293
That was too easy!
That was all just too damn easy!

370
00:29:55,293 --> 00:30:00,131
You call that easy? Marcus, are you
out of your head? It wasn't easy!

371
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,567
Yeah, I agree that was
a difficult battle,

372
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,804
but I don't understand why the Invid
suddenly retreated either.

373
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,740
Attention, all fighters are to return
to moonbase for debriefing.

374
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,481
An unexpected result. Once again
the Invid have escaped destruction.

375
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,983
But our goals remain unchanged.

376
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,986
The Protoculture addicts
must be eliminated.

377
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,757
All those who use the power
contained in the Flower of Life

378
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,626
pose a potential threat
to our domination.

379
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,857
Now, receive my new instructions.

380
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,827
Proceed with the tasks I have given you.

381
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,847
More direct action is required.

382
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,851
Are you ready to receive the tasks
the Awareness has set upon you?

383
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,519
Yes.

384
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,355
But what about the humans?

385
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,448
All in due course.

386
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,666
Hold steady.

387
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,876
Docking clamps locked!
The Deukalion is secure!

388
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,211
Fold system, back online, sir!

389
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,212
Good work, Louie.

390
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,883
How soon can we have the SDF-3
within range of the fold sphere?

391
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,884
30 seconds, sir.

392
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,888
Maintain course. Set fold coordinates
to return to Moon Base Aluce in 30 seconds.

393
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,723
Starting... now.

394
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,057
Coordinates are set, sir.

395
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,728
Attention, space fold
in T-Minus 30 seconds.

396
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,396
Approaching SDF-3.

397
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,732
15 seconds to fold.

398
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,602
--SDF-3 now within range of fold sphere.
--10... 9... 8... 7...

399
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:49,073
6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

400
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,904
--Thank god.
--1...

401
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,907
No!

402
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,748
The SDF-3 has moved out of range,
Captain. Shall I abort the fold?

403
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,263
No, we can't delay.
We must warn the fleet!

404
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,890
Commencing Space Fold!

405
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,101
Mayday, mayday, this is the SDF-3...

406
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,947
Damn it, Rick, I'm so sorry.

407
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,745
Let's just hope there's
still a fleet left to warn.

408
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,984
Ariel...

409
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,487
I'll never be able to thank you
for what you've done for the planet Earth.

410
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,524
I like to think of it as my planet too.

411
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,995
You... you're here. But...

412
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,497
Why didn't you leave Earth
with the rest of the Invid?

413
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,234
This planet is the only home
I've ever known Scott.

414
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,671
Now, weren't you going to thank me?

415
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,007
Yes.

416
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,175
Thanks.

417
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,344
I have to rejoin the fleet.

418
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,849
I'm sure they're going to attempt to find
Admiral Hunter and I have to be a part of it.

419
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,020
Why? Scott, you've already done so much.

420
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,522
Stay here on Earth, with me.

421
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:49,527
Ariel, you've proven to me that the Invid
are not the evil race I thought they were.

422
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,365
Now I have to convince the expeditionary force
that your people should not be destroyed.

423
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,034
Then let me come with you.

424
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,536
It'll be safer for you on Earth.

425
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:04,375
I've lost too many loved ones while at war
and I don't want to risk losing you.

426
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,037
Does that mean that you love me?

427
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,709
I... I promise... I'll be back.

428
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,733
All of our damaged ships are now returning
to Space Station Liberty for repairs.

429
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,070
This will leave the earth vulnerable,
so we're still on alert.

430
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,738
And to make matters even worse,

431
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,909
the Invid took all of the planet's
Protoculture with them.

432
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,913
The expeditionary force now has
less than a year's supply remaining...

433
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,750
...and without the Protoculture
matrix from the SDF-3,

434
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,420
it's impossible to create any more.

435
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,755
Less than a year?

436
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,256
How will we power our ships?

437
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,425
That's the big picture people.

438
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,929
Your individual commanders
will fill you in on the rest.

439
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,191
Dismissed.

440
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,168
Yeah, for those of you
who still have commanders.

441
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,269
I'm telling you Alex,

442
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,940
things would be a whole lot better
if all of those aliens were just wiped out.

443
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,603
If every alien life form was
wiped out, you'd be dead by now.

444
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,947
Oh yeah? What is that
supposed to mean?

445
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:23,121
I seem to recall saving you from the Invid.
24 of them in fact. And I'm half alien.

446
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,724
But, but, you don't look like...
I mean, you don't look different...

447
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,127
I mean you don't look like an alien.

448
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,129
(Laughs)

449
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,797
Uh-huh.

450
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,767
You'll have to excuse Marcus.
He doesn't get out much.

451
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,137
By the way, I'm Alex Romero.
And you are?

452
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,007
Lieutenant Commander
Maia Sterling, Skull Leader.

453
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,644
You're both Wolf Squadron. I'm sorry
to hear about Commander Taylor.

454
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,813
Thanks. He was a good man.

455
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,981
Because of the heavy losses,

456
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,152
General Reinhardt has decided
to merge Wolf and Skull Squadrons.

457
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,653
You'll be serving under me now.

458
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,489
So you'll get to wear a little
skull on your flight suit.

459
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,649
Uh...

460
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,163
Yes, sir... I mean, not...
I- I mean ma'am.

461
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,665
Delighted my lady.

462
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:14,172
Watch your step Lieutenant, I don't put up
with lip from men under my command. Got it?

463
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,503
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,012
Too bad. I'd put up with
her lips anytime, right Marcus?

465
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,120
No comment. I think we've
already insulted our brand new CO

466
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,023
one too many times Alex
so don't push it.

467
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,994
Oh... Marcus, you really like her,
don't you my friend?

468
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,231
Does it matter? She's a
commander. I'm a lieutenant.

469
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,202
You give up too easy buddy,
now listen, if I were you, I'd go and-

470
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,205
Yellow Alert. Unscheduled
space fold in progress.

471
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,866
Now what's going on here?

472
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,718
Where's the fleet?

473
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,222
I don't know, sir. But the Earth
is still here, that's good news.

474
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,224
Unless...

475
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,328
Three enemy fighters have
followed us out of the space fold.

476
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,396
Everyone back to your post.

477
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,455
Try to contact Moon Base Aluce.

478
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,905
Communications are still down.

479
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,465
We won't be able to take
many more hits like that.

480
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,415
Captain, they're coming in
for another pass...

481
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,248
We've detected another fighter.
It's one of ours.

482
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,592
I don't know who you guys are,
but you're sure not friendly.

483
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,928
Still can't get a lock.

484
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,453
Guess I'll have to keep
doing it the old fashioned way.

485
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,778
Icarus, this is Moon Base Aluce.
You okay up there?

486
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,114
Sparks, get me General Reinhardt.

487
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,103
Yes, sir!

488
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,288
General, the Neutron-S missiles
have a serious flaw. They must not be fired.

489
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,457
The Neutron-S missiles
have been destroyed, Captain.

490
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,792
What? But how?

491
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,955
Don't worry. You'll get a full
debriefing after you've landed.

492
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:24,792
Welcome back, Icarus.
You're clear to dock in Hangar Bay 2.

493
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:34,111
Repair teams to Bay 2.
Repair teams to Bay 2.

494
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,444
All emergency personnel prepare
to receive incoming wounded.

495
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,818
Vince?

496
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,653
Vince! Are you okay?

497
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,823
We're alive, thanks to that pilot...

498
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,825
Lieutenant Commander
Scott Bernard, sir.

499
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,328
I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd lend a hand.

500
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,664
Captain Grant, do you have any idea
who or what was attacking you?

501
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,834
No General, I don't.
But the SDF-3 is still back there.

502
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,269
I need to find the Admiral.

503
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,671
The first place you're going
is the infirmary.

504
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,840
I think you've broken your leg.

505
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,034
Medical team!

506
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,179
But Admiral Hunter is-

507
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,348
Listen to your wife, Captain.

508
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,516
Besides, if the SDF-3
was able to fold,

509
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,815
it would probably head to Space
Station Liberty for repairs.

510
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,184
So that means you're coming
with me, to the infirmary.

511
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,327
Okay.

512
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,703
Thank you, Commander Bernard.

513
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,205
You're welcome, sir.

514
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,874
Bernard? Scott Bernard?

515
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,876
Scott, my god is it really you?!

516
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,211
Marcus?

517
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,379
Marcus Rush!

518
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,047
Ah, ha!

519
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,715
I can't believe it.

520
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,218
Neither can I. Look at you.

521
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:52,390
But Scott, I thought you...
the whole Mars Division... were wiped out.

522
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,859
You're alive and you're here.

523
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,394
What about Marlene? Did she...

524
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,230
I'm sorry Marcus.
She didn't make it.

525
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,733
I would have traded my life
for hers if I could. I...

526
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,570
I- I know... seeing you I just...

527
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,572
I just hoped...

528
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,708
It's so good to see you Scott.

529
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,410
It's good to see you too.

530
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,412
How have you been?

531
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,247
Well, I became a pilot.

532
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,083
--This is my wingman Alex Romero.
--Great to meet you, Commander.

533
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,218
Hey, would you like to go
grab a drink with us?

534
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,821
I'd like that. Mind if
I get cleaned up first?

535
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,424
No problem, and let's
get you a new uniform.

536
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,093
I want the Icarus repaired and
back in action as soon as possible.

537
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,390
Yes, sir.

538
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,936
Uh, sir. I'd like to request assistance
salvaging data from the Deukalion.

539
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,372
Admiral Hunter said there's
vital information aboard.

540
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:45,399
I'll have Commander Sterling assist you.
Report your findings back to me, doctor.

541
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,283
Wow!

542
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,454
No survivors. Was the SDF-3
this badly damaged?

543
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:01,289
No. However, it did sustain
major damage from the test firing.

544
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,597
Whoa. This must be Janice.

545
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,799
She's beautiful.

546
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
She's a robot...

547
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,496
...and she looks broken.

548
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,640
Did I do that?

549
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,809
Perhaps she's merely damaged.

550
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,208
Let me see.

551
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,324
There ha... There ha...

552
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,328
There has been a terrible error.
We must warn the fleet.

553
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,831
Don't worry. It's okay.
The fleet's not in any danger.

554
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,400
The Invid are gone. They fled.

555
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,336
You misunderstand me.

556
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,672
It is the Neutron-S missiles
that pose the threat.

557
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,833
They've been taken care of as well.

558
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,180
What about the crew?

559
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,182
Did anyone else survive?

560
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,520
No. Here, let me help you.

561
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,887
Identity. Dr. Louis Nichols.

562
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,694
Yes, yes that's me.

563
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,424
Yes, I will need your help.

564
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,202
Oh, no. This can't be happening again.

565
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,893
Your fate is now tied
to the humans on this planet.

566
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:48,399
But beware, the Children of the Shadow
will soon fall upon them

567
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,902
just as they did
to our people long ago.

568
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,240
They will stop at nothing to destroy
those who use Protoculture.

569
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,577
The humans cannot anticipate their deceit,
their cunning, or their destructive power.

570
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,310
The Children of the Shadow
are going to attack the humans.

571
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,180
I must try to warn Scott!

572
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,004
Well, apart from a few bad memory
blocks, you look to be okay.

573
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,607
Thank you for assisting me
with my diagnostic.

574
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,599
What can I say, I've always
had a thing for machines.

575
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,946
Not that I think
you're just a machine.

576
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,948
But I am a machine.

577
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,951
And in many ways, machines
are superior to you humans.

578
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,621
I'm guessing you're superior
to any machine I've ever...

579
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,626
Um, so, maybe you can fill me in
on something I don't understand.

580
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,719
How very human of you.

581
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,432
Ah, yes.

582
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:56,967
Now, the Neutron-S missiles,

583
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,971
how could they even be constructed
if some of the calculations didn't work.

584
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,640
Well, first you must understand

585
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,976
that much of the design was based
on Haydonite technology.

586
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,910
Diagnostic check completed.

587
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:14,151
Now I really don't understand what you're
talking about. What's Haydonite technology?

588
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,820
Technology from the Haydonites of course.

589
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,489
Right.

590
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,325
Keep going, I'm just a human, remember?

591
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,495
The Haydonites are a highly
advanced cybernetic race

592
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,165
Admiral Hunter forged an alliance with
during the Robotech Expedition.

593
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:32,503
Since then, the Haydonites have shared
much of their technology with us.

594
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,172
Many of our latest advances
are because of them.

595
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,676
But an alliance with an advanced
alien race is really good news, isn't it?

596
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,511
Why doesn't everybody
know about this?

597
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,013
It was at the request
of the Haydonites.

598
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,683
They've have lived quietly
in peace for centuries

599
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,686
and prefer to limit their
involvement with any other races.

600
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,855
And yet they're helping us
with our war against the Invid?

601
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,525
They too have suffered
at the hand of the Invid.

602
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,994
I believe that is why
they are so secretive now.

603
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,229
So then, how do you
fit into all this?

604
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,332
Because of the Haydonite's
desire for solitude...

605
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:07,571
I was created from both human and Haydonite
technology to serve as an emissary.

606
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:12,543
So they gave you information and it was up
to the robotechnologists to sort it all out?

607
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:17,537
Correct. And everything appeared
to be working perfectly until now.

608
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,052
I don't understand.

609
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,389
I am unable to account
for these inconsistencies.

610
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,558
Well then, maybe
you could use a break.

611
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,059
Or, at least I need a break.

612
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,228
There has to be some
sort of a connection,

613
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,399
but my human brain needs more time
to process all of this new information.

614
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,236
Then, may I accompany
you on your break?

615
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,673
I find human companionship
to be most interesting.

616
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,408
No, no, no, that's okay.

617
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,578
You can stay and continue accounting
for all of the inconsistencies.

618
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,741
Dr. Nichols, we've just
finished the modified...

619
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,019
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

620
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,055
Oh, no, you're not interrupting
anything, Commander.

621
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,590
We were just... I mean,
you were saying?

622
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,427
We finished the modifications
you requested for Skull Squadron.

623
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,929
I was wondering if you
needed anything else.

624
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:10,501
Actually, yes. I need to know
how to get to the mess hall.

625
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:15,105
The mess hall is on level 5, but the
Officer's Club really has better food.

626
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,941
I was about to go there myself.
Care to join me?

627
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,272
Lead on, Commander!

628
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,105
Come on, Janice.

629
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,455
I hope the food's
better than the singing.

630
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,979
You're not the only one.

631
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,634
Hey, Commander Bernard,
try some of this.

632
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,467
It's a brand new alien drink.
They call it Zarayba.

633
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,275
--What's in it?
--Scott, you really don't want to know.

634
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,401
Drink up!

635
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,547
That's terrible.

636
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,316
Why didn't you contact anyone
from the expeditionary force

637
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,651
while you were back on Earth?

638
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:05,489
Believe me, if I had been able
to contact the fleet, I would have.

639
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,659
The past two years, I've been fighting
with a small resistance force.

640
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,161
We forced the Invid's hand
at Reflex Point.

641
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,665
No kidding, Commander Bernard.
You were actually at Reflex Point?

642
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,067
Commander Sterling!

643
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,001
Would you please join us?

644
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,669
At ease.

645
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:32,850
Marcus, Alex, this is Dr. Louie Nichols,
Robotech engineer for the Icarus.

646
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,855
And you're Lieutenant Commander
Scott Bernard, the man who saved the Icarus.

647
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,525
Scott was also part of the resistance force
on Earth that defeated the Invid.

648
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,694
I bet you saw a lot of action.

649
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,698
Yep. The Invid were nothing
if not persistent.

650
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,268
So how many of those green-blooded
maggots did you kill?

651
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,203
I have no idea? Why?

652
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,540
Remember when you
and Marlene gave me this?

653
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,643
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

654
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,380
It's become my tribute to you
and Marlene. Check it out.

655
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,216
For every Invid I've killed,
I carved a little notch.

656
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:10,220
Counting the last battle, I've
personally killed twenty-nine Invid.

657
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,724
That's, um... something. Uh...

658
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,021
Scott.

659
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,229
Um, Ariel? What are you doing here?

660
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,992
I need to talk to you.

661
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,402
Um, everyone... this is Ariel.

662
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:30,407
She was a member of the resistance
force I fought with on Earth.

663
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,070
Then have a seat, Ariel.
Any foe of the Invid is a friend of mine.

664
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,048
I've killed twenty-nine Invid.

665
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,752
Scott.

666
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,312
We should probably go.
Excuse us.

667
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,593
That was abrupt.

668
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,561
Maybe it's the singing.

669
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,261
Janice?

670
00:48:55,098 --> 00:49:00,604
Dream of you late at night.

671
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,342
What do you do?

672
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:10,948
When I turn out the light.

673
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,784
No matter who I touch.

674
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,620
Wow, she's really pretty good.
Who is she?

675
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,791
She's my assistant.
She's wonderful, isn't she?

676
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,126
Yeah, she is.
Check her out.

677
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,295
She's not your type, Marcus.

678
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,797
How would you know?

679
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,899
Oh, woman's intuition.

680
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,634
Huh?

681
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,803
What? Hey, don't look at me buddy.

682
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,465
You heard the lady.
Trust a woman's intuition.

683
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,070
Look, I'm going to go
get another drink.

684
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,907
Hey, Marcus.

685
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,654
I'm sorry if I startled you Scott,
but you're the only one I can trust.

686
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,991
Do you have any idea how dangerous
it is for you to be here?

687
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,661
Everyone on this base
has orders to kill Invid on sight.

688
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,830
I've had another vision, Scott.

689
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,999
The Children of the Shadow are coming.

690
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,836
They will attack your fleet.
A space station will be destroyed.

691
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,338
Wait a minute. I don't understand
what you're talking about.

692
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,828
I'll show you.

693
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,345
Remember when we first met?

694
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,515
I didn't even know who
or what I was really.

695
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,973
Only now am I learning what I am
and what I'm capable of.

696
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,529
Whoa...

697
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,531
What is this place?

698
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,034
This is the Invid's first home world.

699
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,704
It was devastated long ago
by the ''Children of the Shadow.''

700
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,672
That's terrifying.

701
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,208
But, why are you
showing me all this?

702
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,377
Because this may be humanity's fate

703
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,213
if you continue to trust
the Children of the Shadow.

704
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,214
What are you saying?

705
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,550
I don't even know who the
''Children of the Shadow'' are.

706
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,219
But your people possess
their technology.

707
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,056
The Regess recognized it
during the battle for Earth.

708
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,558
That is why the Invid fled.

709
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,227
Wait a minute, are you telling me
that these Children of the Shadow

710
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,220
are somehow responsible for creating
the new Shadow technology?

711
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,636
Only because it serves their plans.

712
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,738
Look around Scott.

713
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:19,910
This is what the Children of the Shadow do
to civilizations who use Protoculture.

714
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,745
But why?

715
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,339
Because they fear its awesome power.

716
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,555
After my sister died,
Rick and I were like brothers.

717
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:35,425
I owe him so much.
I can never repay him.

718
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,427
He believed in me,
made me a Captain..

719
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,597
...and the one chance
I had to help him I failed.

720
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,765
You didn't fail.

721
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,267
You did exactly
what he asked you to do.

722
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,036
You returned to warn the fleet.

723
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,105
By the time we got back,
the battle was over

724
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,596
and now we're in desperate
need of Protoculture.

725
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,276
Dammit.

726
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,279
Don't beat yourself up about it Vince.

727
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,615
Rick has a knack for cheating death.

728
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,784
I have a feeling he's okay.

729
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,412
Call it a wife's intuition.

730
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,786
Doctor?

731
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,464
I've just fused the Captain's leg, sir.

732
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,367
Provided he doesn't put
too much weight on it.

733
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,636
Alright, I promise you, I won't.

734
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,140
Vince, you better not.
Now I'll leave you two to talk.

735
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,308
Thank you, Jean.

736
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,477
Any word from Admiral Hunter?

737
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,979
Nothing.

738
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,616
Once the Icarus is repaired
you can return to Omicron Sector.

739
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:37,320
I've reassigned Lt. Commander Sterling's
Skull Squadron to assist with the search.

740
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,656
It'll be good to have her aboard.

741
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,160
Did Louie recover anything
useful from the science vessel?

742
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,830
As a matter of fact, he recovered
an android. Her name is Janice.

743
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,332
Did she say what's wrong
with the Neutron-S missiles?

744
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,169
Not yet, but that's
fairly irrelevant now.

745
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:57,340
The only Neutron-S missiles we have left are
still in space dock at Space Station Liberty.

746
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,673
And just moving them would use more
Protoculture than we can afford.

747
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,349
Then our real concern is recovering
the Protoculture matrix from the SDF-3.

748
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,452
Yes, exactly. Which is why
you need to rest now.

749
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,689
Once the Icarus is ready to go,
I'll need you in top form.

750
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,524
I won't let you down, sir.

751
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,253
I'm sure you won't, Captain.

752
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,467
Please, Scott. Promise me
you'll warn your people.

753
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,695
I'll try.

754
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,707
Hey, Commander Bernard.
Is that girl from Earth still here? Huh?

755
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,709
Scott, look out! She's Invid.

756
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,879
Marcus, wait! You don't
understand. Ariel's a friend.

757
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,380
A friend?

758
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,369
No!

759
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,397
You! You're a traitor!
How could you do this?

760
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,733
Now I know how you survived
the Mars Division massacre.

761
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,904
You must've sold them out to the Invid.
I bet you even killed Marlene.

762
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,405
What?

763
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,574
You're crazy,
I loved your sister!

764
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,910
Marcus, you gotta back off.

765
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,745
This won't bring Marlene back.

766
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,407
He's not worth being
court martialed for.

767
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,913
Yeah, you're right partner, he's not.

768
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,258
Alex, thanks.

769
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,926
Don't thank me.

770
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,763
I just don't want Marcus to get busted
for killing a superior officer.

771
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,266
Even one who's assisting an Invid spy.

772
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,758
--What? I wouldn't-
--Save your explanations
for General Reinhardt.

773
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,780
A warning you say?

774
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,616
Yes. I believe the aliens
that attacked Captain Grant

775
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,286
are going to attack a space
station. Maybe Liberty.

776
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,954
And this is the same
source that told you

777
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,657
the Neutron-S missiles
were created by aliens?

778
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,125
I told you before,

779
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,461
the Invid fled because they
recognized the Neutron-S missiles

780
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,630
as weapons used by their old foes...

781
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,466
...an alien race called
the Children of the Shadow.

782
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,468
Children of the Shadow?

783
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,972
Look, I don't know if that's their real name,
that's what the Invid call them.

784
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:13,643
You seem to know a great deal
about the Invid. Why is that?

785
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,479
We're getting nowhere with this.

786
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,648
Look, it's kinda difficult to explain.

787
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,651
While on Earth,
I gained an Invid contact.

788
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,154
Yeah, Invid contact my ass!

789
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,325
But how else would he know the Neutron-S
missiles were a gift from an alien race?

790
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,493
He's been stuck on Earth for two years.

791
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,662
He's been brainwashed by the Invid.

792
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,998
After all, the Haydonites are their enemy.

793
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,000
The Invid want to confuse us.

794
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,337
Maybe to lure the fleet away
from whatever their real target is.

795
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,672
Sir, I think we should
at least warn the fleet.

796
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,675
What if Scott's information about
the impending attack is accurate?

797
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:50,180
It's just some sort of Invid trick.
The Haydonites are our allies.

798
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,248
Why would they scheme
against humanity

799
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,517
when they've helped us
in our war against the Invid?

800
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,855
General Reinhardt, sir. We have lost all
communication with Space Station Liberty.

801
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,357
Dammit!

802
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,689
I guess the interrogation is over.

803
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,870
Status report, Sparks.

804
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,373
Communications with
the base are being jammed.

805
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,209
I recognize the modulation
of the jamming signal.

806
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,699
Wait a second!

807
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,880
Is this true?

808
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,382
Yes, that's correct.

809
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,549
That's it!

810
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,220
Sir, it's the same aliens that
attacked us in the Omicron Sector.

811
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,289
If that's the case, General,
we should investigate immediately.

812
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,392
Agreed. Now get going, Vince!

813
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,627
Janice, I want you
to accompany the Captain.

814
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,231
I'm afraid our new enemy
may be an acquaintance of yours.

815
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,357
Oh!

816
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:52,075
So, Scott, how much do you trust
this Invid you've befriended?

817
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,412
I trust her completely sir,
and her name is Ariel.

818
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,981
Please, you must believe us.

819
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,417
Hmm? So you're Ariel.

820
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,586
The race you call the Haydonites
are the Children of the Shadow

821
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,755
and they will destroy humanity.

822
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,926
Sir, they destroyed the Invid
home world. I've seen it myself.

823
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,762
How did you know they were going
to attack Space Station Liberty?

824
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,931
Why should we believe you?

825
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,765
I see things. Just go there
and see for yourself.

826
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,105
Okay. No time to lose.

827
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,442
Scott, I want you and Ariel
to join me on the bridge of the Icarus.

828
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,773
Allow me.

829
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,374
Does she do that a lot?

830
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,295
All ship Shadow Devices are active.

831
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,628
First combat defense line
now engaging enemy ships.

832
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,148
Human forces moving into range.

833
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,319
The battle fortress containing
the Protoculture matrix is not among them.

834
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:14,484
While this was not foreseen,
we are to destroy them regardless.

835
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,679
Damage reports coming in.

836
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,182
All sections reporting heavy casualties.

837
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,352
No! The first combat defense line
has been completely annihilated.

838
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,686
That's impossible.

839
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,021
Captain?

840
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,857
Prepare to fire Synchro Cannons.

841
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,690
All ships prepare to fire main guns.

842
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,034
Synchro Cannons on line
and ready to fire.

843
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,525
Initialize disruptor wave.

844
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,880
Captain! We've got an energy
malfunction in the Synchro Cannon.

845
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,881
Can we fire?

846
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,872
Negative, it's not responding!

847
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,237
This is proving to be even easier
than the Awareness had foreseen.

848
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,740
Another human vessel has been
detected unfolding nearby.

849
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:42,404
Excellent. Its destruction will add
to the success of our mission.

850
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,572
Skull Squadron, launch when ready.

851
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,753
One hit and our ships just explode.

852
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,763
How is that possible?

853
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,767
Estimating losses at 89%, sir.

854
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,103
Can you get me the fleet commander?

855
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,506
Still unable to raise the fleet
or Space Station Liberty, Captain.

856
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,440
Damn! Hmm...

857
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,778
Full stop!

858
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,447
Sir?

859
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,951
Full stop! I'm not about to dive into
a battle just so we can get slaughtered.

860
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,942
Aye, aye, sir. Full stop.

861
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,459
Any idea what we're up against?

862
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:33,463
They are the Children of the Shadow.
The Haydonites, I told you.

863
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,300
If they are Haydonite ships,
they do not resemble any I have seen.

864
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,803
Sir, we need a better look
at the enemy's weaponry.

865
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,306
More information would be useful.

866
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,142
I assume communications
with Skull Squadron are jammed?

867
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,645
No, sir. We have full
communications with our fighters.

868
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,812
Captain Grant!

869
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,315
After analyzing the enemy's
jamming techniques,

870
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,318
I retrofitted our communications
to an amplitude modulation.

871
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,154
It's only good for short range
communications, but...

872
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,156
You never cease to amaze me, Louie.

873
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,658
Get Skull Leader on the horn.

874
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,326
It's actually just called
a horn because-

875
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,661
Stop it.

876
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,650
Yes, sir.

877
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,670
Ok, Skull Squadron. Keep up.

878
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,839
Captain Grant needs a better look
at the enemy weaponry.

879
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,842
So, we're going on
a little recon mission.

880
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,675
Activate your data transmitters
and just follow me.

881
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,019
Why are we always stuck
doing recon, Marcus?

882
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,789
Just follow orders, Alex.

883
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:38,194
Knock off the chatter, Romero, or else you're
going to find yourself in a world of hurt.

884
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,029
Hey, buddy. That might be fun.

885
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,533
Oh, please. Alex, will you
give it a rest already?

886
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,525
Now approaching
Robotech fleet. Look sharp.

887
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,212
I'm picking up a power surge
from the carrier up ahead.

888
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,544
Hey guys. I've never
seen anything like that.

889
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,892
Dammit Louie, give me something
to go on! Soldiers are dying out there!

890
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,728
Somehow the enemy's energy wave

891
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,898
caused the ship's reflex furnace
to overload and then implode.

892
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,067
But that should not happen
according to my data.

893
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:22,238
The shadow dimensional field completely
shields the power source of the ship.

894
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,571
Unless there's something wrong
with the Shadow Device...

895
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,412
Of course! Shut down
all the Shadow Devices.

896
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,246
Sir?

897
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,749
Now! Switch to maneuvering thrusters.

898
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,752
Pull us away from the combat zone
and into Space Station Liberty...

899
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,754
...and have our fighters do the same.

900
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,258
All fighters disengage Shadow Device
and fall back to Space Station Liberty.

901
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,094
Skull Leader to Icarus.
What's going on, Captain?

902
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,431
The Shadow Device has been compromised!
That's why the fleet's getting slaughtered!

903
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,766
Now fall back!

904
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,767
Understood.

905
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:55,431
Skull Squadron, deactivate Shadow Devices
and fall back to Space Station Liberty.

906
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,945
Commander Sterling, enemy ships
are in pursuit and gaining.

907
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,447
I can't get a weapons lock on them.

908
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,779
No problem, Skull Leader.
I'll take care of them.

909
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,450
Ok, boys. Let's see you avoid
a blast from my Synchro Cannon.

910
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,623
Huh?

911
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,804
What the hell?

912
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,806
System failure.

913
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,974
Alex, something's wrong
with your Synchro Cannon.

914
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,305
I know, I know.

915
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,815
All right, Skull Squadron, jettison
Synchro Cannon modules immediately.

916
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,807
Repeat, jettison Synchro
Cannon modules immediately.

917
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,657
Mine isn't responding.

918
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,659
Alex, what're you doing?

919
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,828
Those enemy fighters
are coming in too fast.

920
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,330
You'll never make it back
to Space Station Liberty alive.

921
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,332
Alex, don't do this.

922
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,836
Don't worry. I've got it
all taken care of buddy.

923
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,633
Be sure to have a Zarayba on me.

924
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,511
Alex, eject.
That's an order!

925
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,002
Sorry, my lady. Can't hear you.

926
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,530
No! Damn you Alex!

927
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,519
No!

928
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,538
Skull Leader, what's going on out there?

929
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,874
We've lost Lieutenant Romero, sir.

930
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:43,212
The enemy's energy wave appears to have
the same effect on our Synchro Cannons.

931
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,213
Louie, deactivate the-

932
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,717
Already on it, sir.
Synchro Cannon off line.

933
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,554
Maia, head for Liberty's mecha hangar,
and ditch those Shadow Fighters.

934
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,556
God knows what else is wrong with them.

935
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,891
Yes, sir.

936
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,892
Dammit!

937
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,894
We've been completely double-crossed!

938
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:02,231
Everything the Haydonite's have given us
have some sort of Trojan Horse built into it.

939
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,399
Ariel was right.

940
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,563
They don't just want to get rid of the Invid.
They want to get rid of us as well.

941
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,576
Arrest her!

942
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,411
Captain, what're you doing?

943
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,914
She's part Haydonite.
She's one of them.

944
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:23,085
Captain Grant! I was unaware of any
ulterior motive by the Haydonites.

945
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,589
And that's why you're the only one
to survive the Neutron-S missile test?

946
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,591
Sorry, but I'm not buying it.

947
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,424
Get her off my bridge,
and throw her in the brig.

948
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,772
With all due respect, Captain!

949
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,107
I went over the calculations
with Janice myself.

950
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,443
--I don't believe she could possibly-
--Easy, Louie.

951
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,276
If I didn't know you better,
you'd be arrested too.

952
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,951
Several human ships are retreating.

953
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,956
Clearly, they do not yet comprehend
that their entire race is doomed.

954
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:06,295
Our victory today will mark the rise
of a new epoch for the Haydonites.

955
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,464
The electromagnetic signature of the Hybrid

956
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,133
has been detected aboard
one of the retreating ships.

957
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,802
The Hybrid is here?

958
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,637
This was not foreseen.

959
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,129
She might prove too valuable
a resource for the humans.

960
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:23,646
Lead a detachment of elite fighters
to infiltrate the human ship.

961
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:28,985
Extract the hybrid and obtain
the location of the Protoculture matrix.

962
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,988
Or, if necessary...

963
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,824
...eliminate her.

964
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,156
Approaching Space Station Liberty.

965
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:59,181
Space Station Liberty to Icarus,
you're clear to dock.

966
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,517
Louie, search the shipyard registry.

967
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,687
We need to trade the Icarus for
something without Shadow technology.

968
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,856
Well, all I can find is the Ark Angel.

969
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,359
But it's only a colony ship.
Minimal armaments.

970
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,361
It'll have to do.

971
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,696
Dock with the Ark Angel.

972
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,866
Tell the crew to evacuate everyone
on the station to the Ark Angel.

973
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,201
There may be a slight problem, Captain.

974
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,871
The Ark Angel's reflex furnace is offline.

975
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,702
Well, can you get it online?

976
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,878
I believe so, but it'll take
an hour, maybe more.

977
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,539
Get me Skull Leader.

978
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,716
Commander Sterling,
what's your status?

979
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:37,208
We're in the mecha hangar, attempting
to assemble a new fighter squadron.

980
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,729
What're these?

981
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,397
They're Super Shadow Fighters.

982
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,889
Prototypes that have not yet
had Shadow Devices implemented.

983
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,573
What good are these going to be
without Shadowtech systems?

984
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:01,243
They're faster and more maneuverable
and their weapon systems pack a big punch.

985
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,079
Otherwise, they're just like the old Alphas.

986
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,413
We're just going to have to go back

987
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,750
to the old basic ''seat-of-your-pants''
dog-fighting skills.

988
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,919
Skill over technology, boys.

989
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:14,256
Yeah, just because we can't see 'em
on our scopes doesn't mean we can't hit 'em.

990
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,587
Let's saddle up.

991
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,101
Think you can use them
to hold off the attackers for an hour?

992
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,937
We'll do our best, sir.

993
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,106
Ok, Louie, you've got an hour.

994
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,095
Yes, sir.

995
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,625
We are now docking with the Ark Angel.

996
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,295
My team and I will need to get to the Ark
Angel's engine room as quickly as possible.

997
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,126
I think I can help there.

998
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:06,642
Wow... near instantaneous
molecular teleportation.

999
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,145
That would make for a fascinating invention.

1000
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,978
But the Ark Angel's reflex
furnace will have to come first.

1001
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,653
Most impressive. We could use
your help evacuating the station.

1002
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:18,984
Of course.

1003
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,991
Should I help with the
evacuation as well, sir?

1004
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,652
No, Scott, you're with me.

1005
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:30,332
All hands, evacuate
to the Ark Angel immediately.

1006
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,502
One ship doesn't stand a chance
against the Haydonites...

1007
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:38,007
...but Lieutenant Romero's final
act of bravery has given me an idea.

1008
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,343
I got a feeling
I'm not going to like this.

1009
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,611
Probably not.

1010
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,182
We're going to set up a Neutron-S
missile inside the space station.

1011
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,850
And blow the whole thing up?

1012
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,754
The blast radius is big enough that
it will take out the enemy fleet as well.

1013
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,522
It's the best shot that we have.

1014
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,691
Sir, I'll activate it myself.

1015
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,193
You go aboard the Ark Angel and-

1016
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,361
Hey! Who's giving the orders here?

1017
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,362
Sir!

1018
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,532
Only a senior officer can
activate a Neutron-S missile.

1019
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,830
At least we built
that safeguard into them.

1020
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,396
Besides, when else will I get a chance
to try out these new Cyclones?

1021
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,711
Just don't tell my wife
I've been riding one.

1022
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,871
No, sir.

1023
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,222
Captain Grant wants to make sure
the prisoner is secured aboard the Ark Angel

1024
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,058
before the rest of the Icarus is evacuated.

1025
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:29,956
This way.

1026
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:50,903
Security breach in Sector 7G.
Security breach in Sector 7G.

1027
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,572
Open fire!

1028
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,764
You will come with us now.

1029
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,100
I want to know why
your people lied to me

1030
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,936
about the technology
I passed on to the humans.

1031
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,273
You were provided only what was
needed to fulfill your purpose.

1032
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,776
Now you will give us the location
of the Protoculture matrix.

1033
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:24,113
It appears not all
is as you had foreseen.

1034
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,282
Therefore, I refuse.

1035
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,273
Then you become expendable.

1036
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,788
Organics are no match for the
mechanized might of the Haydonites.

1037
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,787
Guess we'll see about that.

1038
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,001
This means nothing.

1039
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:23,172
All those who embrace
Protoculture are doomed.

1040
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:27,336
We shall prevail.

1041
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,841
Not today.

1042
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,676
Thanks for the assist.

1043
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,188
You saved me.

1044
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,357
Well, I figure if the
Haydonites want you dead,

1045
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,359
that's a good reason
to keep you alive.

1046
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,528
The Haydonites have betrayed me
as much as they have betrayed you, Captain.

1047
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:50,199
Then I guess you'll need to escape
on the Ark Angel like everyone else.

1048
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,191
I'm sure Dr. Nichols could use
your help in the engine room.

1049
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,705
All right everyone.

1050
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:00,368
We might be flying different mecha now
but we're still the same squadron.

1051
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,539
Okay, Skull Squadron.
Follow my lead.

1052
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,223
Incoming enemy fighters.

1053
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:18,060
Ok, let's see how well they fight
when they can't cheat.

1054
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,221
Visual targeting systems activated.

1055
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,424
Relax, I got it. Okay?

1056
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,755
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,270
This is for Alex!

1058
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,813
Are you sure we didn't pass it?

1059
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,804
Yes. It should be just ahead.

1060
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,628
Damn! Those are the Neutron-S missiles?

1061
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:30,299
Yep. They're a little hard
to miss, aren't they?

1062
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,968
Now I understand why we can't
just launch these right at 'em.

1063
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,459
Yeah, they certainly
would see these coming.

1064
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,477
All this technology, and they
can't put in an elevator?

1065
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,808
Easy there, Captain.

1066
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,151
I was beginning to wonder why
you needed me to come along.

1067
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,986
Now, watch your leg.

1068
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:55,324
If we make it out of this alive,
my wife's going to kill me.

1069
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,155
Looking forward to it, sir.

1070
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,332
Please confirm authorization.

1071
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:09,168
Captain Vincent S. Grant,
serial number R-X-F-030185.

1072
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,667
Identity confirmed.

1073
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,844
Hmm...

1074
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,191
Neutron-S missile armed and activated.

1075
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,026
Let's get the hell out of here.

1076
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:35,019
Detonation of Neutron-S
warhead in ten minutes.

1077
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,868
Detonation of Neutron-S
warhead in nine minutes.

1078
01:15:54,883 --> 01:16:00,389
The power output is now sufficient
for operation of a hyperspace fold system.

1079
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,891
Evacuation complete, sir.

1080
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,893
Louie, status report.

1081
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,384
The reflex furnace is online.

1082
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,900
I just hope the rest of this
ship is space-worthy.

1083
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,731
We will find out soon enough.

1084
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,914
Now departing Space Station Liberty.

1085
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,758
A colony vessel appears
to be attempting an escape.

1086
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,095
We cannot allow them to get away.

1087
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:43,087
Cut off its escape route
and eliminate it.

1088
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,604
Sir, the enemy fleet is closing in.

1089
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,596
Stay close. I don't want
to leave anyone behind.

1090
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,279
Commander, I need you to hold off
the enemy just a little longer

1091
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,949
so we can clear the station's gravity
field and engage the fold system.

1092
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,284
Understood.

1093
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,447
Skull Squadron, let's clear
a trail for these things.

1094
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:18,467
Detonation of Neutron-S
warheads in 60 seconds.

1095
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,137
We've cleared the space station's
gravitational field. Standing by to fold.

1096
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,300
Have Skull Squadron return
to fold perimeter immediately.

1097
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,819
Maia, there are too many of them.

1098
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,825
Keep cool, Marcus. I...

1099
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,173
My stabilizers are out!

1100
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,834
Hang on, I got ya!

1101
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,849
Skull Leader, ejecting!

1102
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,862
I got ya.

1103
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,710
--I'm hit.
--Marcus, your thrusters are out.

1104
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,546
Don't worry commander,
I know what I'm doing.

1105
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,535
I hope.

1106
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,385
Marcus, no!

1107
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,722
It's okay. They won't
get me without a fight!

1108
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,713
Aaahhhh!

1109
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,569
Detonation of Neutron-S
warhead in 15 seconds.

1110
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,903
Get us out of here.

1111
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,064
Aye, sir, activating space fold drive.

1112
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:15,250
If this fold doesn't work Ariel,
I just wanted you to know that...

1113
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,741
I promise, I'll be back.

1114
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,583
I love you.

1115
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,427
Aaahhhh!

1116
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:37,098
Detonation in 4... 3... 2... 1...

1117
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,446
We have a Neutron weapon detonation.

1118
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:49,440
This was not foreseen.
Quickly, initiate space fold and-

1119
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,620
It's beautiful.

1120
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,296
Where am I?

1121
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:18,980
Wait! Is that... Marlene?

1122
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,649
Is that really you?

1123
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,318
It is, I can't believe it!

1124
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,320
Big sister, I've missed you so much!

1125
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,656
I know, and you have been brave.

1126
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,158
But it's not your time yet, Marcus.

1127
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,662
Please, don't leave me again.
You're all I've got.

1128
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,825
I'll always be with you, Marcus.

1129
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,997
No, wait! Marlene!

1130
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,007
Marlene!!!

1131
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:58,520
No, I am Ariel, daughter of the Regess,
Princess of the Invid.

1132
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,522
You?

1133
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,024
You saved my life.

1134
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,360
Why?

1135
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,362
You know I hate the Invid.

1136
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:12,200
Hatred can only breed more hatred.
It is not what we seek...

1137
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,861
...any of us.

1138
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,200
Ark Angel now entering Earth orbit.

1139
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,722
Based on the information
we now have from Janice,

1140
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,892
the SDF-3 may not have
been destroyed after all.

1141
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,560
Our best hope of winning this war

1142
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,898
is to recover the Protoculture
matrix before the Haydonites do.

1143
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,066
And with a little luck,
Admiral Hunter will be there waiting.

1144
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:49,070
Agreed. I am confident
the Ark Angel is in capable hands.

1145
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,072
Good luck on your new
mission, Captain Grant.

1146
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,061
Thank you, sir.

1147
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,579
Marcus, I just wanted to say
thank you for rescuing me out there.

1148
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,240
We're even now.

1149
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,751
I'm sorry about Alex.

1150
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,920
I know he was a good friend.

1151
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,256
Yes, he was.

1152
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,761
It seems like everyone
I'm close to gets taken by war.

1153
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,930
My sister...

1154
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,932
My best friend...

1155
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,934
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1156
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:22,270
Most of my family
was aboard the SDF-3.

1157
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,761
I don't even know
if they're still alive.

1158
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,109
He owes you his life.

1159
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:32,280
True. Perhaps now it will make him
value the lives of others.

1160
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,283
I'm glad you'll be joining the crew
of the Ark Angel, Ariel.

1161
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:39,321
So, you don't want me to wait
for you on Earth anymore.

1162
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,118
No...

1163
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,131
Are you okay Janice?

1164
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:52,968
I am confused.

1165
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,805
Well, actually, that's very human of you.

1166
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,807
That's what's confusing me.

1167
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,809
Don't worry about it.

1168
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,977
We'll work it out.

1169
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,480
Somehow, I know... We will win.

1170
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,141
We will win...

1171
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:15,824
Life is only what
we choose to make it.

1172
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:20,495
Let us take it.

1173
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:25,159
Let us be free...
