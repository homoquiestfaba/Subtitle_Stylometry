1
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,396
O 'Rourke, Dylan. Age, 28.

2
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:07,026
Cause of death?

3
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,154
High speed car crash.

4
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:12,323
Very romantic,
very sensational.

5
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,076
Very James Dean.

6
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,961
Here how I keep track
of time, Dylan.

7
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,799
Every October
16th, I find you here.

8
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,969
Ten years
of clockwork.

9
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,768
What do you want
with me, detective?

10
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,437
I'm just looking
out for you.

11
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,317
It still doesn't
make sense.

12
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,320
Her ring was missing.

13
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,864
She never took that ring off.
The-the cabby--

14
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,950
There's a lot of illegal
cabs out there, Dylan.

15
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,411
We've gone
over all this.

16
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,954
It was an accident.

17
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,082
It was no accident.

18
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,627
I need to find out
what really happened.

19
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,962
Go home.

20
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,248
Denial's the first stage.

21
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:57,085
Elvis. Take that guy.

22
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,006
Some people actually
believe he still exists.

23
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,178
Yeah, denial.
Christ, I can't believe Elvis is dead.

24
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,556
Then depression.
Shit, Elvis is dead.

25
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,520
What am I gonna do?
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

26
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,272
And then anger.

27
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,608
Why?

28
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,903
Why did he have to die?

29
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,823
And finally, acceptance.

30
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:30,701
All right. It makes sense.
It's all God's will.

31
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:35,665
The king is dead.
Rest his soul.

32
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:37,667
Do you know what
I'm saying, Mr. Stark?

33
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,083
You know, your
family and friends

34
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,587
probably just can't accept
the fact that you're dead.

35
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,340
I wouldn't worry about it.

36
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:32,889
Frank Sinatra was a no show
at Dean Martin's funeral.

37
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,266
Can't get much closer
than the Rat Pack.

38
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,315
I think it's time
to call it, lad.

39
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,318
Just five more minutes.

40
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,237
For Jesus sake, Dylan,
no visitors are comin'.

41
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:53,492
Bastards are probably already
out spending his money.

42
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,453
Tomorrow'll be a
big turnout though.

43
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,914
Young kid's
about your age.

44
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,958
Actually, he's
a year younger.

45
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,960
You knew him?

46
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,796
He was the quarterback on my
high school football team.

47
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,300
We hooked up for 27
touchdowns one senior year.

48
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,137
So you'll see all
your old friends tomorrow.

49
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,599
I-I haven't seen any of
them in a long time.

50
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,353
All the more reason
to catch up.

51
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:24,649
You ever
fantasize about,

52
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,985
you know, watching
your own funeral?

53
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:32,156
Of course.
Doesn't everybody?

54
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,661
My father always said you can only
really tell a man's character

55
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,247
by who shows up
at his funeral.

56
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,042
That's a little late
by that point.

57
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,628
One of life's
great fucking ironies.

58
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:52,718
But Dylan, if you've got to wait 'til your
funeral to find out what makes you tick,

59
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,596
my heart aches for you.

60
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,563
Rest in peace.

61
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,698
Would you like
some tea, Dylan?

62
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,742
Tea? For Jesus, Liz!
He'll have a shot of whiskey.

63
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:19,662
No. I-I don't drink.

64
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,539
Better you than me.

65
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,875
Liz, I'm going to decorate
the inside of me glass.

66
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,713
You give the fucking insomniac
a tall tumbler of warm milk.

67
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,673
Is your family
in the city?

68
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,759
I don't talk
to them anymore.

69
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:38,556
Uh. Liz, he never puts
that bloody thing down.

70
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,601
It's a sentimental thing.

71
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,479
The yo-yo almost always
comes back to you.

72
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,565
Reminds me of
the mistakes I've made.

73
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,235
Mistakes. We all
make mistakes.

74
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,905
There's a difference
in mistakes and regrets.

75
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,074
Oh.

76
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,911
Decko gave me that.

77
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,832
The hands are for friendship,
the heart is for love,

78
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,501
and the crown
is for loyalty.

79
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,213
Someone close to me
had the same ring.

80
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,928
And if the heart is pointed inward,
it means your heart is taken.

81
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:23,225
Shite. They'd better
go get me Viagra.

82
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,901
I like him. Don't get
me wrong. It's just that--

83
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,487
This genetic Viagra
is full of shite.

84
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,781
I can't quite
figure him out.

85
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:43,120
Oh, Liz. He's just a lad, that's
all, who needs some guidance.

86
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,563
Don't feel sorry for him-

87
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:14,568
There are people who float through
life wantin' to be alone.

88
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:18,614
It doesn't bother them that they
don't affect anything or anyone.

89
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,119
Dylan probably
feels sorry for us.

90
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,163
He doesn't have
to be like others.

91
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,231
And, uh, so you
guys've been together for a while,

92
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,860
but you guys didn't really like
each other when you first met.

93
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,862
That's true. Yeah.

94
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,697
Freshman year,
we met.

95
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,866
It kinda, we didn't
hang out as much,

96
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,368
and, you know, that
kinda changed probably--

97
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,663
Different friends and then--

98
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,583
And then we--remember
that party we went to?

99
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,544
Yeah. That's when we probably
started hanging out there.

100
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:18,174
Yeah, and then we made out that night.

101
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,759
So, what do you guys have
planned after graduation?

102
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,553
We're going to
college together.

103
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,555
Uh, so, keeping
it alive, huh?

104
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,224
Yeah, forever.
Forever.

105
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,313
Shit!

106
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,971
Forever.

107
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:17,274
Someone close to me
had the same ring.

108
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,699
Dylan.

109
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,662
Dylan-

110
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,083
Please, open up.

111
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,836
I know you're in there.

112
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,632
Dylan, open the door.

113
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,636
Lei' me in.

114
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,558
I wanna help
you through this.

115
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,228
I'm missing you-

116
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,783
Dylan! Dylan, open please.

117
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,702
Please.

118
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,459
What, are you nervous?

119
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,002
We'll take care of him.

120
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,505
Go on. It's all right.

121
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,333
Ew. Does he work here?

122
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,837
I thought he'd be a big shot lawyer
or something by now. How pathetic.

123
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,215
Is that who I think he is?
You gotta be kidding me.

124
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,551
I haven't seen him
in years, man.

125
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,177
I thought
he was dead.

126
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:36,390
Didn't he use
to date Natalie Penner?

127
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,732
Natalie Penner. That's what fucked him up.
Fucking chick, man.

128
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,067
His best friend, Steve.

129
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,821
Yeah. Don't you remember?
Dylan and Natalie were together and then Steve,

130
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:54,241
than fucking rat snake.
Yeah, he just sharked her.

131
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,346
And the yo-yo returns.

132
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,933
So, did you see some
of your old pals?

133
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,060
Some of them.

134
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,895
Did you talk
to any of them?

135
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,524
No.

136
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,442
Listen to me, son.

137
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,947
Here's your opportunity
to rebuild some relationships.

138
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,285
Some of those relationships
I'd just rather bury.

139
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,831
Hi!

140
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,165
Hi.

141
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,042
Are you two married?

142
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,128
No. Not yet.

143
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,964
So, when are
you getting married?

144
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,590
In May.

145
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,008
Congrats. May what?

146
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,637
May, the day never come.

147
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,390
I'm just trying
to get my career going.

148
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,059
I just don't really have much time
for all that wedding type shit.

149
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,772
Now, don't get me wrong. She's a great girl.
They just think what I'm thinking.

150
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,316
So, where are you working?

151
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,946
Wright and Price law firm. Trying to get partnership.
There's some thick coin.

152
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:59,157
I, uh, couldn't believe when I
heard about Shawn. It was just--

153
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,285
I don't know. It feels
like yesterday he was--

154
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,996
When he was throwing
touchdowns to Dylan?

155
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,041
Speaking of Dylan, does anyone
know what he's been up to lately?

156
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,541
Dylan!

157
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,964
Steve. How are you?

158
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:00,177
Real good, man.
Christ, it's, uh, been a long time.

159
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,852
Shit!

160
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh.

161
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,696
Excuse me. You wouldn't happen
to have an extra one, would you?

162
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,616
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

163
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,034
Have two.

164
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,535
Thank you.

165
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,081
You--y-you work here?

166
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,542
Yeah, I do. And you?

167
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:37,714
I've made partner at Axler, Wright
and Price law firm. Thick coin.

168
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,553
So, who's the ghost?

169
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,889
Old boyfriend.

170
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,350
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

171
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,228
How long has it been since
you've seen that poltergeist?

172
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,271
Ten years ago.

173
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,315
You make that
sound like eternity.

174
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,112
Yeah, a lot's
happened since then.

175
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,991
A lot of waiting?

176
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,659
A lot of waiting.

177
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,829
He's special.

178
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,833
He was special.

179
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
So, uh, this--

180
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,797
This, uh, you know,
job get you laid?

181
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,260
What's that?

182
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:28,598
Excuse me. Dylan, there's a flower delivery out back.
I could use your help.

183
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,891
See you, Steve.

184
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,685
Catch you later,
Dylan.

185
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,783
Natalie.

186
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,618
Hi.

187
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,829
When did you
start smoking?

188
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:56,001
Oh, ten years ago,
but it seems like--

189
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,794
Like yesterday.

190
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,212
Yeah.

191
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:08,597
You know this is the seventh
death from our class?

192
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,725
You'd think we'd run into
these people at weddings,

193
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,896
but instead you get, "You're
cordially invited to a funeral."

194
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,902
Are you still in med school?
Did you finish?

195
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,905
No, I didn't start.
I'm a nurse.

196
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,240
Nurse?

197
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:31,912
You've probably seen some of my patients.
I'm really not that good yet.

198
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,332
You remember the finger I sprained
during the Carson Heights game

199
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,709
and you, um,
taped the wrong one?

200
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,420
I can't lift anything
with this now.

201
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,881
I'm so sorry.

202
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,175
No. I'm-I'm kidding.

203
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,768
Oh!

204
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,235
I should go back
inside, you know.

205
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,612
Steve can't
stand smokers.

206
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,242
Natalie.

207
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,620
Ten years have, uh,
really done you justice.

208
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,081
Thanks.

209
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,719
Done you justice?

210
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,806
I'll always be grateful if you got
a lot to clean up after the party.

211
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,058
Good indication
you've got friends.

212
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,477
No wonder my place is
so clean all the time.

213
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:42,107
I bet if it was you in that box
today, you'd have the same turnout.

214
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,401
You have to be somebody.

215
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,154
I've been gone too long,
and people forget.

216
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:50,991
You'd be surprised what
death brings out in people.

217
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,329
No, it'd be
another Mr. Stark.

218
00:24:56,413 --> 00:25:00,125
No, bollocks. It'd be bigger
than Jack Kennedy's funeral.

219
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,423
Let's have my
funeral then.

220
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:10,635
All the Guinness you can drink
says nobody shows up at my wake.

221
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,762
You serious?

222
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,683
Yeah. We'll-we'll put my name in
the obituaries. Easy as that.

223
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,106
It reminds me of
the good old days.

224
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,859
You, you faked a funeral?

225
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,237
April Fool's day, 1975.

226
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:33,909
Me and me Da got my brother to
believe I was run over by a tractor.

227
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:38,455
He comes into the church.
I popped out of the coffin.

228
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,874
Scared the living
shite out of him.

229
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,919
What did he do?

230
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,590
He beat the shite
out of me.

231
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,259
Didn't talk
to me for six years.

232
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:57,849
Whatever happened at throwing eggs at
houses and burning bags and dog crap?

233
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,269
The Irish don't mess around
when it comes to pranks.

234
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,610
O'Rourke, Dylan Age 28

235
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,820
He was a graduate
of Pennington High School

236
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,865
and member of the City
Championship football team.

237
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,495
Cause of death?

238
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,497
High speed car crash.

239
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,125
Very romantic.
Very sensational.

240
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,753
Very James Dean.

241
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,591
Undoubtedly the ugliest
corpse I've ever seen.

242
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,052
You probably would look
better six feet under.

243
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:38,556
What about the high speed car crash?
I'm supposed to be a m-mangled wreck. Right?

244
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,227
Mm. Internal injuries.
Happens all the time.

245
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,855
Okay. If someone wants to touch
my hands, they'll be warm.

246
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,441
For fuck's sake, Dylan,
it isn't a petting zoo.

247
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,818
All right.

248
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,070
Nobody will touch you-

249
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:56,491
Just don't yawn or you'll give
some poor bastard a heart attack.

250
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,119
You sure your parents
don't read the obituaries?

251
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:02,622
No, they don't.
Even if they did, they wouldn't be here.

252
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,335
Show time, Dracula.

253
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,525
Where's the money, Charlie?

254
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,782
Answer me, you
junkie bitch!

255
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,170
Ah. For God's sake, Dylan,
it's getting late.

256
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,007
That was a stupid idea.

257
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,842
You win the bet.

258
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,762
All the apple juice
you can drink on me.

259
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,308
Dylan.

260
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,691
Sleep tight.

261
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,930
Decko.

262
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,541
Dylan O'Rourke.

263
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,669
What the fuck
did you do?

264
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:58,006
Where the fuck
are you going? Huh?

265
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,969
You're watching me, huh?

266
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:07,682
I bet you're watching me right now.
You're probably wondering who the fuck I am, right?

267
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,727
Hey, you know what?

268
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,855
You know what the two shortest
verses in the Bible are?

269
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:17,317
It's only two-two
words. Just two words.

270
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,194
Isn't that amazing?

271
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,488
It's only
got two words.

272
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,531
Were you
friends with him?

273
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,584
No.

274
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,004
So, how'd
you know him?

275
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,466
I read the obituaries.

276
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,262
How'd he die anyway?

277
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,765
Car crash.

278
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:52,769
Yeah, they say better to be late,
you know, in this life than

279
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,729
early in the next.

280
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:58,858
Do you make a habit out of
going to memorial services?

281
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,320
Well, you know, I'll be honest to you.
I try to go as many as possible.

282
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,782
You know, during the week 'cause
it's kinda great therapy, right?

283
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,992
I mean, you should
really try it.

284
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,871
You should. If you're ever feeling
depressed, just go to a funeral.

285
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,583
And no matter how sad or how
low or had bad things are,

286
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,461
it's never as final
as this, right?

287
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,799
You wanna die?

288
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,137
I wanna go without a clear
conscience, you know.

289
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,599
I wouldn't-wouldn't wanna go without that.
Not 'til I'm ready.

290
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:35,395
I don't wanna-don't wanna go
without making amends.

291
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,401
Red roses, well.

292
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,238
Dylan, I guess
you were special.

293
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,202
I'll leave you
two alone.

294
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,356
I have me good
looks and a wee bit of money

295
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,111
♪ Now all I need is a
pretty little honey ♪

296
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:28,698
♪ I'm off to Dublin
At the end of the year ♪

297
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,742
♪ For a bit
Of a laugh ♪

298
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,745
♪ For the women
And the beer ♪

299
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,631
Ah, all the black
stuff I can drink.

300
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,842
Well, I thought you
didn't drink, lad.

301
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,553
Today's a good day
as any to start.

302
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,641
All right. So, this
weird girl shows up.

303
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:58,019
She shows up, she starts
talking about, uh,

304
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,688
the shortest verse
in the Bible.

305
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,358
That's the best
mass to attend.

306
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,193
In and out,
short and sweet.

307
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:08,321
And suddenly
I-I hear this voice.

308
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:09,989
The weird
girl's voice?

309
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,200
No. Natalie's voice.

310
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:16,204
Natalie?
The old flame?

311
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,956
Natalie's there alone and
she leans over the coffin.

312
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,419
I can't be sure, but I think
she said ”I love you.”

313
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:26,339
I miss you.

314
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,513
She did?

315
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,765
Well, I--she whispered
it, you know.

316
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:39,227
But it was "I-I something you."

317
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,315
So, you didn't
hear the "love" part.

318
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,484
Not really.

319
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,905
So, she could've
said "I hate you."

320
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,283
Possibly, but why would she drive
all the way down to a funeral home

321
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,578
to say "I hate you"?

322
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,456
Did she bring flowers?

323
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,959
Dozen red roses.

324
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,295
Not yellow
or pink. Red.

325
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:11,592
Your old flame came
to your wake, Dylan.

326
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,970
She brought roses!

327
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,389
That says a lot
about your character.

328
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,433
Yeah, maybe.

329
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:22,645
Right, I show up at her door?
Knocking? She'd be furious.

330
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,731
She thinks I'm dead.

331
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:28,317
Your own brother wouldn't
talk to you in six years.

332
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,736
He's your brother.

333
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,157
You should see her.

334
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,786
Seems to me she was sent to
you by the big guy himself.

335
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,250
Hey, one last thing.

336
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,170
I got you a wee little present,
so we can all remember you.

337
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,338
On your way home tonight,
stop by the cemetery

338
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:53,801
and check out that
empty plot 35-E.

339
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:03,936
I got you
your own grave.

340
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,939
Now you Te
really dead, lad.

341
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,300
Don't go in there.

342
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,053
Excuse me?

343
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,450
Hey, asshole.

344
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,411
You're in the wrong place.
There's nothing here to steal.

345
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,872
Just put down
the gun.

346
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:37,835
It's Dylan.

347
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:41,922
Dylan?

348
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,301
Dylan O'Rourke.

349
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,392
Dylan?

350
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,144
Yeah.

351
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,979
Yeah, it's me.

352
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,107
Dylan?

353
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:10,159
Are you sure you're here
for the right person?

354
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:14,789
I knew you were coming. I just didn't,
I just didn't know it'd be so soon.

355
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:18,501
I-I'm sorry. I can-I can
explain everything.

356
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,836
Just tell me where
you're gonna take me.

357
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,505
What are you
talking about?

358
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:26,008
Just tell me where
you're gonna take me.

359
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,637
No, I-I don't understand.
I'm not taking you anywhere.

360
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,514
I need to know
where I'm going.

361
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,641
I think you're
a little confused.

362
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,976
I'm not confused.
I know what you are.

363
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,692
I know what you are.

364
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,828
Fuck!

365
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:57,206
Where's the money, Charlie?

366
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,168
Where's the
fucking money?

367
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,216
Who the fuck
are you? Huh?

368
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,053
Who the fuck is
this, Charlie? Huh?

369
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:14,056
Answer me, you fucking
junkie bitch!

370
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,100
What? He's just
a friend of yours?

371
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,936
He's not
my friend.

372
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,690
He's my guardian angel.

373
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,400
Guardian fucking
angel, huh?

374
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:27,403
Well, we got
a little problem here.

375
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,405
I'm an atheist.

376
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:32,533
I don't believe in
little faggoty angels.

377
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,535
Go ahead, shoot him.

378
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,874
He's already dead.
Shoot him.

379
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,921
Just shoot him!

380
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,561
What the fuck?

381
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,696
Idiot.

382
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,865
I told you
you were dead.

383
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,926
Who was that guy
at your place?

384
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,595
Terrence?

385
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,598
He works for some guy
I owe 20 grand to.

386
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,434
L-I-I- should be,
I should be dead.

387
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,479
Should be?
You are dead.

388
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,696
So us poor
trapped souls.

389
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,991
I've always kinda
been obsessed with dying,

390
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:59,203
and it's my death.

391
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,580
I'm not ready
to go, yet.

392
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,332
Why aren't
you ready?

393
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,501
Family?

394
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:08,087
No, no family left.

395
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,548
Friends or something?

396
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,801
No, never even
been in a carpool lane.

397
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:16,053
I got nothing.

398
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:19,723
As soon as I'm clean, I'm
gonna go with you. I promise.

399
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:21,809
I'm not actually dead.

400
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,645
You are dead.
You just don't know it.

401
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,232
Excuse me.
Can you see me?

402
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,526
Yeah.

403
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:34,196
Okay. You satisfied?

404
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,866
Wait, wait, wait.
Could you, could you touch me?

405
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,285
Excuse me?

406
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:42,246
Just-just touch
my face.

407
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:56,218
Case. I mean, does that, does that
prove to you that I'm not dead?

408
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,803
You're in denial.

409
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,472
I mean, she-she
saw me, she touched me.

410
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,558
How could she do
that if I was dead?

411
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,893
How could I interact
with people?

412
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,230
Because you believe
it so intensely

413
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:12,234
that you've become real to
yourself and to others.

414
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,528
Believing is seeing.

415
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:18,407
So, anybody
could be dead.

416
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:22,786
Like-like-like
this, that guy?

417
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,913
Could be.

418
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:29,418
Walking dead are all around us.
I feel bad for you.

419
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:34,256
You're just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.

420
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,760
So, how do I get
out of Purgatory?

421
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,929
Well, first of all, you need
to accept that you're dead.

422
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:45,142
Then I think you have one more
chance to make things right.

423
00:44:57,363 --> 00:44:59,573
What's it like?

424
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:02,951
What's what like?

425
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:05,412
What made you die.

426
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:07,456
Are you crazy?

427
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,416
Don't call me that.

428
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,544
I am not crazy.
You just leave me the fuck alone

429
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,506
until you're ready to deal with
who the fuck you are, okay?

430
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,591
Then you can
come find me.

431
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,927
You are dead.
You just don't know it.

432
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:17,943
Hey, fuck Charlie.

433
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,654
Fuck us instead.

434
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:24,616
Oh. What's wrong, Dylan?

435
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,368
What'd you say?

436
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:27,828
How do you
know my name?

437
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:30,581
I didn't say anything.

438
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,375
Come on, sweetie.

439
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,795
Let me call you whatever
you want us to call you.

440
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,916
Charlie?

441
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,855
Charlie?

442
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:43,237
Charlie, let me in.

443
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:47,115
Charlie? Open the door.

444
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,252
Oh! Fuck!

445
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,045
Oh, no.

446
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,507
Charlie. Hey.
Wake up.

447
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,926
Somebody help!

448
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,303
Come on.
Fuck, come on!

449
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:10,472
Charlie!

450
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:38,083
What are you
doing, Charlie?

451
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,088
And where are
you right now?

452
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:46,091
You said you didn't wanna
leave like this, right?

453
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:51,930
You're not dead, and
I'm not, either. Okay?

454
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:56,935
I'm gonna be around
for a little while.

455
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:46,526
Visiting hours are now over.

456
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,196
Sir, visiting hours are over.
It's time to leave.

457
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,619
Dylan?

458
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,496
Natalie.

459
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,291
Oh, God.
I'm-I'm so sorry.

460
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:04,294
I can explain everything.

461
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:08,590
That funeral,
we faked it.

462
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,467
I'm not dead.

463
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,096
I mean, obviously,
I'm not dead.

464
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,181
I'm really sorry.

465
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:19,685
I know. I know you
faked your funeral.

466
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:22,604
And you're not dead.

467
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,650
Decko?

468
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:31,863
Did he invite you
to the funeral?

469
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,741
He didn't want
you to be alone.

470
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,538
How do you
know Charlie?

471
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:43,083
Are you on her
emergency contact list?

472
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,379
I'm kinda all
she has right now.

473
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:01,476
Yeah, but after that,

474
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,855
Remember when we broke into the rec
center and we went skinny dipping?

475
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,149
Yes.

476
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:10,193
That was fun. We were starving,
and we went to that place.

477
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:12,362
Burger place with
those huge burgers.

478
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:14,281
Yeah.

479
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:17,993
Bacon and fried egg and
there was, like, ham on it.

480
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:21,329
I don't like
the special sauce.

481
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,674
Can you hear mine?

482
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,009
Yeah.

483
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,136
Can you hear it?

484
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,022
Didn't we go?
Didn't we run out of gas?

485
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,274
Oh, yeah. It was that night.
We ran out of gas.

486
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,859
We called, we had
to, we called--

487
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,695
AAA

488
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,447
That was fun.

489
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:00,494
Oh, hold on.

490
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,538
Hi, honey.

491
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:07,125
Oh, no, no, I'm just busy at work.
I'll be home soon.

492
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,296
Okay. All right. Bye.

493
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,342
Dylan.

494
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,639
I would've gone
to your funeral regardless.

495
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,054
[monitor alarm sets 0177

496
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,442
Are you okay?

497
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,698
I'm okay.

498
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,019
Hi. What are
you doing here?

499
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:52,022
I knew I'd
find you here.

500
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:54,649
It's where you always come
when you wanna be alone.

501
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:57,527
Yeah. Mm-hm.

502
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,246
Oh, my God.

503
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,081
What do you say?

504
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:18,548
Yes.

505
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:09,599
I haven't been here
since we graduated.

506
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,257
Do you blame me
for that night?

507
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,718
Every time I saw you,
I thought of what happened.

508
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:48,054
I've missed you.
I missed you every day for ten years.

509
00:55:48,138 --> 00:55:50,265
You're in love
with someone else!

510
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:53,810
No. I love Steve.
But I'm in love with you.

511
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,195
Dylan?

512
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:45,528
I brought Dylan a couple of my
famous roast beef sandwiches.

513
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:46,821
Can I leave
them with you?

514
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,281
Sure.

515
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,700
Good. We can
have a smoke then.

516
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:53,203
How long have
you been married, Liz?

517
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,664
Um, almost 25 years.

518
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,583
He's a little
much at times,

519
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,795
but no matter how dirty
his laundry, he's mine.

520
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:04,923
Oh. I do

521
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:09,886
carry this
little DUI photo

522
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:13,431
to remind him what an asshole
he can be when he's drunk.

523
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,561
I would've married
Decko since I met him,

524
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,396
but he made me wait.

525
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,565
Why?

526
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:27,612
I was with the man I thought I'd
spend the rest of my life with.

527
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,534
And I fell in love
with his best friend.

528
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,661
Over time I
questioned myself,

529
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:40,041
and now and then I still wonder
if I chose the right partner.

530
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,210
So, you went
back to Decko?

531
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:46,464
No. I stayed with Decko.

532
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:49,551
He was the best friend.

533
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,386
Decko?

534
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:52,929
Mm-hm.

535
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,640
What happened to--

536
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,851
Patrick Keating?

537
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,186
Mm, oh.

538
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:04,023
My beautiful ghost.

539
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,486
I imagine
he thinks of me,

540
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,365
that there's a candle burning
out there somewhere.

541
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:15,201
Do you love Decko?

542
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:17,912
Absolutely.

543
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:21,583
But I do believe it's
possible to love two people.

544
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:26,254
When you're on
your deathbed,

545
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:29,591
don't look back on
your life with regret.

546
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,304
It is a hard
life to live.

547
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,639
Wondering.

548
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,127
Natalie.

549
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,130
Hey.

550
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:11,132
Can I talk to you?

551
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:15,303
Yeah.

552
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:23,645
Uh, listen.

553
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,192
God, I-I don't even
know where to begin.

554
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:33,321
Really. Um, I just--

555
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,281
[monitor alarm sets 0177

556
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:37,533
That's Charlie.

557
00:59:37,617 --> 00:59:38,868
What's wrong with her?

558
00:59:42,372 --> 00:59:44,582
You're okay, Charlie.
Just relax.

559
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,671
Hey, you Te okay.

560
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,966
I'm sorry, sir, but
you need to step out.

561
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:54,884
Dylan, I 'Il come
and get you-

562
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:04,477
Has he made his
peace with you, yet?

563
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,354
Who?

564
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,898
Dylan.

565
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:13,653
Never stops
thinking about you.

566
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,421
What are you
doing here?

567
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,468
I don't know what
she has right now.

568
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,681
Where's the money, Charlie?

569
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:58,698
I thought you
were dead.

570
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:01,409
You shouldn't screw
with people like that.

571
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,162
Prank?

572
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:07,248
It was more of a
reality check.

573
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:10,418
Got that address
you wanted.

574
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,340
Listen, you
shouldn't go there.

575
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:17,884
Why?

576
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:22,096
It's not the guy who took a shot at you you
have to be worried about. It's his boss.

577
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,600
Who's his boss?

578
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:29,854
Just tell me who she owes money to.
I'm sure I can make a deal.

579
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,815
These aren't the type of people
you just make deals with.

580
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:47,038
Get some sleep.

581
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,374
Seeing shit
that isn't there.

582
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:59,717
How much money
are we talking about?

583
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:01,260
Twenty grand.

584
01:02:01,344 --> 01:02:03,179
You really care
about this girl?

585
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,473
You know, I've been the
only one to visit her.

586
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:08,226
Just like she was the
only one to visit me.

587
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:11,145
That's a hell of a lot of money.
How are you gonna get that?

588
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:13,398
Don't worry
about the money.

589
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:18,569
Look, I don't understand.
You hardly know this girl.

590
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:23,241
Think of yourself.
Go to college, start your life.

591
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:26,244
Be fucking selfish
for once, can you?

592
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:29,997
Why--

593
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:32,750
Why are you
doing this?

594
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:36,421
I have to save somebody.

595
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:06,093
I'm here to see
Mr. Brennan.

596
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:14,227
Tell him I'd like to
make a deal for Charlie.

597
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:40,753
So, how do you
know Charlie?

598
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:43,923
Is she a friend
of yours?

599
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:47,134
You could say that.

600
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:50,471
Now, that's not what
Terrence told me.

601
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:55,184
He says you're her,
uh, guardian angel.

602
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,915
Well, now, Terrence,

603
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:21,836
atheist. Comes back
here ranting and raving

604
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,673
about some halo,
wing-wearing wacko

605
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,009
that he puts
two slugs into.

606
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:30,761
I saw the holes
in the wall.

607
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:33,055
He missed twice.

608
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:35,558
I told you Terrence

609
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,643
was a useless
piece of shit.

610
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:40,313
He can't even
shoot straight.

611
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:49,280
So you, you wanna make a
deal for Charlie, hm?

612
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,735
It's 20 for
her debt.

613
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,112
Goddamn.

614
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:33,908
I feel like putting
a bullet in my own gun

615
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,119
just to see if you really
are a fucking angel.

616
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,750
Charlie's debt's repaid.

617
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,252
You have my word.

618
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:49,590
And everybody knows
what that means.

619
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:01,227
Where'd you
get that one?

620
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:29,797
Hi. Have you done it?
Have you made your peace?

621
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,966
I really need you
to hurry, okay?

622
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:35,261
'Cause I'm really ready to go.
I'm ready to go now.

623
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:38,931
Ready to leave
this life. I'm clean.

624
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:45,062
I just have
to ask you something.

625
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:50,860
This, this ring, it--

626
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:55,072
I-I found it in

627
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:58,617
the pawn shop.

628
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:04,749
Brennan said that
you pawned it.

629
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:11,172
Ten years ago.

630
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:12,840
Did you pawn this?

631
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:23,058
Answer me. Where did-- Where
did you get this, Charlie?

632
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:27,897
Where did
you get this?

633
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:36,697
There was an accident.

634
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:41,619
Charlie, the people who were
killed were my parents!

635
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,376
This was my mother's.

636
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:55,382
Who was driving
that taxi?

637
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:15,736
I needed money.

638
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,823
I stole the taxi.

639
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:23,077
And I picked up
the fare.

640
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,292
I lost control.

641
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:35,339
It was an accident.

642
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:49,603
You what?
You stole this?

643
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,231
Dylan, I'm so sorry.

644
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,775
Don't you
fucking touch me.

645
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,330
What do you
need, kid?

646
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:51,916
I'm looking for
Detective Milano.

647
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:55,169
Milano? He's not
here anymore.

648
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:58,005
Do you know when
he'll be back?

649
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:00,841
He died
five years ago.

650
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:03,844
I just saw him
the other night.

651
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:06,555
Don't think so.

652
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,185
That--

653
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,020
That-that can't be.

654
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:15,689
Are you okay?

655
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:19,318
You seeing shit
that isn't there.

656
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,079
Dylan.

657
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,375
Are you okay, lad?

658
01:11:43,509 --> 01:11:45,844
What's the biggest
funeral you ever have?

659
01:11:48,597 --> 01:11:53,060
Hm. About
ten years ago.

660
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,104
We had a standing
mourning service.

661
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:57,648
Spilled out
into the street.

662
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,441
I had to borrow chairs.

663
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:05,698
That was my
parents' funeral.

664
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:08,492
I don't remember
you there.

665
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:11,161
That's because
I wasn't there.

666
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:14,415
I couldn't be.

667
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:18,168
They were there
because of me.

668
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:25,884
I mean, Christ, I haven't even
visited their grave.

669
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:29,680
I was supposed
to pick them up

670
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,598
from the airport.

671
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:35,436
When I didn't show,
eventually they took a cab.

672
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:39,565
That taxi crashed.

673
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:50,534
I was with Natalie
when I found out.

674
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:14,058
I blamed her.

675
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:25,360
I blame myself.

676
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:29,990
That's the night I left her.

677
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:39,917
You know, we made plans
to go to college together, and

678
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:45,005
we put it on hold.

679
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:57,893
My fucking life.

680
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:02,022
My whole--

681
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:07,528
That guilt has been eating you
alive inside for too long.

682
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:09,988
You're gonna let
it destroy you.

683
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:12,366
As it should.

684
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:13,951
No. Listen to me, son.

685
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,662
Don't call me "son".

686
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:21,375
You leave me the fuck alone.
Get that through your head. I don't want your help.

687
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,377
Leave me the
fuck alone!

688
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,713
You listen to me, boy.
You have got to forgive yourself.

689
01:14:26,797 --> 01:14:28,423
I can't!

690
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:30,717
You can!
Stop living in the fucking past!

691
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:34,054
Don't you understand?
The past is all I have.

692
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,557
I have nothing else.
You get that?

693
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,727
No! You have
a life now!

694
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,480
You have me.

695
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:46,191
Now.

696
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:49,820
And Dylan, you
have Natalie.

697
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,462
Oh, God.

698
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:11,675
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

699
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:16,180
Forget about the past.

700
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:18,599
She's come back to you.

701
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:22,060
Don't let her
get away again.

702
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:33,197
That gin.

703
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,991
Every time I see
that girl's face,

704
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,327
I think about
that night.

705
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:44,708
I think about what I did
and what I didn't do.

706
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,378
Forget about what
you didn't do.

707
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:54,927
It's what you're going
to do now that counts.

708
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,735
Hi.

709
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:38,030
Hey, babe. You,
uh, got some mail.

710
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:15,442
Steve! Why did you wait so many
years to ask me to marry you?

711
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:23,325
I-I woke up and
I realized what I had.

712
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:38,632
Was Charlie Scheel released?

713
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:41,635
No, but she just
suddenly took off.

714
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:45,472
I'm ready to leave this life.
I'm clean.

715
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,272
Hey, Natalie. This
is Linda from Mercy.

716
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:58,110
I have a message from your patient, Charlie Scheel.
She said it's urgent.

717
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,196
What are you
doing, Charlie?

718
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,532
Jesus wept.

719
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:51,121
That's the shortest
verse in the Bible.

720
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:58,503
Charlie, come on.
You're making me nervous.

721
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:07,888
Jesus went to visit
his sick friend Lazarus.

722
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:10,724
But he was too late, and
Lazarus was already dead.

723
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:17,189
But instead of just
grieving for him,

724
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:20,484
he resurrected him.

725
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:25,322
That's what
you've done for me.

726
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:31,870
How did you do it? Did you
make your peace, yet?

727
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:34,539
No.

728
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,544
I'm getting so bored
of this, Dylan.

729
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:42,172
Waiting for you.

730
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:46,009
You know what, Charlie?
You Te gonna have to keep waiting.

731
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:53,558
You and I?

732
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:57,521
Have been walking
dead for years now.

733
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:01,149
Me and you.

734
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:07,030
This could be
our Resurrection Day.

735
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:13,119
Charlie!

736
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:19,376
Charlie, if you jump,
I am not coming with you.

737
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:22,754
I'm still in love with Natalie,
and I'm gonna be with her.

738
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:28,885
You hear that, Natalie?

739
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:03,146
I'm sorry I haven't
visited sooner.

740
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:10,111
But it's better to be
late in this life

741
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,782
than early
in the next.

742
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:50,110
Rest in peace.

743
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,122
I've always
loved the bastard.

744
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,582
He's got a lot
of really good pubs.

745
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:09,337
He means colleges.
Now, make sure you keep focused, Dylan.

746
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:14,175
Fresh starts.
No regrets, love.

747
01:24:14,259 --> 01:24:15,552
I know.

748
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,769
The French believe every time you
say goodbye, you die a little.

749
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,065
But what do the fucking
French know?

750
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:32,277
You've been a
really good friend.

751
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,821
Thank you.

752
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:39,826
Drive safely.

753
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:41,745
Thank you.

754
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:44,539
Take care. Take care.

755
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:46,458
We'll be back.

756
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:14,861
You ready?

757
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:18,448
Yeah.

758
01:25:18,573 --> 01:25:23,119
So, if I turn the ring around and the
heart points in, that means I'm taken.

759
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:26,206
Correct.

760
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,959
Okay.

761
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:35,548
That looks better.

762
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:37,133
Thank you.

763
01:26:20,844 --> 01:26:23,263
What was it like?

764
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:24,389
What's what like?

765
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:26,599
What made you die.

766
01:26:53,877 --> 01:26:56,838
Walking dead are
all around us.

767
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:10,602
She saw me. She touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?

768
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:14,522
How could I
interact with people?

769
01:27:14,606 --> 01:27:16,858
You believe it
so intensely

770
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:20,570
that you've become real
to yourself and to others.

771
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:25,241
Believing is seeing.

772
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:37,420
You Te just trapped
in Purgatory.

773
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:40,632
Really could go
either way for you.

774
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:44,510
So, how do I get
out of Purgatory?

775
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:48,348
First of all, you need to
accept that you Te dead.

776
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:52,602
Then I think you have one more
chance to make things right.

777
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:58,733
You wanna die?

778
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:04,113
I don't wanna-wanna go
without making amends.

779
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,544
So, what do you guys have
planned after graduation?

780
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:20,964
We're going
to college together.

781
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,799
Oh, so, keeping
it alive, huh?

782
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,468
