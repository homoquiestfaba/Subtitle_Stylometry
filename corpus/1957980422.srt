1
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:06,166
Bast...

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,002
time is running out.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,464
Please allow me to heal my brother
of this illness...

4
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:15,800
and I will never
question your existence again.

5
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,386
His heart rate is dropping fast.
Where are we?

6
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:19,763
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,514
GRIOT, give me the controls.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,891
As you wish, Princess.

9
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,190
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:31,900
25%.

11
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,486
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:38,073
King T'Challa's heart rate
has fallen to 31 beats per minute.

13
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,700
Princess, you should go be by his side.

14
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,411
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

15
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,830
Get out!

16
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,046
What is the confidence rate?

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,589
29.1%.

18
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:55,799
Print it!

19
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:04,432
Princess, I am aware of the urgency,
but I must warn you...

20
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:06,393
this synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

21
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,770
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

22
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,065
I don't care! Has to work.

23
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:32,419
GRIOT.

24
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,586
Yes, Princess?

25
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,880
What's my brother's heart rate?

26
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:45,807
Your brother is with the ancestors.

27
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,274
No.

28
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:05,327
We give thanks for
the gift of King T'Challa.

29
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,124
The Black Panther.

30
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:15,420
Son of King T'Chaka.

31
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:16,963
My son.

32
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:22,552
Descendant of the most
revered King Bashenga,

33
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,472
the first Black Panther.

34
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,724
We release you.

35
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:30,018
Praise the ancestors.

36
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:55,085
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

37
00:02:56,086 --> 00:03:00,131
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

38
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,011
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

39
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,724
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

40
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:15,146
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

41
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:20,360
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

42
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:22,821
T'Challa

43
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,285
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,474
It is an honor for me...

45
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:40,226
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda...

46
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:43,813
daughter of Lumumba,
sovereign ruler of the kingdom of Wakanda.

47
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,121
Mr. Chairperson...

48
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:04,709
I believe I speak for
all the member states here...

49
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,713
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's...

50
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:13,677
failure to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts...

51
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:18,014
to tackle international challenges,
to share resources...

52
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,683
and full cooperation...

53
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,060
concerning vibranium.

54
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:29,234
France has information that vibranium can
be used to make weapons of mass destruction.

55
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:33,113
It does not trigger any
known metal detector.

56
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,703
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

57
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:43,164
I now give the floor to
Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

58
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,091
It has always been our policy...

59
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:58,179
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

60
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,226
Not because of the dangerous potential
of vibranium...

61
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:07,897
but because of
the dangerous potential of you.

62
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,578
I just lost security visuals.

63
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:28,835
Down on your stomachs right now!

64
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,420
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

65
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,839
Where are the vibranium tools?

66
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:37,636
Who has access?

67
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:53,068
You perform civility here.

68
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:55,904
But we know what you whisper...

69
00:08:56,112 --> 00:09:00,367
in your halls of leadership
and in your military facilities.

70
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,083
"The King is dead.

71
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,879
"The Black Panther is gone.

72
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:18,051
"They have lost their protector.

73
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,185
"Now is our time...

74
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:29,771
"to strike."

75
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:58,925
Aneka, where is your spear?

76
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:00,510
Shuri gave me these to try.

77
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,950
You know, I like them better.

78
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,618
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

79
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,496
because it is precise, elegant...

80
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:42,374
and deadly.

81
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:47,504
It will not change under my watch.

82
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:50,924
Yes, General.

83
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:53,385
I told you not to bring them.

84
00:10:56,305 --> 00:11:01,018
Last night there was another attack
on one of our outreach facilities.

85
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,522
Proof of the involvement
of a member state...

86
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:09,776
is being uploaded to your mobile devices
as we speak.

87
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,947
And as for the identity of the attackers...

88
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,128
Kneel!

89
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:32,883
You're welcome.

90
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:39,640
Let our gracious response to this incursion
be an olive branch.

91
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,561
Further attempts on our resources...

92
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:47,814
will be considered an act of aggression...

93
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:51,735
and met with a much steeper response.

94
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,906
We mourn the loss of our king.

95
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:01,495
But do not think for a second
that Wakanda has lost her ability...

96
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:04,206
to protect our resources.

97
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:08,335
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some...

98
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:11,838
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda...

99
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:16,134
and wish you the best of luck.

100
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,351
This is Rotor 625
requesting clearance to land.

101
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:29,564
All right. Meet you down there.

102
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,732
Yeah.

103
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,319
Hey!

104
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,321
I thought you retired!

105
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,531
I thought I had too.

106
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,034
They said that machine had a one
in a billion chance of finding vibranium.

107
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,369
Oh, less than that.

108
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:05,434
Here we go.

109
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:09,438
Cabin pressure is stable
at negative one P-S-I.

110
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,194
At 800 feet...

111
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,322
passing through thermocline.

112
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,115
All my life supports in the green.

113
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,327
Copy you.

114
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,087
We've touched down.

115
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:45,182
Perfect. So, Salazar,
you are near the site right there.

116
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,602
Yeah, it's astonishing.

117
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:53,398
The drill seemed to make contact
with a metallic substance.

118
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,360
Whatever it is, it's solid.

119
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,071
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

120
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:03,700
I'll be.

121
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,953
Vibranium in the ocean.

122
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,829
Let's go ahead
and get the detector out of there...

123
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,915
since it's the only one we've got.

124
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:13,210
Heading towards the vibranium detector.

125
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,348
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

126
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,058
Yeah. The rig lost power.

127
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,519
Copy that. I'm gonna fix it up here.

128
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,452
What the hell was that?

129
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,759
Jackson...

130
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,678
tell me you're seeing this?

131
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,763
Hang on. Salazar's heart rate.

132
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,141
Hey, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

133
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,103
It's a phantom jellyfish.

134
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,688
I've never seen one this color.

135
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,982
Emergency dive team, stand by.

136
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,901
Salazar, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

137
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,236
Can you see him?

138
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,038
No. He's gone.

139
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,165
Can you clarify?
What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

140
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,335
Salazar, do you copy?

141
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,879
Salazar?

142
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,718
Smitty, we got a situation out here.

143
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:57,648
What's that sound?

144
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,816
West, you got a visual on
what's making that sound?

145
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:07,824
West, how copy, over?

146
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,371
West, you got a visual?

147
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,933
It's some kind of sonic attack.

148
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,893
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

149
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,193
We are under attack.

150
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,195
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

151
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
Copy.
Mayday, mayday, this is Rotor 625.

152
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:49,783
We are requesting assistance immediately.

153
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:50,993
It's the Wakandans.

154
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:54,538
It has to be.

155
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:11,388
Henderson.

156
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:12,931
Smitty, we gotta go.

157
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,391
Henderson!

158
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:16,476
Let's go.

159
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,314
What's going on?

160
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:22,065
Get off the edge.

161
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:39,791
Go!

162
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,521
Go, go, go!

163
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:09,947
Now! Go!

164
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:11,698
Spin! Spin them off!

165
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,660
Okay. They're gone!

166
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:15,911
Oh, my God!

167
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:36,556
Just get us out.

168
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,933
We're good.

169
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:39,351
We're good.

170
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,769
Where is the strike team?

171
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,980
It wasn't the Wakandans. They were blue.

172
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:44,273
Everyone is dead...

173
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,026
Shit. What is going on?

174
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,236
We're getting pulled backwards.

175
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,738
Oh, my God.

176
00:18:58,161 --> 00:18:59,288
Oh, God! Hang on!

177
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,074
Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda...

178
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,452
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday...

179
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,413
while members of her military
escorted captive mercenaries...

180
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,290
onto the floor of the UN.

181
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,083
A year has passed since Queen Ramonda...

182
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,210
was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda...

183
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:50,797
after King T'Challa's sudden death
from an undisclosed illness last year.

184
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:52,966
All eyes are on the
tiny, powerful nation...

185
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,802
as it finds itself increasingly isolated...

186
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,679
My Queen.

187
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,098
Approaching the river border.

188
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:08,440
We are home.

189
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,324
Princess.

190
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,910
Just a moment.
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,412
I understand, Princess, however...

192
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:05,330
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,876
Shuri.

194
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,336
Mother.

195
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,381
I was trying to tell you.
The Queen is here.

196
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,550
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

197
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:20,512
I think that one day artificial
intelligence is going to kill us all.

198
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,350
My AI isn't like the movies, Mother.
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

199
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,853
Yeah, if only children were the same.

200
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,898
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

201
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,028
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

202
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:37,946
There could be any number of...

203
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,325
unknown threats on the horizon,
and they're creating solutions.

204
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,369
Oh, what is this?

205
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,204
Exo Suits for our army.

206
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:50,917
It grants the user super-human strength,
speed, and durability.

207
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,629
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

208
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:54,838
What were her notes?

209
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,340
She hates them.

210
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:04,097
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

211
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,224
Have you made any progress on that?

212
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,559
Excuse me, Princess.

213
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:10,771
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

214
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:11,980
Maybe you should...

215
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,815
Maybe you should
continue your calculations...

216
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,025
as I instructed.

217
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:16,860
As you wish, Princess.

218
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:22,741
We do not need the Herb, Mother.
We need new technology.

219
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,076
What of the Black Panther?

220
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,916
The mantle has unified our nation
for centuries.

221
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,251
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

222
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,796
I wasn't trying to save the mantle
with the Herb...

223
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:38,131
I was trying to save my brother.

224
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,259
Oh, Shuri.

225
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,608
Do you know what day it is?

226
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,568
Tuesday.

227
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,904
The date, child.

228
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:08,495
Brother's passing.

229
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,580
One year ago today.

230
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,383
Have you planned anything?

231
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:25,470
Yes. It involves you
taking your mother for a drive.

232
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,472
- Right now?
- Right now.

233
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,725
And you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.

234
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,809
- Mother.
- No, no.

235
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,061
You won't need them where we are going.

236
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,736
And the other two. Yes.

237
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,347
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

238
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:11,016
It is the only way
you are going to heal...

239
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:13,352
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

240
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:14,770
I'm fine, Mother.

241
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,273
You don't have to worry about me.

242
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:23,028
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

243
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:27,991
T'Challa is dead,
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

244
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,286
When that illness
took your brother from us...

245
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:36,041
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

246
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,877
But I still took time in the bush.

247
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:42,339
I wandered until I found water.

248
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:43,799
And I sat.

249
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,135
Then I did this ritual...

250
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:49,763
that I am about to show you now.

251
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,436
I found your brother in the breeze...

252
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:01,191
pushing me gently, but firm.

253
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,361
Like his hand on my shoulder.

254
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,156
It took some time...

255
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,576
but he was there.

256
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,209
He wasn't there, Mother.

257
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,379
The presence that you felt...

258
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:24,464
was just a construct of your mind.

259
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:30,387
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

260
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,514
That's all.

261
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:42,190
What construct
does your mind create...

262
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,318
when you think of your brother?

263
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,321
Does it offer you comfort?

264
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:50,115
Or torment?

265
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:04,796
Come, child.

266
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:17,601
How did you get this?

267
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:18,852
What does it matter?

268
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,480
What does this have to do with your ritual?

269
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:24,942
Burning of the funeral garments...

270
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:27,444
marks the end
of the mourning period...

271
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:30,405
and the beginning
of a new relationship...

272
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:32,866
with our loved ones that have passed on...

273
00:26:33,283 --> 00:26:34,952
I'm not doing this, Mother.

274
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,621
If I sit...

275
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:40,374
and think about my brother
for too long...

276
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,711
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

277
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,422
It will be the world...

278
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,384
and everyone in it.

279
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,761
Shuri...

280
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,143
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you...

281
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,979
about your brother.

282
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:07,484
Mother, wait!

283
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:09,486
What are you doing?

284
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,638
This better not be a part of your ritual.

285
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,098
It isn't.

286
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,393
Stop! Right there!

287
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:44,938
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

288
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,983
This place is amazing.

289
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,986
The air is pristine.

290
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:53,447
And the water...

291
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,034
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

292
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,579
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

293
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,081
That never have to change who they were.

294
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,669
What reason do you have
to reveal your secret to the world?

295
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:10,672
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

296
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,716
Who are you?

297
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,134
I have many names.

298
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:17,804
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

299
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,476
but my enemies call me Namor.

300
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,482
The American military detected vibranium
under my nation's domain.

301
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:33,028
I was able to
stop them from minin' it...

302
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,074
but we need Wakanda's help
to prevent it from happenin' again.

303
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,161
They use a machine
designed by an American scientist.

304
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,789
Vibranium only exists here.

305
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,332
In Wakanda.

306
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,833
Mother, he's covered in it.

307
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:54,466
Your son exposed the power of vibranium
to the world.

308
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:58,887
In response, other nations have begun
searching the planet for it.

309
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:02,391
His choice has compromised us.

310
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:06,979
I think Wakanda could find the scientist
and bring them to me?

311
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:11,692
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

312
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,155
You do not sneak into my country
and tell me what is fair.

313
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,743
I have more soldiers
than this land has blades of grass.

314
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:25,289
And they have incomparable strength.

315
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:28,834
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

316
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,301
When you have the scientist,
blow into this...

317
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,885
place it in the ocean.

318
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:41,263
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

319
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,101
For your own sake...

320
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,272
don't mention anything about me
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

321
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:00,949
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

322
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:18,508
How did he do that?

323
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,927
We must convene the Council.

324
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:26,391
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence
of any activity at all.

325
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:32,397
Oh, the river border has been breached?

326
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:34,858
If my soldiers were present...

327
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:37,444
this "fish man"...

328
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,321
would be bound before us
as we speak.

329
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,782
If your muscle brains were present...

330
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,077
they would still be there
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

331
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,411
You bald-headed demon...

332
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,372
Show some respect, you two.

333
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:49,539
Respect?

334
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,167
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

335
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,293
Watch your tone, Jabari!

336
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,392
As I was saying...

337
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,228
there was no aerial surveillance
footage of him.

338
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:12,688
And nothing on the radar as well.

339
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:16,358
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

340
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:20,320
He was not alone.
And claims to command a massive army.

341
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,783
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

342
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,951
So he can kill them?

343
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:27,077
Do it.

344
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:32,958
We never had to face an enemy
with access to vibranium before.

345
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,794
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

346
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:40,299
That is because this wise Council
allowed Killmonger to take the throne...

347
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,301
and burn up all of
your precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

348
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,012
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

349
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,514
We should find the fish man and kill him.

350
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,311
If we do what he is asking for now...

351
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:56,773
what is to stop him from coming back
and asking for more?

352
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,200
As you were.

353
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:13,165
Is it just me,
or does this keep getting uglier?

354
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:14,416
It's you.

355
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,210
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

356
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:21,048
This thing can detect
the altered frequency of vibranium...

357
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:26,178
through water, stones, even heavy metals.
Whoever built this is brilliant.

358
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:27,929
Come, look.

359
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:31,141
Some are custom parts
and others look like...

360
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:33,101
they gathered it from a junkyard.

361
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:35,854
I am still struggling to believe...

362
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:38,565
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

363
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,026
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

364
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,987
Our planet is covered of mostly water,
so it's reasonable...

365
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:46,198
that the other one just landed there.

366
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,450
This changes everything that we know.

367
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:52,037
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

368
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:54,665
Those stories are seared in my mind.

369
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,625
That sounds very painful.

370
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,879
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

371
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,632
I do have an idea.

372
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,343
I'm going to need the princess.

373
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,470
Out of the question.

374
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,722
She is in no state to be in the field.

375
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:12,182
My Queen,

376
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,727
it may do her some good to get out.

377
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:18,855
It might just be exactly what she needs.

378
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:23,443
Besides, I can do this American operation
with my eyes closed.

379
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:26,863
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

380
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,448
This Namor...

381
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:30,742
he snuck past our defenses.

382
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,828
That will never happen again.

383
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:34,538
He was not alone.

384
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:36,581
She'll be with me.

385
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,709
So...

386
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,794
when are we leavin'...

387
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,005
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

388
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,243
Come on.

389
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:16,663
Yeah, I got it.

390
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:18,957
I got it.

391
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:22,461
Will you slow down?

392
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,802
You didn't think to call?

393
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,888
Now, why would I have your number?

394
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:38,101
We are looking for the scientist
who built the vibranium detector.

395
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:39,770
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

396
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,397
Come on. Mining ship.

397
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:43,899
Lot of casualties.

398
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:45,525
What happened?

399
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:46,777
Seriously?

400
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:51,657
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

401
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,743
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers...

402
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:55,953
friends of mine.

403
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:57,454
Gone.

404
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:58,664
Just like that.

405
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,083
You throw in the fact that
they were tracking vibranium...

406
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,961
I can assure you
Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

407
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:05,963
So who was it?

408
00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:09,341
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work...

409
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,551
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

410
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,429
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

411
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,640
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist...

412
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:18,308
before anything else happens.

413
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,811
You owe me, Ross.

414
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:22,562
You owe my brother.

415
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:27,317
Okay, look.

416
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:30,362
There are agents
who have been sentenced to death...

417
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,656
for less than I'm about to give you now.

418
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,116
And we got a new director.

419
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:36,159
She's watching me like a hawk.

420
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,870
We will be very, very careful.

421
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,998
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

422
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:42,749
The US needs another machine...

423
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,418
and this kid is the only person
in the world...

424
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,544
who knows how to build one.

425
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:46,753
So they're comin' for her.

426
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:47,879
A kid?

427
00:35:58,181 --> 00:35:59,182
Hey.

428
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:00,392
You forgot to Venmo me.

429
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:03,520
It slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

430
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:06,565
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.
It's a band today.

431
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,233
That's predatory.

432
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,278
I built the whole robotic hand.

433
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:13,947
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

434
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,449
And what grade did you get?

435
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:22,956
Thanks.

436
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,002
Is that an iPhone I see?

437
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,211
Primitive.

438
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,714
My Queen.

439
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,425
We have located the scientist.

440
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:37,179
She is in the American equivalent
of a Wakandan village school.

441
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,555
A school?

442
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:41,391
Please tell me it is a professor.

443
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:43,352
It's a student, Mother.

444
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,062
We can't give her to Namor.

445
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,440
Bring this student back to Wakanda.

446
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,568
Yes, my Queen.

447
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:55,072
I've got it from here.

448
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,574
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

449
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:58,992
It will be more discreet.

450
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,411
I can be discreet.

451
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,124
What?

452
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:07,668
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

453
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:08,877
No.

454
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,129
- It's the wrong shade, isn't it?
- It's the right shade.

455
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:12,881
Fenty 440. You look good.

456
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,551
I can blend in as a student.

457
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,637
I can do this.

458
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:23,892
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

459
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,281
Yo!

460
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:38,490
Riri Williams?

461
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:44,454
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.
You gotta go to the website.

462
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,916
It's an encrypted file.

463
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,293
I wanted to airdrop it.

464
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:51,670
You the...

465
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:55,882
You're Princess Shuri.

466
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:59,094
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:00,804
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

468
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,557
No.

469
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:07,603
I'm here about the vibranium detector
that you built for the CIA.

470
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:12,899
I ain't built no detector for no CIA.
I made that for my metallurgy class.

471
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,027
- A school project?
- Yeah.

472
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,237
My professor said I'd
never be able to do it.

473
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,991
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

474
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,288
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

475
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,541
How old are you?

476
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:31,835
Nineteen.

477
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:36,131
Brilliance at a young age
is not always accepted by the elders.

478
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:39,092
How long did it take you?

479
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:40,385
Couple months.

480
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:42,137
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was...

481
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:44,181
finding big enough mylar sheets
to cover the...

482
00:38:45,974 --> 00:38:47,392
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

483
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,560
Not just us.

484
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,646
This place is no longer safe for you.

485
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:53,982
Gather your things and come with me.
Right now.

486
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,778
I got Differential Equations class in,
like, 15 minutes.

487
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,406
Okay.

488
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:03,700
Okay.

489
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:06,078
You wait right here.

490
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,539
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

491
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:14,628
I had it under control.

492
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:18,090
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

493
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,883
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

494
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,677
Get out!

495
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:22,844
Hey.

496
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:26,890
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step toward me!

497
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:29,059
See how they teach the children
to treat their guests?

498
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,024
You brought a spear in here?

499
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:38,443
You brought a spear in here.

500
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:40,362
I like her.

501
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:43,156
Hey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it...

502
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:44,700
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

503
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:46,910
It's all right, Princess.

504
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:48,453
Small, small girl.

505
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:52,416
I am going to give you two options.

506
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,793
You can come to Wakanda...

507
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,212
conscious or unconscious.

508
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,757
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

509
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,968
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

510
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,847
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

511
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:09,474
- I told you!
- You look good.

512
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,018
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

513
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:15,856
And she can deal with that merman
with the winged ankles...

514
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:18,942
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

515
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:21,194
- You got this.
- With your heater.

516
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,529
Come on. Let's go.

517
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:24,281
What?

518
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:33,332
What exactly is this place?

519
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,001
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

520
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:40,631
He lets me work out of this garage
in exchange.

521
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,716
I just have to grab my work laptop.

522
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:48,180
Please don't touch anything.

523
00:40:48,263 --> 00:40:50,432
You don't have to worry about that.

524
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:54,311
It may not look like much,
but it's my life's work in here.

525
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:58,690
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

526
00:40:58,857 --> 00:40:59,858
Yeah.

527
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,903
And you just leave it on a desk
in a car garage?

528
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,031
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

529
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,326
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

530
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,453
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

531
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,664
Had to build a functional
quantum computer...

532
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,749
just to crack my own encryption.

533
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,293
What is it you're building here?
Is it Stark Tech?

534
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,337
I said don't touch anything.

535
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:23,048
Princess, American law enforcement
has arrived at your location.

536
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:24,633
- Shit.
- Who was that?

537
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:26,009
My AI.

538
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:29,096
They are surrounding us.

539
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,811
I thought you said a merman was after me.

540
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:36,979
That's the feds.

541
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,869
I do not need this shit right now!

542
00:41:52,953 --> 00:41:55,122
I swear to God, I was doing so well!

543
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:57,958
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

544
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,752
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda...

545
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:04,089
is gonna show up at my doorstep
and then shit about to pop off.

546
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,926
I think that I'm actually gonna
take my chances with this merman...

547
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:11,680
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

548
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:15,225
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

549
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:18,979
- This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- ...because of your little machine.

550
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:21,023
- So those popo out there...
- We have surrounded the premises.

551
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:22,816
...are the very least of your worries.

552
00:42:22,983 --> 00:42:25,444
Listen, we need to work together
to get out of here.

553
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:28,113
General, they've got us surrounded.

554
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,823
Maybe we should just split up.

555
00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:31,450
Out of the question.

556
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:32,701
Does this vehicle work?

557
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,329
No.

558
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,625
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

559
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:43,754
Don't even think about it.
Besides, there are three of us.

560
00:42:44,004 --> 00:42:46,381
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

561
00:42:48,175 --> 00:42:49,343
I knew it.

562
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,970
Don't tell me that you built this
in two months.

563
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:55,098
I spent years on this. On and off.

564
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:58,018
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

565
00:42:58,226 --> 00:42:59,269
That thing can fly?

566
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:02,731
There's an entire YouTube channel
dedicated to sightings of me.

567
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:04,483
That's awesome.

568
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,568
- We have a warrant to detain...
- Come.

569
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:07,945
...the student Riri Williams.

570
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:09,279
Wireless transmitter...

571
00:43:09,446 --> 00:43:11,740
- so we can communicate.
- Don't try to scurry off.

572
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:13,909
General Okoye, Princess Shuri...

573
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:16,119
come out with your hands up.

574
00:43:16,787 --> 00:43:17,829
What a hunk of junk.

575
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:20,123
Hey, please be careful.

576
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,376
- You will not be placed under arrest.
- Keys are on the seat.

577
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,044
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge...

578
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:25,379
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

579
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:27,381
General, we really need to split up.

580
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:30,801
Listen to me. We are not in your lab.
We are in the field.

581
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:32,344
Now, get her in the car.

582
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,012
Always shouting at me.

583
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:46,024
The tactical unit will breach the entrance
in three, two...

584
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,526
one.

585
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:50,529
FBI! Don't move!

586
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,155
What the hell is that?

587
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:55,200
Oh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit?
Fall back!

588
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,743
Stay where you are!

589
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:01,373
Guess it can fly.

590
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:02,791
- GRIOT!
- Yes, Princess.

591
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,501
- Now!
- Remote piloting activated.

592
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,919
Shuri! No!

593
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:17,264
Let's go!

594
00:44:18,515 --> 00:44:19,516
GRIOT.

595
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:21,977
Give me a visual.

596
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:31,403
- GRIOT...
- Yes, General?

597
00:44:31,486 --> 00:44:33,405
...take me to the princess...

598
00:44:33,488 --> 00:44:36,283
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU...

599
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,578
you will not be able to process
basic input for a millennia.

600
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:40,912
Just one moment, General.

601
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,581
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

602
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,803
GRIOT, give me control of this vehicle
right now!

603
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,056
I am clearing you a path.

604
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,062
She's all yours, General.

605
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,105
Manual drive engaged.

606
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,332
We need to find an extraction point.

607
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:26,959
There's one across the river.

608
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,758
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

609
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:41,890
Princess, there is a surveillance drone
locked onto you.

610
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:42,975
How high?

611
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,434
Thirty-thousand feet.

612
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:51,483
Hang on.

613
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:53,193
I got it.

614
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,864
Come on, Riri.

615
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,534
You gotta find these
differential equations.

616
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:02,452
Once the relative velocity evens out...

617
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:04,413
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone...

618
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:05,580
without an oxygen mask.

619
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,877
Oxygen level is now 55%.

620
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,714
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

621
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,718
Oxygen level is now 30%.

622
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:23,849
Maximum acceleration. I just need to
adjust my Euler angles and that should...

623
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,851
drop it right on the...

624
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:34,192
Oxygen, 0%.

625
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:39,531
The drone is no longer tracking you.

626
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,451
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

627
00:46:42,618 --> 00:46:43,785
Riri! Are you okay?

628
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:46,121
- Riri!
- Yeah.

629
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,834
I'm good.

630
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:52,753
- Incoming!
- Get out of the way!

631
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:54,046
Oh my!

632
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,213
- Shit!
- And no worries.

633
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,341
I got a special delivery for y'all
in three...

634
00:46:57,424 --> 00:46:58,842
two, one...

635
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,553
Nice one, Riri!

636
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:11,563
Riri!

637
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:42,010
What just happened? Shuri!

638
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:43,470
Shuri!

639
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:01,863
The Princess's vitals are stable, General.

640
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,574
She should regain consciousness
momentarily.

641
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:41,153
Take another step closer...

642
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:43,447
and I will kill you all.

643
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:45,115
Drop your weapons!

644
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:49,119
Kill the scientist.

645
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,954
I'll deal with the witnesses.

646
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:52,164
OK.

647
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:55,083
Hey, is she blue?

648
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:58,670
Kill that woman first.

649
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:00,922
Drop your weapon!

650
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:37,042
Go to Namora.

651
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:48,697
You're not worth my blade.

652
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:02,836
What's taking so long?

653
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:05,797
This is not a time for games.

654
00:51:14,973 --> 00:51:16,099
Okoye!

655
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:18,644
Wait!

656
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:20,103
Activating interpretation.

657
00:51:20,187 --> 00:51:21,229
I'm Shuri.

658
00:51:21,355 --> 00:51:22,689
Princess of Wakanda.

659
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:24,983
I demand that you take me to Namor.

660
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,235
Do not bring harm to this girl.

661
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:31,949
Do we take them both alive?

662
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,618
Yes, Attuma.

663
00:51:50,926 --> 00:51:52,010
Breathe.

664
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:01,895
Shuri!

665
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:23,000
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

666
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,460
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

667
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:26,878
Excuse me?

668
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:29,047
Our field office got a tip from Langley
that they were coming.

669
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,091
Right. Who made that call?

670
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,427
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

671
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:37,180
Director de Fontaine.

672
00:52:37,347 --> 00:52:38,307
Really?

673
00:52:38,432 --> 00:52:39,433
Well...

674
00:52:40,392 --> 00:52:42,394
Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

675
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,439
Yeah, we've been on every one of them
since they took out our ship.

676
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:46,898
That's why I wanted you here.

677
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:48,984
You're lookin' good.

678
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:50,819
Well, I try.

679
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,362
You put that home gym in?

680
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:53,572
Yeah. Last year.

681
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:56,408
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

682
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:58,118
Howdy.

683
00:52:58,201 --> 00:52:59,202
I'm special agent in charge.

684
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:02,289
Oh, good for you. You wanna walk me
through the evidence here, or what?

685
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:04,541
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

686
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,876
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

687
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:08,086
We think it was a car crash...

688
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:10,047
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

689
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,466
What do you mean?
It was just like this when you found it?

690
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:15,010
Yes. We think someone involved
got rid of the vehicles.

691
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:18,013
- Got rid of them how?
- They dumped them into the river.

692
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:19,431
You're kidding me.

693
00:53:20,474 --> 00:53:22,142
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

694
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:24,603
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

695
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:26,939
Hey, Ross? You got a full tank of gas?

696
00:53:27,147 --> 00:53:28,690
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

697
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:31,068
It's an eight-hour drive.

698
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,527
Yeah. We can talk about the case.

699
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:34,029
Actually, wouldn't mind...

700
00:53:35,072 --> 00:53:38,450
apologizing to you for a couple of things
I said during our marriage.

701
00:53:41,828 --> 00:53:42,996
They were blue.

702
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:45,958
And they had superhuman strength.

703
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,670
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

704
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:53,632
I struck down three of them
with blows that should've killed them...

705
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,509
but they rose again.

706
00:53:55,676 --> 00:53:58,929
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

707
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:12,067
Okoye...

708
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:16,780
you will be stripped of your rank
as General of Wakanda's armies...

709
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:19,908
and your status as Dora Milaje.

710
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:25,706
Permission to speak...

711
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:26,790
my Queen?

712
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,251
You may.

713
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:31,211
I beg of you.

714
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:34,715
I have given everything.

715
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:39,386
Let me die saving my
country and that throne.

716
00:54:39,553 --> 00:54:41,555
I'm asking you, mother.

717
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:43,515
Allow me to make this right.

718
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:44,891
"Make it right"?

719
00:54:46,602 --> 00:54:49,730
I do not know
if my daughter is alive or dead.

720
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:53,066
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

721
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:59,573
She raised a spear
against her own husband for Wakanda.

722
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:02,242
Where is her treacherous husband now...

723
00:55:02,451 --> 00:55:06,747
but in a place where she can visit
if she wished? Mine...

724
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:09,916
is with the ancestors.

725
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:14,755
I am Queen of the most powerful nation
in the world...

726
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:18,175
and my entire family is gone!

727
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:21,845
Have I not given everything?

728
00:55:31,063 --> 00:55:32,898
On your feet, General.

729
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:41,281
I stood by you...

730
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,035
after Killmonger took the throne...

731
00:55:45,202 --> 00:55:48,872
and you and the elders in this room
stood by him...

732
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,626
while I ran begging to the Jabari
for protection.

733
00:55:54,044 --> 00:55:58,423
And I warned you
about taking my daughter on this mission...

734
00:55:58,507 --> 00:56:00,509
and you lost her.

735
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:02,678
So, today...

736
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:04,930
I am done.

737
00:56:51,852 --> 00:56:54,521
Are you here, GRIOT?

738
00:56:55,814 --> 00:56:56,982
Yes, my Queen.

739
00:56:58,025 --> 00:57:01,445
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

740
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:02,988
I was.

741
00:57:03,113 --> 00:57:05,866
Are you able to track her Kimoyo Beads?

742
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:08,452
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

743
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,038
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

744
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:13,415
I can't see how they figured out
who built it.

745
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:16,001
That information is highly classified.

746
00:57:19,796 --> 00:57:21,798
- What is that? That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

747
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,135
Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

748
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:27,262
It's enough with the titles.
Just take it. I don't care.

749
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,097
Hey, honey sweetheart.

750
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,352
No, I'm with my boss. Now.

751
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:35,479
Actually, she's leaving.

752
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:36,563
All right.

753
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,316
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

754
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:48,075
Everett Ross.

755
00:57:48,283 --> 00:57:49,409
Queen Ramonda?

756
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:51,536
What are you doing with
Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

757
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:53,497
I didn't know they were hers. All right?

758
00:57:53,664 --> 00:57:55,958
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

759
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,126
Do you have the student?

760
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:01,922
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

761
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:04,341
What? Taken by who?

762
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:07,886
My agency assumes it was you.

763
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:10,013
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact...

764
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:12,349
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

765
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:14,142
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

766
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:16,228
But I can't if I don't
know what's going on.

767
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:19,189
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

768
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:22,484
A country that's already on our radar?
Or you mean someone else?

769
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:24,653
That is all I can say for now.

770
00:58:24,861 --> 00:58:25,862
Please...

771
00:58:26,363 --> 00:58:30,701
alert me if your government
decides to act on their suspicions.

772
00:58:30,784 --> 00:58:32,536
Yeah. Sure.

773
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:36,456
Look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

774
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:38,375
I owe Shuri my life.

775
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:43,130
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

776
00:58:43,338 --> 00:58:45,799
I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic...

777
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:49,177
but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.

778
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:00,063
Hello.

779
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,280
You're here for the headmistress?

780
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:16,538
She's there.

781
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:19,166
Very good.

782
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:27,549
Hello.

783
00:59:33,722 --> 00:59:37,267
Please excuse us for a moment.

784
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:42,397
Hello.

785
00:59:42,481 --> 00:59:43,482
Hello.

786
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:44,608
Hello.

787
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:50,948
Queen Mother.

788
00:59:52,824 --> 00:59:55,077
Everything is a lesson
here for the children.

789
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:58,246
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish...

790
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,666
and they grow everything we eat here.

791
01:00:00,832 --> 01:00:03,543
I recognize some of the concepts here.

792
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:05,629
But you are using different material.

793
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:09,091
Yes, we use strictly
what we can find here in Haiti.

794
01:00:11,093 --> 01:00:14,429
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

795
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:57,242
Queen Mother.

796
01:00:57,326 --> 01:01:00,329
It's been six years since you left us.

797
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:03,624
I thought you would at least come back
for the ceremony.

798
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,754
I was afraid...

799
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:12,591
of how final the funeral would be.

800
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,719
Nakia, daughter of Yaa...

801
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:20,974
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan...

802
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:24,770
and you know death is not the end.

803
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:31,151
Thank you.

804
01:01:35,948 --> 01:01:37,699
How is everyone at home?

805
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:40,119
Shuri has been taken.

806
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:41,912
What?

807
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:45,332
You have infiltrated many nations before.

808
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:47,626
That was a long time ago.

809
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:49,002
I was a different person then.

810
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:52,172
I need someone who can find
where she is being held...

811
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:55,342
and rescue her, without being seen.

812
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:58,595
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

813
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:02,057
Oh, my God.

814
01:02:02,141 --> 01:02:03,434
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

815
01:02:03,642 --> 01:02:05,018
Don't tell me to breathe.

816
01:02:05,144 --> 01:02:06,228
Where the hell are we?

817
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,313
We're in a cave. I'm not sure where.

818
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:09,523
Oh, my God!

819
01:02:10,357 --> 01:02:11,650
What is that?

820
01:02:11,817 --> 01:02:14,570
Glow worms. Their larva gives off light.

821
01:02:15,529 --> 01:02:16,613
Just calm down.

822
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:18,824
Okay, is there, like, a
new Black Panther...

823
01:02:19,032 --> 01:02:21,243
- that you can call to come and get us?
- No.

824
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,411
Why not?

825
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:24,246
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

826
01:02:24,955 --> 01:02:26,623
The Black Panther is gone.

827
01:02:27,249 --> 01:02:29,376
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers
when I get kidnapped?

828
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:35,924
Princess.

829
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:39,219
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

830
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:41,805
We had this made for you.

831
01:02:42,598 --> 01:02:44,725
Do you understand her?

832
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,351
Not completely.

833
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:49,688
Nuh-uh.

834
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,107
That is some supervillain shit right there.

835
01:02:52,316 --> 01:02:53,692
That's in every movie.

836
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:55,110
Princess Leia.

837
01:02:55,194 --> 01:02:56,487
Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

838
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,239
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

839
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:00,365
It's fine.

840
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:03,077
You should see what I have to wear
at Warrior Falls.

841
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:10,459
Come with me.

842
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,836
Wait.

843
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,380
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

844
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:17,007
I'm coming back.

845
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:18,884
I'm coming back.

846
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:20,969
Stay calm.

847
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:28,977
Eat?

848
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,244
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

849
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:46,370
What can I help you with?

850
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:50,416
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

851
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,501
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

852
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:56,672
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you.
Just give me a second...

853
01:03:57,172 --> 01:03:59,133
My professor mentioned a study

854
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:03,971
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

855
01:04:04,763 --> 01:04:07,057
Someone unimaginable.

856
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,394
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

857
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:12,020
I'm begging you.

858
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:13,397
Leave. Now.

859
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:17,151
I've encountered him too.

860
01:04:28,704 --> 01:04:32,624
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

861
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:35,502
...on the shore of the beach.

862
01:04:36,295 --> 01:04:38,172
We thought he was a spirit.

863
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:40,507
The K'uk'ulkan.

864
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:43,594
Our Feathered Serpent God,

865
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:47,264
...of this realm and the realm below.

866
01:04:48,098 --> 01:04:50,851
I would very much like to visit that beach.

867
01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:52,519
Be warned...

868
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:59,109
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

869
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:01,487
Others who have searched for him

870
01:05:01,737 --> 01:05:03,405
with ill in their hearts...

871
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:04,782
have never returned.

872
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:07,534
Lost to the depths...

873
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:10,871
forever...

874
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:31,642
Princess.

875
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:32,768
Welcome.

876
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:37,189
Please, feel free.

877
01:05:44,446 --> 01:05:45,781
This is beautiful.

878
01:05:46,573 --> 01:05:48,283
That was my mother's.

879
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,921
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

880
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,258
Most likely 16th century.

881
01:06:05,509 --> 01:06:07,719
Have you been alive since then?

882
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:11,265
Your mother was human.

883
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:13,600
She was.

884
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:16,019
Then she became something else.

885
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,313
- How?
- "How?"

886
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:21,316
"How" is never as important as "why."

887
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:35,622
My mother and her village
were driven from their farms...

888
01:06:35,873 --> 01:06:39,543
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox...

889
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:42,629
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

890
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:46,175
Facing starvation...

891
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,093
war, and disease...

892
01:06:48,677 --> 01:06:50,429
my people turned to Chaac...

893
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:54,016
our god of rain and abundance.

894
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:59,104
Chaac gave our shaman a vision...

895
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:02,274
a way to save his people.

896
01:07:05,736 --> 01:07:10,157
Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

897
01:07:23,587 --> 01:07:25,839
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time...

898
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:28,258
and she did not want to
ingest the plant...

899
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,594
for fear of what it may do to me.

900
01:07:31,136 --> 01:07:32,304
No. My baby.

901
01:07:32,763 --> 01:07:34,640
But the Shaman was convincing.

902
01:07:43,232 --> 01:07:45,109
Your baby is sick.

903
01:07:45,734 --> 01:07:47,403
Only this can heal him.

904
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:51,573
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

905
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:54,493
Take this gift as a promise...

906
01:07:54,576 --> 01:07:58,122
He will be our new king.

907
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:08,340
They all fell sick.

908
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:11,343
And their lives...

909
01:08:11,468 --> 01:08:13,595
their existence there...

910
01:08:13,846 --> 01:08:15,180
ended.

911
01:08:26,984 --> 01:08:29,194
The plant took away their ability
to breathe air...

912
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:33,198
but enabled them to
draw oxygen from the sea.

913
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:38,287
They settled in the ocean...

914
01:08:38,996 --> 01:08:42,124
away from war and diseases.

915
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,753
Let's go!

916
01:09:11,278 --> 01:09:13,447
My mother gave birth to me there...

917
01:09:13,697 --> 01:09:16,950
and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.

918
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:19,536
The plant gave me wings on my ankles...

919
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:22,081
and ears that pointed to the clouds.

920
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:23,832
I was a mutant.

921
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,003
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

922
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,631
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

923
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:33,509
As she grew older...

924
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,430
my mother mourned the life on land
that she once knew...

925
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:42,017
and died with a broken heart.

926
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:48,857
She made me promise to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

927
01:09:53,946 --> 01:09:57,324
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

928
01:10:04,081 --> 01:10:05,082
Whose child is this?

929
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:21,682
Shoot!

930
01:10:22,224 --> 01:10:23,225
Fire!

931
01:10:39,616 --> 01:10:40,993
Thou art a demon.

932
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:43,036
Son of Satan.

933
01:10:43,245 --> 01:10:45,205
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

934
01:10:45,414 --> 01:10:47,249
As he died by my hand...

935
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:48,459
he called me...

936
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,793
Thou art a child without love.

937
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:51,754
The child without love.

938
01:10:53,839 --> 01:10:56,008
The child without love.

939
01:10:56,633 --> 01:10:58,010
And I took my name from there.

940
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,184
"Namor."

941
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:08,228
Because I have no love
for the surface world.

942
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,316
Why are you telling me all of this?

943
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:16,779
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

944
01:11:16,862 --> 01:11:18,614
What if we took her to Wakanda?

945
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,075
Let us go.

946
01:11:21,992 --> 01:11:23,577
I give you my word.

947
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:25,120
She will remain in my country.

948
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,872
I cannot risk that, Princess.

949
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,624
Then keep me instead.

950
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:32,252
I'd love to see your nation.

951
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:36,215
Well, you can't go down there in that.

952
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:41,720
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

953
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:44,056
Your blood will become toxic...

954
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:48,060
and the pressure of the ocean
will break every bone in your body.

955
01:11:51,146 --> 01:11:52,397
Or you can wear a suit.

956
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,566
We have some of them. Come on.

957
01:11:57,653 --> 01:11:58,654
Stay close.

958
01:13:03,051 --> 01:13:04,762
Hey! Namor, wait!

959
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,803
Hello.

960
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:39,500
It's beautiful.

961
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:42,586
It's made of vibranium.

962
01:15:42,795 --> 01:15:43,796
Yes.

963
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:45,506
In the depths of the ocean...

964
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:48,133
I brought the sun to my people.

965
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:53,722
I know you wished me
to spare the life of the scientist.

966
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:56,308
But now you see what I have to protect.

967
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:23,252
Nakia, your hunch was correct.

968
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:26,422
I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.

969
01:16:59,788 --> 01:17:02,416
The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern...

970
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:06,044
approximately 140 meters below the surface.

971
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,964
Queen Mother, I've found her signal.

972
01:17:09,131 --> 01:17:12,134
It's coming from an underwater cave.

973
01:17:12,342 --> 01:17:14,970
If she's down there,
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

974
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:18,557
How would you like me to proceed?

975
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:23,103
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

976
01:17:23,312 --> 01:17:26,565
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

977
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,645
You are the first person from the surface
to come to Talokan.

978
01:18:05,646 --> 01:18:07,689
Please take this as a
token of our gratitude.

979
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:17,491
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

980
01:18:20,202 --> 01:18:21,662
You are young, Princess.

981
01:18:22,496 --> 01:18:25,374
When you age as I do, you realize...

982
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:28,377
we all lose everyone we love.

983
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,129
But when I lost my brother...

984
01:18:30,295 --> 01:18:31,880
it just felt different.

985
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:33,674
He suffered in silence.

986
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:37,344
When he finally asked me to help him,
I couldn't.

987
01:18:38,387 --> 01:18:40,973
How does that make sense...

988
01:18:41,056 --> 01:18:44,726
that the ancestors would give me
gifts and skills...

989
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:47,646
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

990
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:50,190
Why?

991
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:55,154
I don't have an answer for that question.

992
01:18:57,281 --> 01:18:59,742
My ancestors would often say...

993
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,620
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

994
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:09,501
I admire what you have built here.

995
01:19:11,837 --> 01:19:14,339
And how you've protected your people.

996
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:18,093
But as princess of Wakanda...

997
01:19:18,302 --> 01:19:20,721
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

998
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:25,559
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

999
01:19:26,935 --> 01:19:29,062
I'm not leaving without her.

1000
01:19:29,855 --> 01:19:33,525
We need to find
a peaceful way to resolve this.

1001
01:19:37,237 --> 01:19:38,947
It is no longer about the scientist.

1002
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:45,537
For centuries, the surface nations
have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1003
01:19:46,205 --> 01:19:47,664
Over resources.

1004
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:51,376
Since the day I buried my mother...

1005
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:55,297
I have prepared my people
for the time they will come for us.

1006
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,676
And that machine
is the sign that the time is now.

1007
01:20:01,553 --> 01:20:06,892
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1008
01:20:07,392 --> 01:20:09,186
There is no in-between.

1009
01:20:11,355 --> 01:20:15,025
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world...

1010
01:20:15,651 --> 01:20:17,903
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1011
01:20:18,904 --> 01:20:19,988
That's madness.

1012
01:20:20,197 --> 01:20:24,868
There isn't a nation that wouldn't
plunder Wakanda if given a chance.

1013
01:20:26,203 --> 01:20:28,122
If we make an alliance...

1014
01:20:28,288 --> 01:20:30,999
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1015
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:35,754
Then, when the threat of these nations
has been eliminated...

1016
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:38,590
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1017
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:41,844
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1018
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:44,888
The scientist will die.

1019
01:20:45,848 --> 01:20:48,725
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1020
01:20:49,059 --> 01:20:50,477
An attack on my people?

1021
01:20:50,853 --> 01:20:52,312
Yes.

1022
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:54,857
And I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:58,902
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1024
01:21:02,072 --> 01:21:04,241
You have been summoned...

1025
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:05,617
K'uk'ulkan.

1026
01:21:09,872 --> 01:21:14,168
I heard you that night,
with your mother at the river.

1027
01:21:15,419 --> 01:21:18,213
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1028
01:21:24,386 --> 01:21:26,764
Let us burn it together.

1029
01:21:34,521 --> 01:21:37,524
Queen Ramonda won't sell us any vibranium.

1030
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:41,070
And now they abducted a young woman
who built the machine.

1031
01:21:41,236 --> 01:21:44,198
Yeah, with all due respect,
Riri Williams is a child prodigy...

1032
01:21:44,364 --> 01:21:46,533
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1033
01:21:46,617 --> 01:21:49,578
The Wakandans were recruiting her
as part of their outreach program.

1034
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,163
Nothing more. And then...

1035
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,707
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night...

1036
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:57,252
to arrest the Crown Princess
of an international superpower.

1037
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,258
The President wants to
take offensive action against Wakanda.

1038
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:06,512
What type of offensive action?

1039
01:22:07,304 --> 01:22:08,722
Destabilization.

1040
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:13,268
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1041
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:15,687
So, Ross, what do you think?

1042
01:22:15,771 --> 01:22:18,607
My sources are telling me
that there's someone else out there.

1043
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:21,360
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1044
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,695
You've gotta give me enough time
to investigate this properly...

1045
01:22:23,862 --> 01:22:25,948
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war...

1046
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:27,866
with a country whose military capacity...

1047
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,993
we can't even comprehend.

1048
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:32,496
Director?

1049
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:35,290
I think he's the expert.

1050
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:38,377
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1051
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:45,968
Yes?

1052
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:47,052
We have a problem.

1053
01:23:08,824 --> 01:23:11,118
Is my daughter alive?

1054
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:13,245
The princess is alive and well.

1055
01:23:13,996 --> 01:23:16,832
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1056
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:19,293
She will remain there for the time being.

1057
01:23:23,005 --> 01:23:26,258
What can I offer you in exchange?

1058
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:27,718
Nothing.

1059
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:29,803
I beg to differ.

1060
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,307
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda...

1061
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:36,226
for your attack on their mining ship.

1062
01:23:36,393 --> 01:23:39,396
Return my daughter and the scientist...

1063
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:43,233
or I will inform them of your existence.

1064
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,992
If you tell the Americans about us...

1065
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:55,704
if you try to find us...

1066
01:23:56,789 --> 01:24:00,584
or if I discover
a single Wakandan ship in the ocean...

1067
01:24:01,376 --> 01:24:02,836
I will kill the princess.

1068
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:06,173
I will come to Wakanda...

1069
01:24:06,298 --> 01:24:08,342
and I will kill you.

1070
01:24:17,684 --> 01:24:18,727
So, what happened?

1071
01:24:20,604 --> 01:24:23,565
He wants to go to war
with the surface world...

1072
01:24:23,774 --> 01:24:25,442
and asked me to help him.

1073
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,157
I need to think.

1074
01:24:32,366 --> 01:24:34,284
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1075
01:24:46,588 --> 01:24:47,881
Drop your spear!

1076
01:24:48,006 --> 01:24:49,466
Kill the Princess!

1077
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:56,932
Drop your knife.

1078
01:24:57,391 --> 01:24:58,392
You...

1079
01:24:59,226 --> 01:25:00,352
You killed her.

1080
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:02,521
Let her go

1081
01:25:02,604 --> 01:25:04,690
and you don't have to die.

1082
01:25:07,693 --> 01:25:08,694
Shuri...

1083
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:11,155
Move your left arm.

1084
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:16,994
Are you okay?

1085
01:25:17,786 --> 01:25:19,163
Are you okay?

1086
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:20,622
- Give me your Beads!
- Let's go.

1087
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:23,292
- Give me your Beads. I can save her.
- We have to go.

1088
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:25,753
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,
but we need to listen to her.

1089
01:25:25,878 --> 01:25:27,087
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1090
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:29,298
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1091
01:25:29,465 --> 01:25:31,467
You don't understand. This will mean war.

1092
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:33,927
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1093
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:18,639
Did they hurt you?

1094
01:26:18,722 --> 01:26:20,307
No. No.

1095
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,018
Thank you.

1096
01:26:23,852 --> 01:26:24,978
You're welcome.

1097
01:26:26,522 --> 01:26:27,731
- GRIOT.
- Yes, my Queen.

1098
01:26:27,898 --> 01:26:29,900
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1099
01:26:33,654 --> 01:26:35,531
What happened my child?

1100
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:39,368
The Wakandans.

1101
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,870
They came for her.

1102
01:26:44,581 --> 01:26:46,625
K'uk'ulkan...

1103
01:26:49,086 --> 01:26:52,589
can you save me?

1104
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:07,312
Is she dead?

1105
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:10,816
Yes.

1106
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:21,785
Rest child.

1107
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:25,706
They came...

1108
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:30,169
while you spoke to the Queen?

1109
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:34,923
We should not have trusted her.

1110
01:27:35,716 --> 01:27:38,719
The Princess has seen our home.

1111
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:41,305
What is stopping them

1112
01:27:41,805 --> 01:27:43,932
from coming for Talokan?

1113
01:27:46,226 --> 01:27:47,394
I will.

1114
01:28:22,346 --> 01:28:23,847
Rise Talokan!

1115
01:28:26,225 --> 01:28:27,976
Rise Talokan!

1116
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:35,317
I was blinded

1117
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:36,735
by hope

1118
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:38,612
of partnership.

1119
01:28:40,531 --> 01:28:41,573
And...

1120
01:28:42,241 --> 01:28:44,535
I have compromised

1121
01:28:45,035 --> 01:28:47,162
all of us.

1122
01:28:47,913 --> 01:28:49,039
Talokan

1123
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,958
will not move

1124
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,584
again.

1125
01:28:53,544 --> 01:28:54,503
Namora.

1126
01:28:55,504 --> 01:28:56,505
Attuma.

1127
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:01,635
When we are done with them

1128
01:29:04,513 --> 01:29:06,890
they will never think

1129
01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:09,101
of approaching

1130
01:29:09,309 --> 01:29:10,727
Talokan!

1131
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:14,481
Rise Talokan!

1132
01:29:26,785 --> 01:29:29,246
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1133
01:29:29,788 --> 01:29:31,582
The city has been on edge since you left.

1134
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,500
Go.

1135
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:36,211
Fortify the sonic
barriers for all waterways.

1136
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,421
Princess?

1137
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:39,298
Neka.

1138
01:29:41,258 --> 01:29:43,677
Thank the ancestors.

1139
01:29:44,052 --> 01:29:47,222
I just wanted to return these.

1140
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:50,517
No. Keep them.

1141
01:29:50,726 --> 01:29:52,269
Might need them soon.

1142
01:29:53,228 --> 01:29:55,189
Did you get that from down there?

1143
01:29:58,067 --> 01:30:01,570
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1144
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:03,906
Yes.

1145
01:30:05,115 --> 01:30:06,825
It is beautiful.

1146
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,621
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1147
01:30:30,891 --> 01:30:33,644
So, Miss Riri Williams...

1148
01:30:34,311 --> 01:30:36,480
what do you think of Wakanda?

1149
01:30:36,688 --> 01:30:39,566
The stories just don't
do this place justice.

1150
01:30:41,777 --> 01:30:42,820
It's great.

1151
01:30:43,112 --> 01:30:44,738
But I really would like to go home.

1152
01:30:46,323 --> 01:30:47,741
You will need to be patient.

1153
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,993
Can I at least call my mom?

1154
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:59,795
The Princess has been brought home
by the War Dog Nakia.

1155
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:01,255
Glory to Hanuman.

1156
01:31:01,463 --> 01:31:02,881
Glory to Hanuman.

1157
01:31:04,049 --> 01:31:07,511
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1158
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,555
The Queen will reward her...

1159
01:31:09,638 --> 01:31:12,224
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1160
01:31:14,685 --> 01:31:16,061
Okoye.

1161
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:19,606
Thank you, my sister.

1162
01:31:21,817 --> 01:31:23,026
After Thanos' attack...

1163
01:31:23,402 --> 01:31:25,529
when you left without saying a word...

1164
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:27,322
it hurt.

1165
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:34,663
I regret not being there with all of you.

1166
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,624
It was not easy.

1167
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,376
He was...

1168
01:31:40,002 --> 01:31:43,839
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1169
01:31:44,548 --> 01:31:46,008
But to me...

1170
01:31:52,389 --> 01:31:54,183
he was everything.

1171
01:31:56,059 --> 01:31:57,978
My T'Challa.

1172
01:31:59,354 --> 01:32:02,316
When he was taken away from me,
just like that, I...

1173
01:32:02,983 --> 01:32:04,860
I had to step away...

1174
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:07,529
and let myself break.

1175
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:12,159
I couldn't just...

1176
01:32:12,242 --> 01:32:15,662
keep going as if nothing had happened,
you know.

1177
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:34,515
We are under attack.

1178
01:32:42,231 --> 01:32:43,232
Here.

1179
01:32:50,114 --> 01:32:51,115
Take this one.

1180
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:53,742
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1181
01:32:53,826 --> 01:32:55,786
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1182
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:57,037
Shuri, where are you?

1183
01:32:57,162 --> 01:32:58,747
Making my way to the city right now.

1184
01:32:58,914 --> 01:33:00,290
Stand down! That is an order!

1185
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:02,835
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1186
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:05,546
- Aneka, do not let her leave the lab.
- Mother, you're breaking up.

1187
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:06,630
- We can't hear you.
- Shuri!

1188
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:07,714
Love you. Bye!

1189
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,135
You just hung up on the Queen.

1190
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,261
I just hung up on my mom.

1191
01:33:12,428 --> 01:33:14,012
There's a difference. Come. Let's go!

1192
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:48,338
Invaders!

1193
01:33:53,969 --> 01:33:57,181
Mama! Mama!

1194
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,643
Let us turn! Turn around!

1195
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:08,525
EMTs are suffering a
form of sonic hypnosis.

1196
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:12,237
Take the child.

1197
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,239
General, plug your ears.

1198
01:34:14,406 --> 01:34:15,491
Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:02,788
Can I help?

1200
01:35:02,913 --> 01:35:04,123
Come, quickly.

1201
01:35:11,004 --> 01:35:12,506
Warrior!

1202
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,509
Cross your arms...

1203
01:35:15,592 --> 01:35:16,593
...my child.

1204
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:22,349
Nakia.

1205
01:35:22,474 --> 01:35:23,434
Yes.

1206
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:24,935
We'll find your mama, OK?

1207
01:35:36,905 --> 01:35:38,240
The fish man.

1208
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:45,164
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

1209
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,583
It is up to you now.

1210
01:37:06,203 --> 01:37:07,204
Mayday!

1211
01:37:07,704 --> 01:37:08,747
Mayday!

1212
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:28,475
- Shit, he's too fast.
- He's even faster in the water.

1213
01:37:54,543 --> 01:37:56,044
- Activating system override.
- No.

1214
01:37:56,211 --> 01:37:58,213
- Wait! I'll fix it.
- Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1215
01:38:15,522 --> 01:38:16,523
Do you see her?

1216
01:38:16,774 --> 01:38:18,108
Yes. Right there.

1217
01:38:31,663 --> 01:38:32,664
Go, child.

1218
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,584
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1219
01:38:35,751 --> 01:38:36,794
Run!

1220
01:38:51,475 --> 01:38:52,851
Okoye, move now!

1221
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:54,538
Help the child.

1222
01:40:00,586 --> 01:40:01,628
She did this.

1223
01:40:05,716 --> 01:40:09,720
In one week's time,
I will return with my entire army...

1224
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:13,056
and you will join us
against the surface world...

1225
01:40:13,223 --> 01:40:16,185
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1226
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,061
Come on, my Queen.

1227
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:20,147
Mother.

1228
01:40:20,564 --> 01:40:22,274
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1229
01:40:22,608 --> 01:40:25,360
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1230
01:40:26,153 --> 01:40:27,654
Mourn your losses.

1231
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:32,618
You are queen now.

1232
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:33,786
Mother!

1233
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:35,579
No!

1234
01:40:38,707 --> 01:40:40,292
Get off of me! Mother!

1235
01:40:40,959 --> 01:40:42,920
Mama!

1236
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:51,261
Mama!

1237
01:40:51,804 --> 01:40:53,305
Mama!

1238
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:54,973
Mother!

1239
01:40:55,599 --> 01:40:56,683
Wake up, my Queen.

1240
01:40:58,769 --> 01:40:59,895
Let me see.

1241
01:41:00,604 --> 01:41:01,563
Wake up.

1242
01:41:02,606 --> 01:41:03,982
Help me!

1243
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:05,317
Mama!

1244
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:10,072
Wake up, Mother.

1245
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:11,949
She has passed.

1246
01:41:12,908 --> 01:41:14,326
Mama!

1247
01:41:55,743 --> 01:42:00,914
Jabariland offers you their comfort
for your loss.

1248
01:42:07,546 --> 01:42:09,214
You must mourn her...

1249
01:42:09,381 --> 01:42:13,302
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1250
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:17,055
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1251
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:18,474
Why are you here?

1252
01:42:20,309 --> 01:42:22,102
I promised your brother...

1253
01:42:22,186 --> 01:42:24,480
that I would provide you with counsel...

1254
01:42:24,646 --> 01:42:26,190
and protection.

1255
01:42:28,567 --> 01:42:30,736
But I am in need of your advice today.

1256
01:42:34,698 --> 01:42:38,243
Your tribal elders have approached me
with a proposition.

1257
01:42:39,703 --> 01:42:42,956
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp...

1258
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,625
in Jabariland.

1259
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:47,961
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child...

1260
01:42:48,587 --> 01:42:50,297
who scoffs at tradition?

1261
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:55,552
The world...

1262
01:42:57,429 --> 01:43:00,015
The world has taken too much from you...

1263
01:43:00,808 --> 01:43:04,061
for you to still be considered a child.

1264
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:09,066
It is in my people's interest to know...

1265
01:43:09,233 --> 01:43:11,652
which way your mind is leaning.

1266
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,322
The elders are desperate.

1267
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:18,742
The city is vulnerable.

1268
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:23,205
If you are to provide for them...

1269
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,583
they will be in great debt to you.

1270
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:30,337
And what of your heart?

1271
01:43:33,882 --> 01:43:35,884
Which way is your heart leaning?

1272
01:43:37,803 --> 01:43:40,681
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1273
01:43:44,268 --> 01:43:45,811
My heart was buried with her.

1274
01:44:22,973 --> 01:44:23,932
Oh, man.

1275
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:26,643
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1276
01:44:26,894 --> 01:44:27,895
What are you doing here?

1277
01:44:28,103 --> 01:44:30,647
I'm hungry. And...

1278
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:33,192
Tragedy strikes the
international community.

1279
01:44:33,358 --> 01:44:37,488
Sources can now confirm that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1280
01:44:37,988 --> 01:44:41,825
Western allies say that civil conflict
was the likely cause of the Queen's...

1281
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:45,245
So...

1282
01:44:45,704 --> 01:44:47,081
You have any comment?

1283
01:44:49,124 --> 01:44:52,294
I wonder what else your friends
are keeping from you.

1284
01:44:53,045 --> 01:44:54,213
What are you talking about?

1285
01:44:54,379 --> 01:44:57,883
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1286
01:45:00,302 --> 01:45:02,471
What about the Beads?

1287
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,765
What?

1288
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:05,891
The Beads.

1289
01:45:06,016 --> 01:45:07,142
I had them bugged...

1290
01:45:07,351 --> 01:45:09,019
before you ever even got there.

1291
01:45:09,144 --> 01:45:13,107
I've been privy to
every conversation you've had...

1292
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:15,776
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1293
01:45:16,026 --> 01:45:17,277
May she rest in peace.

1294
01:45:17,694 --> 01:45:19,113
But it's good.

1295
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,322
Well, for us.

1296
01:45:20,489 --> 01:45:23,158
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1297
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:24,660
They're a good people.

1298
01:45:25,369 --> 01:45:27,413
You ever thought for a second...

1299
01:45:27,579 --> 01:45:29,164
what they could be doing?

1300
01:45:29,373 --> 01:45:30,707
Ever thought what we would be doing...

1301
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:34,002
if the US was the only country in the world
with vibranium?

1302
01:45:35,337 --> 01:45:38,590
I actually dream about that.

1303
01:45:41,385 --> 01:45:43,137
Val. Val, please.

1304
01:45:43,429 --> 01:45:45,097
It's Director de Fontaine.

1305
01:45:47,975 --> 01:45:51,145
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1306
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:54,898
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1307
01:45:57,192 --> 01:45:59,695
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1308
01:45:59,862 --> 01:46:02,030
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1309
01:46:02,197 --> 01:46:05,492
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1310
01:46:06,368 --> 01:46:08,370
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1311
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:19,381
My brother is dead.

1312
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:23,719
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1313
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:42,946
GRIOT?

1314
01:46:43,113 --> 01:46:45,824
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis...

1315
01:46:45,949 --> 01:46:49,536
between our attempts at creating
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1316
01:46:52,206 --> 01:46:54,291
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1317
01:46:54,833 --> 01:46:56,085
Yes, Princess.

1318
01:46:59,421 --> 01:47:02,174
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil...

1319
01:47:03,425 --> 01:47:06,804
they may share some base-level similarities
that we can exploit.

1320
01:47:07,012 --> 01:47:08,305
As you wish, Princess.

1321
01:47:12,643 --> 01:47:15,062
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1322
01:47:15,145 --> 01:47:16,271
Uploading now.

1323
01:47:47,886 --> 01:47:49,263
Why doesn't he look like them?

1324
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:51,640
His physiology is completely different.

1325
01:47:51,723 --> 01:47:54,476
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1326
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:56,895
The women that were guarding us,
they had water over their mouths...

1327
01:47:57,062 --> 01:47:58,856
and on their necks.

1328
01:47:58,939 --> 01:47:59,940
He didn't have that.

1329
01:48:00,023 --> 01:48:05,446
Several organisms don't need gills
to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1330
01:48:05,612 --> 01:48:07,239
It's like a jellyfish.

1331
01:48:07,322 --> 01:48:11,201
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1332
01:48:12,536 --> 01:48:14,747
- It's a process called diffusion.
- Diffusion.

1333
01:48:39,146 --> 01:48:41,857
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler...

1334
01:48:42,024 --> 01:48:43,525
is a day wasted.

1335
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,987
We must deal with Namor
before he brings his warriors back here.

1336
01:48:47,112 --> 01:48:49,907
And how are we to deal with a man
with that much power?

1337
01:48:50,824 --> 01:48:52,409
In that attack,
before he took out your plane...

1338
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:53,952
he jumped back into the water.

1339
01:48:54,078 --> 01:48:55,829
What if that's what makes him strong?

1340
01:48:56,038 --> 01:48:59,458
He's breathing air and getting oxygen
from the water on his skin.

1341
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:02,920
If we could find a way to dry his ass out,
he won't be as strong.

1342
01:49:03,295 --> 01:49:04,463
Yo, that's it.

1343
01:49:04,588 --> 01:49:05,589
GRIOT.

1344
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:09,468
We need to convert the Royal Talon Fighter
into a pervaporation chamber.

1345
01:49:09,635 --> 01:49:10,719
Is that even possible?

1346
01:49:10,886 --> 01:49:11,970
Yes.

1347
01:49:13,555 --> 01:49:15,432
You're going to help us trap him.

1348
01:49:16,225 --> 01:49:18,227
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1349
01:49:18,435 --> 01:49:20,062
Right this way.

1350
01:49:23,857 --> 01:49:26,360
How old were you
when you built your first machine?

1351
01:49:26,527 --> 01:49:27,528
Three.

1352
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:31,281
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1353
01:49:31,448 --> 01:49:33,784
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

1354
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:40,082
So who taught you how to do
all that you do?

1355
01:49:40,374 --> 01:49:41,667
My big brother.

1356
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,048
I was the tip of the spear
of Wakanda's army.

1357
01:49:48,215 --> 01:49:50,551
This is not me.

1358
01:49:51,135 --> 01:49:53,262
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1359
01:49:54,388 --> 01:49:55,681
I turned in my weapon.

1360
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:58,016
I built you a new spear as well.

1361
01:49:59,852 --> 01:50:00,936
A new one?

1362
01:50:01,019 --> 01:50:02,062
Yes.

1363
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:05,899
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1364
01:50:06,024 --> 01:50:07,401
The Midnight Angel.

1365
01:50:07,609 --> 01:50:09,069
Midnight Angel?

1366
01:50:09,194 --> 01:50:10,988
Listen to me.

1367
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:14,283
This will even the odds against them.

1368
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,785
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1369
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:19,830
Please.

1370
01:50:24,501 --> 01:50:25,753
Shuri.

1371
01:50:26,336 --> 01:50:27,546
Yes.

1372
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:30,758
How many of these did you make?

1373
01:50:32,885 --> 01:50:34,845
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1374
01:50:35,012 --> 01:50:36,638
I won't be forced out of my home.

1375
01:50:36,805 --> 01:50:39,391
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1376
01:50:39,475 --> 01:50:40,893
Why did you join the Dora?

1377
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:43,103
Why do you care?

1378
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,905
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1379
01:50:53,322 --> 01:50:56,450
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of Kyana...

1380
01:50:57,201 --> 01:50:59,328
do you still have some fight left in you?

1381
01:50:59,495 --> 01:51:01,997
What do you have in mind?

1382
01:51:26,563 --> 01:51:27,564
GRIOT...

1383
01:51:29,233 --> 01:51:30,567
what's the confidence rate?

1384
01:51:31,318 --> 01:51:33,570
98.7%, Princess.

1385
01:51:33,862 --> 01:51:37,616
Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

1386
01:51:40,702 --> 01:51:43,080
Hey, Shuri.

1387
01:51:43,914 --> 01:51:46,208
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1388
01:51:47,251 --> 01:51:48,877
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1389
01:51:52,881 --> 01:51:53,882
So...

1390
01:51:55,217 --> 01:51:58,137
this is what you've been up to.

1391
01:51:58,929 --> 01:52:00,097
Yes.

1392
01:52:00,264 --> 01:52:02,182
What you have here, now...

1393
01:52:03,475 --> 01:52:07,688
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1394
01:52:08,939 --> 01:52:13,193
It would be the greatest gift...

1395
01:52:13,569 --> 01:52:16,029
since Bashenga's discovery.

1396
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:23,412
We'll soon find out. Come.

1397
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:27,958
- GRIOT?
- Yes, Princess.

1398
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:29,042
Print it.

1399
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:35,007
How will we know if it works?

1400
01:52:35,799 --> 01:52:37,009
If it glows.

1401
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:47,352
You did it!

1402
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:54,568
I mean, shouldn't we be burning incense
or something?

1403
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:58,280
Only Bast knows how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1404
01:53:08,624 --> 01:53:10,542
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

1405
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:11,710
No.

1406
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:14,296
Need you to have access to my chest...

1407
01:53:14,463 --> 01:53:16,548
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1408
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:18,634
"Cardiac arrest"?

1409
01:53:19,718 --> 01:53:20,761
She's joking...

1410
01:53:21,303 --> 01:53:22,554
right?

1411
01:53:24,556 --> 01:53:25,557
Right?

1412
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:34,400
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb...

1413
01:53:34,691 --> 01:53:37,820
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther...

1414
01:53:38,195 --> 01:53:40,656
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1415
01:53:43,075 --> 01:53:44,451
Ramonda.

1416
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:49,915
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1417
01:54:59,943 --> 01:55:00,944
Mother?

1418
01:55:14,291 --> 01:55:15,542
N'Jadaka.

1419
01:55:16,085 --> 01:55:17,252
Lil' cousin.

1420
01:55:17,669 --> 01:55:18,670
How?

1421
01:55:18,879 --> 01:55:21,548
How is never as important as why, right?

1422
01:55:23,342 --> 01:55:24,551
You chose me.

1423
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,638
Impossible. I would never choose you.

1424
01:55:27,805 --> 01:55:29,431
Why did you take the Herb?

1425
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,433
To see my family.

1426
01:55:31,517 --> 01:55:32,518
No, that's bullshit.

1427
01:55:33,477 --> 01:55:36,438
You didn't believe the Ancestral Plane
was real, did you?

1428
01:55:39,566 --> 01:55:40,567
No.

1429
01:55:41,276 --> 01:55:42,569
So, why did you take it, then?

1430
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:45,614
You don't have to lie to me.

1431
01:55:46,448 --> 01:55:47,991
So I can be strong.

1432
01:55:48,283 --> 01:55:49,868
Strong to do what?

1433
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,747
See?

1434
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:57,251
We're more alike than you think.

1435
01:55:59,169 --> 01:56:01,088
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1436
01:56:01,296 --> 01:56:02,464
I'm nothing like you.

1437
01:56:03,882 --> 01:56:05,634
You took it for yourself...

1438
01:56:05,843 --> 01:56:07,344
then destroyed the rest.

1439
01:56:08,887 --> 01:56:10,055
Unworthy king...

1440
01:56:10,931 --> 01:56:12,391
afraid of being replaced.

1441
01:56:13,475 --> 01:56:14,476
Just a coward.

1442
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:15,602
No.

1443
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:18,397
I had the courage to do
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1444
01:56:19,815 --> 01:56:21,275
How many people like your scientist...

1445
01:56:21,442 --> 01:56:23,777
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1446
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:25,821
Cowards.

1447
01:56:25,988 --> 01:56:29,074
That was the Panthers
that came before me...

1448
01:56:29,241 --> 01:56:30,242
and before T'Challa.

1449
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:32,244
Don't mention my brother.

1450
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:34,204
You're the reason why he's dead.

1451
01:56:34,788 --> 01:56:38,041
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1452
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:40,377
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1453
01:56:40,586 --> 01:56:42,379
Their blood is on your hands.

1454
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:44,882
That ain't on me.

1455
01:56:45,507 --> 01:56:46,842
And don't you dare...

1456
01:56:46,967 --> 01:56:48,844
take that away from your mother.

1457
01:56:49,011 --> 01:56:52,556
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1458
01:56:53,891 --> 01:56:56,560
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1459
01:56:58,061 --> 01:56:59,855
He would've killed that girl.

1460
01:57:00,522 --> 01:57:02,441
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1461
01:57:04,068 --> 01:57:06,653
T'Challa was too noble.

1462
01:57:08,864 --> 01:57:11,241
He let the man who
murdered your father live.

1463
01:57:13,368 --> 01:57:14,995
And here you stand.

1464
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:22,836
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1465
01:57:23,003 --> 01:57:25,089
or take care of business...

1466
01:57:25,798 --> 01:57:26,924
like me?

1467
01:57:29,676 --> 01:57:30,677
Are you okay?

1468
01:57:32,846 --> 01:57:34,056
Are you OK?

1469
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,684
Who did you see?

1470
01:57:43,190 --> 01:57:44,191
No one.

1471
01:57:47,403 --> 01:57:48,445
What's going on?

1472
01:57:49,154 --> 01:57:50,489
I failed.

1473
01:57:50,697 --> 01:57:51,615
It didn't work.

1474
01:57:51,824 --> 01:57:52,825
Hey, Shuri.

1475
01:57:55,911 --> 01:57:56,870
They abandoned me.

1476
01:57:57,079 --> 01:57:58,247
They would never do that.

1477
01:57:58,414 --> 01:57:59,915
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1478
01:58:00,082 --> 01:58:01,375
I re-created the Herb.

1479
01:58:01,542 --> 01:58:03,919
- Okay.
- I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1480
01:58:04,128 --> 01:58:05,629
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1481
01:58:05,754 --> 01:58:06,839
Just relax.

1482
01:58:14,012 --> 01:58:15,264
Shit.

1483
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,936
Can I get some of that too?

1484
01:58:28,402 --> 01:58:29,445
I think...

1485
01:58:30,946 --> 01:58:32,448
you're going to need a suit.

1486
01:59:04,104 --> 01:59:06,023
There are more people coming from the city.

1487
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:07,691
They need more space.

1488
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,901
So what?

1489
01:59:09,735 --> 01:59:12,071
You are visitors.

1490
01:59:12,237 --> 01:59:15,574
It is a wonder how anything gets done
with you people.

1491
01:59:41,183 --> 01:59:42,810
The princess!

1492
02:00:16,343 --> 02:00:17,719
She has done it!

1493
02:00:18,387 --> 02:00:21,432
The Black Panther lives!

1494
02:00:39,241 --> 02:00:41,702
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1495
02:00:44,163 --> 02:00:45,539
Our Queen murdered.

1496
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:49,585
Our capital destroyed.

1497
02:00:51,336 --> 02:00:53,172
He believes we have no protector.

1498
02:00:55,132 --> 02:00:56,133
But now...

1499
02:00:57,885 --> 02:00:59,970
now is our time to strike.

1500
02:01:00,095 --> 02:01:03,724
How, when we don't even know
how to find him?

1501
02:01:04,266 --> 02:01:06,059
We'll bring Namor to us.

1502
02:01:06,226 --> 02:01:07,644
- Here, again?
- No.

1503
02:01:07,895 --> 02:01:10,272
A distant location at sea.

1504
02:01:10,355 --> 02:01:11,356
All right.

1505
02:01:11,815 --> 02:01:13,400
Let's say this does work.

1506
02:01:15,736 --> 02:01:17,446
Assuming we can kill this man...

1507
02:01:17,613 --> 02:01:20,657
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1508
02:01:23,327 --> 02:01:25,788
is murdering him the right solution?

1509
02:01:26,163 --> 02:01:28,123
You were calling for his head...

1510
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:30,709
when his only crime was intimidation.

1511
02:01:30,876 --> 02:01:32,628
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1512
02:01:32,836 --> 02:01:34,046
His soldiers...

1513
02:01:34,213 --> 02:01:35,798
did not call him General or King.

1514
02:01:35,964 --> 02:01:38,634
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1515
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:40,010
What is that?

1516
02:01:40,219 --> 02:01:42,346
The feather serpent god.

1517
02:01:42,846 --> 02:01:43,847
What?

1518
02:01:44,014 --> 02:01:45,933
Do you think because
we are living in the mountains...

1519
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,018
we do not have access to books?

1520
02:01:48,519 --> 02:01:49,853
Elders...

1521
02:01:50,145 --> 02:01:51,563
with your permission...

1522
02:01:51,814 --> 02:01:55,401
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1523
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,319
Yes.

1524
02:01:57,694 --> 02:01:58,695
Yes.

1525
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:06,870
Namor's not finished.

1526
02:02:08,372 --> 02:02:11,458
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1527
02:02:11,625 --> 02:02:13,961
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1528
02:02:14,086 --> 02:02:16,338
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1529
02:02:16,797 --> 02:02:20,134
If Namor is indeed a god to his people...

1530
02:02:20,259 --> 02:02:22,928
killing him will risk eternal war.

1531
02:02:23,095 --> 02:02:24,179
And so what?

1532
02:02:24,638 --> 02:02:27,015
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1533
02:02:27,224 --> 02:02:28,517
Of course it was.

1534
02:02:29,643 --> 02:02:33,730
Of course she was.

1535
02:02:35,733 --> 02:02:38,944
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1536
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:46,034
And it is not what I want...

1537
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:50,497
for my people.

1538
02:03:00,799 --> 02:03:03,844
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1539
02:03:04,762 --> 02:03:06,764
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1540
02:03:07,848 --> 02:03:10,184
Her hopes and her dreams.

1541
02:03:13,312 --> 02:03:14,730
But she's dead.

1542
02:03:15,773 --> 02:03:16,774
She's gone!

1543
02:03:18,609 --> 02:03:22,488
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1544
02:03:23,822 --> 02:03:25,074
So, her dreams...

1545
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:28,327
her goals, her hopes for me...

1546
02:03:31,747 --> 02:03:32,998
it doesn't exist.

1547
02:03:35,667 --> 02:03:37,252
It doesn't matter anymore.

1548
02:03:39,338 --> 02:03:42,216
What matters is what I want...

1549
02:03:42,382 --> 02:03:45,052
and what I want is Namor dead!

1550
02:03:49,014 --> 02:03:51,725
And you're going to help me get it.

1551
02:03:58,232 --> 02:03:59,400
Are we clear?

1552
02:04:06,949 --> 02:04:08,659
We leave in the morning.

1553
02:04:34,476 --> 02:04:35,477
Hi.

1554
02:04:35,686 --> 02:04:36,645
Good morning.

1555
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:40,482
If we survive this...

1556
02:04:42,067 --> 02:04:45,279
I want you to know
you have a home with me in Haiti.

1557
02:04:48,198 --> 02:04:50,409
Here. Take my hands.

1558
02:04:53,746 --> 02:04:54,747
Breathe.

1559
02:04:59,126 --> 02:05:01,712
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1560
02:05:01,795 --> 02:05:04,882
Who did you see when you took the Herb?

1561
02:05:10,095 --> 02:05:11,805
If you go to war for vengeance...

1562
02:05:11,972 --> 02:05:14,308
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1563
02:05:14,975 --> 02:05:16,810
It will only grow larger...

1564
02:05:17,019 --> 02:05:18,479
and it will consume you.

1565
02:05:20,647 --> 02:05:22,024
It already has.

1566
02:05:27,529 --> 02:05:34,119
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

1567
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,121
Where?

1568
02:06:05,567 --> 02:06:06,735
Get out of the water!

1569
02:06:51,405 --> 02:06:52,698
For the Queen.

1570
02:08:06,814 --> 02:08:08,524
Riri, how's it going up there?

1571
02:08:09,108 --> 02:08:10,317
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1572
02:08:10,442 --> 02:08:11,819
I could really use that backup right now.

1573
02:08:12,027 --> 02:08:13,946
I thought you'd never ask.

1574
02:08:19,827 --> 02:08:20,828
Shit.

1575
02:08:25,207 --> 02:08:26,625
Shit, he's fast.

1576
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:28,502
But I'm faster.

1577
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,523
I got you.

1578
02:08:55,863 --> 02:08:57,239
It's on you now, Shuri.

1579
02:09:06,457 --> 02:09:08,041
- Princess.
- No.

1580
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:11,795
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1581
02:09:12,379 --> 02:09:15,382
Pervaporation cells activated.

1582
02:09:24,850 --> 02:09:25,851
What's wrong?

1583
02:09:26,643 --> 02:09:27,895
You need a glass of water?

1584
02:09:31,857 --> 02:09:32,941
Yo, we got him.

1585
02:09:33,025 --> 02:09:34,735
- Good!
- Namor has been captured.

1586
02:09:35,027 --> 02:09:36,195
Retreat back!

1587
02:09:41,158 --> 02:09:42,576
Back to Wakanda!

1588
02:09:48,373 --> 02:09:49,374
Move out!

1589
02:10:14,441 --> 02:10:15,609
What is going on?

1590
02:10:16,443 --> 02:10:18,320
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1591
02:10:40,509 --> 02:10:42,010
That can't be good.

1592
02:11:14,084 --> 02:11:16,253
Panther, the Sea Leopard has lost power...

1593
02:11:16,462 --> 02:11:18,422
and they are experiencing
significant casualties.

1594
02:11:20,007 --> 02:11:20,966
Okoye.

1595
02:11:21,175 --> 02:11:22,468
Panther.

1596
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:24,636
Aneka.

1597
02:11:25,888 --> 02:11:26,889
Okoye.

1598
02:11:27,055 --> 02:11:28,307
It is time.

1599
02:11:39,151 --> 02:11:40,194
For Wakanda!

1600
02:11:40,986 --> 02:11:42,196
Wakanda!

1601
02:11:50,537 --> 02:11:52,206
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1602
02:11:52,331 --> 02:11:54,583
Catastrophic. His spear is
made of raw vibranium.

1603
02:11:54,708 --> 02:11:57,169
- The ship could explode at any second.
- Get us to the desert.

1604
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:16,980
No!

1605
02:12:45,634 --> 02:12:47,136
Sink the ship!

1606
02:13:14,747 --> 02:13:15,748
I got you, sis.

1607
02:13:15,914 --> 02:13:16,915
Hold on.

1608
02:14:21,146 --> 02:14:22,564
Warrior!

1609
02:14:25,984 --> 02:14:28,278
You speak the mother tongue?

1610
02:14:28,612 --> 02:14:30,989
You can greet your ancestors with it...

1611
02:15:01,061 --> 02:15:02,354
Get off me!

1612
02:15:14,283 --> 02:15:15,576
All right, come here.

1613
02:15:18,871 --> 02:15:22,249
You will greet your ancestors.

1614
02:15:46,231 --> 02:15:47,775
May the ancestors save us...

1615
02:15:48,025 --> 02:15:49,526
if the princess does not hurry.

1616
02:15:49,693 --> 02:15:51,487
We may be going to join them.

1617
02:15:52,362 --> 02:15:53,447
If so, hey...

1618
02:15:53,572 --> 02:15:55,783
let us take as many of them with us
as we can.

1619
02:16:25,896 --> 02:16:27,314
It could've been different.

1620
02:16:32,027 --> 02:16:33,404
I need water.

1621
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:52,297
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1622
02:16:52,506 --> 02:16:53,882
or take care of business...

1623
02:16:53,966 --> 02:16:55,008
like me?

1624
02:16:55,175 --> 02:16:56,802
I'm not my brother.

1625
02:16:58,178 --> 02:17:00,264
Namor will beg me for mercy...

1626
02:17:00,889 --> 02:17:03,392
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1627
02:17:42,264 --> 02:17:44,725
Imperius Rex.

1628
02:17:47,352 --> 02:17:48,520
Wakanda forever!

1629
02:19:37,254 --> 02:19:38,756
Shuri.

1630
02:19:40,257 --> 02:19:41,258
Mama.

1631
02:19:44,178 --> 02:19:45,554
Show him...

1632
02:19:45,929 --> 02:19:47,389
who you are.

1633
02:19:54,354 --> 02:19:55,355
Yield...

1634
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,776
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1635
02:19:58,942 --> 02:20:01,278
We will protect your secrets.

1636
02:20:01,487 --> 02:20:02,488
Yield...

1637
02:20:03,739 --> 02:20:05,407
and your people will live.

1638
02:20:09,453 --> 02:20:11,830
Vengeance has consumed us.

1639
02:20:12,164 --> 02:20:14,917
We cannot let it consume our people.

1640
02:20:23,634 --> 02:20:25,469
I yield.

1641
02:20:50,452 --> 02:20:52,663
Talokanile'ex!

1642
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,958
Let us return home.

1643
02:20:56,625 --> 02:20:58,001
Our fight here is done.

1644
02:21:10,889 --> 02:21:12,724
Wakanda forever!

1645
02:21:13,267 --> 02:21:14,768
Wakanda forever!

1646
02:21:59,188 --> 02:22:00,647
Thank you, my love.

1647
02:22:24,546 --> 02:22:25,631
Yo.

1648
02:22:30,177 --> 02:22:31,345
All set to head home?

1649
02:22:31,512 --> 02:22:33,972
As long as you're sure the police
won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1650
02:22:34,181 --> 02:22:35,849
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1651
02:22:36,016 --> 02:22:39,603
But you might want to slow down
on your homework-for-hire business.

1652
02:22:39,812 --> 02:22:42,147
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1653
02:22:43,315 --> 02:22:45,275
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1654
02:22:45,401 --> 02:22:46,402
Yes.

1655
02:22:46,652 --> 02:22:49,863
Your suit.
It's a great design...

1656
02:22:50,531 --> 02:22:51,657
but can't let you leave with it.

1657
02:22:51,824 --> 02:22:53,033
It's all good.

1658
02:22:53,242 --> 02:22:56,161
Figured the least I could do
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1659
02:22:57,496 --> 02:22:58,914
I have one more thing to show you.

1660
02:22:59,373 --> 02:23:00,374
Come.

1661
02:23:04,378 --> 02:23:07,464
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river...

1662
02:23:07,631 --> 02:23:09,049
but it was worth it.

1663
02:23:09,675 --> 02:23:10,676
How did you...

1664
02:23:12,052 --> 02:23:13,512
It's my dad's car.

1665
02:23:14,805 --> 02:23:16,557
We used to work on it before...

1666
02:23:22,521 --> 02:23:24,356
- You sure this is her?
- Every part.

1667
02:23:24,565 --> 02:23:26,024
Have it shipped to Boston.

1668
02:23:26,108 --> 02:23:27,401
Be there before you arrive.

1669
02:23:33,115 --> 02:23:34,116
Bring it in, man.

1670
02:23:37,536 --> 02:23:41,832
Panther, Miss Williams' transport
has arrived.

1671
02:23:42,583 --> 02:23:44,001
Look after yourself.

1672
02:23:44,418 --> 02:23:46,837
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1673
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:48,005
Catch a Bulls game?

1674
02:23:49,256 --> 02:23:53,802
Sounds fun, but I have something
I need to take care of.

1675
02:24:18,452 --> 02:24:21,038
And now I present to you...

1676
02:24:21,163 --> 02:24:22,331
Princess Shuri...

1677
02:24:22,414 --> 02:24:23,749
the Black Panther!

1678
02:24:42,184 --> 02:24:45,104
The Black Panther sends her regards...

1679
02:24:45,896 --> 02:24:47,856
but she will not be joining us today.

1680
02:24:49,024 --> 02:24:50,943
I, M'Baku...

1681
02:24:51,151 --> 02:24:53,612
leader of the Jabari Tribe...

1682
02:24:53,779 --> 02:24:55,364
son of Wakanda...

1683
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,617
wish to challenge...

1684
02:24:59,701 --> 02:25:00,786
for the throne.

1685
02:25:06,458 --> 02:25:08,168
What is troubling you, my child?

1686
02:25:10,045 --> 02:25:17,010
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

1687
02:25:17,970 --> 02:25:23,058
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

1688
02:25:23,475 --> 02:25:28,230
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

1689
02:25:29,064 --> 02:25:32,192
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

1690
02:25:34,111 --> 02:25:38,532
The Black Panther is
the most powerful person

1691
02:25:38,907 --> 02:25:44,705
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

1692
02:25:44,872 --> 02:25:47,875
But she has no allies.

1693
02:25:48,292 --> 02:25:52,921
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

1694
02:25:54,757 --> 02:25:56,842
With this alliance...

1695
02:25:57,509 --> 02:26:04,558
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1696
02:26:04,975 --> 02:26:08,812
The surface world will come for Wakanda

1697
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:12,608
and Wakanda will turn to us.

1698
02:26:14,234 --> 02:26:15,903
Trust me.

1699
02:26:32,628 --> 02:26:33,796
What the hell is this?

1700
02:26:34,004 --> 02:26:35,214
Can we turn around?

1701
02:26:36,882 --> 02:26:38,842
I don't know, man. We'll lose an hour.

1702
02:26:40,219 --> 02:26:41,678
Why don't you go check it out?

1703
02:26:41,804 --> 02:26:43,013
Okay.

1704
02:26:45,849 --> 02:26:47,142
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1705
02:26:47,518 --> 02:26:49,520
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1706
02:26:49,686 --> 02:26:51,480
How do you want us to proceed?

1707
02:26:51,939 --> 02:26:52,940
What the...

1708
02:27:04,993 --> 02:27:07,246
A colonizer in chains.

1709
02:27:07,996 --> 02:27:10,082
Now I have seen everything.

1710
02:27:10,249 --> 02:27:11,250
Funny.

1711
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,043
Let's go.

1712
02:27:39,778 --> 02:27:40,779
Thank you.

1713
02:27:40,863 --> 02:27:41,864
You're welcome.

1714
02:27:46,827 --> 02:27:47,828
Hey.

1715
02:27:49,163 --> 02:27:50,789
Welcome!

1716
02:27:52,583 --> 02:27:54,001
It's good to see you.

1717
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:55,961
Everything is ready.

1718
02:27:56,128 --> 02:27:57,463
Just give me one moment, eh?

1719
02:27:57,629 --> 02:27:59,006
Actually...

1720
02:27:59,173 --> 02:28:01,008
I think I should do it on my own.

1721
02:28:02,259 --> 02:28:03,594
Of course.

1722
02:32:38,660 --> 02:32:39,661
Shuri...

1723
02:32:40,913 --> 02:32:42,706
can we join you now?

1724
02:32:45,793 --> 02:32:48,837
This is my son, Toussaint.

1725
02:32:50,005 --> 02:32:51,006
Toussaint...

1726
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:54,718
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1727
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:57,221
Hi.

1728
02:33:18,158 --> 02:33:20,744
We agreed it was better for him
to grow up here.

1729
02:33:20,994 --> 02:33:24,081
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1730
02:33:25,457 --> 02:33:26,667
Your father...

1731
02:33:27,292 --> 02:33:29,002
your baba...

1732
02:33:29,169 --> 02:33:31,880
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1733
02:33:36,468 --> 02:33:38,512
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral...

1734
02:33:39,346 --> 02:33:42,307
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1735
02:33:43,058 --> 02:33:45,769
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1736
02:33:47,563 --> 02:33:49,148
Did my mother meet him?

1737
02:33:49,231 --> 02:33:50,232
She did.

1738
02:33:59,867 --> 02:34:00,909
It's nice to meet you.

1739
02:34:01,118 --> 02:34:02,327
Nice to meet you.

1740
02:34:02,453 --> 02:34:04,079
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1741
02:34:04,496 --> 02:34:06,665
It holds a great history.

1742
02:34:06,874 --> 02:34:10,169
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1743
02:34:13,464 --> 02:34:15,549
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1744
02:34:15,632 --> 02:34:16,717
Is that true?

1745
02:34:17,885 --> 02:34:20,763
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1746
02:34:23,766 --> 02:34:26,101
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1747
02:34:29,062 --> 02:34:30,230
Who are you?

1748
02:34:31,148 --> 02:34:35,360
My name is Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.
