1
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,135
<i>If you're reading this letter...</i>

2
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,276
<i>...it's because I've been committed</i>
<i>to an insane asylum.</i>

3
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,496
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

4
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,607
<i>I just don't know what else to do.</i>

5
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,409
<i>My sister's mentally ill.</i>

6
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,475
<i>She has been</i>
<i>since our mother died.</i>

7
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,182
Lily.

8
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,128
No. No. No.
Fuck! Somebody help me!

9
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,758
l'm calling about Lily Romero.

10
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,672
Look, like l told you,
we had her released to home care...

11
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,311
...under our family doctor.

12
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,915
You know, you're supposed to be
taking these things.

13
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,608
She's my sister.
l have a right to see her.

14
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,914
Fuck!

15
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,162
<i>But now our worst nightmare</i>
<i>has come true.</i>

16
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,664
<i>Lily's been committed</i>
<i>to a mental institution.</i>

17
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,802
<i>She's become a ward of the state.</i>

18
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,234
<i>The doctors can do</i>
<i>whatever they want to her.</i>

19
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,305
<i>This letter's my insurance policy.</i>

20
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,508
<i>The only way I can save her</i>
<i>is to get her out.</i>

21
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,015
No. No.

22
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:17,020
<i>And the only way to get her out</i>
<i>is to become one of them myself.</i>

23
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,100
-Fuck.
-Don't touch me.

24
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,760
The monsters.
Monster of the anti-matter.

25
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,032
Don't touch me!
Don't fucking touch me!

26
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,535
You think you have all the answers.

27
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,683
-No, no, no!
-lmmediate medical response.

28
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,186
You can't touch me!

29
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,526
Calm down. Hey!
Hey, hey.

30
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,064
Look at them. Look at them.
l'm not the destroyer.

31
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,273
Easy. Easy.

32
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,676
l'm falling down.

33
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,244
You're gonna be okay.

34
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,883
Come on, guys.

35
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,214
We need to immobilize his legs.

36
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,815
Hang on, it takes a few seconds.

37
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,323
Bastard clocked me.

38
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,229
Take him up to Med-Psych.
They'll know what to do with him.

39
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,362
Gotta clean your ass too.

40
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,366
Couldn't wait till after my shift
to freak the fuck out?

41
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,630
Goddamn.
You smell like shit.

42
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,774
You shit yourself?

43
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,037
Hello there. l'm Dr. Gianetti.

44
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,492
Can you tell me what happened?

45
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,456
Do you have a name?

46
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,898
<i>Jack be nimble, Jack be quick</i>
<i>Jack jump over the candlestick</i>

47
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,532
Jack.

48
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,063
Good.

49
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,143
Let's call you Jack from now on,
shall we?

50
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,574
Can you get Charles in here?

51
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,547
We're not gonna get much more
until these sedatives wear off.

52
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,583
l'm gonna take care of you.

53
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,778
Help you.

54
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,696
He stole my instructions.

55
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,701
This place gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

56
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,565
Just breathe.

57
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,426
Gotta wear your seatbelt tonight.

58
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,367
You got celebrity neighbors.

59
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,464
You see that dude?

60
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,434
Mark Gibbon Hawthorne.

61
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,006
That's the guy who choked
all those girls in Oregon.

62
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,706
Kept their corpses
in this greenhouse.

63
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,472
Fucked them for weeks
after they were dead.

64
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,482
Buried them right on the spot.

65
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,191
Sweet dreams, Tinker Bell.

66
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,822
Oh, hell, no.

67
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,728
Not on my shift.

68
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,598
His hand!

69
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,339
Fucking son of a bitch.
You bite your lip to trick me in there.

70
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,508
You know he's gonna fry your ass
when he hears about it.

71
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,347
Why are you telling me that?
l don't know.

72
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,685
-You shut up.
-l forgot.

73
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,724
Hey. You.

74
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,289
l saw what you did.

75
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,900
You told him.

76
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,502
Do you know how long
l've been in here?

77
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,530
There's no smell in here.
Did you notice?

78
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,406
l was gonna go outside.

79
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,876
To where things grow.

80
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,072
To the sunshine.

81
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,685
But you ruined that.

82
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,246
You told him.

83
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,092
-l didn't do anything.
-You told him.

84
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,095
-You told him!
-Just leave me alone!

85
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,829
Shut up!

86
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,606
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

87
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,575
Shut up!

88
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,179
Shut up!

89
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,182
Jack.

90
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,289
Jack.

91
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,327
Hello, Jack.

92
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,228
Can you hear me?
He's in shock. Let's get him up.

93
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,939
Judging by the angle of incision,
these cuts were self-inflicted.

94
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,511
ls that true, Jack?

95
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,450
That you did this to yourself?

96
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,491
l don't know. l don't remember.

97
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,596
Don't remember
or you don't wanna remember?

98
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,293
l don't know. l'm not this mystery--
You're the destroyer.

99
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,628
l'm anti-matter.

100
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,396
Better keep an eye on him.

101
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,404
There's more to this case
than simple schizophrenia.

102
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,239
Put him on psych ward.

103
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,940
l'll check him out
after l've done my rounds.

104
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,368
l'm sorry, l just wanted to touch him.

105
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,097
Just wanted to smell his skin.

106
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,400
l understand, Mr. Hawthorne.

107
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,009
lt's your instinct.

108
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,176
The Orpheum brings your feelings
up to the surface...

109
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,342
...so l can see them better.
So l can make you well.

110
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,323
Home sweet home.

111
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,437
This is Jack.
Cops picked him up yesterday.

112
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,231
He's being placed
under observation.

113
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,604
There's not a lot here.
What am l supposed to do with him?

114
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,212
Starting him on Zyprexa,
Haldol, possibly Orpheum...

115
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,315
...pending Dr. Gianetti's
final diagnosis.

116
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,814
-So that mean we're cool?
-Sure.

117
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,586
Always room for one more.

118
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,121
Great.

119
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,528
Nice to meet you, Jack.

120
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,027
l'm Nancy.

121
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,188
Don't worry about
all that treatment stuff.

122
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,833
Let's get you settled in, okay?

123
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,936
Hang out for a sec
and l'll give you the grand tour.

124
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,689
-l'm sorry, l--
-Hi.

125
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,423
l'm Heather.

126
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,627
You're new here, right?
They don't let us use scissors...

127
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,330
...but l'm getting pretty good
with my fingers.

128
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,906
See.

129
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,506
He was touching me.

130
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,873
-What?
-You saw him.

131
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,742
-No!
-Stay in your seat.

132
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,577
-He raped me.
-l didn't do anything.

133
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,584
He was gonna stick his thing
inside of me. lnside my vagina.

134
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,880
-Shelly.
-My vagina.

135
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,081
Want me to call Dr. Gianetti?
Do you wanna go back upstairs?

136
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,192
Then sit!

137
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,687
Okay, l shouldn't have left you alone,
all right?

138
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,560
lt's best to give everyone
space until you learn the ropes.

139
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,463
-l didn't do anything.
-l know. l know.

140
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,999
<i>All patient rooms are here</i>
<i>in the West Building.</i>

141
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,007
The day room and commissary are
both coed, same with the courtyard.

142
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,408
Nurse Henderson dispenses
patient medication every morning.

143
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,176
ln the afternoons we have
group-therapy session which--

144
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,715
You don't understand!

145
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,414
Somebody do something!
He's choking her!

146
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,753
He's hurting my fucking brain!

147
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,229
Hit that if you want her to live.

148
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,632
-Don't you fucking touch that!
-l can't let you kill her.

149
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,365
They're the ones killing us!

150
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,711
You got three seconds. One, two--

151
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,247
That's enough.

152
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,275
Let her go.

153
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,682
You said no more.

154
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,291
l don't want it.

155
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,428
Who's in charge here, Mr. Loomis?

156
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,291
You or your anger?

157
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,138
l'm proud of you.

158
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,416
Put him upstairs.

159
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,149
For the rest of you,
back to your rooms!

160
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,515
We're on lockdown.

161
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,490
-All right, what happened?
-l dropped my responder.

162
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,163
Jack sounded the alarm.

163
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,896
Jack.

164
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,511
lt's closest to the window.

165
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,448
l'm feeling really tired.

166
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,352
Just rest, okay?
l'll check on you later.

167
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,585
-Oh, no. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.
-What are you doing in here?

168
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,198
l wanted to see if you were
one of Gianetti's army ants, you know?

169
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,494
With the white, white, white--
You know.

170
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,761
Are you talking about Orpheum?
ls that what makes their eyes white?

171
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,775
Oh, there-- Look, there he goes.
There he goes. Crank up the toaster.

172
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,475
-What exactly is going on up there?
-l don't know. l'll tell you this, okay?

173
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,709
The ones that are going up there
are coming back different.

174
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,583
Fucked up. l know l'm fucked up.
No, not like that.

175
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,716
Look, see? You see that, right?

176
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,919
lt's probably something
straining the grid.

177
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,825
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

178
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,195
What--? How do you know so much
about the wiring in the building?

179
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,127
Just hear things.

180
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,110
-That's enough, Paul. You'll kill him.
-Hold on.

181
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,875
All right.

182
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,715
Cut the power.

183
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,654
-You could smell him burning.
-Oh, he was doing fine.

184
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:51,334
As you might know, l do have
experience with this kind of treatment.

185
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:57,169
Prep him for an additional 20 cc's
of Orpheum.

186
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,236
His levels are above 300 ppm.

187
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,678
l'm aware of his levels.

188
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,277
And what about the incidents
of violence?

189
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,617
We should slow down
and take an observational stance.

190
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,354
This is how Orpheum is designed.

191
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,397
To strip away layer after layer...

192
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,526
...of these
so-called higher brain functions...

193
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,296
...where sickness hides.

194
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,536
We gotta get to the core.
We gotta get to the lizard's brain.

195
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:40,275
And when we do, only then
can l re-introduce healthier behaviors.

196
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,479
lt's also that core
that makes us dangerous.

197
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,922
Don't push me.

198
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,498
-That's my game.
-Laura, no.

199
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,608
l don't want to see any histrionics
or tantrums.

200
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,303
You're to sit here quietly
like everybody else, all right?

201
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,675
Or this will be
your last time down here.

202
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,564
At least l know you're still alive.

203
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,406
What are you doing here?
l thought they said no visitors.

204
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,945
l'm not visiting.

205
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:25,488
lf you came here to be a hero, forget it.
l don't wanna be saved.

206
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,788
We promised to take care
of each other, remember?

207
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,485
-You and me.
-That was before.

208
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,222
-Before what?
-Before l stopped wanting to live.

209
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:38,495
l am sick, Jack, just like Mom,
and l am never going to get better.

210
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,869
l tried to kill myself
so you could be free from all of this.

211
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,838
-l did this for you.
-What was l supposed to do?

212
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,069
Just let them cut you open?

213
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,737
-They don't do that stuff anymore.
-Bullshit!

214
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,113
They're giving everyone in here
some kind of experimental drug.

215
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,091
And what are you
gonna do about it, Jack?

216
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,660
You're a patient now, just like us.

217
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,227
Okay, just tell me
where they're keeping you.

218
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,631
-l'm gonna find a way to get us out.
-No one gets out of these places.

219
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:16,069
lf you can't behave, you won't
be allowed down here, period.

220
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,880
You know what? Honestly,
l don't care what you do with me.

221
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,811
Why won't you let me
just fucking die?

222
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,415
l can walk.

223
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,292
Fuck.

224
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:57,214
l saw you talking to that girl.
She knows you, doesn't she?

225
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,577
-Get away from me.
-No, get away from her.

226
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,811
Listen, come to my room tonight.

227
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,081
Turn out the lights
so you don't see my face.

228
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,691
Look, l don't want to, okay?

229
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,918
Who is she, Jack?

230
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,291
Are you fucking her? Are you?

231
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,371
You better watch it.

232
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,668
They're using Heather
to see if you're a good receptor.

233
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,401
Receptor for what?

234
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:30,605
DNA hybrids, l--
Goddamn it, l shouldn't talk here.

235
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,775
They've got devices everywhere.

236
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,418
Even in the food.

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,161
lf anyone heard that,
l have bad DNA.

238
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,528
-Not good for hybridization.
-Very funny.

239
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:55,462
You know what? They laugh.
Everyone out there laughed.

240
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,475
But guess what, in here,
at least l can have my thoughts, okay?

241
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,273
Without all the looks.

242
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,081
Don't put that here.

243
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,589
-Enjoy the grub?
-l couldn't go last night.

244
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,086
She-- Henderson was working late.

245
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,994
l don't give a shit
what that bitch was doing.

246
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,259
We had a deal.

247
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,628
Get the fucking pills...

248
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,178
...or l file a report
and you go for a long walk upstairs.

249
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,941
No, no, no. l'll go tonight.

250
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,577
Good doggie.

251
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,587
What the fuck are you looking at,
retard?

252
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,086
No-- No-- Nothing.

253
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,415
Thought so.

254
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,996
What was that all about?
You're stealing pills for that asshole?

255
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,335
You better fucking keep that
to yourself.

256
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,602
Guess what. l see how you turn
your crazy on and off.

257
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,013
Guess we both have a secret now.

258
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,680
Pick that up.

259
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,312
l thought you forgot about me.

260
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:47,714
You don't wanna do that, Charles.
l'll tell them about us.

261
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,754
About what you've been doing
to me.

262
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,194
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

263
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:15,107
Turn your face.
That thing makes me sick.

264
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,645
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

265
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,083
l'm sorry.

266
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,022
Punctuality is a sign of respect.

267
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,659
We can't let one person
break the rules.

268
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,886
That wouldn't be fair, would it?

269
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,756
l am postponing your privileges
until you learn to observe regulations.

270
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,167
l cut my finger.

271
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,404
l think you'll live.

272
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,806
We were talking about families
and relationships...

273
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,245
...and since you decided
to keep us all waiting...

274
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,408
...why don't you start
the discussion?

275
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,882
No, no, no. l can't.
Not today, please.

276
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,459
Just make something up.
No one really gives a shit.

277
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:41,759
Heather, everyone participates.
That's how this works.

278
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,300
Why don't you begin by telling us
about your mother, Jack?

279
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,564
My mother--

280
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,803
She was sick a lot.

281
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:00,447
They said she had these things
in her brain...

282
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:08,419
...like tiny little scars,
and they tried to take them out.

283
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,652
You're doing very good, Jack.
Continue.

284
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:16,560
They kept operating on her,
cutting her open.

285
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,299
And my sister,
she couldn't go to the hospital.

286
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,270
She was too afraid of the doctors.

287
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,711
But my mother,
she was gone by then anyway.

288
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,454
She was a fucking vegetable.

289
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,747
They killed her.

290
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:45,157
Mr. Loomis, everyone stays
in their seats during group.

291
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,069
Back in your seats!

292
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,868
Back in your seats!

293
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,847
Back in your seats!
Back in your seats!

294
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,146
Back in your seats!
Back in your seats!

295
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,293
-This is enough.
-Don't do that. Don't--

296
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,797
We've got a situation in group.
Get your asses down here now.

297
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,272
Get him off my arm!

298
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,299
Get him out of here.

299
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,036
Everybody, back to your rooms.
Back to your rooms.

300
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,203
We're on lockdown
for the rest of the day.

301
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,792
lt was the blood.

302
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,556
They wanted the blood.

303
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:57,225
l told you, they're changing.
White, white, white.

304
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:02,601
Look-- Meet me in my room.
l need to tell you something.

305
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,016
This is crazy. You committed yourself
so you could break out?

306
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,243
l didn't do it for me, l did it for Lily.

307
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,719
That means you're not crazy, but you
must be to come up with that plan...

308
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,914
...because it's crazy.

309
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,822
Lily is all l have, okay?
They wouldn't let me talk to her.

310
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,096
l had to know if she was alive.

311
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,425
Wait, you said
that she tried to kill herself.

312
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,534
That means
that she's on suicide watch.

313
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,329
That's solitary for three months.

314
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,439
l'm gonna tell Gianetti the truth.
Show him the letter.

315
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,075
Once he sees why l did this,
he'll have to let me out.

316
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,710
You're better off in here, Jack.

317
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
Once you learn your way around,
it's not so bad.

318
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,447
l'm telling you, you go outside,
it's people outside, the--

319
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,279
You know, come on,
they don't understand.

320
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,387
-l'll make them understand.
-Jack.

321
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,519
Jack.

322
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,828
Jack, we're on lockdown.
You can't be walking around like this.

323
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,600
-l need to talk to Dr. Gianetti.
-Absolutely not, he is furious--

324
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,499
Look, Nancy, you owe me one.

325
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,137
Please.

326
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,570
This is a bad idea.

327
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,877
-Hello, Jack.
-So you found it?

328
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,858
Under the photo
on your sister's desk.

329
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,151
So you read it.

330
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,897
Why are you looking at me
like that?

331
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,431
Why don't you read it for us, Jack?

332
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,179
-What is this?
-Oh, it's the letter, Jack.

333
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,249
Right where you said it would be.

334
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,015
This is a trick. You did this.

335
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,214
-ls that your handwriting?
-Yes, it's my handwriting.

336
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,383
But l know what l wrote.
l'm not crazy.

337
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,327
You had a wonderful breakthrough
in group today.

338
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,467
l think we should focus
on the progress that you're making.

339
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,535
The progress l'm making?

340
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,763
What are you talking about? Okay?
This is all an act.

341
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,501
So now you're telling me the truth
or what?

342
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,636
Yes. Yes, l'm telling you the truth.
l've told you a thousand times.

343
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,407
Jack...

344
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:30,543
...one day you say one thing,
the next day, something else.

345
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,890
Remember the first time
you got here?

346
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,891
You could barely remember
your own name.

347
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,229
lt seems to me
that it's quite obvious...

348
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,496
...that your stay here with us
has been beneficial.

349
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,436
-What do you think?
-No.

350
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,067
No. Okay?

351
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,340
Look...

352
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,841
...l'm making all this stuff up...

353
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,412
...to get to Lily.

354
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,448
To help her, okay?
But l see now that l was wrong.

355
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:14,222
Okay, look, l'm sorry. All right?

356
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,367
l made a mistake.

357
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,606
You saw them today.

358
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,676
l'm not like that.
l don't belong in here.

359
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,876
This isn't about the other patients,
Jack. This is about you.

360
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,280
No, we're not talking about me, okay?
l'm not crazy.

361
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,853
-Put him on maximum now.
-No.

362
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,048
No, no, no, you can't do this, okay?
You can't do this.

363
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,626
l'm not crazy. l'm not fucking crazy!

364
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,128
Get him out of here.

365
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,032
No! No!

366
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,597
Charles.

367
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,203
-Come on, you gotta help me, man.
-Shut up!

368
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,679
l'm not like them.

369
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,878
l'm not like them.
l don't belong in here.

370
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,420
Look. Look at me.

371
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,216
You know how long it's been
since l've touched a woman's hand?

372
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,830
Since l smelled a woman's skin?

373
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,462
You ruined that for me, Jack.

374
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,604
l'm gonna make you pay, Jack.

375
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,512
l didn't do anything to you.
Just shut the fuck up!

376
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,241
Leave me the fuck alone!

377
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,214
The bad-leg syndrome.

378
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:57,594
You and all this pent-up power....

379
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,867
Please, l'm sorry.

380
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,173
You were right, l--

381
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:12,282
l have problems.
l know that l need help.

382
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,643
Just don't leave me up here.

383
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,185
That's very good, Jack...

384
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,920
...because now we can focus
on your recovery.

385
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,623
Okay.

386
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,061
-Thank you.
-Oh, you're welcome.

387
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,325
l wanna get better.

388
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,991
Good.

389
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,735
So put him back on psych.

390
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,303
Let's go, buddy.

391
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,747
Gianetti's a fucking liar.

392
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,250
He never plans
on letting any of us out of here.

393
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,082
Of course he doesn't,
we're the receptacles.

394
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,453
You don't wanna poison
the normal people, right?

395
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,923
Oil and water.

396
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,624
Hey!

397
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,998
What about the pill thing?

398
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,502
You know the security system.

399
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,504
How do you move around
after lights out?

400
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,869
No, l don't rock the boat.

401
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,479
-That's how l survive.
-Dave, look around.

402
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,278
How much longer
until they come for us?

403
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,907
No. No. That's bad. That's trouble.

404
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,987
Dave, Dave, please.

405
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:30,958
-l can't do this without your help.
-Lights out, people. Shake a leg.

406
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,142
Jesus.

407
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,752
Would you stop doing that?

408
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,650
l'll show you how to move around...

409
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,724
...but l'm not going with you.
l'm not going up there.

410
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,258
All right.

411
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:07,030
Stick close, Charles is on rounds.

412
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,724
lt's a low-tech operation.

413
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,674
ln the drawer under the ledger,
there's a security card.

414
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,618
Don't mess anything up.
Henderson's like a fucking hawk.

415
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:09,783
Dave.

416
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,125
Oh, shit, he doubled back.

417
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,321
Don't wait up.

418
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,430
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,868
Yeah, l like that one.

420
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,270
Now what you doing?

421
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,916
Oh, yeah?

422
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,850
l got it. l got you. l got it.

423
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,721
Lil. Lil, is that you?

424
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,490
Lily, it's me, Jack.

425
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,269
l thought l'd never see you again.

426
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,877
l'm sorry. l'm sorry
about those things that l said.

427
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,605
lt's okay. lt's okay.
l'm gonna get us out of here.

428
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,373
Just like l promised.

429
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,347
Jack, l'm scared.

430
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,418
l can-- l can hear them at night.

431
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:20,114
They do these experiments
on them with drugs...

432
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,486
...and you were right.

433
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,790
Someone's coming.
We gotta get the key.

434
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,827
-l'll come back for you.
-No, Jack. Jack.

435
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,830
-l'll come back.
-Jack, don't leave me.

436
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,457
Jack!

437
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,713
Jack. Jack.

438
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,246
Let me out! Come on, Jack.

439
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,582
lt's acting like a virus.

440
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,694
His levels have doubled
without any injections.

441
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,494
That's impossible.

442
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,194
The drug is replicating itself.

443
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:52,274
Orpheum is not a drug!

444
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,944
Orpheum is a microscopic machine...

445
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:00,413
...doing exactly
what l programmed it to do.

446
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:07,049
You see, this is nanotechnology,
not biochemistry.

447
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,357
The data indicates a mutation.

448
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,792
The compound could be
transmittable, Paul.

449
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,555
Do you understand
what that means?

450
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:21,228
l've been saving people
all my goddamn life.

451
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:27,173
-What is that? Orpheum?
-No, no, no.

452
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,841
Something to help me think.

453
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,656
Then do me too.

454
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:09,074
lf Orpheum has mutated...

455
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,881
...it's doing so...

456
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,487
...so it can survive.

457
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,331
lt's evolving, and we....

458
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,197
We have to stay ahead of it,
don't we? We have to stay ahead.

459
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:46,154
Yes. We have to be in control.

460
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:55,125
We have to be in control.

461
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,202
Shut up! Shut up!

462
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,378
Fucking pig.

463
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,512
Keep up the good work.

464
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,649
We're doing this for our patients,
not for ourselves...

465
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:28,662
...and the faster we can locate
the mutation, the better.

466
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:52,017
Wait, Paul. We need to discuss
the team's schedule.

467
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:31,056
-Bitch. Bitch, fucking bitch!
-You look like shit, Jack.

468
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,994
Staying up late at night, huh?

469
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,524
-What's her name?
-Don't fucking touch me.

470
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,260
ls there a problem?

471
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,066
-No. No, no problem.
-Then open up.

472
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,247
Jack.

473
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,152
What happened to you?
l thought they caught you.

474
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,489
Gotta show you something.

475
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:07,193
Orpheum from Gianetti's lab.

476
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,197
These people are more fucked up
than we could even imagine.

477
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,693
When l get out of here,
l'm gonna take them down.

478
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,363
-You went into his lab?
-Jack?

479
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,532
Let me see your hand, please.

480
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,278
Get some fresh air.

481
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,784
lt looks like you could use it.

482
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,120
Come on.

483
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,816
Hello, Mr. Manetti,
how are you today?

484
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,491
l need a set of keys.

485
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,098
They're keeping Lily
in one of the cells in solitary.

486
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,394
Anything else?
How about a fucking spaceship...

487
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,094
...to come down,
take us away like Karen Carpenter.

488
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,799
Look. Just get the keys from Charles.
He wears them on his belt.

489
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,842
No way. You can't
fucking mess with these people, Jack.

490
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,742
They'll take you upstairs
and you're not gonna come back.

491
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,177
You don't get it, do you?

492
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,681
All those thoughts
rattling around in your head?

493
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,686
They're nothing compared to what's
going on. Right, we're fucking lab rats.

494
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,223
Look, l'm getting out of here tonight
and l'm taking Lily with me.

495
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,623
You do whatever the hell you want.

496
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,022
Hi, Jack.
Look who l found under the bush--

497
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,997
-Get the fuck away from us.
-No, Jack!

498
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,693
l'm trying to show you something.

499
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,198
They're all warm inside.

500
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:29,375
Under the--
The fur and all the skin and the meat...

501
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,413
...they're all warm.

502
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,607
Look.

503
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,513
Oh, shit!

504
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,017
Holy fuck!

505
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,381
-What the fuck?
-Get the fuck out of here!

506
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,721
You wanna know something else?
You're warm inside too.

507
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,128
Run, damn it! Get out!

508
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,665
Come on, hurry!

509
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,274
They're gonna kill him!

510
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,250
Help!

511
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,586
Throw us the key! Hurry!

512
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,850
They told me to eat your face.

513
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,490
-Hey!
-Get him off of me!

514
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,160
Help! Help!

515
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,060
Just do it!

516
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,728
Hey!

517
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,669
Jack.

518
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,106
<i>Jack.</i>

519
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,918
<i>You can never leave.</i>

520
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,984
<i>You belong here.</i>

521
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,959
<i>With Mommy.</i>

522
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,530
-Where is she? Where's Lily?
-Jack, you need to calm down.

523
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,101
The reason
you're not in max...

524
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,794
...is l stuck my neck out
for you.

525
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,236
l'm not the problem here!

526
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,641
l wanna see my sister
right fucking now! Where is she?

527
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,645
Lily is upstairs.
She's with Dr. Gianetti.

528
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,615
You see this? l saw the light.

529
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,778
Okay?
l know what he's doing up there.

530
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,517
Dr. Gianetti is one of the greatest
minds of our generation.

531
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:27,187
Your sister is very fortunate
to have him caring for her.

532
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,497
You're changing.
Just like the rest of them.

533
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,636
l was exposed
to the Orpheum compound...

534
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,567
...when Mr. Loomis bit me.

535
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,264
The crystallization in my eyes
is normal.

536
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,808
Nothing in this place is normal.

537
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,141
l won't be bullied
by your paranoid delusions.

538
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,975
Paranoid delusions?

539
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,141
Someone tried to eat
my fucking face!

540
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,981
He could be giving her that shit
right now. We have to stop it.

541
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,216
-He's unstable, l want him upstairs.
-Wait. Okay, he's just upset.

542
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,486
l'll take him back to his room.
Jack, walk.

543
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,152
Lock the door, though.

544
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,766
We can't have one patient
disrupting the entire ward!

545
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,362
-l need to see my sister.
-l'm sorry.

546
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,561
But, Jack,
you have to stay in your room.

547
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,604
Just don't-- Don't lock me in here.

548
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,106
Nancy. Nancy, wait.

549
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,005
Nancy, please!

550
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,078
Goddamn it!

551
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,111
Dinnertime.

552
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,451
This food is dead!

553
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,686
We need something real.

554
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,833
l'll see if Gianetti
can whip up a steak.

555
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,766
-How do you like it?
-Alive.

556
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,379
l'm sorry. l thought you were someone
coming to take me upstairs.

557
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:05,221
Charles is sleeping for a long time.
l switched up his pills.

558
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,192
Thank you, Dave.

559
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,609
Please. Please. Please, help me.

560
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,302
-Please don't do this to me.
-There's nothing l can do.

561
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,971
l'm not the one in control.
He's made that very clear.

562
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,744
Mr. Loomis, wake up.
lt's time for dinner.

563
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,518
l'll do anything.
l'll take my meds, l swear.

564
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,749
Please, just don't give me that stuff,
please.

565
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,157
-Please!
-Would you shut up, please?

566
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,960
Mr. Loomis.

567
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,898
Mr. Loomis.

568
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,668
Mr. Loomis.

569
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,346
Let go of my arm.

570
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,119
Let go of my arm.

571
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,795
Let go!

572
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,374
Help! Help!

573
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,806
Help! Help!

574
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,315
Help! Help!

575
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,848
Help me!

576
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,926
Help me!

577
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,741
Just in case.

578
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,110
This is how you repay my loyalty.

579
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,022
lgnoring the safety procedures.

580
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:18,052
Putting the entire program at risk.

581
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:23,761
He ate my arm, you selfish prick.

582
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,199
Gianetti's lab's on the far side,
through maximum.

583
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,171
Selfish prick.

584
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,432
Selfish prick.

585
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,408
Do you have any idea,
the sacrifices l've made...

586
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,947
...for my patients?
l've given them my life.

587
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,711
My time. l've given them my mind!

588
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,294
Come on.

589
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,623
You're insane.

590
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,393
You're insane.

591
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:04,196
That never bothered you before,
right?

592
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,841
Let me see.

593
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,815
There's no way upstairs. Come on.

594
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,659
l don't want Orpheum.

595
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,032
lt's morphine. For the pain.

596
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,032
Better?

597
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,442
l saw Henderson's arm.

598
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,710
The infection is spreading.

599
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:56,291
Yes, we've already determined
the compound is transmittable.

600
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,292
l've taken every step to contain it.

601
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,694
What l do need now is time
to locate the mutation.

602
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,165
To find a way to suppress it.

603
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,405
-Hold still.
-lt's too late.

604
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,809
Nature wins.

605
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:19,711
Oh, nature always wins
in the long run...

606
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:24,980
...but science owns today.

607
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,755
You see, science requires sacrifice.

608
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,388
l'll do my best to honor yours.

609
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,570
Hey, Charles. Charles?

610
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,675
Charles, this is Dr. Gianetti.

611
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,183
We have two of my patients
running around in maximum security.

612
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,954
Charles, goddamn it.
Where the hell are you?

613
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,620
<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

614
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,363
Sorry, doc.
He's a little tied up right now.

615
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,434
l can help you.
We can work together.

616
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,570
You're never getting out of here.
Ever!

617
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,065
Nancy?

618
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,041
ls that you?

619
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,712
l came to take a look at your wound.
We need to redress the bandage.

620
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,084
No. Get away from me.

621
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:38,488
Turn your face.
That thing makes me sick.

622
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,826
l'm at the most critical phase
of my research...

623
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:47,993
...and l refuse to be distracted
by this kind of incompetence.

624
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,402
Bitch.

625
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,739
Something's shorting the system.

626
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:01,976
Here we come, Jack.
lt's our time now.

627
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,079
Anyone still out there
ready to perform their duties?

628
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,184
God, it's not working.

629
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,583
Hello?

630
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,756
-Do it! We're trapped!
-There's no power source.

631
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,108
Short it out with the Taser.

632
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,044
Now l'm gonna fucking kill you.

633
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,980
Come on, Dave, go!

634
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,544
-Come on!
-Use the Taser.

635
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,469
-David, give me the battery.
-What? No, no. We're dead without it--

636
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,275
-Just give me the fucking battery!
-All right, hold this.

637
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,645
lt needs an external power source.

638
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,590
-Jack.
-Go!

639
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,024
Dave!

640
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,834
Damn it!

641
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,966
We turned a corner here.

642
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,572
-Jack, is that you?
-Lily.

643
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,714
-Oh, God.
-Are you okay?

644
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,909
Her arm, he--
He was eating her arm.

645
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,678
Did Gianetti give you anything?

646
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,947
-No, no, he didn't have time to.
-Orpheum?

647
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:50,581
-But l think he's coming back.
-We're gonna get out of here.

648
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,854
What did you expect?

649
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,531
You took him for granted.

650
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:05,436
l learned to respect him
and overlook the indiscretions.

651
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,310
l'm sure that that's why
he still loves me...

652
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,915
...but you, you were greedy.

653
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,712
And look where all that greediness
got you, huh?

654
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,048
Okay, this looks--

655
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,357
No!

656
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,698
We should have enough juice
to jump the locks.

657
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:41,435
-Can use another battery for the Taser.
-How do you know it works?

658
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:47,776
-Fucking dick.
-That's it, Dave. Get angry.

659
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,746
Jack,
l am sorry l got you into all this.

660
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,321
No, it's okay.
All right, we take care of each other.

661
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,323
lt's all we have.

662
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,824
And none of us
deserve to be in here.

663
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,528
-No matter how fucked up we are.
-Okay.

664
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,325
Yeah, no, l'm ready.

665
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,194
-All right.
-l wanna live.

666
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,476
Let's go.

667
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,122
Down this way. There's a stairwell.

668
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,607
Where'd they all go?

669
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,913
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

670
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,737
Did they eat him?

671
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,413
Come on. Lily?

672
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:58,053
-Yeah.
-Come on.

673
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,381
Okay.

674
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:01,787
Yeah.

675
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,996
lt's a trap.

676
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,107
Buy me some time.
We gotta take the elevator.

677
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,344
Okay, yeah. l can do this. Come on.

678
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,347
Fuck you! Come on.

679
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,541
Come on.

680
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,916
l was hoping you'd come back.

681
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,920
Come on, l'm gonna break off a piece
of the crazy for you.

682
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,392
What the fuck?

683
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,399
Jack.

684
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,539
Jack, come on, dude. We gotta go.

685
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,041
l don't know what's wrong.
The wiring's different.

686
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,701
Get out of my way.

687
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,214
l think l got it.

688
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,916
-Help me.
-A special flower.

689
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,818
-Lily.
-Help. Help.

690
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,726
Get off of her!

691
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,498
-Help!
-Go down into the pit.

692
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,128
l got you.

693
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,106
No!

694
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:45,526
-Come on.
-Hold the elevator!

695
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,801
l was the one
who was supposed to escape.

696
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,873
You ruined that, Jack. You owe me.

697
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,267
Here's what l owe you.

698
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,484
Come here.

699
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,317
lt's okay.

700
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,385
We did it.

701
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,527
Okay?

702
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,305
Come on.

703
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,785
No one's coming down
this thing now.

704
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,320
Holy shit.

705
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,535
Where is everybody?

706
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,768
You stay here with Lily.

707
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,810
l'm gonna check
the rest of the ward.

708
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,691
Do it outside. Be quiet.

709
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:41,934
l've been waiting for you, Jack.
l wouldn't cheat on you, Jack.

710
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,635
You know that, don't you?

711
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,648
Why are you leaving?

712
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,014
Don't you think l'm pretty?

713
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,448
You're a fucking knockout.

714
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,384
All right, Jack. l forgive you.

715
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,156
We can work this out.
Can't you see that l fucking love you?

716
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,670
They're beyond crazy.
They're not even human anymore.

717
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,705
Get down.

718
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:23,117
l don't know how long this will hold.
Come on.

719
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,349
Nancy, it's us.

720
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,927
-lt's Jack.
-They're all killing each other.

721
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,792
We have to get out of the building.
lt's not just this ward.

722
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,627
lt's in maximum security too.

723
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,167
Building's programmed to seal
when power goes out.

724
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,999
-What about the windows?
-No. Reinforced glass and steel.

725
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,266
This place is designed
to keep people inside.

726
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,501
Well, can we go somewhere
that isn't here?

727
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,309
Service stairs are through the kitchen.
Behind the counter.

728
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,139
Jackpot.

729
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,199
l can work with this.

730
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,325
There's nobody there.

731
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,004
-They must be following us.
-Well, they found us now.

732
01:06:59,181 --> 01:06:59,248
Oh, shit.

733
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,579
Oh, shit.

734
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,548
We're fucking dead.

735
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,077
Jack!

736
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,393
Jack.

737
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,631
Jack, come on.

738
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,024
We've gotta go, Jack. Come on.

739
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,294
Come on.

740
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:02,236
-Jack.
-Lily, toss me the pipe.

741
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,809
Come on. Come on.

742
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,546
-Go.
-Come on. Come on.

743
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,458
Check the phones. Come on.

744
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,935
Wait. Wait. Someone's in here.

745
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,568
l thought you had the floor, Nancy.

746
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:43,581
Where's Dr. Gianetti? We need
to get the staff out of the building.

747
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,949
Dr. Gianetti made his policy
crystal clear.

748
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,890
We are in a containment phase,
and he is working on a solution.

749
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,025
A solution to what?

750
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,891
They're fucking eating each other.

751
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:59,231
No, Vera knows the way to the roof.
We can get help.

752
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,596
Vera had an accident...

753
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,434
...and she is resting in one of
the recovery rooms right now.

754
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,169
She is cooperating with the doctor...

755
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:13,509
...and trying to find a solution
to our problem, as is her duty.

756
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,846
Your duty, Miss Chen,
is to cover your ward...

757
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,184
...not to aid our mentally ill patients
in trying to escape.

758
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:25,850
l will not tolerate insubordination!

759
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,322
Consider this my resignation.

760
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,597
Gianetti keeps a gun
in his office.

761
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,260
Let's go.

762
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,803
Shit.

763
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,075
Give me the knife.

764
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,376
Why would he have this?

765
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,213
Why would a doctor have this?

766
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,498
That lying motherfucker.

767
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,013
Hey, guys.

768
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,131
Do it, Jack.

769
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,536
Get her off of me.

770
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,143
Nobody quits on my staff.

771
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,370
Shoot her!

772
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,652
Save the bullets.
We're gonna need them.

773
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,921
Oh, God.

774
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,889
Recovery's in here.

775
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,225
Right.

776
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,401
Oh, Jesus.

777
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,965
Nurse Henderson.

778
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,030
She was here feeding.

779
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,671
She's dead now.

780
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,503
We need to find a way to the roof.

781
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,908
-ln Gianetti's lab.
-Okay.

782
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,982
There's a passage.
lt leads to the boiler room.

783
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:06,212
Gianetti had it put in when
he started the Orpheum program.

784
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,686
No, l studied the plans.
There's nothing there.

785
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,325
We'd have to go back
through maximum security.

786
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,154
There's a laundry chute.

787
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,527
lt goes to the fourth floor.

788
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,459
lf you find Gianetti...

789
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,102
...kill him for me.

790
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,033
-Yeah, that won't be a problem.
-Okay.

791
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,732
Wait. Don't let me be like them.

792
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,676
Use the syringe.

793
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,442
Outside.

794
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,413
You didn't deserve this.

795
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,825
We gotta move.
They're gonna be looking for us.

796
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,843
Dave. Left, left.

797
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,202
We're trapped again. Where is it?

798
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,532
-l don't know.
-What do we do? What do we do?

799
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,732
Check the doors.
lt's gotta be around here.

800
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,843
Rose? Oh, my God.

801
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,185
Nancy.

802
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:47,679
No.

803
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,257
Nancy. Nancy.

804
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,006
Come on, we gotta go.
Jack, we gotta go.

805
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,477
-lt's through here.
-Then start climbing.

806
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:12,113
l'm gonna hold them off
as long as l can.

807
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:40,838
Stop running, Jack.
You belong here with me.

808
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,767
You psycho fucking bitch.

809
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,250
Keep moving. Here they come.

810
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,053
Go!

811
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,690
Jack, come on.

812
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:07,935
No!

813
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,436
Hurry up!

814
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,739
Jack!

815
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,183
Please.

816
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,355
Please.

817
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,461
Get the fuck--

818
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:39,925
No! Jack.

819
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,130
Die!

820
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:54,138
Come on. l can't hold this thing.

821
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,881
All right, go. Go, l got it.

822
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,490
Dave. Come on.

823
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,812
They're all dead.

824
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,988
-They're like animals.
-Animals don't do this to each other.

825
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,228
No. People do.

826
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,860
lt's okay.
lt's okay, we're gonna go home now.

827
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,834
We're gonna go home.

828
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,633
We're gonna go home.
We're gonna go home.

829
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,039
You forgot something, Jack.

830
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,843
l should thank you.
This knife that you left behind...

831
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,784
...allowed me to do all this.

832
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:10,855
You saved my life...

833
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,851
...and l'd like to give it back.

834
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,836
You forgot something, you sick fuck.

835
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,176
We're crazy too.

836
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,351
He's gone.

837
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,693
He left us here to die,
that fucking coward.

838
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,021
He wouldn't leave his work.

839
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,563
Here it is.

840
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:57,364
l can't believe l'm actually
leaving this place.

841
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:04,044
Don't move, because
this is a very delicate procedure.

842
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,874
Hey, please, just let us go.

843
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:10,881
-You don't need us anymore.
-Shut up. l need you more than ever.

844
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,577
So just sit down and listen.

845
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,016
Help me.

846
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:18,057
Now, this is called
an ice-pick lobotomy.

847
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,185
Thousands of these procedures...

848
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:28,492
...were performed during the '50s
as a simple way...

849
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,865
...to quiet that
manic-depressive aunt...

850
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,233
...you kept in the attic.

851
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:35,205
So simple they used to
do it in a house call.

852
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:43,945
One motion, and the frontal cortex
is removed from the rest of the brain.

853
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,451
Coming out nice and easy.

854
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:53,722
And as you can see,
the result is quite remarkable.

855
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,954
You fucking monster!

856
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,428
He's not dead.

857
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,297
Just a little less engaged.

858
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:02,336
l'm gonna fucking kill you!

859
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,230
Jack! Oh, God.

860
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,808
-Jack, no.
-lt didn't have to be like this.

861
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,571
-Jack, get up.
-l designed Orpheum to replace...

862
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,648
...those crude techniques.

863
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:16,511
To be the next generation...

864
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:22,055
...of minimally invasive
psychosurgery.

865
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,282
Can you shut up!

866
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:25,859
And why us?

867
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:29,963
lsn't it justified
when the pain of a few offers...

868
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,191
...relief for millions and millions?

869
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,302
ls that what Orpheum is? Relief?

870
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:39,439
Orpheum is the future.

871
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,202
The scientific process.

872
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,867
Just:

873
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:49,408
-And we're just part of the process.
-l think so. Yes.

874
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:51,884
Watch out!

875
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,170
Jack, Jack, Jack.

876
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,907
l'm gonna help you...

877
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:19,672
...because you're sick
and mentally unbalanced.

878
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,315
Well, maybe that's not so bad.

879
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,715
Hurry up, he's coming to.

880
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:56,180
What are you doing, Jack?

881
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,943
No, don't do that.

882
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,782
-Don't. Think about my patients.
-Shut up!

883
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,754
We're gonna try a little experiment.

884
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,790
How long it takes you
to free yourself...

885
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:09,260
...versus how long it takes
Mr. Loomis here to fucking eat you.

886
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,298
Lily, please stop him.
He's nuts. He's nuts.

887
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,792
No, stop hitting--

888
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,063
-You're not dead.
-What?

889
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,866
Just a little less engaged.

890
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,804
Please, don't do this. He's sick.

891
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:25,242
He's sick. Lily, don't you understand?
He's sick.

892
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:30,949
Just trying to help you.
You're not gonna survive!

893
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,518
Mr. Loomis...

894
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:41,052
...who's in charge,
you or your anger, huh?

895
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,256
Just be a good boy now.

896
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,697
Don't hurt me.

897
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:48,995
No.

898
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,195
Jack!

899
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,271
Jack, help me!

900
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,773
Jack!

901
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,567
Jack!

902
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,944
Jack, come on.
l think there's a way down over here.

903
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,374
Jack.

904
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:35,380
l need you to stay with me right now.
Come on, Jack.

905
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,313
Jack.

906
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:48,489
Jack, come on. We have to go.

907
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:58,204
Help! Hey, please.

908
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,204
Jack.

909
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,837
Give me your hand.

910
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:08,546
lt's okay, you're gonna be fine.
Just fine.

911
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,151
We did it, Jack. We did it.

912
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:15,420
Now we're gonna go home,
we're really going home.

913
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,426
<i>Unit 22 7, this is Dispatch.</i>

914
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,586
<i>Unit 22 7, this is Dispatch.</i>

915
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:23,288
<i>There is no response at Med-Psych.</i>
<i>Repeat, no response at Med-Psych.</i>

916
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,228
Let's see
if we can get them some help.

917
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,028
Hey! Hey!

918
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,594

Yes, can l help you?

920
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,901
