Somebody killed my dad.

00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,781
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

10
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,849
Hey, I need you
guys to get out here.

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,551
I need the police
out here right now.

12
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,685
What's going on, sir?

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,154
My neighbors have been murdered.

17
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,892
Yeah, I'm from the division of
child protective services and

18
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,894
one of my social
workers is missing.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,495
How long has this
person been missing?

20
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,330
Um, since this afternoon.

21
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,501
She hasn't shown up for
her case today at 2:00.

[voice on camera]:
She's coming out.

29
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,624
It's working now.

30
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,526
Is that the same battery?

31
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,927
No, it's a new one.

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,363
The other one must be defective.

33
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,533
It said it's fully charged
but I couldn't get any power.

34
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,469
Why don't you leave it on for
a while, make sure it's okay.

35
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,540
Yeah, will do.

36
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,908
You happy?

37
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,443
I'm happy.

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,378
But I don't think
Mr. Pearson will be.

[glitching sound]

40
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,782
I put the stills on a disc.

41
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,483
Yep.

42
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,386
I'll call him in the morning.

It's mom.

46
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,598
What?

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,901
Hello.

48
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,670
Mmhmm.

49
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,506
Right.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,040
Okay.

51
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,376
What is she saying?

52
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,678
Okay.

53
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,313
All right.

54
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,516
Bye.

55
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,685
Is he dead?

56
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,389
Not yet.

57
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,491
Well, John, what did she say?

58
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,428
She said the
treatments didn't work.

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,830
I can't believe it.

60
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,933
We have to go up there.

61
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,034
I can't do that.

62
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,436
Kenny, we already
discussed this.

63
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:23,937
I know.

64
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,705
I just... I can't.

65
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,507
And we have work.

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,878
We'll figure it out.

Jesus, you're not
playing around.

I told you, I
wanna tape everything.

You all set?

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,444
Yeah, I have everything I need.

Home sweet home.

89
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,806
I don't think so.

100
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,059
It's a quarter after three.

101
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,229
This isn't good, John.

102
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,164
We're here way too early.

103
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,766
We're not doing anything wrong.

104
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,703
We're just sitting here
drinking coffee and talking.

105
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,638
Government drones.

106
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,574
Believe me, we're
not here too early.

107
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,274
They'll be punching out at 4:00.

108
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,144
Five at the latest.

109
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,614
They work their, their eight
hour days, forty hour weeks.

Collecting their paychecks
at the end of the week.

111
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,720
And they get crazy benefits.

112
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,621
Who do you think has
more rights in that building

113
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,090
over there, huh?

114
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:17,029
The scumbags or their victims?

115
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,100
To protect and serve.

118
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,311
Is that him?

119
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,713
I think so.

120
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,681
You think so?

121
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:43,723
It's him.

Do you see him?

126
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:22,862
I see him.

127
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,097
He's turning.

128
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,399
I know.

129
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,634
I'm not gonna lose him.

130
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,969
I have his home address.

131
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,838
We can GPS it if we have to.

132
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,309
I just needed to see him.

Now what?

139
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,426
We wait.

[crickets chirping]

141
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,467
Get your camera.

142
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,905
Okay.

[crickets chirping]

145
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,443
Wait a minute.

146
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,345
We need to talk about
what we're doing here.

147
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,480
There's nothing to talk about.

148
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,347
I already got it started.

149
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,816
Now come on.

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:58,858

[door closes]

153
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,301
Where's he at?

154
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,271
He's upstairs.

155
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:20,312

[man tied up breathes heavy]

159
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,099
It's him.

160
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,934
Yeah, it's him.

161
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,370
Where's his wife?

162
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,906
She died a few years back.

163
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,975
[heavy breathing]

164
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,978
He's here all by himself now.

165
00:11:53,012 --> 00:12:01,020
[heavy breathing]

166
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,125
Now, I'm gonna
take the tape off.

167
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,861
But if you yell for help or
if you do anything stupid,

168
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,196
I'll end it.

169
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,833
You understand?

170
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,301
[groans]

171
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,870
Take whatever you
want and leave.

172
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,408
This is very manageable for you
two as long as this doesn't go

173
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,212
any further than a robbery.

174
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,848
What makes you think
we're here to rob you?

175
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,284
What is it that you want?

176
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,320
You tell me.

177
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,157
I don't know.

178
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,258
You don't know?

179
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,392
No.

180
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,395
[heavy breathing]

181
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,064
Well you're a judge.

182
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,165
Yes.

183
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes I am.

184
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,971
Then it's your job... your
"gift"... to take the evidence

185
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,107
presented to you
and make a decision.

186
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,278
Two armed intruders hold a judge
against his will in his home.

187
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,280
Robbery is not the motive.

188
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,450
With all of your years of
experience, your vast

189
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:11,557
legal knowledge, tell me,
what is your conclusion?

190
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,492
Do I know you two?

191
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,128
We're not important.

192
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,297
I'm a family court judge.

193
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,565
Not criminal.

194
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,566
We're not criminals.

195
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,434
Neither one of us has
ever committed a crime.

196
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,103
Or served a day in jail.

197
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,237
Okay.

198
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,007
I didn't mean anything by it.

199
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,342
You're both very young.

200
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,311
You don't wanna
throw your lives away.

201
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,146
You're not worried
about our lives.

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,482
You're gonna say whatever you
have to say to get out of this.

203
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,417
To get back to your
Saturday golf outings,

204
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,319
and your Sunday family dinners.

205
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,288
Having a good time, enjoying
life while you sit in your

206
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,558
courtroom acting like God.

207
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:53,599
The reckless decisions
you make destroy lives.

208
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,404
I fully understand the
impact that my rulings

209
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,573
have on people's lives.

210
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:06,212
That is not something
that I take lightly.

211
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:14,253
Uh-huh.

212
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:25,364
I stand by every
decision I've ever made.

213
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,234
Well so do I.

214
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,335
John!

215
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,470
[blood pours out]

216
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,305
Holy shit.

[judge gags and struggles]

218
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,351
Oh my God.

219
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,486
Did you get that?

220
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,488
Yeah.

[judge gags and struggles]

222
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,200
I can't believe it.

223
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,237
I mean, I can't believe it.

00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,440
[heavy breathing]

225
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,109
This is really happening.

[heavy breathing]

227
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,253
Did you bring the robe?

[footsteps]

229
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,259
You got it?

230
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:32,564
Yeah.

231
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:40,105
[footsteps]

232
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,110
Grab the papers and
let's get out of here.

It hasn't changed a bit.

238
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,377
I know.

[radio chatter]

240
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,683
There it is.

241
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,218
You wanna stop?

243
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,757
No.

[radio chatter]

245
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,160
I remember you loved that place.

246
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,397
Mom would take me there when
you and Andrea were at school.

247
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,399
She'd let me play the video
games and then we'd get

248
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,336
ice cream and walk home.

249
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,506
[radio chatter]

250
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,408

00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,501
Why are we here?

[sounds of nature]

256
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,713
John?

257
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:31,550
I remember dad brought
the three of us here.

258
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,521
You were at short,
Andrea was at second,

259
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,792
I was right here on
pitcher's mound.

260
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,327
Dad was over there
in the batter's box.

261
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,531
He was hitting us
pop-ups and grounders.

262
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,435
He hit you a fly ball but
it was a little too high.

263
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,470
But you stayed under it.

264
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,606
Even when it came down on
you and you misjudged it,

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,643
you hung in there.

266
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,346
The ball, the ball hit
you on the shoulder

267
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,854
and I knew you were
hurt but you wouldn't cry.

268
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:13,659
You were a tough little kid.

269
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:21,700
[outside noise]

270
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,706
I almost didn't recognize it.

271
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,774
It looks like a
completely different house

272
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,509
without that tree out front.

273
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:37,683
Yeah, that thing was
dead when we lived here.

274
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,720
I remember mom used to rag on
dad constantly to cut it down.

275
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:49,761
Well somebody cut it down.

276
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,565
They've done some landscaping.

277
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,569
It looks like they
replaced the front door, too.

278
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:05,611

Hey, guys.

286
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,390
What can I get for you?

287
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,727
I'll take a vodka tonic.

288
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,462
[bar chatter and music]

289
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,830
I'll take a house beer.

290
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,433
All right.

291
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,501
[bar music]

292
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,635
Here you go, guys.

293
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,703
Great.

294
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,372
Thanks.

295
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:13,278
Okay, so um what's
with the cameras?

296
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:13,845
Go ahead.

297
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,715
Tell her.

298
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,383
We're shooting a documentary.

299
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,551
Really?

300
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,320
What about?

301
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,357
It's about people and how
their actions affect others.

302
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,459
Are you gonna be
showing good people or bad?

303
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,294
Is there a difference?

304
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,495
I think so.

305
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,366
I think for the most part
people are either good or bad.

306
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,734
I disagree.

307
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,003
I think that there's
good and bad in everyone.

308
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,639
So Hitler had good in him?

309
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,841
I'm sure at one point he did.

310
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,445
I mean, I don't
think he was born evil.

311
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,513
I think he probably experienced
things in his life that made

312
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,049
him go the way he did.

313
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,518
So you believe in free will?

314
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,488
Exactly.

315
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,056
See, I believe we're
genetically predisposed

316
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,059
to become what we are.

317
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,798
We get our parents' hair
color; Their eyes; Their looks.

318
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,502
And I believe genetically
we get their personalities,

319
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,740
their intellect,
strengths, weaknesses.

320
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,076
You don't think that we
learn some of that from them?

321
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,211
I don't.

322
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,481
I mean, how else would you
explain adopted children?

323
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,450
You know, raised in good homes,
ending up in legal trouble

324
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,653
or on drugs?

325
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,922
See, I think there's something
inside them that's stronger

326
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,792
than what they were taught.

327
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,894
That's an interesting point.

328
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,630
I actually think it's
a combination of both.

329
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,534
I agree that we're genetically
predisposed to certain things,

330
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,037
good or bad.

331
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,808
But I also believe that life
experiences, our environment,

332
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:54,680
can tilt us either way.

333
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,949
I can buy that.

334
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,552
Makes sense to me.

335
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,922
Now karma is
something I believe in.

336
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,527
I think we're all
connected, someway, somehow.

337
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,734
And our actions
always come back to us.

338
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,071
Life's a circle.

339
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,473
[bar music]

340
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,741
We're room 213.

341
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,544
Cool.

342
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,745
Which way?

343
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,782
Straight ahead.

344
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:38,824
[shuffles things
around and door closes]

345
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,161
I'm shot.

346
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,498
Yeah, so am I.

347
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,502
You should have gone
home with that bartender.

348
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,804
She wasn't into me.

349
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,506
That's not true.

350
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,142
She was talking to you the
whole time we were there.

351
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,977
She was just being nice.

352
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,616
Besides, they get better
tips if they flirt with you.

353
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,185
Did you get her name at least?

354
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:07,986
Yeah.

355
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,654
Theresa.

356
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,491
She likes to be called T.

357
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,459
T, huh?

358
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:22,567
Well T had great tits.

359
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:30,075
Yeah, she did.

360
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,878
There's a shit storm
coming our way Kenny.

361
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,080
What are you talking about?

362
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,516
I'm talking about our karma.

363
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,219
I've been thinking
about that all night.

364
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:47,025
The judge had a family, what
did they do to deserve that?

365
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,762
This'll come back to us
in one form or another.

366
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,866
I kinda see us as
the judge's karma.

367
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,201
But where does it end?

368
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,269
I don't know.

369
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,938
I mean, I guess it ends
when it's supposed to end.

370
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,774
It's out of our hands now.

371
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:09,214
We can stop it
before it gets worse.

372
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,516
So what are you saying?

373
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,285
Do you wanna stop?

374
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,920
Yeah.

375
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,722
Yeah, I wanna stop.

376
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,559
I thought this was
the right thing to do,

377
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:26,932
but now I'm not so sure.

378
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,303
Okay, John.

379
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:39,611
You're the only one in my life
I've ever been able to count on.

380
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:45,116
[birds chirping]

381
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,022
[door opens]

382
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:58,196
I squared away the room.

383
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,800
You look like you got raped
by a gang of swinging dicks.

384
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,168
[chuckling]

385
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:11,209
There's no way I look that bad.

386
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,180
[car noise]

387
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:20,819
So last night, was
that the booze speaking?

388
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,621
No.

389
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:28,059
No, it wasn't.

390
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,062
[starts car]

391
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:39,104
[car noise]

392
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,309
What do you wanna do
about the footage?

393
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,612
I'll take care of
it when we get home.

394
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:52,617
Do you think it's a
good idea to wait?

395
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,686
What the fuck?

396
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,088
What is it?

397
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:57,989
Pull over.

398
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,291
Did they say
something about the judge?

399
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,393
Hey, pull the fuck over!

400
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:08,800
[newspaper ruffles]

401
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,235
John!

402
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,371
[birds chirping]

403
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,806
[river running]

404
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,507
John!

405
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,178
Will you tell me what's wrong?!

406
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,346
There's nothing wrong,
except that I shouldn't have

407
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,849
second guessed myself.

408
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,084
Here.

409
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,186
Take a look at this.

410
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,423
[river running
and birds chirping]

411
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,658
Holy shit.

412
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,126
Don't you see?

413
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,129
We are doing the right thing.

414
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,865
This is crazy.

415
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,434
I don't know what to say.

416
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,938
My instincts were right
until I started to doubt myself.

417
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,006
But who wouldn't?

418
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,909
I mean, look at
what we're doing.

419
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,914
But if this isn't a sign,
then I don't know what is.

420
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,282
[knocks on door]

421
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,316
What are you doing?

422
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,418
Wait for me.

423
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,886
[crickets chirping]

424
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,122
Shit.

425
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:04,923
Get down on the floor now!

426
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,124
[woman screams]

427
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:06,758
Now!

428
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,892
Now!
Get on the floor!

429
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,793
Shut up!

430
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,328
Get on the ground right now.

431
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,697
[woman screaming]
Get on the fucking floor!

432
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,398
[woman screaming]

433
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,232
No!

434
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,133
No John!

435
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,901
John!

436
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:17,469
[woman screaming]

437
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:25,710
[footsteps]

00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,180
[door opens and closes]

439
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,448
Jesus Christ.

440
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,150
I know.

441
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,952
Do you think anyone heard us?

442
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,320
I don't think so.

443
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,256
I mean, I don't know.

444
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,825
I didn't see anybody out there.

445
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:48,867
Here.

446
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:57,308
[curtains shuffle]

447
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:04,315
Come on.

448
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,750
Crazy fucker.

449
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,319
I can't believe he
came at me like that.

450
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,356
Can you imagine charging
at someone with a gun?

451
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,357
No.

452
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:19,330
[footsteps]

453
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:25,537
[woman gagged and sobbing]

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:33,778
[sniffling and heavy breathing]

455
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:41,453
[sniffling and heavy breathing]

456
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:45,090
[glitching sound]

457
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:49,461
Now I know you're both scared.

458
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,429
You don't know where this
is going and you don't have

459
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,399
any control of the situation.

460
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:58,236
[metal chair
bangs against floor]

461
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,306
It's a terrible
feeling, isn't it?

462
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:09,347
To be helpless.

463
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,550
To know that your safety
and well-being is in the hands

464
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:18,957
of someone else.

465
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,160
When someone has that
kind of power over you.

466
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,063
You want compassion, right?

467
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,600
Yeah.

468
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,467
Okay.

469
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,136
I know you're both
anxious to speak.

470
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,338
And I wanna hear
what you have to say.

471
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:38,843
But I don't want a repeat
of what happened upstairs.

472
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,079
Understand?

473
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,281
[grunting and heavy breathing]

474
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:47,285
Remember, you're handcuffed
and tied up and I have a knife.

475
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,422
[woman whines]

476
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,324
Please don't hurt us.

477
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:57,128
We'll do whatever you want.

478
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,865
Look, I don't know what you boys
want, but whatever it is,

479
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,867
I'm sure I can deal with
it without involving her.

480
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,468
No!

481
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,336
Don't hurt either of us!

482
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,206
Please let her go.

483
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,407
[crying]

484
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,275
No.

485
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,842
Please.

486
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,977
Why are you doing this?

487
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,079
We've done nothing to you.

488
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,314
That's right.

489
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,483
You didn't do anything.

490
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,018
That's very noble of you.

491
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,420
To sacrifice
yourself for your wife.

492
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,556
Not everyone would do that.

493
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,291
Thank-you.

494
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,594
But the real test would be
to put yourself out there for

495
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,396
a complete stranger.

496
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,430
Could you do that?

497
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,331
Yes!

498
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,332
We do it all the time.

499
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,400
Really?

500
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,267
Yes.

501
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,468
We're both very
active with our church.

502
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,440
And we do food drives and
clothing drives for the needy.

503
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,577
We help run a charity
for unwed pregnant teens.

504
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,280
And every Thanksgiving we
serve dinner to the homeless.

505
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,949
And you tell all of your friends
about your selfless acts,

506
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,450
don't you?

507
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:57,555
No.

508
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,526
Of course you don't.

509
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,395
That's not why we do it.

510
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,496
Then why do you do it?

511
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,132
Because it's the
right thing to do!

512
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:12,370
You have some nerve breaking
into our home, holding us

513
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,507
against our will, and passing
judgment on our integrity!

514
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,308
Judy!

515
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,109
I will pass judgment!

516
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,110
[chair bangs]

517
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,278
Because everything you
just said is a bunch of

518
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,380
superficial bullshit!

519
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,316
Nothing you've done has
changed anyone's lives!

520
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,252
You think feeding dinner to
the homeless one day out

521
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,486
of the year does anything?

522
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,456
What about the other
364 days in the year?

523
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,257
And look at me!

524
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,524
No!

525
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,627
You think your donations to your
charities ever reach the needy?

526
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,297
Or your shitty furniture for
your unwed pregnant teens.

527
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,566
You think that
makes a difference?!

528
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,970
Yes, it does.

529
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:50,975
I'm talking about really making
a difference when it's personal

530
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,044
and right in front of you.

531
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,648
I'm not talking about sending in
money to people you never meet,

532
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,385
or serving food to people then
sending them on their way,

533
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,554
or dropping off furniture and
wishing them good luck,

534
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,423
then going back to
your comfortable life.

535
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,393
What do you want?!

536
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,662
Let me put it to you this way.

537
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,132
What would you do if someone
came banging on your door in

538
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:20,338
the middle of the night, bloody
and beaten, begging for help.

539
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,641
Would you make a simple
phone call to the police?

540
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,411
Or would you slam the
door shut and do nothing?

541
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,314
Because you didn't
want to get involved?

542
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,583
Oh my God, it can't be.

543
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,319
Please.

544
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,420
That's what this is about?

545
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,421
You don't understand.

546
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,655
No.

547
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,359
[Alan shouts as his
mouth is taped shut]

548
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,327
We were scared.

549
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,330
We didn't know what to do.

550
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,732
No.

551
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,469
[Judy mumbles as her
mouth is taped shut]

552
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,472
How's this for an explanation?

553
00:32:54,505 --> 00:33:00,111
See no evil, hear no
evil, speak no evil.

554
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,581
[Alan gasps as he's stabbed]

[Judy sobs under the tape]

556

[knife cuts into the
air and Judy's body]

557
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,833
Fuck!

558
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:28,106
[wiping sound and
birds chirping]

559
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,408
Kenny, what are you doing?

560
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:38,449
[heavy breathing]

561
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,823
So what do you think?

562
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,228
[street noise
and birds chirping]

563
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:58,269
[diner music and chatter]

564
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:05,710
[diner music and chatter]

565
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,245
Here you go.

566
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,313
Thank you.

567
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:14,619
Enjoy.

568
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,487
I need to get some coffee.

569
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,524
So do I.

570
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,459
You hungry?

571
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,627
Not really.

572
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,496
[phone ringing]

573
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,664
Is that you?

574
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,732
Yeah.

575
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,467
[phone ringing]

576
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,601
It's Andrea.

577
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,203
Andrea?

578
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,805
Yeah, it's her.

579
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,372
[phone ringing]

580
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,506
It's gotta be about dad.

581
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,607
Well answer it.

582
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,176
I don't know what to say.

583
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:38,876
Just talk to her.

584
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,611
You've stayed in touch with her.

585
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,380
Let's just see if she
leaves a voicemail.

586
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,614
[phone ringing]

587
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:49,187
Hey, how's everything going?

588
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,221
[Andrea on voicemail] Hi, Kenny.

589
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,291
It's your big sister.

590
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,927
I'm not sure why I'm calling.

591
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,596
I know you and John
want to be left alone,

592
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:03,701
but for what it's worth,
I saw dad last night.

593
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:10,308
I actually just left their
house and he's getting worse.

594
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:15,246
I thought you should know.

595
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,516
[birds chirping]

596
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:26,557
[movement in the car]

597
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:34,765
[movement in the car]

598
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,701
[heavy sigh]

599
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,904
Come on, Kenny.

600
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,206
Jesus Christ.

601
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,409
[birds chirping]

602
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,979
Kenny!

603
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,381
I'm over here!

604
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,450
Well where's here?!

605
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,419
Down by the stream!

606
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,389
What Cupful stream?

607
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:04,929
[birds chirping and footsteps]

608
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,864
How are you making out?

609
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:12,603
Good.

610
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,339
Let me see what you got.

611
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,943
[sounds of nature]

612
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,848
[camera makes a beeping
sound with each picture]

613
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,716
These look really great, bro.

614
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,655
Thanks.

615
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,892
Listen, I know this is kinda
how you process things,

616
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,695
but we really gotta get moving.

617
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,999
Yeah, just give me
a few more minutes.

618
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:47,405
[sounds of nature]

619
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:55,513
[car sounds]

620
00:36:55,546 --> 00:37:00,051
[dogs barking, cars honking]

621
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:08,292
[sounds of nature]

622
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:18,402
[sounds of nature]

623

[sounds of nature]

624
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,713
So what do you wanna do?

625
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:33,417
Just sit here and wait.

626
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,655
Let her go inside,
we'll give it a little time.

627
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:45,696
[outside noise]

628
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,399
[car starts]

629
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,433
Shit.

630
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,835
Try to block her.

631
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,069
It's too risky.

632
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,637
It's daylight.

633
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,538
Somebody might see us.

634
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,108
So you wanna leave?

635
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:01,812
No, let's just follow
her and see what happens.

636
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:09,854
[car noise]

637
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:19,964
[car noise]

638
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:34,578
[kids playing]

639
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:44,522
[kids playing]

640
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,458
What do you think?

641
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,428
Think she's gonna
remove the kids?

642
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,897
I don't think so.

643
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,399
The kids look too happy.

644
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,969
It's a foster home.

645
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,573
It's their escape from insanity.

646
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:06,143
Until they decide to send
them back to their parents,

647
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:14,385
the same people that put
them here to begin with.

648
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,962
Is there anyone around?

649
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,163
I don't see anyone.

650
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,932
Well, keep an eye out.

651
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,533
You wanna do this now?

652
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,502
This might be the
best chance we have.

653
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,670
John, let's think about this.

654
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,438
She probably has
another appointment today.

655
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,575
Or she's expected
back at her office.

656
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,510
Wait, if she doesn't
show up, the police are

657
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,145
gonna look for her.

658
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,481
Let's do it at her house
tonight, It'll buy us more time.

659
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:49,487
I'm not doing this
in front of her kids.

660
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,091
[car opens and closes]

661
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,794
[Woman screams]
Jesus.

662
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,697
Did anybody fucking see him?

663
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,131
Come on!

664
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,599
Help me!

665
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:09,640

[sounds of nature]

675
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:23,647
[sounds of nature]

676
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,683
Are you okay?

677
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,884
Yeah.

678
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,253
[sounds of nature]

679
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,289
I'm gonna carry her in.

680
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:38,128
[sounds of nature]

681
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:43,067
[woman screams]

682
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,269
Somebody!
Help me!

683
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,270
I thought you tied her up!

684
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,071
I did!

685
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,807
She got out of it!

686
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,076
[footsteps and heavy breathing]

687
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:56,580
[woman screams]

688
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,748
Leave me alone!

689
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,584
No!

690
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,954
[struggles and heavy breathing]

691
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,258
Help me get her
inside the fuckin' house.

692
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,627
[sounds of nature]
Come on!

693
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:17,668
[footsteps]

694
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:27,711
[footsteps]

695
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,714
[crickets chirping]

696
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,150
Please.

697
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,754
I have two little
boys, I'm all they have.

698
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,822
I told you to be quiet!

699
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:46,864
[woman sobs]

700
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:57,374
[woman sobs]

701
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:07,918
[woman sobs]

702
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:18,329
[footsteps around the house]

703
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,439
This house once
brought happiness.

704
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:36,680
It brought safety and security
when everything was crazy.

705
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,317
There was an older
couple that owned this house.

706
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,453
They couldn't have
children of their own

707
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,255
so they filled it
with foster kids.

708
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,124
Do you remember them?

709
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,760
Fred and Helen Decker.

710
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,961
That's right.

711
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,930
I'm surprised you
remember their names.

712
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,734
I figured you'd know them
by some state-assigned code.

713
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,235
They were good people.

714
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,304
They were great people.

715
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,841
Fred passed away
about eight years ago.

716
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,376
I know he did.

717
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,946
And I know Helen lost this
place about five years ago.

718
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,416
She did everything she
could to try to keep it.

719
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:17,121
But it was just too much
for her after losing Fred.

720
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,189
So after helping others
for most of her life,

721
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,324
she now gets to spend
what little time she has

722
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:24,328
left in a state-run
nursing home.

723
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,365
Where she can be taken
care of for a change.

724
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:34,338
She's just another number.

725
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,740
We're all just numbers, right?

726
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:41,311
How we live, how we die,
how much money we make.

727
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,381
And then decisions are
made that affect peoples' lives

728
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,351
based on statistics.

729
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,953
I never looked at the
two of you that way.

730
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,289
What did you say?

731
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,324
I remember you.

732
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,362
John and Kenneth Stiles,
and your sister Andrea.

733
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,364
Obviously, you're
both a lot older now

734
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,300
but I recognized you right away.

735
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,302
And the way the two of
you interact with each other,

736
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,172
it hasn't changed.

737
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,407
I don't know why
you're doing this to me.

738
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,508
You don't?

739
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,211
I don't.

740
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:17,314
I did everything I could to
protect the three of you.

741
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,983
I had you removed from an
abusive home and placed

742
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,386
in a safe environment
here with the Deckers.

743
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,088
I tried to help you.

744
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,956
But you sent us
back to our parents.

745
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,058
It's always in the best interest
of the children to be with

746
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,426
their biological parents.

747
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,428
Even if there's abuse?

748
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,396
Of course not.

749
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,630
When there's abuse,
we remove the children.

750
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,533
Then the parents are given a
case plan and if they follow it,

751
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,169
then they'll regain custody.

752
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,473
And I'm assuming my parents
followed it to perfection.

753
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,875
They did everything
they were required to do.

754
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,510
I had to tell the judge that.

755
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:49,346
And in his divine wisdom
he sent us back to them.

756
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,216
It's not our goal to
break up families.

757
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,419
Our first priority is
to protect the children.

758
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,687
Like in our case.

759
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,858
Your parents demonstrated that
they had a safe and stable home.

760
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,226
A safe, stable home?

761
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,461
Do you have any idea how
horrific the abuse was when

762
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,629
you sent us back to them?

763
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,432
When I came to your house
and everything seemed okay.

764
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,900
Oh, bullshit!

765
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,034
You think checking
up on us every

766
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,469
here and there did anything?!

767
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,338
You don't think we all put
on our smiley faces for you

768
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,006
when you stopped by?!

769
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,407
You should have told me.

770
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,443
Your parents weren't
gonna admit anything.

771
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,912
The neighbors didn't
want to get involved.

772
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,149
The abuse was bad
before you removed us.

773
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,384
But it went to a whole other
level when they moved us to

774
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:31,288
that house in the woods
where no one heard us

775
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,458
and they did whatever
they wanted.

776
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,262
I'm sorry.

777
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:46,303
We should have never
gone back to them.

778
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:56,046
All of your studies and charts
and statistics removed us from a

779
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,151
safe, stable home and sent us
back to the people that hurt us.

780
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:05,055
I have spent my life
fighting to protect children.

781
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:08,292
I am on the front
lines everyday.

782
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,329
Don't you think the
red tape frustrates me?

783
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,630
Not only do I have
to fight the parents,

784
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,301
but I have to fight the system.

785
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:25,342
I have something
I wanna show you.

786
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:34,284
[John gathers
papers and a knife]

787
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,422
No!

788
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,156
No!

789
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:47,197
No!

790
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:52,135
Here's the court order
removing us from our parents.

791
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,473
And here's the court order
kicking us back to them.

792
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,711
What one hand giveth,
the other hand taketh away.

793
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:05,315
It breaks my heart
that we got it wrong.

794
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,986
It was our hearts that were
broken because you got it wrong.

795
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,954
What about my boys?

796
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:14,157
Your boys will feel the same
pain that was inflicted on us.

797
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,159
Not me.

798
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,396
Your parents.

799
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,266
Is this your goal here?

800
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,500
To destroy as many lives
as you can because

801
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,971
you had a shitty childhood?

802
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:28,972
Well guess what?

803
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:33,110
You're not the only ones.

804
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:39,483
My boys have not had a
walk in the park either.

805
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:43,353
Their father is a
violent alcoholic.

806
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:48,425
I tried to fix him
because that's who I am.

807
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:54,598
It took me years, years
to realize that I couldn't.

808
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:58,669
And then finally I
took the boys and I left.

809
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,773
If something happens to me,
my ex-husband will raise them.

810
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:06,076
You realize that, right?

811
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,611
How do you think
they're gonna affect society

812
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:12,115
with that kind of upbringing?

813
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,786
I'm their Helen Decker.

814
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:20,791
Whatever happens to me
in this room right now

815
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:25,262
will hurt innocent people
for years to come.

816
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,099
[woman sobs]

817
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,669
John?

818
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,205
Turn it off.

819
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,274
[sobbing]

820
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,577
[glitching sound]

821
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,381
We can't just leave her here!

822
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:48,385
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

823
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,654
[footsteps]

824
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,422
Wait a minute.

825
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,091
This is my life, too.

826
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,325
It's not all about you!

827
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,494
I know that.

828
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:01,631
You think I don't?

829
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,434
This is about the two
of us making things right.

830
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,369
Yeah, and how are we
gonna do that when

831
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,237
we're sitting behind bars?

832
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,739
There's no doubt the
cops are looking for her.

833
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,340
She isn't going anywhere.

834
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,575
I tied her right this time.

835
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,542
Okay.

836
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,278
So she might not get
out tonight or tomorrow.

837
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,247
But she's eventually
gonna get out of there, John.

838
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,282
And when she does she's
gonna tell them all about us!

839
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,484
So then go take care of her.

840
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,252
I'm not gonna do that.

841
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,487
This is your brilliant idea.

842
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,621
You deal with it.

843
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,223
Oh, so I put a gun to your
head and made you do this.

844
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,491
No, obviously not.

845
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,860
But like with everything it's,
it's your plans and your terms

846
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,294
and I just went along with it.

847
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,562
We talked about this for years.

848
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,564
No, you talked
about this for years.

849
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,366
I just agreed with you.

850
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,235
So you don't share any
responsibility in this?

851
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,469
That's not what I'm saying.

852
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,339
How can I say that with
our fuckin' documentary?

853
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,607
And by the way
what's up with that?

854
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,841
With what?

855
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,878
With us videotaping our way
to the goddamn death penalty.

856
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,413
You know why we're taping this.

857
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,881
No, I don't.

858
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,483
Kenny, you know
why we're taping this.

859
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,751
No, I really don't.

860
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,319
It doesn't make any sense.

861
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:56,987
But it does.

862
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,854
This means something to us.

863
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,424
This doesn't mean
shit to me, John.

864
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,425
Other than the fact
that I've completely

865
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,461
fucked up my life now.

866
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:08,298
Jesus Christ.

867
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,334
You really don't know.

868
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,136
I'm done.

869
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,172
[glitching sound]

870
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:19,176
Why don't you go drink now.

871
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,444
[footsteps]

872
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:21,077
Kenny.

873
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,446
No, John, I'm outta here.

874
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,647
Can I say something?

875
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,483
There's nothing else to say.

876
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,486
I mean, all my life
I've followed you blindly.

877
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,454
And I wanted to get back
at those people just

878
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,355
as badly as you did.

879
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,225
I can't deny that.

880
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,161
But you don't even
have a plan here.

881
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:44,401
Taping everything, leaving
her here to testify against us.

882
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,338
There's no going back.

883
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,473
There was no going back
the second we pulled out

884
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:54,311
of our driveway.

885
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,246
[sounds of nature]

886
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:02,853
I can't do this anymore.

887
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,920
I'll see if I can find a
bus stop when we

888
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,690
get into Kynorsburg.

889
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,526
Maybe somebody at the
home can tell me where to go.

890
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,661
Are you going with me?

891
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:16,967
I'd like to pay my respects.

892
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,438
[office sounds]

893
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,372
Is it on?

894
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,476
Yeah.

895
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:32,482
[office sounds and chatter]

896
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,885
Hi, Helen.

897
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,887
Hello.

898
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,222
Do you remember us?

899
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,391
I do.

900
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,359
Fred and I were just
talking about the

901
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:47,631
two of you the other day.

902
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,532
You were?

903
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,600
Yeah.

904
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,302
Where's Andrea?

905
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,637
She couldn't come with us.

906
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,872
She's been helping
out our parents.

907
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,942
They were troubled people.

908
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,379
You remember them well.

909
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:10,387
Come here and let me hug you.

910
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,788
Thank you.

911
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,689
No.

912
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,890
Thank you, Helen.

913
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,259
For everything you
and Fred did for us.

914
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,929
We just want you to know how
much we love you and how much

915
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,332
we appreciate the time
we spent at your home.

916
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:27,370
That means the world to me.

917
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:31,875
Kenny, put down that

918
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,411
Okay.

[TV plays in the background]

920
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,753
You were always so quiet.

921
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,523
I'm not quiet.

922
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,493
Fred always tells that
same story about you.

923
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,930
That boy in the neighborhood
was picking on your brother.

924
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,499
He was older than you, right?

925
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,734
Yeah, by a few years.

926
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,803
That's what I thought.

927
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,873
Well anyway, he roughed up
John in front of our house.

928
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,510
Fred and I saw it happen, but
before we could get outside

929
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,580
to break it up, you came
out of nowhere and jumped

930
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,882
on that boy's back.

931
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,951
You were punching him
and biting him and he spun

932
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,320
around like a top.

933
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:20,957
He couldn't shake you off.

934
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,395
Fred always says that being
quiet doesn't mean you're weak.

935
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:32,736
He admires your
loyalty to each other.

936
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,072
I didn't see that same
type of loyalty from Andrea.

937
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,410
I remember something
different about that day.

938
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:45,448
When Fred and I came outside,
I saw her standing there.

939
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,485
She didn't do
anything to help you.

940
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,554
Andrea always
looked out for Andrea.

941
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,424
That one tested my patience.

942
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,994
She was nasty to
me, but loved Fred.

943
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,997
She always went
for his attention.

[News anchor on TV]

945
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:02,866
We're beginning this hour with
continuing coverage of a
missing.

Carlton social worker.

947
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:04,801
As we reported earlier, the
woman was last seen yesterday

948
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,836
afternoon at a local restaurant.

949
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,805
Her name is LindaHallet.

950
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:09,939
She's 44-years-old.

951
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,408
-Jesus.
-Shh.

952
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:11,975
And a single mother of two.

953
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:12,709
Linda is a white female.

957
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,079
Shut up.

Coworkers contacted authorities
late yesterday afternoon when.

960
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,852
Linda failed to report back
to the United Family Services

961

office in Woodsboro,
where she's worked for the

962
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,457
past twenty-two years.

963
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,059
Now police will not
comment if the social worker's

964
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,495
disappearance is connected to
the murder of Family Court
Judge.

William Stevens, whose body
was found yesterday in his home.

A search has been organized by.

967
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,470
You left your baseball
bat out on the front yard.

968
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,106
Make sure you bring
it in before it rains.

969
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,875
We grabbed it.

970
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,577
We didn't forget about it.

971
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,513
Can one of you tell
Fred that dinner's ready?

972
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,514
Yeah.

973
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,550
I'll tell him.

00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,018
When authorities found a man
and his wife dead in their home.

A spokeswoman for the
Tannersville Police Department

976
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:01,124

McGrath and his wife
45-year-old.

977
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,160
Judy McGrath were found
murdered in their basement.

978
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,895
John, we can't stay here.

979
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,863
The causes of their deaths
have not been confirmed.

980
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:07,931
We have to go.

981
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,065
Yeah.

982
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:09,566
But the spokeswoman says
they suffered traumatic wounds.

983
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,633
We have to go now.

984
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,169
I'll take you over to
the bus station right now.

I'm sorry, Kenny.

I'm sorry for
fucking up your life.

989
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,763
You're right.

990
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:44,968
I'm doing this
without any regard for you.

991
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:48,471
I'll do whatever I can
to get you out of this.

00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,208

made you help me.

But that's not how it happened.

995
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,046
I was there every
step of the way.

996
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,715
I didn't look out for you.

997
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,251
Yeah, you did.

about what I said last night.

It's not all about
you, It's about me, too.

1000
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,731
It's about the two of us
reclaiming our lives, right?

1001
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:18,535
About not letting
others define us as victims.

1002

The false face must hide
what the false heart doth know.

1098
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,391
You're quoting Shakespeare.

1099
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:18,327
I can only imagine what
you were going to do to me.

1100
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,463
We were gonna cut off
your face to show your

1101
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,399
true face underneath.

1102
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,369
Well it's a good
thing I watch the news.

1103
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:29,138
I knew it was the two of you the
minute I saw that this morning.

1104
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,040
I had a feeling I was
on your to-do list.

1105
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,308
You never looked out for us.

1106
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,376
And who looked out for me?

1107
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,277
It doesn't matter.

1108
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:34,944
It does matter.

1109
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:35,978
No, it doesn't.

1110
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,446
It didn't have to be
everybody for themselves.

1111
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,348
Kenny and I never did that.

1112
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,984
We trusted you as our older
sister and you wanted

1113
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,586
us to trust you.

1114
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,356
So you could constantly
set us up with mom and dad.

1115
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,292
You lured us into the
secret room for the first time,

1116
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,459
remember?

1117
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,329
I learned at a very young
age to look out for myself.

1118
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,263
At our expense.

1119
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,364
At anyone's expense.

1120
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,066
Yeah, but it was more
than just self-preservation.

1121
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,401
There was something
else going on with you.

1122
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,468
Oh, is that right?

1123
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,403
Hey, you tell me.

1124
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,271
That night dad beat
the fuck out of us.

1125
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,172
Which night?

1126
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:04,440
You know which night.

1127
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,675
The three of us were supposed to
sneak out after they fell asleep

1128
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,244
and run next door
to the McGraths.

1129
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:09,579
Kenny and I made it there.

1130
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,681
But you were nowhere to be seen.

1131
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,015
I told you, mom caught me
climbing out the window

1132
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,383
and told dad.

1133
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,651
Bullshit, Andrea!

1134
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,587
Dad showed up at the McGraths
like two minutes after we did.

1135
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,988
How did he know
where we were going?

1136
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,022
I don't know.

1137
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,458
Maybe they heard us
planning our great escape.

1138
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,659
Why did we involve
those people anyway?

1139
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,062
We could've called 911.

1140
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,396
Well I thought it'd be better
to have an adult call

1141
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,398
úcause we were fuckin' kids.

1142
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,301
How was I supposed to know
they'd slam the door shut?

1143
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,302
Well you showed them.

1144
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,137
Hey, they could've
saved us months of abuse.

1145
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:35,972
What was it?

1146
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,106
Another six months?

1147
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,442
A year before Kenny's teacher
saw bruises on his arm,

1148
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,344
turned in mom and dad.

1149
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,379
Even after they removed us, you
still tried to cover for them.

1150
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,681
It was conditioned behavior.

1151
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,716
Don't you get it?

1152
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,317
The two of you think
I'm some sort of monster.

1153
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,518
You are a monster.

1154
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,320
Everybody in your
life serves a purpose.

1155
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,722
Just look at the
lifestyle you live.

1156
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:53,856
Yeah, what about it?

1157
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,524
That was pretty smart, getting
pregnant by some rich,

1158
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,160
old guy and cleaning him
out in your divorce.

1159
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,328
Hey, Shannon's
hooked you up big time.

1160
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,463
Leave her out of this.

1161
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,198
Why don't you leave
her out of this?!

1162
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,633
I saw the T-shirt
in her bedroom.

1163
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,601
Granddaddy's little girl?

1164
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,236
What the fuck kind of reason
could you possibly have
bringing.

1165
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,438
Shannon around mom and dad?

1166
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,274
You're in no
position to judge me.

1167
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,043
Is this just another attempt
by you to gain their approval?

1168
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,979
You gave away your first
baby to make them happy.

1169
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,015
How old were you?

1170
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,750
Eighteen?

1171
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,518
Why didn't you
just leave with her?

1172
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,422
You left right
after that anyway.

1173
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:33,996
You don't know a thing about me.

1174
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:42,038
[car noise]

1175
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:53,015
[car noise]

1176
01:05:55,818 --> 01:06:04,026
[car noise]

1177
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:12,134
[puts car in park]

1178
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:20,176
I started it where you left off.

1179
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:30,753
There's two people inside
that you wanted to see.

1180
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:40,796
There's two people inside
that you wanted to see.

1181
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,333
[sounds of nature]

1182
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:52,375
[footsteps]

1183
01:06:54,410 --> 01:07:02,251
[footsteps]

1184
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,720
Go on.

1185
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,490
You've been here before.

1186
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:13,195
[footsteps]

1187
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,398
Don't do anything stupid.

1188
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:23,439
[footsteps]

1189
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:31,247
Remember, out here, when you
scream, it doesn't make a sound.

1190
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,715
[door opens]

1191
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,418
After you.

1192
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:43,459
[footsteps]

1193
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,432
Mom?

1194
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,400
I'm upstairs.

1195
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,436
Come on down.

1196
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,871
I have a surprise for you.

1197
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,239
Is Shannon with you?

1198
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,708
No, she's at Doug's this week.

1199
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:06,615
Okay, I'll be down in a minute.

1200
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,451
Nothing's changed.

1201
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,555
People don't change.

1202
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,825
They just get older.

1203
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:23,866
[footsteps]

1204
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,374
What is this?

1205
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,277
Is that anyway to
speak to your children?

1206
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,646
We're all here for
a family reunion.

1207
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,650
The five of us
together one last time.

1208
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,753
Is that why
you're holding a gun?

1209
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,389
It's for old time's sake.

1210
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:51,594
Only this time I'm
pointing the gun at you.

1211
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,396
And Kenny and John
have the cameras.

1212
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,533
In this house, a camera's
more dangerous than a gun.

1213
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,634
What are you talking about?

1214
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,802
Oh, come on.

1215
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:00,870
Loyal to the bitter end.

1216
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:04,940
Eh, mom?

1217
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,378
Kenny, do you know
what they're talking about?

1218
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,247
I don't know.

1219
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,216
He might have
blocked out certain things.

1220
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,818
But you know.

1221
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,520
I know what?

1222
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,555
That we weren't perfect parents.

1223
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,990
I know that.

1224
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,458
But you had
everything you needed.

1225
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,826
You had a roof over your head.

1226
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,562
You had clothes and food.

1227
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,464
We did the best we could.

1228
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,232
Did I say you could move?!

1229
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,567
Did I?!

1230
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,402
No, you didn't.

1231
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,770
I won't move again.

1232
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,772
Just don't do anything stupid.

1233
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,574
Don't tell me what to do!

1234
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,642
Okay.

1235
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,444
You're never going to
tell me what to do again!

1236
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,012
Okay.

1237
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,880
I get it.

1238
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,383
I don't want the three
of you to ruin your lives.

1239
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,485
You don't give a shit about us.

1240
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,719
I care.

1241
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,955
You're always
toeing the company line.

1242
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:56,025
You did the best that
you could, you care.

1243
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,526
We were there, mom.

1244
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,328
We know what happened.

1245
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,330
And dad lies and
you swear to it.

1246
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,598
That's not true.

1247
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,899
Seriously?

1248
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,635
What are we to you, mom?

1249
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,337
You're my children.

1250
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,274
I know you gave birth to us
but you never took care of us.

1251
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,777
Never worried about our
well-being, our schoolwork,

1252
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,645
whether we were clean or safe.

1253
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,549
All we ever got from you
was anger or indifference.

1254
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,618
That's how I was raised.

1255
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,754
Nobody showed me
any love or caring.

1256
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,457
You have no idea how
my parents abused me.

1257
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,425
Here we go again.

1258
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,460
And your grandparents
abused your parents.

1259
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,528
And their parents abused them.

1260
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,629
And dad abused you.

1261
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:34,730
Is that your excuse?

1262
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,732
It's not an excuse.

1263
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:37,666
At what point do you
take responsibility for

1264
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,034
your own actions?

1265
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:44,907
When do you break the cycle?

1266
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,911
Have the three of you come here
to have some sort of final say?

1267
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,948
Is that what you want?

1268
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,552
Your father's dying!

1269
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,853
You wanna shoot me?

1270
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:58,887
Fine.

1271
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:03,058
I have nothing left anyway.

1272
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,860
You wanna shoot your dad?

1273
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,929
He's all yours.

1274
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,964
What's left of him.

1275
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,799
You'd be doing him a favor.

1276
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,035
We'll see about that.

1277
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:16,505
Now start up the stairs slowly.

1278
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:20,509
I want the two of
you in front of me.

1279
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:24,113
The enemy of my
enemy is not my friend.

1280
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,715
[footsteps]

1281
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,885
Hold up, mom.

1282
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,121
When you get into that room,
I don't want you anywhere

1283
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:35,491
near that nightstand.

1284
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:39,595
I know that's where you
and dad keep your gun.

1285
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:43,465
After you.

1286
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,534
[door opens]

1287
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:53,575
[footsteps]

1288
01:11:55,577 --> 01:12:03,585
[footsteps]

1289
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:11,627
Well look at what
the cat dragged in.

1290
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:19,668
I suppose you're here
to bid me a fond farewell.

1291
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,404
I didn't think so.

1292
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:27,109
John and Kenny are making
quite the interesting movie.

1293
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,978
Well I do see the cameras.

1294
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,480
You know all
about making movies.

1295
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,915
Right, dad?

1296
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,884
I figured that's
where this is headin'.

1297
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,520
Oh, daddy, you have no idea.

1298
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,089
Is that right?

1299
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:44,059
Remember Judge
Stevens and the McGraths?

1300
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:48,030
I remember those assholes.

1301
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:54,169
You should see
what they did to them.

1302
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,206
Are we talking past tense?

1303
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,575
We are.

1304
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:03,879
[Dad laughs and coughs]

1305
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,516
You fuckin' pussies.

1306
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:13,188
You wait till I'm half-dead to
hatch some revenge bullshit?

1307
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,593
I thought I made men out of you.

1308
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:20,062
Like you?

1309
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:21,830
Watch it, kid.

1310
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,232
Or what?

1311
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,700
What are you gonna do?

1312
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,235
You can't do shit to us now.

1313
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:30,639
And you can't do shit to me.

1314
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,609
Except maybe watch me die.

1315
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:37,679
You'd be surprised how horrible
we can make your last hours.

1316
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,782
Let's see what you got.

1317
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,550
That's some tough talk.

1318
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,584
But you know your little
step-and-fetch-it here

1319
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,119
has your ass covered.

1320
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,188
I don't need
anybody to cover my ass.

1321
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,023
Mom never did?

1322
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:52,060
You sound like a
whiny, little bitch.

1323
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,730
Andrea never lied
to the social worker?

1324
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:58,233
When I was little my old
man beat the shit out of me

1325
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,269
and I took it.

1326
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,171
Didn't we just
hear this downstairs?

1327
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:06,775
I didn't run around bitching
about how bad that I had it.

1328
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:10,179
No, you just beat the shit out
of your wife and kids,

1329
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,113
you sick fuck.

1330
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,848
Don't you talk to
your father that way.

1331
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:13,982
I'll talk to him anyway I want.

1332
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,184
And you too for that matter.

1333
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,185
Come on!

1334
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,220
The two of you and your
sob childhood bullshit.

1335
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,021
Bring it to me!

1336
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,023
What else your
old man do to you?

1337
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:21,924
[smacked across the face]

1338
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:22,891
John!

1339
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,593
That's the last time
you'll ever touch me!

1340
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,127
Stop it!

1341
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:25,994
Go ahead and hit me!

1342
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,262
It's not the first
punch I've taken!

1343
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:32,000
Back off or I'll
shoot you right now!

1344
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:32,634
Kenny!

1345
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,535
[gunshot]

1346
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,604
[Pati screams]

1347
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:42,744
[heavy breathing]

1348
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,914
The next one won't be a warning.

1349
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,952
Move away from the gun.

1350
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:54,189
Okay.

1351
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,991
It's all right, baby girl.

1352
01:14:56,024 --> 01:15:02,231
Let them do what they gotta do.

1353
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:05,801
I'm not keeping them from you.

1354
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,237
You're in on this with them?

1355
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:12,674
Let's just say we're
here for different reasons.

1356
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:17,246
[crickets chirping
and footsteps]

1357
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,780
Where are we going?

1358
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,315
I'll tell you when to stop.

1359
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:28,557
Just keep going.

1360
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,859
Are you okay?

1361
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,728
I'm fine.

1362
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:39,368
[footsteps]

1363
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:47,609
[Pati grunts]

1364
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,318
Don't help them.

1365
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,820
Fine.

1366
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:06,862
[Pati grunts]

1367
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,001
Come on!

1368
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:21,043
[Pati grunts and Joe coughs]

1369
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:29,885
You can stop now.

1370
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:37,926
[sounds of nature]

1371
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:47,970
[sounds of nature]

1372
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:58,013
[sounds of nature]

1373
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,988
[drops shovel]

1374
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,756
Start digging.

1375
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,258
I'm not gonna do that.

1376
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,294
You had no
problem doing it before.

1377
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,795
This has gone far enough.

1378
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:19,868
[Andrea grunts and Pati screams]

1379
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:24,740
What's this about, Andrea?

1380
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:28,110
Do you think I'm playing games?!

1381
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:31,413
Dig!

1382
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:39,454
[sound of digging]

1383
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:49,431
[Joe coughs]

1384
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:57,472
[sound of digging]

1385
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:05,447
Get that fuckin'
camera out of my face.

1386
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:11,787
[sound of nature and digging]

1387
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,124
You're almost there.

1388
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,393
This won't change a thing.

1389
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,628
It will for me.

1390
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:23,865
Did you know, I was content
watching daddy suffer a long,

1391
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,001
painful death?

1392
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,538
His punishment for
everything he did to us.

1393
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:34,276
But John and Kenny made me
realize that wasn't enough.

1394
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,411
They made me realize
people should be held

1395
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,513
accountable for their actions.

1396
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,549
[shovel drops]

1397
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:48,023
[sounds of nature]

1398
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:55,397
I'm done.

1399
01:18:55,430 --> 01:19:03,438
[footsteps and sound of nature]

1400
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:11,346
[footsteps and sound of nature]

1401
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:19,387
[moving around outside]

1402
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:29,431
[moving around outside]

1403
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:41,376
[digging]

1404
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:51,419
[digging]

1405
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:59,895
[heavy breathing]

1406
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:09,938
[heavy breathing]

1407
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:20,515
[Andrea cries]

1408
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:30,525
[Andrea cries]

1409
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:40,569
[Andrea cries]

01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:50,445
[Andrea coughs]

1411
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:54,416
John.

1412
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:59,221
What the fuck?

1413
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:02,023
What'd the three of you do?

1414
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,993
Not me.

1415
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,563
Them.

1416
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,999
She was my baby.

1417
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,400
Kristen?

1418
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,436
The one mom and dad
made you give up?

1419
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:18,607
The one they took from me.

1420
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,376
You killed her baby?

1421
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,345
Which one of you did it?

1422
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,046
Which one of you
killed an infant?

1423
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:30,452
It was the both of them.

1424
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,322
You and Kenny
were gone that night.

1425
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:37,125
You were out with your friends.

1426
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:40,962
Who could blame you for
never wanting to be at home.

1427
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:45,267
I was sleeping in my room and
Kristen was in her bassinet.

1428
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,736
She wasn't even a week old.

1429
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:50,739
I woke up in the middle of
the night, call it mother's

1430
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:56,011
intuition, and she was gone.

1431
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,079
I knew it was them right away.

1432
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,116
And I thought they'd
taken her to the basement.

1433
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:04,119
But it was worse.

1434
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:08,423
I saw mom running
into the woods.

1435
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,459
I chased after her
and wound up here.

1436
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:16,231
They had already dug her grave.

1437
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,434
And mom threw my baby,
she threw her into this hole

1438
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:24,572
like a piece of garbage,
and daddy,

1439
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,642
you crushed her skull
with that brick.

1440
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:28,777
I tried to stop them.

1441
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,645
I did.

1442
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:35,016
But mom beat me with her
gun and said she'd shoot me.

1443
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,787
And daddy, do you remember what
you said to me when I was on

1444
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,590
the ground bleeding and crying.

1445
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,225
"It's for the best, baby girl.

1446
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:47,095
"It's for the best".

1447
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,497
Why?

1448
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,166
Why did you do that?

1449
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,801
ÚCause that's what mom wanted.

1450
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,703
When did mom ever
have a say with dad?

1451
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:58,239
When she threatened to turn him
in for everything he did to us.

1452
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,343
Well what did your baby
have to do with that?

1453
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:03,111
Make me understand!

1454
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,579
You should have left this alone.

1455
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:06,581
Left what alone?!

1456
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:07,682
You don't wanna know.

1457
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:08,750
I wanna know!

1458
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,586
I wanna know how you could
kill your granddaughter!

1459
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,089
She wasn't his granddaughter.

1460
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,824
What?

1461
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:20,495
She was perfect.

1462
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:24,466
Her eyes were beautiful,
her skin,

1463
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,702
she looked just like her father.

1464
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,771
No fuckin' way.

1465
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,674
Are you serious?

1466
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,844
You fuckin' did that to her?

1467
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,412
And you kept it?

1468
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:38,847
She was our baby.

1469
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,849
It was a freak.

1470
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:42,317
No, she wasn't!

1471
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,252
You just didn't
wanna lose your husband!

1472
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,286
What were you thinking?

1473
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,323
That's why you
made him kill her!

1474
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,526
I tried to turn you
in, but I couldn't.

1475
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,662
When I left that night, I
never planned on coming back.

1476
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,765
But I wanted you to see Shannon.

1477
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:00,268
I wanted you to
see what you'd lost.

1478
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:04,172
Well you showed me.

1479
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:09,210
I'm feeling all teary-eyed
about the damage I've done.

1480
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,579
What did you want from me?

1481
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:16,384
Some sort of
deathbed revelation?

1482
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:20,155
Find the error of my ways?

1483
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:25,894
I don't give a shit about
any of the three of you,

1484
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:30,498
Shannon, or your dead baby.

1485
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:38,506
I don't care what you
say or what you do.

1486
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,509
I've made more impact
on your lives than any

1487
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:44,479
of you ever made on mine.

1488
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:45,613
You fuckin' piece of shit!

1489
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:46,514
[glitching sound]

1490
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:47,682
Think you're gonna
have the final say?!

1491
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:49,150
John!

1492
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,418
There's no way to
unfuck what you've done!

1493
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:51,419
Not here!

1494
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,554
Not this way!

1495
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:55,824
Am I impacting your life now?!

1496
01:24:55,857 --> 01:25:03,865
[struggle between everyone]

1497
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,567
[gun shots]

1498
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,470
Kenny get down!

1499
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,737
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1500
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:17,779
[screaming and gunshots]

1501
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:27,489
Shit!

1502
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:30,525
[footsteps]

1503
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,828
Jesus.

1504
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,930
[screaming and gunshots]

1505
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:44,172
[sobbing]

1506
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,242
Jesus Christ.

1507
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,576
Keep an eye on them.

1508
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,778
I don't think
they're going anywhere.

1509
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:55,750
[heavy breathing]

1510
01:25:55,783 --> 01:26:03,791
[footsteps]

1511
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:13,835
[footsteps]

1512
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:22,944
[sounds of nature]

1513
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,445
[gunshots]

1514
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:25,313
Mother fucker.

1515
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:33,388
[screaming and gunshots]

1516
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:41,429
[footsteps]

1517
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,833
[gun shot]

1518
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:53,875
[footsteps]

1519
01:26:55,843 --> 01:27:03,851
[sobbing]

1520
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:06,354
[gunshots]

1521
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:14,395
[screaming and sobbing]

1522
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:19,500
Don't you fuckin' die!

1523
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:22,003
I hope I ruin your plans.

1524
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,371
No!

1525
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:28,476
I knew you valued
your pathetic life.

1526
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:31,412
Now get up.

1527
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:34,382
I can't.

1528
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,785
It's amazing what you can do
when you put your mind to it.

1529
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:38,987
[Pati sobs]

1530
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,421
I told you to get up!

1531
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:48,363
[Pati screams and sobs]

1532
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,731
Move!

1533
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:57,772
[Pati sobs]

1534
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:09,384
[thunder rolls]

1535
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:21,629
[footsteps]

1536
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,001
[sound of nature]

1537
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:35,043
[thunder rolls]

1538
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:44,585
I'll never understand.

1539
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:47,822
You left your baby
in a shallow grave

1540
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:51,025
and you let them
get away with it.

1541
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:56,431
You let dad get away with
it, like she didn't matter.

1542
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,432
And then you used Shannon
to try to get some sort

1543
01:28:57,465 --> 01:29:01,169
of validation from him.

1544
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:05,940
We all have to
answer for our actions.

1545
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:11,446
There's no secret room where
we can hide from mom and dad.

1546
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:15,416
Shannon's better off this way.

1547
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:19,954
[Andrea screams]

1548
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:21,456
Hey, get back here.

1549
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,424
No!

1550
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:29,464
[thunder rolls]

1551
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:32,900
Are you done?

1552
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:38,639
Yeah, she's in there.

1553
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:44,445
[thunder rolls]

1554
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:52,487
[sobbing]

1555
01:29:54,522 --> 01:30:01,696
[sobbing]

1556
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:06,467
You need a hand?

1557
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:13,241
I'm fine.

1558
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:21,482
[footsteps]

1559
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:31,526
[footsteps]

1560
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:42,804
[door opens]

1561
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:53,848
[rain and thunder]

1562
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:07,061
Let's bring them down.

1563
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:17,171
Let's bring them down.

1564
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:23,811
What is that?

1565
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,646
So what do you do?

1566
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,282
You sit down here
and watch these?

1567
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,085
John what's on these tapes?

1568
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,323
Yeah, John, what's on the tapes?

1569
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:39,293
Shut up.

1570
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:42,730
I wanna know.

1571
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,799
I really need you to remember.

1572
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:47,869
My three kids.

1573
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:55,743
One of them runs away from home,
one of them has memory block,

1574
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:01,916
and one hides behind the bottle.

1575
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,285
No more hiding.

1576
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:12,326
To destroy your demons,
first you have to face them.

1577
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:20,334
You and I are on
those tapes, with dad.

1578
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:25,339
I'm sure Andrea's
on some of them, too.

1579
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,809
Mom worked one of the cameras.

1580
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:32,947
She'd move all around us.

1581
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:37,852
And they had their
second camera on a tripod.

1582
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:45,760
He wanted to
cover all the angles.

1583
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,329
It started when we moved here.

1584
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:56,203
After we came back from
Helen's, down here in this room.

1585
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,106
The secret room.

1586
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:02,043
That's what Andrea called it.

1587
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:05,279
He probably started molesting
her at the other house.

1588
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:10,318
I don't know.

1589
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:14,422
Andrea came up to
our room that night.

1590
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:17,158
Said she had found a
room in the basement.

1591
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:19,727
That's right.

1592
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,664
She said it was a secret room.

1593
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:26,033
Where the three of us
could hide from mom and dad.

1594
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:29,236
And they'd never find us.

1595
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:36,143
But when we got down here
they were waiting for us,

1596
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:41,282
with the cameras.

1597
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:44,986
You put her up to
that, didn't you?

1598
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:47,855
Then he made us undress.

1599
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:53,160
[thunder and rain]

1600
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:57,431
He started touching you.

1601
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:01,435
Then he made me come over.

1602
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:04,372
"Don't be afraid of
the cameras, Kenny.

1603
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:10,444
Your name's gonna
be up in lights..."

1604
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:13,714
I remember
everything you did to us.

1605
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,083
And everything you
made us do to you.

1606
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:18,352
For years!

1607
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:26,394
[tears through boxes]

1608
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:30,965
Is this all of them?!

1609
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,400
Is it?!

1610
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:34,468
It's all of them.

1611
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,270
The masters anyway.

1612
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:39,507
You made copies,
you scumbag fuck?!

1613
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,744
[beats Joe while Pati sobs]

1614
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:47,448
Where are they?!

1615
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:51,452
They're all over the place.

1616
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,321
Where are the fuckin' copies?!

1617
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:58,492
The two of you are
gonna live forever.

1618
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:04,298
[heavy breathing]

1619
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:12,339
[Joe is thrown to the
floor and Pati screams]

1620
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,942
What'd you do with them?!

1621
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:22,983
The internet's a
wonderful thing.

1622
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:33,394
Well, this is our movie.

1623
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:41,435
[thunder rolls]

1624
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:48,576
And the two of you
are the stars now.

1625
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:56,817
[destroys tapes]

1626
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:06,861
[destroys tapes]

1627
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:11,465
The broken parents.

[police sirens]

1629
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:20,908
Time's up.

[thunder rolls]

1632
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:48,035
When we were kids,
you terrified us.

1633
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:52,473
We lived in constant fear.

1634
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:59,313
Every time you raised your
voices, walked into a room,

1635
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:03,417
or even looked our way.

1636
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:07,922
You were these imposing figures.

1637
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:10,291
Bigger than life.

Well not anymore.

1642
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:28,475
Now that we're grown and
on a level playing field,

1643
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,979
we can see the both of
you for what you really are.

No, Kenny.

1648
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:46,293
Please.

1649
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:49,663
Please no.

1650
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,967
It wasn't all bad.

1651
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,536

[Pati sobs]

1656
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:31,238
Broken by life.

1657
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:35,576
So what are you?

1658
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,645
Free.

Now!

1681
01:39:58,258 --> 01:39:58,692
