00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,001
<i>(man)</i> The Brothers Grimm, Your Majesty.

2
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>(woman)</i> Good day, gentlemen.

3
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:16,163
Thank you so much for coming.

4
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:27,161
I suppose you're wondering why anyone
my age would request an audience...

5
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:30,130
...with the authors of children's stories.

6
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:33,204
Your letter was most intriguing, madam.

7
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:37,763
I find your collection of folk tales
quite brilliant actually.

8
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,763
Thank you.

9
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:42,366
But I must say I was terribly disturbed...

10
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:46,491
...when I read your version
of <i>The Little Cinder Girl.</i>

11
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:50,644
There are those
who swear Perrault's telling...

12
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:54,088
...with its fairy godmother
and magic pumpkins...

13
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,844
...would be closer to the truth.

14
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,844
Some claim the shoe was made of fur.

15
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,492
Others insist it was glass.

16
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:03,642
Well, I guess we'll never know.

17
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,768
<i>(Grimm #2)</i> Forgive me, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,685
Might I enquire about the painting?

19
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:10,763
She's really quite er...

20
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,126
...extraordinary.

21
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,203
Her name was Danielle...

22
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,522
...de Barbarac.

23
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,603
And this...

24
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:23,089
...was her glass slipper.

25
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:34,722
Perhaps you will allow me
to set the record straight?

26
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,690
Then it's true... the story?

27
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,923
<i>(woman)</i> Yes. Quite.

28
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,003
Now, then.

29
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:45,443
What is that phrase you use?

30
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,443
Oh, yes.

31
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,523
Once upon a time...

32
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:53,602
...there lived a young girl...

33
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:57,162
...who loved her father very much.

34
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:10,363
(girl)
<i>Oh, Paulette, it feels just like Christmas!</i>

35
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:13,171
I get a mother and sisters all in one day!

36
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:17,848
Yes, it's going to be very exciting here,
what with the Baroness and all...

37
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:19,963
Oh, hold still!

38
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,203
The master deserves
some happiness after all this time...

39
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,362
...bringing up the child on his own.

40
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:27,044
She must be lovely.

41
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,123
I hope she likes me.

42
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:30,531
She'll love you.

43
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:33,888
Just be the little angel
I know is in there somewhere.

44
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:37,681
And don't chew on the bones at dinner
and give yourself away.

45
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,364
<i>(banging)</i>

46
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:42,046
Child, your father arrives any moment!

47
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,523
Gustave, I told you!

48
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:47,806
Not today!

49
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,406
You look like a girl!

50
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:52,289
That's what I am, halfwit!

51
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,363
Yeah, but today you look it!

52
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,048
Boy or girl, I can still whip <i>you.</i>

53
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,804
Hah!

54
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,123
Look lively, it's the master.

55
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,760
Welcome home, Monsieur le seigneur.

56
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,047
I see you have brought us a baroness.

57
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:42,408
I have brought you an entire household,
Maurice.

58
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,801
But I seem to be missing a daughter.

59
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,120
<i>(door opens)</i>

60
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:18,363
Oh... Auguste.

61
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,926
It's absolutely charming, really.

62
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,206
Papa!

63
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,283
Oh ho ho!

64
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,923
Oh, look at you, just as I left.

65
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:31,572
I'll wager your friend Gustave is around here.

66
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,643
No, sir! I slaughtered him.

67
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:34,881
He's...

68
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,080
<i>(Auguste laughs)</i> Well, so you did.

69
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,520
I had hoped to present a little lady.

70
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,603
I suppose you'll have to do.

71
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:45,966
Danielle...

72
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:49,965
...may I present
the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent...

73
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,441
...and her daughters,
Marguerite and Jacqueline.

74
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:55,126
Hello, Danielle. At last we meet.

75
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,806
Your father speaks of nothing else.

76
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:01,885
Ladies, say hello to your new stepsister.

77
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,611
<i>(both)</i> Mademoiselle.

78
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,363
<i>Utopia.</i>

79
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,203
It means paradise.

80
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:15,485
This may be a bit thick for an eight-year-old.

81
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,722
But we could add it to our library.

82
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,768
Will you read some?

83
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,843
It's been a very long day.

84
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:23,923
And you're a husband now.

85
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,443
Yes, I'm a husband.

86
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,602
But a father first and for ever.

87
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:33,607
We've been two peas in a pod,
you and I, for a long time.

88
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:36,729
I suppose this will take some getting used to.

89
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:41,091
Did you see the way they ate their supper?

90
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,128
It was perfect!

91
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,884
Like a dance!

92
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:47,247
- Do you like them?
- Very much.

93
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,323
Good, good.

94
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,411
Because I have to go
to Avignon in a fortnight.

95
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,962
- But you just got back!
- I know.

96
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,441
- For how long?
- Only... three weeks.

97
00:07:58,532 --> 00:07:59,521
- One.
- Two.

98
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,046
- One!
- T... two.

99
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,443
All right, one.

100
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,883
Come on, go to sleep.

101
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,690
Kiss.

102
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:15,763
Sleep tight.

103
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,443
<i>(cock crows)</i>

104
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:23,209
<i>(laughs)</i>

105
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,090
I've never seen so many gloomy faces
around here.

106
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,163
I shall be back in a week.

107
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:32,689
Then go. The sooner you leave,
the sooner we can celebrate your return.

108
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:37,602
Perhaps by then, the three of you
will know each other better.

109
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:41,605
Huh? I'm counting on you
to teach them the ropes around here.

110
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:46,004
The Baroness isn't used
to getting her hands dirty.

111
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,169
Thank you, Maurice.

112
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,288
Safe journey, master.

113
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,450
Come along, ladies. Back to your lessons.

114
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:17,412
Wait! It's tradition.

115
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,483
He always waves at the gate.

No.

Papa!

127
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:36,368
<i>(Baroness)</i> Auguste.

You cannot leave me here!

<i>A man who was still a boy...</i>

134
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,530
<i>... in many, many ways.</i>

135

<i>(man)</i> I signed a marriage treaty

137
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,882
<i>(woman)</i> But he does not love her, my lord.

138
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,327
- It's not about love!
- Perhaps it should be.

139
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,609
If he is to become King,
he must accept his responsibilities.

140
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:25,446
A sapling cannot grow
in the shadow of a mighty oak, Francis.

141
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,649

- He needs a good whipping.

<i>(woman)</i> Really, Francis!

143

Oh, no, you don't.

Thief! This will teach you
to steal my father's horse!

156
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,528
Mine slipped his shoe. I have no choice.

00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:04,729
- And our choice is what? To let you?
- I was borrowing it.

158

Get out, or I'll wake the house.

Forgive me, Your Highness.
I did not see you.

162
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,691
Your aim would suggest otherwise.

163
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,842
And for that I know I must die.

164

...speak of this to no-one and er...

166
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,683
...I shall be lenient.

167
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:37,802
We have other horses, Highness.

168
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,883
Younger, if that is your wish.

169
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:44,367
I wish for nothing more
than to be free of my gilded cage.

170
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,323
For your silence.

171
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:00,447
I asked for four-minute eggs,
not four one-minute eggs.

172
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,000
And where in God's name is our bread?!

173
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,686
It's just coming out of the oven, my lady.

Marguerite, precious...

00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,968
...what do I always say about tone?

176
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:13,647
A lady of breeding
ought never to raise her voice...

177
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:16,963
...above the gentle hum of
<i>(whispers)</i> a whispering wind.

178
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:23,328
Jacqueline, dear. Do not speak
unless you can improve the silence.

179
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,448
I was not shrill, I was resonant.

180
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,568
A courtier knows the difference.

181
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:31,611
I doubt your style of resonance
would be permitted in the Royal Court.

182
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,411
I'm not going to the Royal Court,
am I, Mother?

183
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:39,247
No-one is. Except some Spanish pig
they have the nerve to call a princess.

184
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:42,051
Darling, nothing is final until you're dead.

185
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:44,521
And even then I'm sure God negotiates.

186
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:51,882
Why is there no salt on this table?

187
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:54,807
Danielle!

188
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,603
Coming!

189
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,683
She's in one of her moods!

190
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,763
Did the sun rise in the east?

191
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,570
Yes, Louise, it did.

192
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,962
And it is going to be a beautiful day!

193
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:09,043
Look at all those feathers!

194
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:11,123
Child, where did you get this?

195
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,487
From an angel of mercy.

196
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,051
I know what to do with them.

197
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,521
Maurice?

198
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:21,161
If the Baroness can sell
your husband to pay her taxes...

199
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,208
...then these can bring him home.

200
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,283
The Court will have to let him go.

201
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:29,411
But the King has sold him to Cartier.
He's bound for the Americas.

202
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:32,564
This is our home,
and I will not see it fall apart.

203
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,449
<i>(Rodmilla)</i> We are waiting!

204
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,523
Take heed, mistress...

205
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,126
...or these coins are as good as hers.

206
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,083
Morning, madame...

207
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,447
...Marguerite, Jacqueline.

208
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,523
I trust you slept well.

209
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,243
What kept you?

210
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:57,449
I fell off the ladder in the orchard,
but I am better now.

211
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,092
Someone's been reading
in the fireplace again.

212
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,163
Look at you. Ash and soot everywhere.

213
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,767
Some people read
because they cannot think for themselves.

214
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,571
Why don't you sleep with the pigs,
Cinder-Soot...

215
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,882
...if you insist on smelling like one?

216
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,202
<i>(Rodmilla)</i> That was harsh, Marguerite.

217
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,203
Danielle, come here, child.

218
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:21,685
Your appearance does reflect
a certain... crudeness, my dear.

219
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,763
What can I do to make you try?

220
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,643
I do try, Stepmother.

221
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,128
I do wish to please you.

222
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,248
Sometimes, I sit on my own...

223
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:34,284
...and try to think of what else I could do,
how to act...

224
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:37,170
Oh, calm down, child. Relax.

225
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,567
Perhaps if we brought back Maurice,
I would not offend you so.

226
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,246
It is your manner that offends, Danielle.

227
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:53,211
Throughout these hard times,
I have sheltered you and cared for you.

228
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:57,365
All that I ask in return
is that you help me here without complaint.

229
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,841
Is that such an extraordinary request?

230
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,888
- No, my lady.
- Very well.

231
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:06,090
We shall have no more talk
of servants coming back. Understood?

232
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,163
Yes, my lady.

233
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,363
After all that I do!

234
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,363
After all I have done!

235
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:16,680
It's never enough.

236
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,881
Eggs are cold.

237
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,043
<i>(man)</i> Oh, no, there's nothing there!

238
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,088
There's nothing!

239
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:34,561
I beg you, please leave us alone.

240
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:35,687
Please!

241
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:39,726
- No, no, not that.
- Out of the way, old man!

242
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,205
<i>(whistles)</i>

243
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,682
- Get on the horses!
- It's the Royal Guard! Run!

244
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,163
God, I don't believe this!

245
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,851
The painting...

246
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,081
Please, for the love of God, the painting.

247
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:05,085
- That man, he's getting away.
- The Guard will assist you. I cannot.

248
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,366
Please, sir!

249
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:09,012
It is... my life.

250
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,491
<i>(yells)</i>

251
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:25,320
Aaagh!

252
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:28,840
Ugly bastard! Fast!

253
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,249
Yah!

254
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:47,323
Give it to me! Give it to me!

255
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:02,523
Got you! Give me that!

256
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,324
Aaargh!

257
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,043
No. Too small.

258
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,807
It needs to draw some attention.

259
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:44,170
I fear, Baroness,
anything larger might make her fall over.

260
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:47,449
Perhaps you are right.
I shall have to look elsewhere.

261
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:49,523
I have just the thing!

262
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,681
Have you lost your marbles?

263
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:55,206
Do you know what the punishment is...

264
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,250
...for servants who dress above their station?

265
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:00,368
Five days in the stocks.

266
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,966
You'd do the same for me, admit it.

267
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,921
Me? Pretend to be a courtier?

268
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:09,971
Prancing round like some nobleman
when I've never been to court.

269
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:11,565
And neither have you!

270
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,404
Then I won't be recognised.

271
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:16,529
Hand me that gown so I can be on my way.

272
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:19,648
They'll never buy it.

273
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:21,768
You are too sweet.

274
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:24,924
They'll never buy a servant
with 20 gold francs either.

275
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:27,003
I am Maurice's only hope.

276
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,812
And the Baroness, what did you tell her?

277
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,883
I am picking wild flowers.

278
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,008
Gustave, can you still see her?

279
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:38,607
- They're buying a brooch.
- Unbelievable.

280
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:41,889
She ignores the manor,
blames us for her debt...

281
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,850
...and still pretends to have money to burn.

282
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,043
Don't you dare laugh.

283
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,569
I'm coming out.

284
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,209
The shoes are too big.

285
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,041
Nobody will be looking at your feet.

286
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,692
Yards of fabric and I still feel naked.

287
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,440
If you're going to be a noblewoman...

288
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,523
...you must play the part.

289
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,283
You look down to no-one.

290
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:25,162
I am just a servant in a nice dress.

291
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:28,692
Come.
We have to do something with that hair.

292
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:36,441
Oh!

293
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:37,760
Thank you.

294
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:40,207
- Henry, you promised.
- I know.

295
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,283
I lied.

296
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:45,443
I thought...

297
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,683
...I'd see the world before
I gave up my life to God and country.

298
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:50,808
Why on earth did you stop?

299
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,610
I suppose I lack conviction.

300
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:54,410
You seem to have it in spades.

301
00:22:54,492 --> 00:22:57,768
Besides, you claimed
it was a matter of life and death.

302
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:00,525
A woman always is, Sire.

303
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:06,208
She laughs at me, sir,
as if she knows something I do not.

304
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,362
The lady had many secrets.

305
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,443
I merely painted one of them.

306
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:15,401
Signor da Vinci has been invited
to the palace as the artist in residence.

307
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:16,925
Leonardo da Vinci?

308
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:20,163
Michelangelo was trapped
under a ceiling in Rome.

309
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:21,844
I'm just a second choice.

310
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:25,288
I am on my way to Genoa
and I find my salvation on the highway!

311
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:28,045
Sir, you are the founder
of forward thinking...

312
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,407
...and my father is the king of backward.

313
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,722
Could you talk him into the 16th century?

314
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,121
Captain Laurent, do translate.

315
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:39,251
Prince Henry suffers from
an arranged marriage, signore...

316
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:40,811
...among other things.

317
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,723
Oh! Your Highness.

318
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,846
What a lovely surprise.

319
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:01,205
To what do we owe this great honour?

320
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,760
I'm returning your horse, Baroness.

321
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:06,488
- Oh. Was it missing?
- Yes.

322
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,961
I took the liberty of borrowing it earlier.

323
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:11,088
I'm afraid I scared your servant...

324
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:15,085
A young lady with a...
quite a good arm, actually.

325
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,242
- She is mute, my lord.
- Really?

326
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,764
She spoke quite forcefully.

327
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,922
Well, it comes and goes.

328
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:25,527
But as always Your Highness
is welcome to anything he wishes.

329
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:27,603
Anything at all.

330
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,048
- <i>(gasps)</i>
- Wait for me!

331
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:32,491
Oh, ladies.

332
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,130
Here you are.

333
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:37,490
<i>(both)</i> Your Highness.

334
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:43,640
Your Highness, may I present
Marguerite Francoise Louise...

335
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,404
...of the House of Ghent?

336
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:47,642
And Jacqueline.

337
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,883
You may indeed.

338
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:54,204
Ladies, forgive me, but you seem
to have blossomed overnight.

339
00:24:55,892 --> 00:24:57,120
We're so looking forward...

340
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:01,091
...to celebrating the engagement
to your own Spanish rose.

341
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:03,561
Yes, well, there have been...

342
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:07,327
...several new developments
with regards to Spain.

343
00:25:07,412 --> 00:25:10,848
I must say, Marguerite, that brooch is...

344
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:12,285
...stunning.

345
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:14,363
This old thing?

346
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:16,763
You're too kind.

347
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,600
These developments...

348
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,683
...I trust are for the best?

349
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:27,245
Let us hope so.

350
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:29,129
Good day, ladies.

351
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,603
Make way for the lady.

352
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:41,207
Come on, move it!

353
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:45,963
Lord, give me strength.

354
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,726
Come on, come on!

355
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:58,925
I wish to address the issue of this gentleman.

356
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:02,641
He is my servant and I am here
to pay the debt against him.

357
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:04,768
You're too late, he's paid for.

358
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:07,241
I can pay you 20 gold francs.

359
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:09,766
You can have me for 20 gold francs.
Drive on!

360
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:12,483
I demand you release him at once...

361
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,927
...or I shall take this matter to the King.

362
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:18,641
The King is the one that sold him.
He's now the property of Cartier.

363
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,849
He is not property at all,
you ill-mannered tub of guts.

364
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,004
Do you think it right
to chain people like chattel?

365
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,322
I demand you release him at once!

366
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,130
Get out of my way!

367
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:33,285
- You dare raise your voice to a lady, sir?
- Your Highness...

368
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,123
F-Forgive me, Sire.

369
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:38,683
I meant no disrespect.

370
00:27:39,412 --> 00:27:41,403
It's just er...

371
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:45,485
I'm following orders. It's my job
to take these thieves to the coast.

372
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:48,211
A servant is not a thief, Your Highness...

373
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,931
...and those who are cannot help themselves.

374
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,003
Really?

375
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,684
Well, then. By all means...

376
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:56,490
...enlighten us.

377
00:27:56,572 --> 00:28:03,762
If you suffer your people to be ill-educated
and their manners corrupted from infancy...

378
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:08,721
...then punish them for those crimes to which
their first education disposed them...

379
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,121
...what else is to be concluded, Sire...

380
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:14,284
...but that you first make thieves
and then punish them?

381
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,203
Well, there you have it.

382
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,884
Release him.

383
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:26,247
- But, Sire...
- I said...

384
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:28,243
...release him!

385
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,323
Yes, Sire.

386
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,532
I thought I was looking at your mother.

387
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,250
Meet me at the bridge.

388
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,130
Prepare the horses! We will leave at once!

389
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,123
I thank you, Your Highness.

390
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,723
Have we met?

391
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,761
I do not believe so, Your Highness.

392
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:13,086
I could have sworn
I knew every courtier in the province.

393
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,891
Well... I'm visiting a cousin.

394
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,963
- Who?
- My cousin.

395
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:20,043
Yes, you said that. Which one?

396
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:23,203
The only one I have, Sire.

397
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,010
Are you coy on purpose...

398
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:28,050
...or do you honestly refuse
to tell me your name?

399
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,930
No! And yes.

400
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:36,245
Then, pray, tell me your cousin's name
so I might call upon <i>her</i> to learn who you are.

401
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:40,166
Anyone who can quote Thomas More
is well worth the effort.

402
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:44,243
The Prince has read <i>Utopia?</i>

403
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,647
I found it sentimental and dull.

404
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:51,361
I confess, the plight
of the everyday rustic bores me.

405
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:54,649
I gather you do not converse
with many peasants.

406
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:57,371
<i>(chuckles)</i> Certainly not, no! Naturally.

407
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:01,127
Excuse me, Sire,
but there is nothing natural about it.

408
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:06,161
A country's character is defined
by its everyday rustics, as you call them.

409
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:10,450
They are the legs you stand on.
That position demands respect, not...

410
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:14,286
Am I to understand
that you find me arrogant?

411
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:18,325
Well, you gave one man back his life...

412
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:21,051
...but did you even glance at the others?

413
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:24,963
Please, I beg of you...

414
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:27,043
...a name. Any name.

415
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,802
I fear that the only name to leave you with...

416
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,929
...is Comtesse Nicole de Lancret.

417
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,803
There now.

418
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:43,928
That wasn't so hard.

419
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,604
Oh, Henry!

420
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:47,045
You're back.

421
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,406
Hello, Mother.

422
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:51,370
The King would like a word with you.

423
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,249
Several, in fact.

424
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:54,811
He usually does.

425
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:56,530
I shall be right in.

426
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:27,049
Ooh!

427
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,362
Oooh-ho-ho!

428
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:18,840
You, sir, are restricted to the grounds.

429
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:20,365
Am I under house arrest?

430
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:23,171
Do not mock me, boy,
for I am in a foul disposition.

431
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:25,402
- And I will have my way.
- Or what?

432
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,325
You'll send me to the Americas
like some criminal?

433
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,687
All for the sake of your stupid contract.

434
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:32,763
You are the Crown Prince of France.

435
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,241
And it is my life.

436
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:37,323
Francis, sit down before you have a stroke.

437
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:39,368
Really, the two of you.

438
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,771
Sweetheart...

439
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:45,721
...you were born to privilege,
and with that comes specific obligations.

440
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:48,451
Forgive me, Mother,
but marriage to a stranger...

441
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,966
...never made anyone
in this room very happy.

442
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:56,208
Marry Gabriela by the next full moon
or I will strike at you in any way I can.

443
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:58,886
What's it to be, Father? Hot oil or the rack?

444
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,042
I will simply deny you the crown...

445
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:04,123
...and... live for ever!

446
00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:05,440
Good.

447
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:06,885
Agreed.

448
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,769
I don't want it.

449
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,563
He's your son!

450
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,248
D Somebody's in trouble!

451
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,687
What do you mean?

452
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:25,683
You stupid, stupid girl!

453
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,683
How dare you do this to me?

454
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,002
To Marguerite?
It all makes me sick!

455
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,448
It's deceitfulness
and I will not have it in this house!

456
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,124
What did I do?

457
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:37,089
<i>(Marguerite)</i> Think, Danielle.

458
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:39,561
Think really hard.

459
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:50,204
Prince Henry stole our horse this morning?

460
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,281
Yes!

461
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:55,126
And that would explain
why he returned it this afternoon.

462
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:58,010
How dare you let him surprise us like that?

463
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:00,083
I'm sorry.

464
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:04,051
Luckily for you,
Marguerite turned in a beautiful performance.

465
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:08,330
She and the Prince had quite an interlude.

466
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:10,801
I shouldn't be surprised if he drops by again.

467
00:34:10,892 --> 00:34:14,043
Come, come!
I must know exactly what was said.

468
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,851
The simplest phrase can have a thousand
meanings.

469
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,526
He said you were forceful. What did you say?

470
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:26,285
L-I called him a thief, madam.

471
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:29,163
I did not recognise him.

472
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:31,765
<i>(laughs)</i>

473
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,243
Oh, Danielle.

474
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:39,449
You poor, little country girl.

475
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:47,211
Well, we must work extra hard
to make sure the manor is spotless.

476
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:51,251
We cannot have a royal bottom
sitting on a dirty chaise, can we?

477
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:53,209
No.

478
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,004
What is he doing here?

479
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,162
L-I have worked off your...

480
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:00,643
<i>My</i> debt, madame.

481
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,927
They told me I could go home.

482
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:04,843
Fine.

483
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:06,923
Go... catch a chicken!

484
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,443
Who, dear?

485
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:16,523
Comtesse Nicole de Lancret.

486
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,243
She's a cousin of...

487
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:22,005
Actually, I don't know who her cousin is.

488
00:35:22,092 --> 00:35:23,889
Surely you have heard of her?

489
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,405
Oh, darling...

490
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:29,883
...there are simply too many courtiers
to remember them all by name.

491
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:31,963
Why do you ask?

492
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:33,041
Mm?

493
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,123
Oh, never mind.

494
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:37,922
In honour of Signor da Vinci...

495
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,082
...I have decided to throw a ball.

496
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,128
A masked ball.

497
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:44,931
At which point,
you and I will strike a compromise.

498
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,730
Compromise? You?

499
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,370
If love is what you seek...

500
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:50,682
...I suggest you find it before then.

501
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:53,206
Five days hence, at the stroke of midnight...

502
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,762
...you will announce your engagement
to the girl of your choice...

503
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:59,491
...or... I will announce it for you.

504
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:01,369
Are we agreed?

505
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,289
What of your treaty?

506
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,648
Let me worry about Spain.
You've got bigger problems.

507
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,041
Choose wisely, Henry.

508
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:13,804
Divorce is only
something they do in England.

509
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,843
What news of the engagement?

510
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:27,921
Cancelled.

511
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:33,132
Rumour has it he must find himself
a bride before that very night.

512
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:35,601
Well, that doesn't give us very much time.

513
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,047
I shall need to know...

514
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:41,090
...who the competition is,
every move he makes...

515
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:43,527
...his agenda...

516
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,650
...and any other titbits you might pick up.

517
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:54,691
He's playing tennis with
the Marquis de Limoges tomorrow at noon.

518
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:59,368
A skin of such... elegance...

519
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:04,207
...concealing such... ruthlessness.

520
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:10,449
I've grown rather fond
of our intrigues together.

521
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,250
Surely you must know that.

522
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:15,725
I'm having an inkling, my lady.

523
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,683
When my daughter is Queen...

524
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,809
...perhaps we might come
to a new arrangement.

525
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:32,564
<i>(Paulette)</i> I'd have given anything
to see you all dressed up like a courtier.

526
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,961
Speaking to the Prince like a lady.

527
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,043
<i>(Danielle)</i> Scolding him is more like it.

528
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:40,010
I cannot believe
I gave him my mother's name.

529
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,683
The man is insufferable.

530
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,605
Yes. You've been saying that...

531
00:37:45,692 --> 00:37:47,569
...all day.

532
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:50,405
Well, it's as true now as it was this morning.

533
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:51,720
Oh!

534
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,201
Darling, he's royalty.

535
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,843
They're born like that.

536
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:02,520
Then I suppose the penalty for being wealthy
is having to live with the rich.

537
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,762
I'll bet he's quite charming...

538
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,763
...once you get to know him.

539
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,685
I think he and Marguerite deserve each other.

540
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:11,763
Oh! Bite your tongue!

541
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:16,642
The only throne I want her sitting on
is the one I have to clean every day.

542
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:20,922
(Rodmilla) <i>What's wrong with this one?</i>

543
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,003
- It's blue.
- Henry loves blue!

544
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,129
And 50 other girls
will be wearing the same colour.

545
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:28,521
Very good, Marguerite.

546
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:31,403
This one is too small.

547
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,926
We shall just have to get you a tighter cinch.

548
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,968
I cannot breathe as it is.

549
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:38,612
If one cannot breathe, one cannot eat.

550
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,808
Mother, focus, please!

551
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,690
Perhaps if I knew
what you were looking for!

552
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:45,490
Something fit for a queen!

553
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:54,083
Come, ladies. I have just the thing.

554
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:56,288
But we must speak of this to no-one.

555
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:58,363
Oh, I do love a good intrigue!

556
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:05,329
Waste not...

557
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,403
...want not.

558
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,483
Oh, perfect!

559
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,483
Oh, look at these shoes.

560
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,323
Where did you get these?

561
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:26,245
They're Danielle's dowry, for her wedding.

562
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:27,924
Cinderella? Married?

563
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,889
To who, the chimney sweep?

564
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:33,169
If that dress is hers,
perhaps she'll want to wear it to the ball.

565
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:36,688
Since when does a royal function
include commoners?

566
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,683
Well, never.

567
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:40,444
But she is our stepsister...

568
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:43,922
...and the invitation did say,
"To the ladies of the house".

569
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:46,651
- She's not of noble blood.
- And who would notice?

570
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,246
Honestly, Jacqueline, whose side are you on?

571
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:53,403
What are you doing?

572
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:59,208
Airing out your dress... for the masque.

573
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,965
Her dress? But you just said...

574
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:06,648
I suppose for a commoner, it'll have to do.
I mean, look at it.

575
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,041
It's practically an antique.

576
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:15,568
You wish me... to go to a masque?

577
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:17,927
- Mm.
- Of course.

578
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:20,603
I don't know what to say.

579
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,603
Say? Honestly, Danielle.

580
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:26,446
It hurts me you don't feel like
one of my daughters.

581
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:28,602
I only meant...

582
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,444
I thought we could all go
as one big happy family.

583
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:34,923
That is, if you complete your chores in time,
mind your manners till then.

584
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:43,203
What's the matter with her?

585
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,967
Oh... She doesn't want you to go.

586
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:51,012
<i>(Henry)</i> Do you really think
there is only one perfect mate?

587
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:55,005
<i>(Henry)</i> Do you really think
there is only one perfect mate?

588
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,048
As a matter of fact, I do.

589
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,123
How can you be certain to find them?

590
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:02,249
And if you find them,
are they really the one for you...

591
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,084
...or do you only think they are?

592
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:07,164
What if the person you're meant to be with
never appears?

593
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:10,324
Or she does, but...
but you're too distracted to notice?

594
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:12,289
You learn to pay attention.

595
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,363
Then, let's say...

596
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,967
...God puts two people on earth...

597
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:19,691
...and they are lucky enough
to find one another.

598
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:22,491
But... one of them gets hit by lightning.

599
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:24,563
Well, then what?

600
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,449
Is that it?

601
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:29,410
Or perchance you meet someone new
and marry again.

602
00:41:29,492 --> 00:41:32,609
Is that the lady you should be with?
Or was it the first?

603
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:36,844
When the two of them are side by side,
were they both the one for you...

604
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:39,082
...and you just met the first one first?

605
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:41,640
Or is the second one supposed to be first?

606
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,962
And is everything just chance...

607
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,808
...or are some things meant to be?

608
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:49,804
You cannot leave everything to fate, boy.

609
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:53,601
She's got a lot to do.
Sometimes you must give her a hand.

610
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:55,728
What's this project?

611
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:57,803
Would you care to see if they work?

612
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,883
<i>(laughing)</i>

613
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:16,043
<i>(pig grunts)</i>

614
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:53,683
It looks like rain.

615
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,125
<i>(screams)</i>

616
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,970
Signor da Vinci!

617
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:01,690
Are you all right?

618
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:04,969
I should leave walking on water
to the Son of God.

619
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,612
Fortunately, I tripped over an angel.

620
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,163
Comtesse!

621
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:12,686
Your Highness! Oh!

622
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:17,289
Oh, careful, it's very slippery right there.

623
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,929
Here, please. Allow me.

624
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:21,001
Oh!

625
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:23,322
Thank you.

626
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:34,443
Where are your attendants?

627
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:37,405
I decided to give them the day off.

628
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,483
<i>(laughs)</i> Day off?

629
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:41,483
From what? Life?

630
00:43:41,572 --> 00:43:44,564
Don't you tire of people waiting on you
all the time?

631
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:48,008
Yes, but... they're servants. It's what they do.

632
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:52,005
I wish I could dismiss mine
as easily as you do yours.

633
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:54,048
I must be going.

634
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,282
- You're angry with me.
- No.

635
00:43:56,452 --> 00:43:58,170
Admit it.

636
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,766
- Well, yes, if you must know.
- Why?

637
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:04,049
Because you are trying to bait me
with your snobbery.

638
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:08,442
I'm afraid, mademoiselle,
<i>you</i> are a walking contradiction...

639
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:10,682
...and I find that rather fascinating.

640
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:12,683
- Me?
- Yes, you.

641
00:44:12,772 --> 00:44:16,651
You spout the ideals of a Utopian society,
yet you live the life of a courtier.

642
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:20,441
You own all the land there is,
yet you take no pride in working it.

643
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,523
Is that not also a contradiction?

644
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:25,126
First I'm arrogant, and now I have no pride.

645
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:27,168
However do I manage that?

646
00:44:27,252 --> 00:44:30,881
You have everything
and still the world holds no joy.

647
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:35,409
Yet you make fun of those
who would see it for its possibilities.

648
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:38,723
How do you do it?

649
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:40,165
What?

650
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:44,609
Live each day with this kind of passion?
Don't you find it exhausting?

651
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:46,569
Only when I'm around you.

652
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,802
Why do you like to irritate me so?

653
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:51,008
Why do you rise to the occasion?

654
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:55,485
<i>(woman)</i> Danielle!

655
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,685
Er...

656
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:03,447
Forgive me, Your Highness,
I've lost track of the hour.

657
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:04,681
But the wind...

658
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:07,366
- It's perfect!
- I am sorry.

659
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:09,488
I'm playing tennis tomorrow.

660
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:11,642
- Will you come?
- I must go.

661
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:15,562
Why does she keep doing that?

662
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:19,683
Paulette.

663
00:45:19,772 --> 00:45:21,649
Where are the candlesticks?

664
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,324
We can hardly see our plates.

665
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:27,007
They're missing, my lady.
I've searched high and low.

666
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:29,128
The painting in the hall is gone too.

667
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:31,282
It seems we have a thief in our midst.

668
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:34,762
Hmm. So this is how I'm treated
after all our years together.

669
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,888
My husband's prize possessions!

670
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:41,966
Well, I shall just garnish your wages
until the pilfered items are returned.

671
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:44,930
- Is that quite understood?
- <i>(both)</i> Yes, ma'am.

672
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:50,365
Perhaps I shall ship you to the Americas
with all the other thieves.

673
00:45:50,452 --> 00:45:51,965
<i>(Jacqueline)</i> Oh. Didn't you hear?

674
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,964
The Prince asked the King
to release all those men.

675
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,008
- He didn't!
- Mmm.

676
00:45:57,092 --> 00:45:58,491
Now, by...

677
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:05,322
By royal decree,
any man who sails must be compensated.

678
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:07,085
Compensated!

679
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:10,289
Honestly! What is the world coming to?

680
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:13,842
I want to know who this Comtesse is
everyone keeps talking about.

681
00:46:13,932 --> 00:46:18,164
Ten courtiers were speaking of her today
and how the Prince fell all over himself.

682
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:22,040
<i>(Rodmilla)</i> We should find out
who she is and bury her.

683
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,730
<i>(cheering)</i>

684
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:47,843
<i>(chattering)</i>

685
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:15,327
You're looking well, Marguerite.

686
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:19,005
You're welcome to look, Your Highness.

687
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:44,523
Danielle de Barbarac.

688
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:47,723
You get prettier every week.

689
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:50,724
And you, Monsieur le Pieu,
are wasting your flattery.

690
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:54,202
It's a pity your soil's
the best in the province...

691
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,442
...and yet so poorly tended.

692
00:47:56,532 --> 00:47:59,046
We have limited resources, sir.

693
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:01,851
- We do the best we can.
- Anything I can do?

694
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:05,686
You should bring it up with the Baroness
and stick to shopping.

695
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:09,447
I'd rather discuss it with Danielle,
if you don't mind.

696
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,727
I may be twice your age, child,
but I'm well-endowed.

697
00:48:16,132 --> 00:48:18,123
As evidenced by my estate.

698
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:22,208
I've always had a soft spot
for the less fortunate.

699
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:24,362
You need a wealthy benefactor.

700
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:27,926
And I need a young lady with spirit.

701
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:29,650
Prunes?

702
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,601
No.

703
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:34,003
I'll buy nothing this week.

704
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:38,051
And you'd do well to remember
that without my generosity...

705
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:41,442
...your pathetic little farm
would cease to exist.

706
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:45,969
So I'd be very, very careful if I were you.

707
00:48:53,252 --> 00:48:55,243
Ooh! Horrible man!

708
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,927
If he didn't buy
a bushel of vegetables every week...

709
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:01,003
...I'd spit on him.

710
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:09,931
Here.

711
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:12,446
Never have you tasted anything so...

712
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,931
...delicious.

713
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:24,041
Mmm.

714
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:26,928
Don't even think about it.

715
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:28,650
Like it?

716
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,684
Like it?

717
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:33,969
Why, it's positively sinful.

718
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:35,770
What's it called?

719
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:37,410
Er... chocolate.

720
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:40,484
The Spanish monks keep sending bricks of it.

721
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:48,247
These are our servants, Your Highness.

722
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:50,482
Really? Oh, I'd love to meet them.

723
00:49:57,492 --> 00:49:59,483
Good day, ladies.

724
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:02,050
<i>(chicken squawks)</i>

725
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:08,807
What are you doing?
Trying to scare the Prince to death?

726
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,162
We were startled, that's all.

727
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:16,643
Were there just the two of you?

728
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:18,882
And the chicken, Your Highness.

729
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:23,812
We must press for a quick engagement.

730
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,122
We must press for a quick engagement.

731
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:29,203
Paris at Christmas.

732
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,283
Can you imagine?

733
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:37,489
No. I don't suppose you can.

734
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:43,004
My mother was hard on me too, you know.

735
00:50:43,852 --> 00:50:47,447
She taught me
that cleanliness was next to godliness.

736
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:51,762
She forced me to wash my face
at least 20 times a day...

737
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:54,286
...convinced it was never clean enough.

738
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:56,363
I was very grateful to her.

739
00:50:58,012 --> 00:51:00,480
She wanted me to be all that I could be.

740
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,683
And here I am...

741
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:07,563
...a baroness.

742
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:11,805
And Marguerite shall be Queen.

743
00:51:25,092 --> 00:51:27,652
It's a pity you never knew your mother.

744
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:32,448
There must be a little bit of her
in you somewhere.

745
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:38,172
I wish I knew what she looked like.

746
00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:41,927
Yes. Well, we must never feel sorry
for ourselves, must we?

747
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:45,891
No matter how bad things get,
they can always get worse.

748
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:48,683
Yes, madam.

749
00:51:52,732 --> 00:51:55,246
You have so much of your father in you.

750
00:51:56,372 --> 00:52:00,411
Sometimes I can almost see him
looking out through your eyes.

751
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,481
Really?

752
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,283
Yes, well...

753
00:52:06,132 --> 00:52:08,851
Your features are so... masculine.

754
00:52:12,252 --> 00:52:15,483
Well... to be raised by a man...

755
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:20,450
No wonder you're built for hard labour.

756
00:52:24,692 --> 00:52:27,001
Did you love my father?

757
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:30,643
Well, I barely knew him.

758
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:37,003
Now go away.

759
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,603
I'm tired.

760
00:52:58,932 --> 00:53:00,923
<i>(flapping)</i>

761
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:08,049
<i>(Danielle)</i> Look, Gustave! It's floating!

762
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:09,326
Why are you so happy?

763
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,290
You'll be swimming in manure
if they get married.

764
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:14,522
I don't know why it bothers you so.

765
00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:16,250
I couldn't care less.

766
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:19,847
You're lying! The Prince
would be your brother-in-law...

767
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:24,403
...and you, Comtesse de Lancret,
would be bringing them breakfast in bed.

768
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:26,966
But they would move into the palace...

769
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:30,647
...and I could stay with the manor
and turn things around.

770
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:33,087
You like him. Admit it.

771
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,003
Nope.

772
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:37,925
And l-I suppose if you saw him again...

773
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:40,003
...y- y-you'd simply...

774
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,048
I'd walk right up to him and say...

775
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:44,692
..."Your Highness, my family is your family."

776
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:46,763
"Please, take them away."

777
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:50,765
Good. Because here's your big chance.
He's headed this way.

778
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:05,043
I'm looking for Signor da Vinci.

779
00:54:05,132 --> 00:54:07,771
We're to go to the monastery.
Have you seen him?

780
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:09,524
Da Vinci?

781
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:11,204
No, Your Highness.

782
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:13,965
Well, is that not his flying contraption?

783
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:16,612
- Where did you get it?
- From er...

784
00:54:16,692 --> 00:54:18,967
...the Comtesse de Lancret.

785
00:54:19,772 --> 00:54:22,127
She is a friend of his.

786
00:54:22,212 --> 00:54:23,201
You know her?

787
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:26,284
Please, I must find her.
Where is she staying?

788
00:54:26,372 --> 00:54:28,090
Er...

789
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:30,367
I believe, Your Highness...

790
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:33,091
...that she is staying with a cousin.

791
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:34,321
The erm...

792
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:35,970
...Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.

793
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:37,531
<i>(groans)</i>

794
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:38,601
Hmm.

795
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,728
That does present a problem.

796
00:54:40,812 --> 00:54:42,609
But...

797
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:44,762
...I do know that she is there...

798
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:47,161
...alone, by herself...

799
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,482
...at this very moment.

800
00:54:49,572 --> 00:54:51,130
Excellent.

801
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,488
Nice painting.

802
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:02,650
Gustave!

803
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,723
You horrible little snipe!

804
00:55:04,812 --> 00:55:06,803
Did you hear? He likes my work!

805
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:09,042
And <i>he</i> is headed toward my house!

806
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:11,803
Then I suggest you run.

807
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:34,847
Paulette! Louise! Quick!

808
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,450
Your Highness.

809
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:52,523
What an unexpected surprise.

810
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:54,603
Why, Comtesse.

811
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:57,123
Do you not attend church?

812
00:55:57,212 --> 00:56:00,648
My faith is better served
away from the rabid crowd.

813
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,006
<i>(panting)</i>

814
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,971
Yes, I'm afraid my father's edict
has created quite a um...

815
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,565
...a phenomenon.

816
00:56:07,652 --> 00:56:09,802
Which is why I am bound for the monastery.

817
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:14,245
The Franciscans
have an astonishing library.

818
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:18,245
Since you are so fond of reading,
I thought you mightjoin me?

819
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:20,323
It is not fair, Sire.

820
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:22,842
You have found my weakness...

821
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:25,002
...but I have yet to learn yours.

822
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:27,048
I should think it was quite obvious.

823
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,882
Captain Laurent!

824
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,325
I shall not need my horse or your services.

825
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,521
Today, I am simply...

826
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,008
...Henry.

827
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,601
<i>(church bell)</i>

828
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:05,848
Prince Henry left early this morning,
Baroness.

829
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,160
No-one seems to know where he went.

830
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,718
But... I've brought you something...

831
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,324
...that will brighten up your day.

832
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,241
It's a... (whispers)

833
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:22,518
Oh, you vicious, <i>vicious</i> man!

834
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,641
<i>(choir sings "Veni, Creator Spiritus")</i>

835
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,161
It makes me want to cry.

836
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,649
Pick one.

837
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,484
I could no sooner choose
a favourite star in the heavens.

838
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,561
What is it that touches you so?

839
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,561
I guess it's because...

840
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,006
...when I was young, my father
would stay up late and read to me.

841
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,126
He was addicted to the written word.

842
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,600
I would fall asleep
listening to the sound of his voice.

843
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,681
What sort of books?

844
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,761
Science, philosophy.

845
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,560
I suppose they remind me of him.

846
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,641
He died when I was eight.

847
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,439
<i>Utopia</i> was the last book he brought home.

848
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,084
Which explains why you quote it.

849
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:26,202
I would rather hear his voice again
than any sound in the world.

850
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,241
Is something wrong?

851
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,161
In all my years of study...

852
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,639
...not one tutor ever demonstrated...

853
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,961
...the passion you have shown me
in the last two days.

854
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,448
You have more conviction in one memory...

855
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:06,124
...than I have in my entire being.

856
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,802
Your Highness...

857
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,882
...if there is anything I have said...
- Please!

858
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,722
Don't.

859
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:24,278
It's not you.

860
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,888
Make haste, Marguerite. It's now or never.

861
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,321
Lovely service.

862
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,401
Forgive me...

863
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,686
...Your Majesty.

864
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,965
I think you dropped this on your way out.

865
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,041
My goodness!

866
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,119
I do not even remember putting it on.

867
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,921
Thank you, child.

868
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:56,323
It is a rare person indeed who would return
such a valuable keepsake.

869
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,322
You are too magnanimous, Your Majesty.

870
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,921
How very kind.

871
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,365
- Her name?
- Marguerite de Ghent.

872
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,122
Er... er... Marguerite.

873
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:11,249
We shall have a chat tomorrow, you and I.

874
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,161
Bring your mother.

875
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,683
As you wish.

876
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,250
Well, this is terribly embarrassing.

877
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,523
We'll head back to the monastery at once.

878
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,081
And we shall continue on foot.

879
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,481
But it's half a day's walk!

880
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:36,563
Honestly, Your Highness.
Where is your sense of adventure?

881
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,649
Well, I guess if you put it that way...

882
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,279
We can't be too confident, ladies.

883
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,726
The Prince wasn't in church today
and we need to know why.

884
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,119
Marguerite gets to do everything.

885
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,203
Don't be daft, Jacqueline.
The Queen doesn't know you exist.

886
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,758
What Marguerite does is for all of us.

887
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,000
We need you to help her get ready.

888
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,402
Lovely. I shall soon be cleaning
the fireplace with Danielle!

889
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:12,802
- Where is that girl?
- Probably off catching rabbits with her teeth.

890
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,281
Begging your pardon, my lady,
but that mirror in your bedchamber...

891
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,282
...did you move it?
- Of course not. Why?

892
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:22,008
It's also missing.

893
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,558
Then it too shall come out of your pay.

894
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:30,846
Either you stop telling her when things
go missing, or we'll be paying her to work.

895
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,888
Good thing I didn't mention the tapestries.

896
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,646
You would think I would know
the way to my own castle!

897
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,119
Why is it men never stop for directions?

898
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,519
Ah! There it is! It is back that way.

899
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,878
And I still can't believe I'm down here
while you're up there!

900
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,564
And in your undergarments, no less!

901
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,960
I couldn't very well climb up here
in that gown, could I?

902
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,929
Besides, if you broke your royal neck,
where would we be?

903
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,002
You swim alone, climb rocks,
rescue servants.

904
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,126
Is there anything you don't do?

905
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,641
Fly.

906
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,483
Now turn around
so I can climb back down.

Stay aloft, madam.

910
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,286
There are games afoot.

911
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,244
My wife thanks you for this fine garment,
mademoiselle.

912
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,685
You will give me back my dress, sir.

913
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,562
Let her go!

914
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:27,118
Your quarrel... is with me.

915
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,528
Release her.

916
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,444
I insist you return my things at once.

917
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,569
And since you deprive me of my escort,
I demand a horse as well.

918
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,159
Milady, you may have anything
you can carry.

919
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,479
May I have your word on that, sir?

920
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:59,161
On my honour as a Gypsy,
whatever you can carry.

Please, come back. I'll give you a horse.

924
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,003
I want to be informed
the minute she gets home. Understood?

925
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,081
Yes, ma'am.

926
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,488

And they're as fuzzy as my own.

929
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,962
Then France concedes?

930
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,881
Never!

931
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,562
My next choice...

932
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,288
...will be paper.

933
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,527
It is your turn.

934
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,601
And it had better be good.

935
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,999
I have no desire to be King.

936
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,286
But think of all the wonderful things
you could do...

937
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,440
...for your country, for the world.

938
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,328
Yes, but to be so defined by your position.

939
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,321
To only be seen as what you are.

940
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,844
You don't know how insufferable that is!

941
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,921
You might be surprised.

942
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:43,001
Really?

943
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,768
A Gypsy, for example,
is rarely painted as anything else.

944
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:52,878
They're defined by their status
as you are, yet it is not who they are.

945
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:57,566
You have been born to privilege,
and with that come specific obligations.

946
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,245
I am sorry.
My mouth has run away with me again.

947
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,321
No, my lady.

948
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,688
It is your mouth...

949
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,920
...that has me hypnotised.

Yes.

961
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,487
I often go there to...

962
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,561
...be alone.

963
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,800
Would you meet me there tomorrow?

964
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:53,000
I shall try.

965
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,240
Then I shall wait all day.

966

Our son has something to tell us.

968
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,281
Mother, Father.

969
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,361
I want to build a university...

970
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:17,489
...with the largest library in Europe,
where people of any station can study.

971
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,559
All right.

972
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:21,642
Who are you
and what have you done with our son?

973
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,804
Oh. And I want to invite
the Gypsies to the ball.

I feel as if my skin is the only thing
keeping me from going everywhere at once.

1065
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,845
There is something I must tell you.

1066
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,124
And I you.

1067
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:59,123
Oh, here. Your book,
you left it in the carriage yesterday.

1068
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,201
- Your Highness...
- Henry.

1069
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,650
I cannot stay long, but I had to see you.

1070
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,521
There is much to say.

1071
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,168
Come.

1072
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,639
I want to show you something.

1073
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,841
I used to play here as a boy.

1074
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,561
It was my father's most cherished retreat...

1075
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,368
...before the war.

1076
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,401
<i>(birds twittering)</i>

1077
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,565
It's beautiful.

1078
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:47,009
I've measured my life by these trees...

1079
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,561
...starting here...

1080
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,481
...all the way up there.

1081
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,288
And still they grow.

1082
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:56,725
So much life to live...

1083
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,399
...but I no longer imagine it alone.

1084
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,081
You're not making this easy.

1085
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,963
I have not slept for fear I would wake
to find all this a dream.

1086
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,647
Oh, last night, I had a revelation.

1087
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:23,049
I used to think, if I cared at all,
I would have to care about everything...

1088
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,882
...and I'd go stark raving mad.

1089
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:27,848
But... now I've found my purpose.

1090
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:32,089
It's a project actually inspired by you.

1091
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,561
I feel...

1092
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,641
...the most wonderful...

1093
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,161
...freedom.

1094
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,241
It wasn't me.

1095
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,001
<i>(laughs)</i>

1096
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,081
Nicole.

1097
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:50,048
You are unlike any courtier I have ever met.

1098
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,521
Tomorrow, at the masque...

1099
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,999
...I shall make it known to the world.

1100
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:01,169
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

1101
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,161
Now, then.

1102
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:10,200
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1103
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:13,561
<i>(sobs)</i>

1104
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,481
Simply that...

1105
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:22,279
...last night was the happiest night of my life.

1106
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:37,764
Ow!

1107
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,081
I must go.

1108
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,603
Nicole!

1109
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:47,725
No.

1110
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,519
Of all the insidious jokes,
making your mother a comtesse.

1111
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:13,365
It's almost as absurd as a prince
frequenting a servant who sleeps with pigs!

1112
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,964
What bothers you more, Stepmother?

1113
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,803
That I am common, or that I am competition?

1114
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,608
Where is the dress, Danielle?

1115
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,681
I don't know what you're talking about.

1116
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,726
The gown. The slippers?

1117
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,165
They were in my room and now they're gone.

1118
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,241
<i>(Marguerite)</i> You hid them, I know it!

1119
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,286
Where did you put the gown, Danielle?

1120
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,160
Where are the candlesticks
and the tapestries...

1121
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,808
...and the silver?

1122
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,289
Perhaps the dress is with them!

1123
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,201
You produce that gown!

1124
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,599
I would rather die a thousand deaths...

1125
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:49,559
...than to see my mother's dress
on that spoiled, selfish cow!

1126
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:56,164
Hmm. Perhaps we can arrange that.

1127
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,161
<i>(door rattles)</i>

1128
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,241
<i>(Rodmilla)</i> Get in there.

1129
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,648
<i>(locks door)</i>

1130
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:07,482
Open this door...

1131
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:09,925
...and you'll wish you never set foot here.

1132
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,444
Ladies, gather everything we can sell.

1133
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:14,407
We're going to town tomorrow.

1134
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,640
Mother... it's only a ball.

1135
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,369
Yes, and you're only going for the food.

1136
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,161
Engaged?

1137
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,047
To a Belgian?

1138
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,041
I'm afraid so.

1139
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:32,519
Impossible.
There has to be some mistake.

1140
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,841
She was travelling by boat this afternoon.

1141
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:41,204
Baroness Rodmilla
was quite reluctant to talk about it.

1142
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,963
It's no wonder, with tidings such as these.

1143
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:48,009
If she was betrothed, she should
have had the decency to tell me!

1144
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,842
Would you have listened?

1145
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,921
Of course not! I would have...

1146
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,161
Oh, God.

1147
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,684
How could I have been so blind?

1148
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,489
There I was, pouring my royal heart out...

1149
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:03,562
...and she was simply trying
to bid me farewell.

1150
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:07,165
It is a strong woman
who can keep her wits about her...

1151
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,718
...with you trying to steal her heart.

1152
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:13,485
Yes.
And what a clumsy thief I turned out to be.

1153
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,526
Come now, Henry.

1154
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,882
<i>(Queen)</i> Any choice is better than Spain.

1155
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:25,089
Go to the Prince, tell him what's happened.

1156
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,968
B-But I'm nobody.
The Prince would never see me.

1157
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:30,041
You are her friend, Gustave.

1158
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:33,406
She needs your help.
The Prince expects to see her.

1159
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:34,479
L-I cannot.

1160
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,164
Besides, my master has me working tonight.

1161
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,686
Then go to da Vinci.
Surely a painter can see another painter?

1162
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:45,969
I am but an apprentice, and he is
the greatest painter in the world.

1163
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,041
I could no sooner talk to God.

1164
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,439
For once in your life, man, be bold.

1165
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,124
This way, sir.

1166
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,201
Straight up there, madam.

1167
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,761
<i>(hums)</i>

1168
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,241
Yoo-hoo!

1169
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,961
I wanted to be the peacock.

1170
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:55,486
Jacqueline, the horse is
one of God's noblest creatures.

1171
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,720
Why don't I just pull the carriage?

1172
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,040
If it will get us there any faster.

1173
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,520
I'm looking for Signor da Vinci.

1174
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,641
Signor da Vinci!

1175
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,842
Yes?

1176
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,761
Oh!

1177
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,841
Oh, mistress, it's no use!

1178
01:22:58,930 --> 01:22:59,919
Allow me.

1179
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,564
Oh, brilliant!

1180
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,402
Why, that was pure genius.

1181
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:14,639
Yes.

1182
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:18,120
I shall go down in history
as the man who opened a door.

1183
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,481
- <i>(chuckles)</i>
- Gustave!

1184
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:23,448
Maurice said the Prince was expecting you.

1185
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:26,408
He is expecting someone who does not exist.

1186
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:29,209
Signore,
my name is Danielle de Barbarac...

1187
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,962
...and I am but a servant.

1188
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:34,167
I am the bastard son of a peasant.
What does that matter?

1189
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,684
I have deceived him.

1190
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,761
The Prince will understand.

1191
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:42,082
The night is young.
We must get you ready for the ball.

1192
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:44,764
- I do not wish to go.
- If you stay...

1193
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:46,169
...the Baroness wins.

1194
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,800
How can I face him?

1195
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:53,360
Because he deserves
to hear the truth from the one he loves.

1196
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,203
A bird may love a fish, signore...

1197
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:59,281
...but where would they live?

1198
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:02,521
Then I shall have to make you wings.

1199
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:06,289
Ooh, come on! No time to waste.

1200
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,361
Louise, get the dress!

1201
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,880
I understand you wanted to see me.

1202
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:20,561
Yes, Father. I did.

1203
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,081
Listen, Henry.

1204
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:34,122
Perhaps it was unfair of me
to put so much pressure on you...

1205
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,405
...about the marriage contract.

1206
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:41,083
I just thought it was time
to make some changes in your life.

1207
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:43,730
You seemed to be a bit... floundering.

1208
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:46,562
And er...

1209
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,084
Well, l-I just wanted to say...

1210
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:52,287
...that this university thing...

1211
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,081
...is a brilliant idea.

1212
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:59,961
We don't have to announce
anything tonight...

1213
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,166
I've made my decision.

1214
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,881
Oh.

1215
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:26,081
She looks like a masterpiece.

1216
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,161
She looks like her mother.

1217
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,889
- Come, let us see your paintings.
- Now?

1218
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:33,962
When you're as old as I am,
now is all you've got.

1219
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,199
Wait!

1220
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:37,440
It's tradition.

1221
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:14,321
Whoa!

1222
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:19,161
Neigh!

1223

This is it, my darling.

Friends...

1227
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:38,601
...honoured guests.

1228
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:41,361
It gives us great pleasure...

1229
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,400
...on this festive occasion...

1230
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:49,564
...not only to honour Signor da Vinci,
who seems to have disappeared...

1231
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:53,806
...but also to tell you
of a long-awaited decision.

1232
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,401
So, without further ado...

1233
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,288
Breathe, just breathe.

1234
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:02,999
...it is my great privilege
to announce the engagement of our son...

1235
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,081
...Prince Henry...

1236
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:07,161
...to...

1237
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:41,561
Well, well, well.

1238
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:43,925
What have we here?

1239
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:46,319
My mother said you were getting married.

1240
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:48,446
She was misinformed.

1241
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:53,001
But there is something I must tell you now,
before another word is spoken.

1242
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:55,240
Then you're not engaged?

1243
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:56,922
No, I'm not.

1244
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:01,087
I was about to make
the worst mistake of my life.

1245
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:03,886
Who is she?

1246
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:06,768
My guess would be the Comtesse de Lancret.

1247
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:11,161
The who?

1248
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,559
Come. I want you to meet someone.

1249
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,481
Oh, I must speak with you.

1250
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:21,085
- Whatever it is, my answer is yes.
- No, wait, please.

1251
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:25,720
Oh, look. I invited the Gypsies.

1252
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:29,208
- What are you doing?
- Making you a princess.

1253
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,163
<i>(gasps)</i>

1254
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,480
- How dare you!
- Madame, contain yourself!

1255
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,526
- She is an impostor, Sire!
- No!

1256
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,965
Her name is Danielle de Barbarac.

1257
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:42,689
She has been my servant for ten years.

1258
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,967
A servant, Henry?
Is this some kind ofjoke?

1259
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,884
Baroness, you are on dangerous ground!

1260
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,289
Ask her yourself!

1261
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:54,999
She's a grasping, devious little pretender...

1262
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:59,003
...and it is my duty to expose her
as the covetous hoax she is.

1263
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,081
Tell these women who you are.

1264
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,042
Tell them!

1265
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:12,802
Bow before royalty, you insolent fraud!

1266
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:15,484
My God, it can't be true.

1267
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:21,281
Nicole?

1268
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,443
Nicole de Lancret was my mother.

1269
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:29,649
I am what she says.

1270
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,921
The apple?

1271
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,641
That was you?

1272
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:44,686
I can explain.

1273
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:47,330
<i>(King Francis)</i> Well, someone had better!

...and now you're a servant?

1276
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,481
I've heard enough.

I am a Prince of France.

And you...

1282
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:16,884

Danielle!

1286
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,081
What have you done?

1287
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:25,845
I was born to privilege
and with that come specific obligations.

1288
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:27,124
Horseshit.

1289
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:31,203
- You're out of line, old man.
- No, you are out of line.

1290
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:34,566
Have you any idea what she went through
to get here tonight?

1291
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:36,163
She lied to me.

1292
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,367
She came to tell you the truth
and you fed her to the wolves.

1293
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,599
What do you know?

1294
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:43,648
You build flying machines and walk on water.

1295
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,766
Yet you know nothing about life.

1296
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,444
I know that a life without love...

1297
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,168
...is no life at all.

1298
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,206
And love without trust?

1299
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,405
What of that?

1300
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,560
She's your match, Henry.

1301
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,880
I am but a servant to my crown...

1302
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,928
...and I have made my decision.

1303
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:03,001

1309
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:31,440
...that before your rather embarrassing debut...

1310
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:35,239
...the Prince was about to choose
Marguerite to be his bride.

1311
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,805
Men are so fickle, aren't they?

1312
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,768
One minute, they're spouting sonnets...

1313
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:45,126
...and the next you're back
to being a hired help.

1314
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:49,362
I must say, I've never seen you
quite this dedicated in your chores.

1315
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,328
What makes you think
I do any of this for you?

1316
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:55,922
Well, my, my, my.
Aren't we feisty this morning?

1317
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:57,841
Let me pass.

1318
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:01,081
- You've brought this on yourself.
- I have work to do.

1319
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,922
Let the others handle it.

1320
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:07,001
Don't you understand?

1321
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,648
You've won!

1322
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,721
Go and move into your palace...

1323
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:12,801
...and leave us be!

1324
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:17,089
You are not my problem any more.

1325
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,561
Is that what I am?

1326
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:22,641
Your problem?

1327
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,647
I have done everything
you've ever asked me to do...

1328
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:30,200
...and still you've denied me
the only thing I ever wanted.

1329
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,246
And what was that?

1330
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:34,321
What do you think?

1331
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,129
You are the only mother I have ever known.

1332
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:44,445
Was there a time,
even in its smallest measurement...

1333
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:46,327
...that you loved me at all?

1334
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:50,608
How can anyone love a pebble in their shoe?

Yes. And now they're back.

01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:32,209
He taught me well.

1418
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:37,159
Now hand me that key,
or I swear on his grave I will slit you...

1419
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:40,208
...from navel to nose.

1420
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:57,686
Your freedom...

1421
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,761
...my lady.

1422
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:26,889
Hello.

1423
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,723
Hello.

1424
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:33,801
What are you doing here?

1425
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:37,081
I erm...

1426
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,961
I came to rescue you.

1427
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:42,041
Rescue <i>me?</i>

1428
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:44,405
A commoner?

1429
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:48,968
Actually, I came to beg your forgiveness.

1430
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:53,202
I offered you the world,
and at the first test of honour I betrayed you.

1431
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:55,281
Please, Danielle.

1432
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,406
Say it again.

1433
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:03,799
I'm sorry.

1434
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:05,881
No.

1435
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:09,563
The part where you said my name.

1436
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:13,761
Danielle.

1437
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:18,961
Perhaps you would be so kind...

1438
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:21,644
...as to help me find the owner of this...

1439
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:24,449
...rather remarkable shoe?

1440
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,480
Where did you find that?

1441
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,323
She is my match in every way.

1442
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:35,559
Please tell me I haven't lost her.

1443
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:41,006
It belongs to a peasant, Your Highness...

1444
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:44,002
...who pretended to be a courtier
to save a man's life.

1445
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:46,081
Yes, I know.

1446
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:49,609
And the name's Henry, if you don't mind.

1447
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,889
I kneel before you not as a prince...

1448
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:07,881
...but as a man in love.

1449
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:12,961
But I...

1450
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:15,405
...would feel like a king...

1451
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:19,522
...if you, Danielle de Barbarac...

1452
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:24,161
...would be my wife.

1453
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:56,164
How was I to know
he'd run out of the side door?

1454
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:58,366
He was supposed to be getting married!

1455
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:01,647
I heard the Prince talked to you.
What did he say?

1456
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:04,321
Well, I can't be sure.

1457
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:06,721
It all happened so quickly.

1458
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:08,801
But I think what he said was...

1459
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:12,565
..."It serves me right
for choosing a foreigner over your...

1460
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,641
...sister."

1461
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:17,401
<i>(giggles)</i>

1462
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:20,084
Well, very good.

1463
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:23,765
Perhaps we should just
let him fret about it for a few days.

1464
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:25,562
<i>(bell rings)</i>

1465
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:27,606
<i>(all)</i> I'll get it!

1466
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:31,730
His Supreme Majesty, King Francis...

1467
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:35,928
...requests an audience with
the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent...

1468
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:37,762
...and her daughters immediately.

1469
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,000
Oh. Is anything wrong?

1470
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,001
No, milady.

1471
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:45,162
The King demanded that you arrive in style.

1472
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:48,162
Hmm! In style we shall be.

1473
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,399
<i>(Marguerite squeals)</i>

1474
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:20,283
Baroness...

1475
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:24,682
...did you or did you not
lie to Her Majesty the Queen of France?

1476
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:29,962
Choose your words wisely, madame...

1477
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,041
...for they may be your last.

1478
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:39,758
A woman would do practically anything...

1479
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:42,728
...for the love of her daughter, Your Majesties.

1480
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,846
Perhaps I did get a little carried away.

1481
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,921
Mother, what have you done?

1482
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,649
Your Majesty, like you,
I am just a victim here.

1483
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:55,881
She has lied to us both
and I am ashamed to call her family.

1484
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:58,200
How dare you turn on me, you ingrate!

1485
01:46:58,290 --> 01:47:00,281
You see what I have to put with!

1486
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:02,281
Silence, both of you!

1487
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:03,769
Good Lord!

1488
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,363
Are they always like this?

1489
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:06,644
Worse...

1490
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:08,288
...Your Majesty.

1491
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,361
Jacqueline, darling...

1492
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:13,408
...I'd hate to think
you had anything to do with this.

1493
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:14,923
Of course not, Mother.

1494
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,319
I'm only here for the food.

1495
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:19,888
Baroness de Ghent.

1496
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:22,530
You are forthwith stripped of your title.

1497
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,601
You and your horrible daughter...

1498
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:27,727
...are to be shipped to the Americas
on the first boat.

1499
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:29,801
Unless, by some miracle...

1500
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:32,882
...someone here will speak for you.

1501
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:57,286
There seem to be
quite a few people out of town.

1502
01:47:58,010 --> 01:48:00,240
<i>(Danielle)</i> I will speak for her.

1503
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:14,562
She is, after all, my stepmother.

1504
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:40,121
Your Highness.

1505
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,286
Marguerite...

1506
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:50,078
...I don't believe you've met...

1507
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:51,569
...my wife.

1508
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,601
<i>(Danielle)</i> I want you to know...

1509
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,250
...that I will forget you after this moment...

1510
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:59,161
...and never think of you again.

1511
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,559
But you, I am quite certain...

1512
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:06,041
...will think about me
every single day for the rest of your life.

1513
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,241
How long might that be?

1514
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:18,960
All I ask, Your Majesties...

1515
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:25,049
...is that you show her the same courtesy
that she has bestowed upon me.

1516
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:38,008
After you've washed the tablecloths,
start on the napkins...

1517
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:40,399
...and move those over there.

1518
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:42,481
- Marguerite.
- What?

1519
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:44,640
- You heard the woman.
- So did you.

1520
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:47,847
- Yes, but I'm management.
- Like hell you are!

1521
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:51,366
You're just the same as me, a big nobody!

1522
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:53,918
How dare you speak that way!
I am of noble blood.

1523
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,365
And you are getting on my nerves!

It's wonderful.

1530

I just can't get over it... Your Highness.

1534
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:34,122
Yes, well, royalty or not...

01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:36,166
...I can still whip you.

1536
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,047
I must say, Leonardo...

...for a man of your talents...

1538
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:45,205
...it doesn't look a thing like her.

You, sir, are supposed to be charming.
