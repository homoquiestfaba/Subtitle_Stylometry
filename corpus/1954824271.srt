1
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,912
Maybe the cap you
started with was too thick.

2
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,293
We have time.
We'll find one that fits.

3
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,987
<i>...It's not gonna last.</i>

4
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

5
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,615
<i>My tongue is swollen up bad.</i>

6
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,244
<i>I never thought our hiding place
would outlast our well.</i>

7
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,038
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

8
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,999
Can anyone answer me?

9
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,125
Can you hear me?

10
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,918
<i>Anyone?</i>

11
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,795
<i>Anyone...</i>

12
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,859
<i>He)” Upstairs!</i>

13
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,361
<i>I'll check the attic.</i>

14
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,820
<i>Sure.</i>

15
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,464
<i>Don, there's nothin'.</i>

16
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,718
<i>There is no water here.</i>

17
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,437
- <i>Dave, what about--</i>
- <i>Let's just go.</i>

18
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,239
Water.

19
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,007
Water.

20
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you.

21
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,394
Is anyone else with you?

22
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,194
The others,
they left you here?

23
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,868
Oh.

24
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
You could rest here awhile.

25
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,752
You can't walk
out of the valley.

26
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,794
Even if you weren't injured...

27
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,088
I'm not trying to walk
out of the valley.

28
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,633
My sister's on the far side.

29
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:33,972
I just need enough water
to make it to my sister.

30
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,641
She isn't well.

31
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,742
You can't stay here, either.

32
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,869
I'm okay.
I have my plan.

33
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,376
They're always hunting.

34
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,586
You stay put,
they'll find you.

35
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,922
Or your well will go dry,
whichever's first.

36
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,438
They're hunting in the south.

37
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,232
It's safer to go north.

38
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,695
Keep it.

39
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,408
Wait.

40
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,124
Stay lucky.

41
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,159
I'm good.

42
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
Where's Dean?

43
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,755
Hunting up some food.

44
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,673
He's getting worse,
isn't he?

45
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,515
Kendal...

46
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:49,066
Remember when this
was all rice paddies?

47
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,485
Catching all those frogs?

48
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,073
Do you think it'll
ever rain again?

49
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,183
So you found a wreck?

50
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,689
Yeah, just outside
the pumping field.

51
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,273
It's new.

52
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,150
Two, maybe three weeks.

53
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,236
We should be able
to find something.

54
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,737
Thanks.

55
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,534
You know I can help you.

56
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,313
Heard Island.

57
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,857
All that cold water.

58
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,401
That's a good spot then.

59
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,787
Plane lands on a
bright green field,

60
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,373
pumping lightly along
until it comes to a rest

61
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,667
next to a low stone wall,

62
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,544
built hundreds and hundreds
of years ago

63
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,712
by the earliest explorers.

64
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:04,761
There's a stone building
not far in the distance

65
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,181
with a cold stream connecting
the snowcap mountains above

66
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,016
to the blue-grey sea below.

67
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,399
And if you wipe the steam
off the cockpit window,

68
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,907
you can see penguins
and sheath piles

69
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,328
and elephant seals

70
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,789
covering the black mange.

71
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,270
<i>...And I'm scared.</i>

72
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,898
<i>Can anyone help?</i>

73
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,858
<i>I'm on the Dover farm.</i>

74
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,698
<i>And someone is outside.</i>

75
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,284
<i>He's got a mask.</i>

76
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:13,330
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

77
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,040
<i>Can anyone help?</i>

78
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,757
What's going on?

79
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,009
Someone's at the Dover farm.

80
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,802
You shouldn't go.

81
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:28,887
You always did.

82
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,263
You'll be okay without me.

83
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,057
It's not me I'm worried about.

84
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,023
Stay lucky.

85
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,171
<i>...And I'm scared.</i>

86
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,179
<i>I'm so thirsty.
Please come.</i>

87
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,619
<i>Our well has gone dry.</i>

88
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,580
We have no more water.

89
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,498
<i>There are others
hiding out there,</i>

90
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,834
<i>parasite drinking my water.</i>

91
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,880
<i>Pick up the radio
and try again.</i>

92
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,383
<i>Please, let these two--</i>

93
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,802
<i>Pick up the radio
and call out again</i>

94
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,721
<i>or I'll have these two shot.</i>

95
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,436
<i>People used to show mercy.</i>

96
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,146
<i>Wells go dry.</i>

97
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,024
<i>People change.</i>

98
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,038
There are no more farms.

99
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,499
There's no more farms,
they're all done in.

100
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,917
Please.

101
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,670
You don't want to kill her.

102
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,756
There's a man of God in here.

103
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,509
We're not going to hurt you.

104
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,052
You must be thirsty.

105
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,721
They're always thirsty.
Give her some of my water.

106
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,974
Come on.

107
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,605
Mr. Carson!
Mr. Carson!

108
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,273
It's a trap!
It's a trap!

109
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,691
Ah!

110
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,991
This is a fine house.

111
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,202
My grandfather
always admired it.

112
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,168
Search it.

113
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,629
Then on to the next.
We're finished here.

114
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,504
<i>They're like rats
eating a sandwich.</i>

115
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,715
<i>You! Keep tearing
this farm apart.</i>

116
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,175
<i>We'll take the kitchen.</i>

117
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,388
Look how sweet, father.

118
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,224
Someone closed her eyes.

119
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,853
Pray for her, Cadiz.

120
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,649
Pray for each of these
desperate, thirsty souls.

121
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,275
You'd think after
ten years of no rain

122
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,151
they'd give up.

123
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,538
There can't be many left.

124
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:55,380
We're going to hunt them
from dry well to dry well.

125
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,387
If they're alive,
they're consuming my water.

126
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,808
And they can't consume my water
without my consent.

127
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,878
Distributor cap didn't fit!

128
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,429
I wouldn't let them
follow me here...

129
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,350
You know that, right?

130
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,478
Not like we want
anything with you, anyway.

131
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,106
We found the Cessna.

132
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,941
It's ours.

133
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:06,821
Just the same,
maybe we'd let you come with us.

134
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,739
Maybe.

135
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,540
You have a good spot here.
I'll grant you that.

136
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:28,468
But we have water...
And you don't.

137
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,470
That's why I'm safe here.

138
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,889
You're too small
to be on your own.

139
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,978
I'm safer on my own.

140
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,067
Okay, I am not
going to argue with you.

141
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,570
I mean, you seem to be
doing alright.

142
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,324
But Dean and I,
we're not like the others.

143
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,997
You try loosening
the inlet flange?

144
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,334
Refill it with water
to prime it?

145
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,462
It's not the pump.
It's like the well gave out.

146
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,923
Just isn't filling anymore.

147
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,515
When you were at the compound,
were the derricks pumping?

148
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,349
All of them.

149
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,517
And the truck came.

150
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,895
Never seen them fill it so fast.

151
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,856
You don't need the plane.

152
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,607
You move at night.

153
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,817
Take as much water
as you can carry.

154
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,277
You can reach
my uncle's place in,

155
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,987
I don't know,
about three or four weeks-

156
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,447
Stop!

157
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,948
You know I'm dying, Kendal.

158
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,285
Without enough water,
my kidneys are done.

159
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,711
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

160
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,796
Move over.

161
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,851
I'm not going to leave you here.

162
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,106
I'm going to find it.

163
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,779
<i>This is the Birch farm.</i>

164
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,783
<i>This is the Birch farm,
land grant 2371,</i>

165
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,035
<i>calling for Mr. Carson.</i>

166
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,622
<i>We'd like to request- noon
today- to the refugee camp.</i>

167
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,832
<i>...Birch farm.</i>

168
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,584
<i>...371.</i>

169
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,462
<i>We'd like to request...
...Refugee camp.</i>

170
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,631
The Birch farm.

171
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,217
I guess that leaves
us and the boy.

172
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,972
You don't have to go.

173
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,391
I need to see what happens.

174
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,060
If it looks okay,
maybe we should call in, too.

175
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,921
I drink the tears of those
who have gone before us.

176
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,756
And my spirit is quenched.

177
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,384
We're done here.

178
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,804
The well went dry.

179
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,139
We took it as far as we could.

180
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:17,274
But it has been six months
of terror and hiding.

181
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,528
How many dead?

182
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,907
With Simon gone,
there's nothing for us here.

183
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,660
Just come with us.

184
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,161
They can help Dean.

185
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,330
Flacker says they
have medicine.

186
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,005
You never knew family.

187
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,716
We can start again.

188
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,844
Make a new family.

189
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,763
I hear Carson has a daughter.

190
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,516
We can send them to get Dean.

191
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,767
It's his kidneys, girl.

192
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,686
Same as his sister Pia.

193
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,437
There's just no way you kids
are getting out of here.

194
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,981
I can find Dean more water.

195
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,607
Things might be better
outside the valley.

196
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,193
If we go north,
there has to be water.

197
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,320
You still have faith.

198
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,950
That's good.

199
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:12,538
We hid a day's worth of water
on the north side of the house.

200
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,790
Welcome to it once we're gone.

201
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,377
Didn't your people
have a plane?

202
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,545
Used to.

203
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:20,796
Shot down over
the pumping field.

204
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,173
Burned out there
for two days straight.

205
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,760
Guess that's one way out.

206
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,898
Welcome, Mr. Carson.

207
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,484
Thank you for
responding to our call.

208
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,194
We are unarmed and ready.

209
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,445
Good.

210
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,656
If you'd like to look around...

211
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,911
Then shall they begin
to say to the mountains

212
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,706
fall on us,
to the hills cover us.

213
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,542
For if they do these
things in a green tree,

214
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,295
what shall be done in the dry?

215
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,281
I know this is hard,

216
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,993
but just isn't enough
water, you see?

217
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,536
Listen to me.

218
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,622
These were old people
and they're going to suffer.

219
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,040
You understand?

220
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,917
I had to do it.

221
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,378
You're different.

222
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,087
I can tell.

223
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,799
Now, tell me,

224
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,135
is there anybody else
on the farm?

225
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,556
Huh?
Come on now.

226
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,182
Listen, if we're going
to have a relationship,

227
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,184
that's based on trust.

228
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,728
You have to come clean.

229
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,563
Please don't.

230
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,858
Otherwise,
what's the point?

231
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,366
Yeah, there's one more.

232
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,784
One more.

233
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,287
Use the heat sensors.

234
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,831
You look like a man who prays...

235
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,931
Sit, daughter of mine.

236
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,893
I believe this is going
to be the last holdout.

237
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,603
As far as the eye can see,

238
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:27,191
this valley has Carson's buried
under every acre of it.

239
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,110
And I'm not going to stop
until it's all ours.

240
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,738
They suffer less
this way, don't they?

241
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,573
These little people?

242
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:46,585
Think of it as an
extinction of a species,

243
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:55,094
like the passenger pigeon or
the ivory-billed Woodpecker.

244
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:59,139
Your world is about
to get so much better.

245
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,725
What could be better than this?

246
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,727
This one is yours, my love.

247
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,864
Now, is that everyone?

248
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,366
Hmm?

249
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,119
Yes, sir.

250
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,608
Ah!

251
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,393
How is the pump?

252
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,148
It's slow.

253
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,734
But okay.
The usual.

254
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,199
Did you get hurt?

255
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,951
Nope.

256
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,285
Good.

257
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:31,012
I know why our pump is failing.

258
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,264
Why?

259
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,811
They're draining the aquifer.

260
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,272
All those pumps going
around the clock.

261
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,692
They're sucking the water
right out from under us...

262
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,486
But it's our well.

263
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:50,532
If the company drains
all the water,

264
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,826
drive all the
squatters away,

265
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:55,370
they control
the whole valley.

266
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,970
Maybe we should call Carson.

267
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,930
Maybe the company
camps aren't so bad.

268
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,765
We can't.

269
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,644
Carson's not taking
people to camps.

270
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,481
He's the one that's been
doing all the killing.

271
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,403
It's not Christmas yet.

272
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,780
Says who?

273
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,459
That's good.

274
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,047
We should go back inside.

275
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,133
They'll be hunting soon.

276
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,885
Wait.

277
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,098
I want to visit her grave.

278
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,224
Tomorrow.

279
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,560
I need to say goodbye.

280
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,830
I miss her.

281
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,087
You were just crazy enough
for her to like you.

282
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,755
I wasn't near as
crazy as your sister.

283
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,340
No one was.

284
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:15,176
Do you think it
keeps us here?

285
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,511
Her grave?

286
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,598
Of course not.

287
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,890
Let's go back in.

288
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,351
Listen...

289
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:28,023
When the time comes,
I want you to burn my body.

290
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,234
Don't bury it.
Not like this.

291
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:37,532
Nothing ties you to this house,
you understand?

292
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:41,620
You'll burn my body and
go to my uncle's place.

293
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:47,834
It's what Pia would have wanted.

294
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,462
Okay, I promise.

295
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:56,009
But I'm going to get us both
out of here long before you die.

296
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,845
Come on.

297
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,071
I'll be right back.

298
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,829
Hello the house!

299
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,336
Whosoever killed
in the trenches.

300
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,672
Whosoever left a
man's lifeless body

301
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,007
to the wind and
the vultures,

302
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,217
without the dignity
of a burial,

303
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,761
come forward.

304
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:06,931
Confess thy sins,
dearly beloveds!

305
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,225
We bring mercy.

306
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:17,108
Whosoever wants to
live another hour.

307
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,444
Whosoever wants
to see another day.

308
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:22,030
Come forward!

309
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,491
Step into the light!

310
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,876
I did what I could do.

311
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,629
Search it and gas it.

312
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,256
<i>The attic.
Above us.</i>

313
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,882
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

314
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,009
<i>Up the stairs!
Hurry!</i>

315
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,922
The sun's been pounding this
side of the building all day...

316
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,304
Gas it, then we'll move on.

317
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,205
Don't put--
Don't put it there.

318
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,415
Put it on the siding.

319
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:03,459
There's no sense in destroying
the beauty of the craftsmanship.

320
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,336
Respect the carpenter.

321
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,214
Onward, then.

322
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:10,216
Next property's north,
northeast.

323
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,218
The King track.

324
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,317
I know.

325
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,402
I'm going to get you water.

326
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,352
Come on.
Keep moving.

327
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,774
Ah!

328
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:52,688
Alby!

329
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,069
Alby!

330
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:11,749
Pssst!

331
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,251
Are you okay?

332
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,093
I watch them in the shadows

333
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,637
waiting for me
to make a mistake.

334
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,392
I won't make a mistake.

335
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,187
- Everyone makes mist-
- Shh...

336
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,774
Wait for dark.

337
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,859
Then leave.

338
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,529
You're not helping me like this.

339
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,708
Will you show me where you hide
in case I need to find you?

340
00:54:56,252 --> 00:55:00,589
They always come looking
after you've been here.

341
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:04,218
I don't need you to come by.

342
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,637
But we're going
to get out of this,

343
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,639
you, me and Dean.

344
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:09,682
I'm going to come for you

345
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:13,978
and we'll leave
this place, I promise.

346
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,775
Promise doesn't mean a thing.

347
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,571
What is it?

348
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,408
Vagrants.
Heading for us.

349
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,076
How do they look?

350
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:54,245
They're in bad shape.

351
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,746
It's okay. They'll see
that Carson's been here

352
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,039
and they'll take off.

353
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:00,334
We'll just wait.
They won't find anything.

354
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:02,878
And if they die
on our doorstep?

355
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,007
We've got a good store of water.

356
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,677
You say the pump's
in good shape.

357
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,762
Why not help them?

358
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:18,853
What if it's just another
one of Carson's traps?

359
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:24,108
We've got plenty of water,
right?

360
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,527
Right.

361
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,363
We have the water.
I'll give them a flask.

362
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,580
Just in case.

363
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,707
Not everyone is as
charitable as you.

364
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:18,162
It's long gone.

365
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,956
We're not going to
make it to another barn.

366
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,668
We won't survive
the noon sun.

367
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,631
Oh, come on.
We'll wait out the heat.

368
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,258
We got another farm in us yet.

369
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,637
Come on, all the wells in
this valley can't be dry.

370
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,769
Don't please.

371
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,772
Wait, wait,
please don't kill us.

372
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,815
We don't have guns.

373
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,108
Only knives.

374
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,985
We mean you no harm.

375
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,490
We're just very thirsty.

376
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,283
Why did Carson send you?

377
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,369
That liar?

378
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,413
We're not with Carson.

379
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,917
We're just thirsty.

380
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:07,211
Carson hit our farm
some time back.

381
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:10,673
Folks thought he'd help them.

382
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,509
We're the only ones
that survived.

383
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:15,469
Our well's been long dry.

384
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:17,555
And we had a good
store of water

385
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:21,475
until they ran it
into the ground.

386
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:25,271
We held on a week
before moving on.

387
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:29,525
Every well we've come to
in this valley's been dry.

388
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,235
You done?

389
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:33,904
Here's the deal.

390
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:37,032
You'll walk in front of me
to that tower over there.

391
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:37,950
I'm going to pass
you my flask

392
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,743
and when it's dry,
you'll move on.

393
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,954
You won't look back,
won't come back.

394
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,887
So you been visited, too.

395
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,514
Keep moving.

396
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,561
Those notices they post,
instructions,

397
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,313
they're all lies.

398
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,814
It's a trap.

399
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,459
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

400
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,682
Thank you.

401
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,560
From the bottom of our hearts.

402
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:50,481
We wouldn't have made it
to another well.

403
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,860
How many of you are here?

404
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,362
I'm on my own.

405
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,821
Come with us, then.

406
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,865
Safety in numbers.

407
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,617
We owe you.

408
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,369
We're trying to
get to the mountains.

409
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,079
You've got a gun.

410
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,165
Improves all of our chances.

411
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,958
I can't.

412
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,752
Why not?

413
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,587
Looks kind of lonesome here.

414
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:18,842
Whoever you're waiting for,
they ain't coming back.

415
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,432
You guys should start
back on your way.

416
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,647
Thank you,
from all of us.

417
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,899
Thank you.

418
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:37,403
Were they in trouble?

419
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,779
Thirsty people at the end.

420
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,949
Carson's already killed
everyone else at their farm.

421
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:53,711
We're done, aren't we?

422
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,587
We're doing fine.

423
01:01:55,629 --> 01:02:00,384
No.

424
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:03,345
You've been giving me
your water for a week.

425
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,305
So what is it?

426
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,061
What is it?

427
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,899
The pump's dry.

428
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,987
HOW long?

429
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,281
Two days.

430
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:25,784
How long can we survive
on the water we have?

431
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,038
A week.

432
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,166
Maybe.

433
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,626
Why wouldn't you tell me?

434
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,920
I thought you'd be gone already.

435
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,267
I need to try the wreck outside
the pumping compound gates.

436
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,436
For the missing distributor cap.

437
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,771
We've tried so many--

438
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,481
It's too dangerous.

439
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,442
There's nowhere else to try.
At least we'll know.

440
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:00,068
I just don't know how to
get that close to the gates

441
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,404
without them spotting me.

442
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:10,662
Do they still dump their
waste oil by the fence?

443
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,539
Yeah.

444
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:26,303
I know how you can get close.

445
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:31,725
What's the one thing they fear
in a world without water?

446
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,249
<i>Who did this?</i>

447
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,750
<i>How did they breach the fence?</i>

448
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,513
<i>Go on. Fan out and find out
who breached the fence.</i>

449
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,557
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

450
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,142
<i>Find them!</i>

451
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,103
<i>Come on.
Get out there.</i>

452
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,147
<i>Get the rest of the men.</i>

453
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,193
What's going on?

454
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:50,864
We did it.

455
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,870
You did it.

456
01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:59,247
Shut up.

457
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,667
I'll carry you the
whole way if I have to.

458
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,378
I got it all worked out.

459
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,253
We can't leave just yet.

460
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,881
We'll be too slow
over open ground.

461
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:09,466
- We'll wait for dark.
- Kendal.

462
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,134
We can have the plane
prepped by daylight.

463
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:14,096
You, me, Alby,
we're getting out of here.

464
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,555
Kendal.

465
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,149
Beautiful,
but there's no time-

466
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,443
- One more story...
- Later.

467
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,987
I promise.

468
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:37,452
Here, I'll go get water,
but drink this.

469
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,746
You can have as
much as you want.

470
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,896
Didn't I say that anyone with
water to give must have a well?

471
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,439
Mm-hmm.

472
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,650
Shh.

473
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:54,988
You hid it so cleverly we had
to wait for you to get a drink.

474
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,533
We're very sorry about
how this turned out.

475
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,993
Let's end this.

476
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,496
There's not enough
water for her, too.

477
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,581
When you're right...

478
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,085
...You're right.

479
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,507
Ah!

480
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,874
Hmm.

481
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,132
Hmm.

482
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,850
They're coming!
Run!

483
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:11,690
Come on.

484
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,538
Stay quiet.

485
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,876
And no matter what,
don't you ever dare come back.

486
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,711
I'll come back.

487
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,462
Dean!

488
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,136
Well, hello there.

489
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:24,638
We heard shots.

490
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,890
Where are the others?

491
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:29,726
It's just me now.

492
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:33,063
The others are dead.

493
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,398
Our well just ran dry

494
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,443
and we were fighting
for the remaining water.

495
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:39,527
Hmm...

496
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,075
Just ran dry.

497
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,911
And you killed the
others yourself?

498
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,246
Confess, son.

499
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,498
It'll only take the pain away.

500
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,628
I killed them.

501
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,046
You're a fighter.

502
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:00,048
I like that.

503
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:10,016
You know how I knew that
you were here all the time?

504
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:14,229
I mean, not you specifically,
but someone?

505
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,901
Birds.

506
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,321
Birds go where
the water is, so...

507
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:29,577
You afflicted with something?

508
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,247
The boy looks ill.

509
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,291
I remember this house.

510
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:37,002
Look at this.
This door frame is beautiful.

511
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,461
Sturdy.

512
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,011
Good one.

513
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,096
- I built it.
- Oh.

514
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,390
With Mr. Miller.

515
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:52,684
Wow, Mr. Miller!
You don't say.

516
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,728
Well, my hat's off
to both of you.

517
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,230
Mr. Miller left the land to me.

518
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:02,152
But not the water.

519
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:06,906
You see, there was a time
when a man owned the land,

520
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,701
he controlled the water,
but things are different.

521
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:13,163
The water's mine,
so the land is mine.

522
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:18,168
Empty-

523
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,378
Then go check the barn.

524
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,268
Get down!

525
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,604
Get him!

526
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,320
Put it down.

527
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,681
He's wounded, Cadiz.

528
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,727
Agh!

529
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,193
For shame.

530
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,448
Such a shame.

531
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,952
Dad.

532
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,704
Look.

533
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,732
Throw water on it.

534
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,693
Will this land never clear.

535
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:51,029
Carson, this land's
been blighted

536
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,198
- since before you were born.
- I know.

537
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,243
It's not your fault

538
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:01,039
the company no longer
takes in refugees.

539
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,168
It's not your fault
the rain won't fall.

540
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,377
Sometimes I just wonder...

541
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,880
I just wonder that
maybe I could've saved-

542
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:10,632
- You have to kill them.
- I know.

543
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,509
It's a mercy.

544
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,928
- The vagrants only suffer.
- I know.

545
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,684
I suppose if it wasn't me,
it'll just be someone else.

546
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,065
I didn't want this for you.

547
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,275
I know.

548
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:31,569
We're almost done.

549
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,404
Let's move on to the next farm.

550
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:34,906
Yes.

551
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:36,783
Cadiz can mark this one as ours.

552
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,660
Good.
Mark it. Let's go.

553
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,245
Of course.

554
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,163
You two go on your way.

555
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,426
Agh!

556
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,431
Ah, fuck!

557
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,070
Alby!

558
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:49,822
It fits.

559
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,242
Alby!

560
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,036
Come on!
I got the cap for the plane.

561
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,746
Let's go.

562
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,090
No.

563
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,572
Ah!

564
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,543
Get the boys!

565
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,382
Alby, hide.

566
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,386
Agh!

567
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,110
God! Blood!

568
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:21,492
I must say,
I am pleased.

569
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:26,580
Finally a holdout
has come to me,

570
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:31,919
instead of cowering in your
hiding holes awaiting judgment.

571
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,004
Take a look, Brooke.

572
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,005
Look at her.

573
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:36,924
Yes, father.

574
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,467
Strong!

575
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,427
You must be the very last one.

576
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,724
The wells are all dry.
There's no one left.

577
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:49,311
My legacy is complete.

578
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,188
The valley's all yours, Brooke.

579
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:56,569
Daddy...

580
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,487
Come on,
come on.

581
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,866
Be strong.

582
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,078
Your future is secure.

583
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,084
This is Carson land.

584
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:14,044
Always was,
always will be.

585
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:17,631
And it'll rain on
generations to come yet.

586
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,429
I must apologize,

587
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,348
I would love to leave you
in this world.

588
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:31,437
But my daughter,

589
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,231
she can't stand competition.

590
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:41,405
Agh!

591
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,366
Ah!

592
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,412
Agh!

593
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,593
It's just you and me now.

594
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:16,357
See, just you and me.

595
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:24,883
Agh!

596
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:12,222
And Dean?

597
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,685
He's going to
stay behind.
