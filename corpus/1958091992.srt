and the Broadway stage.

25
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,880
People often ask me who were
my greatest comedy influences.

26
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,415
And as a kid growing up
in the '70s,

27
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,384
there were too many
to choose from.

28
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,554
Raymond Burr, Pat Nixon,
Johnny Mathis,

29
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,657
the woman from those
commercials who kept saying,

30
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,458
"Where's the beef?"

31
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,027
But let me tell you something.

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,664
Carol Burnett lands
a solid fifth on that list.

33
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,636
I know that you are
a very humble person

34
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,707
and that this all might be
kind of difficult for you.

35
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,611
And really all I can say is,

36
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,947
you got to brace yourself

37
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:59,218
because we are about
to lay it on really thick.

38
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,254
So, let's get started, shall we?

39
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,523
[ Cheers and applause ]

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,860
And I think
the best way to begin

41
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,829
is at the beginning.

42
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,800
I began my life
in show business as a fan.

43
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,301
As a little girl,

44
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,971
there was nothing I loved more
than going to the movies

45
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,739
with my grandmother, Nanny,

46
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,710
and I just wanted to climb
into the screen and live there.

47
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,080
At UCLA, I was going
to major in journalism,

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,649
and they didn't have
a major in journalism.

49
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,818
So I looked in the catalog,

50
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,387
and I found
Theater Arts/English.

51
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,057
I didn't realize that,
as a freshman,

52
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,993
when you're in
the Theater Arts department,

53
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,363
you had to take
an acting course.

54
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,431
And I was terrified.

55
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,135
And I was in this class
with about 10 other students.

56
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,237
And I had to do a scene,

57
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,039
and they cracked up.

58
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,574
The students cracked up.

59
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,942
They laughed and all like that,

60
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,712
and I thought,
"This is a good feeling.

61
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,681
I think I want to pursue this."

62
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,518
The bug bit
when I heard the laughter.

63
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,888
I joined a musical-comedy
workshop at UCLA.

64
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,091
I remember I did a scene
from "Annie Get Your Gun."

65
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,793
And there was a tap
on my shoulder,

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,896
and it was this gentleman
and his wife.

67
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,364
He said,
"We really enjoyed you.

68
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,166
What do you want
to do with your life?"

69
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,235
And I said, "Well, someday
I want to go to New York."

70
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,837
And he said,
"Why aren't you there now?"

71
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,607
Well, we were --

72
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,042
We were not wealthy.

73
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,978
Let me put it this way.
We were poor.

74
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,214
So I had no money
to go to New York.

75
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,785
And I just said, "Well,
someday I hope I can save up

76
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,620
to be able to go."

77
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,289
And he said,
"I'll lend you the money.

78
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,391
"There are stipulations.

79
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,062
"You pay it back
within five years if you can,

80
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,930
"if you're successful.

81
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,066
"You must never reveal my name.

82
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,668
You must pay it forward
and help others out."

83
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,605
Well, that was my ticket
to New York.

The John Foster Dulles song
was written by Ken Welch,

who was my coach
and special material writer.

136
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,472
Now, for those of you
who don't remember,

137
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,642
John Foster Dulles
was the Secretary of State,

138
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,611
and he was aptly named.

139
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,012
He was dull.

140
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,280
Kenny wrote the song,

141
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,216
and then I was asked to go
on the Jack Paar show.

142
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,119
There was such a big reaction,
Jack had me come back.

143
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,589
And then Ed Sullivan
had me do it on Sunday.

144
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,859
So, three times that week,
I did the Dulles number.

00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,295
Garry Moore had a variety show,

146
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,830
which was a very big hit,

147
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,065
and Martha Raye,

148
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,367
who was a brilliant comedienne,
was the guest,

149
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,503
but she came down with
a terrible case of bronchitis.

150
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,439
And Gary said,
"Can you come over

151
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,941
and be the guest
and replace Martha?"

152
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,010
Well, I ran over there
like Road Runner.

153
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,480
And Gary explained to the
audience there in the studio

154
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,183
that I had just come in
to do this,

155

and the audience
was very supportive.

156
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,822
Then, as a result, Bob Banner,
the executive producer,

157
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,992
asked me if I would want to be
a regular on Gary's show.

What makes me smile

is that both of us

One of my favorite parts
of "The Carol Burnett Show"

443

was what we just saw,

00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,895
when Carol would come out
on stage

and answer questions
from her audience.

446

It always felt
spontaneous and real,

always came through.

it looked kind of easy.

being so kind and helping me

because I wasn't really sure
what I was doing, you know,

as a partner

I was really frightened.
