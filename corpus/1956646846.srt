Oh, I'm so glad you could stop laughing

186
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,058
long enough to tell me that.

187
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,794
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,045
(laughing)

189
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:42,527
Took her out.

190
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,063
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,099
You're being ridiculous.

192
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,933
If you will just think about

193
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,271
what you're saying for a minute.

194
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:53,122
Think about it?

195
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,823
Greg, it's all I think about.

196
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,990
I kind of hoped you might have been

197
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,025
a little more supportive.

198
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,826
But you're not gonna change my mind.

199
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,123
It'll work out, I promise.

200
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,613
We're gonna have a baby, Greg.

201
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,498
We can build a life together.

202
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,483
(tires squealing)

203
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,047
We are out of here!

204
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,048
I hate this place.

205
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,035
[Nicole] Six more weeks!

206
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:37,009

I told you, nobody
named Stinky is allowed.

220
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,210
Hey.

221
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,329
First of all, you're too young.

222
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,609
Second of all, it's little league.

223
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,819
Next year, I promise.

224
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,369
You get a uniform, the whole deal.

225
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,369
Oh my God, I got accepted to college.

226
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,370
Huh, which one?

227
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:26,594
That's the thing, there's
two, Duke and Chapel Hill.

228
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:27,895
[Liz] Take your hat off.

229
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,309
Two schools in one day, that's great.

230
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,599
Yeah, congratulations, honey.

231
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,433
Thanks.

232
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,209
[Boy] Dad, we're gonna
be late for the game.

233
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,043
Oh, you're right.

234
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:36,970
Look, I'll get them ready in two minutes.

235
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,803
You meet me out there.

236
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:38,636
[Liz] Two minutes.

237
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:39,899
Congratulations, Nikki, really.

238
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,733
Thanks, Cal.

239
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:41,566
[Cal] Let's go.

240
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,849
Come on, come on, chop
chop, boys, let's go.

241
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,060
Here, take this.

242
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,223
Will you help me with these?

243
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,809
Duke and Chapel Hill.

244
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,599
Isn't Greg going to Chapel Hill?

245
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,797
Yeah, he is.

246
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,699
If I were you, I'd
wait for an invitation.

247
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,533
Mom.

248
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,366
What?

249
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:58,199
I just don't think he's someone

250
00:12:58,199 --> 00:12:59,032
you wanna let go of, you know?

251
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,359
Don't let him get away.

252
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,420
[Cal] Liz, let's go.

253
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:03,049
Coming, coming, coming!

254
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,889
Listen, after the game, we're
gonna go to lunch, okay?

255
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,879
Congratulations, see ya.

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,713
Thanks.

257
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,949
(uptempo rock music)

258
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:19,123
(chattering)

259
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,880
(phone ringing)

260
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:45,981
Greg, phone.

261
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,359
Hey, what's up?

262
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,809
Greg, why haven't you called me back?

263
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,259
I've left three messages for you.

264
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,149
Can't talk right now.

265
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,819
Greg, I'm not gonna just disappear.

266
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,215
You're gonna have to take responsibil...

267
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,260
(dial tone droning)

268
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,185
P.J., hold my calls.

269
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,374
[P.J.] You got it.

270
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,360
Who was that?

271
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,110
Some chick who wants to marry me.

272
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,540
(uptempo rock music)

273
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,039
If I can have everyone's
attention, please.

274
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,251
It's time for the old people to go to bed.

275
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,822
(laughing)

276
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:40,120
But before we go up, I
wanna make sure that my son

277
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,509
gets his birthday present.

278
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,889
Greg, I hope you haven't
been drinking tonight because

279
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,170
I'm certain you don't
wanna be dropping these

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,489
in the pool.

281
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,695
[Girl] Oh, wow.

282
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:52,803
[Girl] So lucky.

283
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,425
(applauding)

284
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,457
Did you know about this?

285
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,737
Maybe.

286
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:11,738
Yeah, I did.

287
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,909
Dad, this is incredible.

288
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,599
I don't know what to say.

289
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,810
I can ask you all to raise your glasses

290
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,309
to my son, Greg.

291
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,879
Your new set of wheels will be
taking you off to Chapel Hill

292
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,839
in just a few short months.

293
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,909
I want you to keep in mind
that same set of wheels

294
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,579
will bring you right
back home after college

295
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,980
should you choose to return.

296
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,630
I'm very proud of you, son.

297
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,060
You've got a great competitive spirit

298
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,239
and I see a great deal of success

299
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,790
and achievement in your future.

300
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,939
Happy birthday, son.

301
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,893
[All] Happy birthday.

302
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,506
Hey, let's get some cake.

303
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:54,352
You guys wanna get some cake?

304
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,998
[All] Yeah.

305
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,499
(tense music)

306
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,101
What, are you stalking me now?

307
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,972
Is it your birthday?

308
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:33,393
Is that what's going on?

309
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,283
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to spoil your party.

310
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,909
Look Greg, I know this is hard for you,

311
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,660
trying to fit me in with your
life and friends and all,

312
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,722
but when this baby is born and you see

313
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:50,767
that little face smiling up at you...

314
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:51,821
Listen.

315
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:54,739
Listen, maybe we can reach some
sort of agreement, alright?

316
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,729
Some kind of cash settlement or something.

317
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,369
Cash settlement?

318
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,203
I'm willing...

319
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:00,633
Is that what you think this is about?

320
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:05,139
Greg, this baby's gonna be
born and raised in this town.

321
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,590
Now do you want to tell
your parents or should I?

322
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,183
Greg.

323
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,040
The child needs to know
who it's father is.

324
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:25,765
(melancholy music)

325
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:39,742
(chattering)
(clapping)

326
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,716
Make a wish, son.

327
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:45,874
[Girl] Make a wish, Greg.

328
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:53,424
(cheering)

329
00:17:57,714 --> 00:18:00,131
(chattering)

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,563
It's so hard to imagine.

331
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,889
I've never sat and stared out
at this lake so many times.

332
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,499
It's just weird to think
that soon none of us

333
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,003
will even be here anymore.

334
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,250
You think you'll moved
back here after college?

335
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:21,318
I don't know.

336
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,679
I'm sure your dad will want you to.

337
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,409
I mean Dunleavy Development's gonna need

338
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,010
another Dunleavy someday, right?

339
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,233
It's not such a bad place, Tarrington.

340
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,260
I can see moving back here someday.

341
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,773
I still can't decide between
Duke and Chapel Hill.

342
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,393
I mean they're both such good schools.

343
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,919
You don't have to yet.

344
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,753
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,363
Hey, you okay?

346
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,113
Yeah.

347
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,193
Are we okay?

348
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,440
Yeah.

349
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I'm sorry, I'm just,

350
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:04,629
I'm just kinda distracted with something.

351
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,963
No, we're fine, we're good.

352
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,433
Hey Emily, it's me.

353
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,510
Yeah listen, we need to talk, okay?

354
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,529
Why don't I meet you on the corner

355
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,209
by the movie theater in about 20 minutes.

356
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,763
Fine, see you then.

357
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:14,484
So, you know what you want,

358
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:15,799
you want to wait a minute?

359
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,983
No, I'll have a cheeseburger,
french fries and root beer.

360
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,377
Miss?

361
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,210
Yeah?

362
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:24,850
I'm sorry about the other night.

363
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,287
I'm the brat that spilled iced tea on you.

364
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,346
That.

365
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,789
Shoot, don't worry about that.

366
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,605
That's an occupational hazard.

367
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,665
(laughing)

368
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,499
Order up.

369
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,899
Okay.

370
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,733
Okay.

371
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,329
No one has to know about
this but us, right?

372
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,889
We can go down to that
clinic in Charlotte.

373
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,199
We'll do it this weekend.

374
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Just tell my father...

375
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,392
You don't seem to understand Greg.

376
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:56,643
I'm gonna have this baby.

377
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm gonna raise it and I'm gonna love it,

378
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,102
and there's nothing you can
say that's gonna change...

379
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,609
You don't seem to understand Emily.

380
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,219
Do you think that I'm
gonna sit here and watch

381
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,779
my entire life get flushed
down the toilet, huh?

382
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,639
I mean is that what you really think?

383
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,799
Do you have any idea
what my father would say

384
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,949
if he found out about this?

385
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,783
I mean, gee.

386
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:14,979
Uh, congratulations Dad but your

387
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,892
illegitimate grandson, well he's gonna be

388
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,669
raised in that slum across town.

389
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,973
I mean, come on okay?

390
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,363
Is that all you care about?

391
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,233
Is what your father thinks?

392
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,292
Let's get it over with, then.

393
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,276
I'll tell him myself.

394
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:29,109
[Greg] Emily.

395
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:29,942
[Emily] Going right now.

396
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,438
Hey, Emily.

397
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,272
You will say nothing.

398
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,959
You are not having this baby, you hear me?

399
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,837
Yes, I am.

400
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:39,241

(tense rock music)

401
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:40,659

(chattering)

414
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,748
I just hope I find
a better class of boys

415
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:54,582
when I get to college.

416
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,333
Come on, they're not so bad.

417
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,937
What about P.J.?

418
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:01,404
I don't know.

419
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:03,675
I don't know.

420
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:06,369
It's kind of hard to take P.J. seriously.

421
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,989
I don't know, I think he's pretty cute,

422
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,012
in a goofy sort of way.

423
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:11,995
Yeah.

424
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,257
See?

425
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,776
She smiled.

426
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,249
In a goofy sort of way.

427
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,167
Yeah, come on, come on.

428
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:21,965
Ready?

429
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,830
Alright, fade on three.

430
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:25,998
One, two, hut!

431
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,604
Hey!

432
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:29,906
Hey, Sharon.

433
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:32,276
(giggling)

434
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,827
You look lovely this afternoon.

435
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,371
Want to go with me on Friday?

436
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,242
Mmm, I don't think so, P.J.

437
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:40,496
(laughing)

438
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:41,467
Oh look.

439
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,309
There's that waitress, remember?

440
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,629
The mother of the missing girl,

441
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,309
Tina DeCapprio said her
daughter was last seen

442
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,357
five days ago...

443
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:49,393
What happened?

444
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,398
Her daughter disappeared.

445
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,633
[Sharon] That's terrible.

446
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,589
Was just a few weeks shy of graduation

447
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,733
when police say she
mysteriously disappeared.

448
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,409
Authorities are asking
anyone with any information

449
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,124
on the whereabouts of Emily DeCapprio...

450
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,781
[Greg] Okay, boring.

451
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:05,867
Greg, I was watching that.

452
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:06,701
I'm sorry, honey.

453
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:08,259
It's the rule of the jungle.

454
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,422
Men rule the remote.

455
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,204
Oh, please.

456
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,038
Hey is anybody hungry?

457
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:12,871
You hungry?

458
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,890
Hey, Betty, could you make
us some sandwiches please?

459
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:15,882
[Girl] Want some more?

460
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:16,715
[Boy] Yeah.

461
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,548
Thank you.

462
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,541
Sorry.

463
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:22,421
Hi, Mom.

464
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,254
[Liz] Hey darling.

465
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,087
What's for dinner?

466
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,269
I'm starving.

467
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,029
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

468
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,867
It's Cal's father's birthday

469
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,669
and we're taking the
kids there for dinner.

470
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,667
They can't wait to help their
grandpa blow out the candles.

471
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:33,849
Come on guys, let's go.

472
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,369
You're welcome to come if you want.

473
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,290
No, that's fine.

474
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,209
Here, take this one.

475
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,577
Take that on out.

476
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm sorry I thought I told you.

477
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,739
There's pasta salad in the fridge.

478
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,989
Got it.

479
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,875
Have fun.

480
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,708
Yeah.

481
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,239
[Man On TV] Won't be
certain until the results

482
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,340
of the autopsy are in.

483
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,959
It's very important to try
to remember everything.

484
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,689
A missing child is perhaps the cruelest

485
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,759
form of punishment that any mother can

486
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,969
bear and to look in Tina DeCapprio's eyes

487
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,439
tells of that anguish.

488
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,739
Cards and letters continue to pour into

489
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,579
Tina from friends and strangers alike

490
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,527
most reading simply, "Emily come home."

491
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,419
[Nicole] Hi, is Tina here?

492
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,049
No, she's not working tonight.

493
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,329
Oh well, I owe her this card.

494
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,409
Could you give it to her?

495
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,009
Why don't you bring it by her house?

496
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,039
You just go up to Brock

497
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,769
and it's about a mile or so up the road.

498
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,289
You'll see it where all
the cars are parked.

499
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,813
Okay, thanks.

500
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,683
Hey, brat!

501
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,339
You're the one aren't you?

502
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,289
The one that spilled the iced tea?

503
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,093
Yeah, I don't want to disturb you.

504
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,749
I just wrote you a card.

505
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,779
I left it in the mailbox.

506
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,759
Well don't run off.

507
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,042
I just came out to get
some fresh air you know?

508
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,639
I mean all those people.

509
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,709
It's nice to know that people care

510
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,509
but they look at me with such pity

511
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,153
I think I should comfort them.

512
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,600
Cigarette?

513
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,019
Oh no, I don't smoke.

514
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,309
Oh, good for you.

515
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,399
Don't start.

516
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,683
You'll end up like me.

517
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,589
You know, Emily, she won't even let me

518
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,173
smoke in the house, you know?

519
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,949
Are you friend of hers?

520
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,883
No, I go to Tarrington.

521
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,889
I just heard about what
happened in the news

522
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,693
and well, I wrote you the card.

523
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,553
That's sweet.

524
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,645
Senior, right?

525
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,149
Yeah.

526
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,343
Yeah, you look to be about her age.

527
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,133
Must be exciting.

528
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,403
Never graduated myself.

529
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,679
I got pregnant, got married.

530
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,513
Dumped the husband but I love those kids.

531
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,399
What's your name?

532
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,233
Nicole.

533
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,023
Nicole.

534
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:35,219
That's pretty.

535
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,379
I'm Tina.

536
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,373
Yeah, I know.

537
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,529
Nicole, could I ask
you to do a favor for me?

538
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,827
Sure.

539
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:45,661
Great.

540
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,323
I've got posters up all over town,

541
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,113
everywhere from here to Cranston.

542
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,869
I was thinking that maybe
you could take some,

543
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,429
you know, over to Tarrington High?

544
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,089
Maybe somebody there knows something.

545
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,923
Oh wow.

546
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:04,959
She's really pretty.

547
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,179
Yeah.

548
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,263
You'll have to pardon the mess.

549
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,169
Emily's been trying to
teach me how to sew.

550
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,522
Good thing she's a patient girl.

551
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,749
I said we're gonna put in one hour

552
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,179
and the next thing you know it's midnight

553
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,009
and we're still yakking away.

554
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,960
It's nice that you guys are so close.

555
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,173
Well, you know how
mothers and daughters are.

556
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,543
Not all of them.

557
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,710
I better get going.

558
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,329
Listen, thanks for helping, Nicole.

559
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,939
It was nice to meet you.

560
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,140
Nice to meet you, too.

561
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:41,506
Goodnight.

562
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:52,465

566
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,149
P.J., tell me why we're here.

567
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,983
Why?

568
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,429
Because we're young and we're virile

569
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,919
and the world is our oyster.

570
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,113
Besides, I drove.

571
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:33,005
(mumbling)

572
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:39,381
[Greg] Did you get CDs, huh?

573
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,583
[P.J.] I'll find something.

574
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,553
[Nicole] Music?

575
00:29:43,553 --> 00:29:44,424
I got it.

576
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,410
(mellow pop music)

577
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:47,281
Relax, Greg.

578
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,115
It's the love shack.

579
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:49,519
No, it's my love shack and I don't feel

580
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,403
like being here right now.

581
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:51,310
Hey, come on.

582
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,356
Take a walk with me, okay?

583
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,190
So.

584
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,743
I want to leave them
alone for a little while,

585
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:58,809
besides, I want to tell
you what I did last night.

586
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,750
This is stupid.

587
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,701
She's never gonna go out with him.

588
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,059
(mumbling)

589
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,893
What, what?

590
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:04,153
What I did last night.

591
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,799
I went over to Vernon
and I visited that woman,

592
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,669
Tina DeCapprio, you know,
whose daughter is missing?

593
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,169
Oh, you know her?

594
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,003
Not really.

595
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:15,049
I mean, just from the diner.

596
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,789
I wanted to drop off a card
but somehow we got to talking.

597
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,019
[Greg] What'd you talk about?

598
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,989
[Nicole] A lot of things.

599
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,169
[Greg] Yeah?

600
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,879
I feel so sorry for her.

601
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,253
I mean she loves her daughter so much.

602
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,401
Emily.

603
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:28,360
And she was pretty too.

604
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,419
I mean, she she is pretty.

605
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,899
It's not like she's dead or something.

606
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,733
[Greg] I don't know.

607
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:33,566
I just I don't get where the whole

608
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,819
town's going nuts over some girl who's

609
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,810
probably just run away
from home or something.

610
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:37,312
[Nicole] Oh, look at that.

611
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,689
That's so cute.

612
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,523
[Greg] What?

613
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,429
It's like a little flower or something.

614
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,263
Lemme see.

615
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:48,642
Give it to me.

616
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:49,475
[Nicole] Hey!

617
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:50,308
Come on, Nic, give it to me.

618
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,141
[Nicole] No!

619
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:51,974
[Greg] Hey, come on.

620
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,209
I swear you are so spoiled sometimes.

621
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,536
Give it to me.

622
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:55,899
I know it may be hard
for you to believe,

623
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,329
but you can't have
everything you want exactly

624
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,453
when you want it.

625
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,069
The unthinkable has happened.

626
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,109
Sharon has agreed to go on a date with me,

627
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,849
an unsupervised, unchaperoned date.

628
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,303
This has been four years in the making.

629
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,939
Congratulations.

630
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,569
Great.

631
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,403
Told you.

Everything okay?

640
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,290
Ms. DeCapprio.

641
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,699
Can we talk for a minute?

642
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,649
Just wanted to touch base.

643
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,639
We'll be wrapping things up for now.

644
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,849
The state and federal
authorities are up to date,

645
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,839
and just as soon as we
hear anything at all...

646
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,629
Wait, what are you talking about?

647
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,963
Wrapping things up?

648
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:19,449
Ms. DeCapprio over 850,000
kids are reported missing

649
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,889
in this country every year,

650
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,229
and a vast majority of them
have simply run away from home,

651
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,359
especially girls her age.

652
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,199
Now we've talked with
her friends at school,

653
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,799
We've spoken on the
phone with Greg Dunleavy.

654
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,050
There's just not much
more the police can do.

655
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,823
Have you contacted all
her friends personally?

656
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,113
Just about.

657
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,987
(doorbell ringing)

658
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,373
Hello.

659
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:07,939
I'm looking for Greg Dunleavy.

660
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,709
Is this the right house?

661
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,743
Yes, come in.

662
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,823
Greg's out back.

663
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,590
Why don't you have a seat?

664
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,230
Can I get you something?

665
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,867
No, I'm fine, thank you.

666
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:37,074
(chattering)

667
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:38,019
Greg!

668
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,061
Someone's here to see you.

669
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,479
[Greg] Be back in a second.

670
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,563
I'm sorry, there's no
smoking in this house.

671
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,189
What is it you want to see Greg about?

672
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,023
It's personal.

673
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,270
You a friend of his?

674
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,883
Not really.

675
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,699
Hi, Ms. DeCapprio.

676
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,989
Greg.

677
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm really sorry about what's happened.

678
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,219
I've been meaning to come by and see you.

679
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,159
It's just, you know,
things have been so crazy

680
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,979
with graduation and finals coming.

681
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,813
Oh yeah.

682
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:54,077
You really can't wait to
get me out of here, can you?

683
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:57,719
You know, it's odd Greg,
but I don't think Emily's

684
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,789
ever met any of your friends.

685
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,879
As a matter of fact, I don't think

686
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,259
she's ever been in this house, has she?

687
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,279
For a close relationship, you've really

688
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,919
kept her stashed away.

689
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,009
Oh, we haven't really been
seeing each other that long,

690
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,449
Ms. DeCapprio, so we just kind of spent

691
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,939
most of our time alone.

692
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,263
Yes, I'm sure you did.

693
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,839
Look, I'll be brief.

694
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,579
I've talked to all of
her friends in Vernon.

695
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,529
They don't have a clue.

696
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,159
I just need to know if you have any

697
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,939
idea of what happened.

698
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,259
No, not really.

699
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,369
There was this, this one
thing a couple of weeks ago.

700
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,099
We were riding in the car together,

701
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,789
and this song came on the radio about

702
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,536
running away from home and Emily said,

703
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:37,597
"Maybe that's what I'll do.

704
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:39,529
"Maybe I'll run away."

705
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,746
Well, did she say anything else,

706
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:43,105
like where she would go
or who she would go with?

707
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:45,489
No, no, she never mentioned it again.

708
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,976
She just said, "Maybe
I'll run away from home."

709
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,977
And I never really gave it much thought.

710
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,100
Alright.

711
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:54,409
Well, I won't torture you any longer.

712
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,999
Look Greg, just promise
me if you hear anything

713
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,833
you'll give me a call.

714
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,666
- Of course.
- Tina.

715
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,279
What are you doing here?

716
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,723
Do you guys know each other?

717
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:09,072
Does this does have
something to do with Emily?

718
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,360
Excuse me, I'm in
the wrong neighborhood.

719
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,459
Greg, what's going on?

720
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,159
Well, she...

721
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,763
Tina, wait a minute.

722
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:23,325
Tina.

723
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,629
Tina, stop.

724
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,463
Talk to me.

725
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:28,350
What's going on?

726
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,749
I'm sorry, Nicole.

727
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,929
I just have bigger things
on my mind right now

728
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,803
than the love life of rich kids.

729
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,663
What?

730
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,503
Tina what is going on?

731
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,263
What do you think is going on?

732
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,073
Greg was seeing Emily, okay?

733
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,229
Your boyfriend was cheating on you.

734
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,333
Welcome to the real world.

735
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,751
(tense melancholy music)

736
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:06,020
(pop music)
(chattering)

737
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,020
I have no clue!

738
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,300
Excuse me, sir, what do
you think you're doing?

739
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,134
[Man] What am I doing?

740
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,639
That was the question.

741
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,257
I'm working for God.

742
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:22,231
What are you doing?

743
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,064
Okay, we're going to have to...

744
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:23,897
this is school property, son.

745
00:37:23,898 --> 00:37:25,449
I don't pay any attention to your...

746
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,009
I've seen that guy around.

747
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,829
He's always panhandling in the park.

748
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,754
Must be from another planet, I guess.

749
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:33,662
(siren blipping)

750
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,576
This whole town's looking for Emily.

751
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:36,442
[Officer] Alright, break it up.

752
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:37,692
Crazy people.

753
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,610
Right this way, thank you, officer.

754
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:42,470
(mumbling)

755
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:43,304
Okay, kids.

756
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,439
Get back to class.

757
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,674
[Officer] Let's go, let's go.

758
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:46,508
[Man] Let me get my cart.

759
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:47,341
[Officer] Yeah, no.

760
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:48,840
[Man] Let me get my cart.

761
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:49,674
[Officer] Keep moving.

762
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,902
(bell ringing)

763
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,450
Hey come on, just talk
to me for two minutes.

764
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:57,032
Greg, there's nothing left to say.

765
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:59,450
(chattering)

766
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,780
He really misses you, Nic.

767
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,969
So what, I'm supposed
to feel sorry for him?

768
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,259
You guys are so good together.

769
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,804
Yeah well, it isn't me
who screwed it up, is it?

770
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:14,889
Nicole.

771
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,253
Sharon, he lied to me.

772
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,519
Every time we were together
he was lying to my face.

773
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,149
I don't see how I'm supposed
to just get over that

774
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,983
like it's no...

775
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,433
Nic, please.

776
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,832
I'll talk to you later, okay?

777
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,439
Give me a second okay?

778
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,393
Let me, let me tell you how sorry I am.

779
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,689
Okay, you're sorry.

780
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,809
Have a nice life.

781
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,599
Nic, it wasn't a big thing with Emily.

782
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,429
I had only taken her
out a couple of times.

783
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,799
Really?

784
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,239
Just give me a few
minutes tonight, please.

785
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,073
I can't, I'm busy.

786
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:44,906
Nicole!

787
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,219
Actually I'm volunteering
for a search party tonight.

788
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,889
We'll be looking for
your other girlfriend.

789
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,154
Somebody said they saw her
near the woods by the old mill.

790
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:58,738
(bell ringing)

791
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,839
I wanna thank you all for volunteering

792
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,979
your time and energy this evening.

793
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,869
We're gonna spread out
about eight feet apart,

794
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,739
form a single line and walk due east.

795
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,519
Everyone move nice and slow
and keep your eyes wide open.

796
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,939
But before we go why don't we join hands

797
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,663
for a moment for a short prayer.

798
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,599
Dear Lord,

799
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,500
we're here to search for Emily tonight

800
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:35,763
but we ask that our
search prove fruitless,

801
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,280
for we pray that Emily is safe and sound

802
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,659
and will be returned to us shortly.

803
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,129
Amen.

804
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,009
Okay, let's spread out.

805
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,859
Move nice and slow and
keep your eyes wide open.

806
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,693
Let's go.

807
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,523
Single line eight feet apart.

808
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,856
(melancholy music)

809
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,467
I'm glad that we did the search.

810
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,456
I think it's for the best
that we didn't find her.

811
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:34,374
I guess you're right.

812
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:36,105
Hey.

813
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,041
Hey.

814
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:47,174
[Man] If there's anything
that we can do at all,

815
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,571
just give me a ring.

816
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,459
[Tina] I appreciate that.

817
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,539
[Man] Goodnight.

818
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,859
Goodnight.

819
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,462
I'm sorry about making
a scene the other day.

820
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:58,819
It's okay.

821
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,520
It's better that I know the truth.

822
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,510
How are you doing?

823
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:07,379
It's getting harder
and harder, you know?

824
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,139
Every night alone at home
waiting for the phone

825
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,609
and I don't know.

826
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,443
Maybe she did run away from home.

827
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,369
I know she was depressed
the last few weeks

828
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,929
and I couldn't get her to talk about it.

829
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,865
Maybe if I tried harder,
just reached out...

830
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:25,567
No, no.

831
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,459
Thanks for coming, Nicole.

832
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,043
It really means a lot to me.

833
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:35,823
Do you need a lift home?

834
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:37,635
No, no.

835
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:39,333
I came with the neighbors.

836
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,193
Take care.

837
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:48,229
Oh, graduation right, Saturday night?

838
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,063
Yeah.

839
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,829
Congratulations.

840
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,663
Thanks.

841
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,059
So, we were just walking off

842
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,110
the ninth hole and guess who we run into?

843
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,599
The Dunleavys.

844
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,209
So, we walked the
clubhouse to get a drink.

845
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,519
The men start talking business
and before you know it,

846
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,159
Ted Dunleavy has agreed to finance Cal's

847
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,360
new condominium project.

848
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,280
That's great.

849
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:16,319
Well, it's not a done deal yet,

850
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,979
but it looks really good.

851
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,279
Maybe you could get Greg to put in

852
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,270
a good word with his old man.

853
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,793
Greg and I aren't
seeing each other anymore.

854
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,043
Excuse me?

855
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,163
Things weren't working
out so I broke it off.

856
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,949
Why would you do that?

857
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,853
Because things weren't working out.

858
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,413
Excuse me.

859
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,054
I'll be right back.

860
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:54,536
Nicole.

861
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,749
Nicole, honey listen.

862
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,609
Whatever happened I'm
sure you can patch it up.

863
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,128
I'm sure if you just apologized,

864
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:01,962
Apologize?

865
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:02,940
He'd forgive you.

866
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:05,699
What makes you so certain
it was something that I did?

867
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,809
I didn't say that.

868
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,349
I'm just, I'm just trying to help.

869
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,519
Thanks a lot, Mom.

870
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,423
You've been very helpful, as usual.

871
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,459
(chattering)

872
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:25,509
Come on, you guys, we're gonna be late.

873
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,083
Okay wait.

874
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:27,917
How does my hair look?

875
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:28,979
Your hair looks great.

876
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,225
Kim, you've been wearing
your hair like that

877
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:31,727
since the seventh grade.

878
00:43:31,728 --> 00:43:32,561
Wait, wait.

879
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:34,646
One last rehearsal of the
cheerleading squad, okay?

880
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,847
I want you guys to pay
very close attention.

881
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,799
Jacket's gonna win and we can't be beat,

882
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,743
so let's fight for victory.

883
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:46,357
Jacket's gonna win and we can't be beat,

884
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:49,358
so let's fight for victory.

885
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,584
Jacket's gonna win and we can't be beat!

886
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:54,918
(screaming)

887
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:58,938

(mumbling)

892
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,920
No way, I'm wearing this
thing straight to college.

893

(excited chattering)

894
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:38,056
Alright!

895
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:45,513
Who wants a marshmallow?

896
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,284
[Girl] Who wants a burnt marshmallow?

00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:04,105
Hey Nic.

900
00:45:04,106 --> 00:45:05,356
Nic, come on, talk to me.

901
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,309
Hey, please.

902
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,261
If you knew what I was
going through right now...

903
00:45:10,262 --> 00:45:11,662
What you're going through?

904
00:45:13,184 --> 00:45:14,017
I'm sorry.

905
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,899
Listen,

906
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,689
I screwed up Nic,

907
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:20,570
big-time and

908
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,809
I am so, so sorry.

909
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,659
If you take me back, if you
give me just one more chance,

910
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,319
I promise I will never do anything to hurt

911
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,719
you for the rest of my life.

912
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,758
You lied to me.

913
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:36,139
I know.

914
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,519
How do you want me to believe
anything that you're saying?

915
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,270
Just give me another chance, Nic.

916
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,943
Please.

917
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,060
I got you something.

918
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,030
What's that supposed to mean?

919
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:53,269
It means I love you.

920
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,883
It means I miss you.

921
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,320
It means I want you to come to
Chapel Hill with me next year

922
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,833
so we can be together forever.

923
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,200
I really miss you, Nic.

924
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,433
I miss you, too.

925
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,153
[Greg] God, I love you so much.

926
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:24,993
I love you so much.

927
00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:32,129
(chattering)

928
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,669
Just one kiss, P.J., that's all.

929
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,820
We'll see about that.

930
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,657
Okay, let's see what you can do.

931
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,650
(laughing)

932
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:48,568
(mellow pop music)

933
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:54,105
What is that?

934
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:56,606
(tense music)

935
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:11,274
Oh my God.

936
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:13,608
(screaming)

937
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,149
It's that girl.

938
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,399
It's Emily.

939
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,950
[P.J.] I'll go call for help!

940
00:47:24,938 --> 00:47:28,021
(excited chattering)

941
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,337
[Girl] Poor thing.

942
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:50,382
(somber organ music)

943
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:07,301
God, her face was so cold.

944
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:11,396
I never knew a person could get that cold.

945
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:14,025
The police have any leads or anything?

946
00:48:14,026 --> 00:48:15,409
The paper said the body's being sent

947
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,913
to Charlotte for an autopsy.

948
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,699
Poor Tina.

949
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,629
Before we begin Ms.
DeCapprio asked me to announce

950
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,359
that the family will be
receiving at their home

951
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,119
this evening between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.

952
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,823
for all who wish to pay
their condolences personally.

953
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,229
Now that we've all taken our seats,

954
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,443
the service can begin.

955
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,390
I don't know, maybe I
should just wait out here.

956
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,983
Greg.

957
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,181
This is just feels kind
of weird Nic, you know?

958
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:57,699
I mean, going in there with you.

959
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,279
Everybody knows I was seeing Emily.

960
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,576
I don't want to hear this.

961
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:02,449
Ms. DeCapprio hates my guts as it is.

962
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,989
We're here to offer condolences.

963
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,717
Leave everything else out of it.

964
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,733
She's not even here.

965
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:20,919
Let's just go.

966
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,489
Wait.

967
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,490
I know where she is.

968
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,843
Tina?

969
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,549
I needed a cigarette, and
Emily won't let me smoke

970
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,880
in the house, so...

971
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,949
We both wanted to offer our condolences.

972
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,800
I'm really sorry about what happened.

973
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,869
Thanks, Greg, I appreciate that.

974
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,703
Sure.

975
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,100
How's Andy doing?

976
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,329
You know, it's hard to tell.

977
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,980
He keeps everything so bottled up

978
00:50:07,227 --> 00:50:09,099
but he's decided he wants to go home

979
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,939
with his dad for the summer and under

980
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,523
the circumstances it's
probably for the best.

981
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,742
I'm gonna give you guys a minute or two.

982
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:19,493
I'll wait in the car.

983
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,899
So you took him back?

984
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,393
He was really sorry.

985
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,170
What could I say?

986
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,659
Well, you could have said
what I said when I found out

987
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,263
my husband was running around.

988
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,403
Sorry's good but it's not good enough.

989
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,329
You know, Nicole women
weren't just put on this earth

990
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,233
to say and do and dress
the way men want them to.

991
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,843
It's an important lesson
for a girl to learn.

992
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:02,656
Well, I hope that's not what I do.

993
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,045
(melancholy music)

994
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:10,009
You know what I'd like to do?

995
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,639
I'd like to take some
flowers down to the lake

996
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,590
where they found her and then
plant some flowers for Emily.

997
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,099
Could you do that with me?

998
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,267
I'd love to.

999
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:21,259
Thank you.

1000
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,429
It seems all of Tarrington
turned out Saturday to say

1001
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,539
goodbye to Emily, the young girl whose

1002
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,569
body was found late last week on the

1003
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,366
shores of Scofield
Lake, brutally murdered.

1004
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,159
It was a somber affair.

1005
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,439
Family, classmates,
strangers alike attended

1006
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,849
the service where Emily
DeCapprio was eulogized

1007
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,539
as a wonderful girl, senselessly taken

1008
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,730
in the prime of her...

1009
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,288
[Greg] Hey.

1010
00:51:57,289 --> 00:51:59,039
Didn't see you there.

1011
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:03,288
(melancholy music)

1012
00:52:11,473 --> 00:52:13,723
(mumbling)

1013
00:52:16,022 --> 00:52:17,022
That's it.

1014
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,693
Oh, I don't want to cry anymore.

1015
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,633
I've been crying for weeks.

1016
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,920
Just wanna sit here, hold hands

1017
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,293
have silence.

1018
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,060
Moment of silence

1019
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,153
for Emily.

1020
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:47,373
Oh God.

1021
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:49,488
(sobbing)

1022
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:51,023
I want her back.

1023
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,044
I want her back.

1024
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,045
Oh God, I want her back.

1025
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:04,099
I just don't understand
how anybody could do that.

1026
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,529
Kill a girl, stuff her in a trash bag,

1027
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,769
dump her in the middle of a lake.

1028
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,029
Hell of way to remember our
last summer in Tarrington.

1029
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,129
Well, it's over now.

1030
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:12,963
Over?

1031
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:14,319
You know that creep is
still out there somewhere.

1032
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,669
Who knows who he'll get next.

1033
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,503
Oh, thanks, Kim.

1034
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:17,880
That'll help us sleep tonight.

1035
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,579
You know, there's just one thing

1036
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,780
that I don't understand.

1037
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,453
Why did you tell Tina that
you thought Emily ran away?

1038
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,479
That's what she said
she was planning to do.

1039
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,109
Yeah, maybe she did run away.

1040
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,322
Maybe she was hitchhiking out of town

1041
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:34,103
and she got picked up by some
serial killer or something.

1042
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,939
You've sure been spending a lot of time

1043
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,123
with that woman lately.

1044
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:40,723
We're friends.

1045
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:42,549
That just seems kind of weird.

1046
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,179
I mean all of a sudden you're
off hanging out in Vernon.

1047
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,149
She's poor, Sharon.

1048
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,463
That's where she lives.

1049
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,809
It's not like everybody that lives in

1050
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,209
Vernon is a criminal.

1051
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,519
Whatever.

1052
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,489
You know, I just don't see
what you two have in common.

1053
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,139
I don't know.

1054
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,933
Maybe I remind her of Emily.

1055
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,409
What do you think, Greg?

1056
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,386
Do I remind you of Emily?

1057
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:06,470
Nicole.

1058
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:09,888
(tense melancholy music)

1059
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:35,189
You wanna go for a swim?

1060
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,327
No, I think I'm just gonna go home.

1061
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,569
[Bill] Are you Greg Dunleavy?

1062
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:51,403
[Greg] Yeah.

1063
00:54:51,403 --> 00:54:52,403
Detective Phil Rodlauer.

1064
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,272
This is Detective Connie Lang.

1065
00:54:54,273 --> 00:54:55,106
[Greg] How are you doing?

1066
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:56,909
[Phil] we're gonna need to
talk to you for a few minutes.

1067
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,880
Phil, what's going on?

1068
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,752
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Dunleavy.

1069
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:04,022
We're gonna need Greg for a
while down at the station.

1070
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:04,856
Now?

1071
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:06,279
But it's almost dinnertime.

1072
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,406
Phil, we're just about
to sit down for dinner.

1073
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,409
How about I give you a call later on?

1074
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,619
We can talk about this.

1075
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,499
I think it'd be best
if he came down now.

1076
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,509
It's the Emily DeCapprio situation.

1077
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,239
There've been some developments.

1078
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,439
You're welcome to come if you like.

1079
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,363
You can follow us down in your own car.

1080
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,448
(tense music)

1081
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:27,199
(chattering on police radio)

1082
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,889
Do you know what's going on?

1083
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,599
The police just came and got Greg.

1084
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,409
They said something
about a new development.

1085
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,779
Mmm, they performed
an autopsy in Charlotte.

1086
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,439
Results just came back.

1087
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,273
And?

1088
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:50,189
Well, she wasn't drowned.

1089
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,269
Her lungs were still full of air.

1090
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,089
That's why she floated up
to the surface like that.

1091
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,259
Apparently she'd been
killed somewhere else.

1092
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,567
Strangled, then dumped in a
lake an hour so after death.

1093
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:03,913
Phil, can we get to the point here?

1094
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,009
The coroner discovered another surprise.

1095
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,439
She was pregnant.

1096
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,273
Oh my God.

1097
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,809
About six weeks.

1098
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,119
See, it all makes sense now.

1099
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,129
That's why she was acting so worried.

1100
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,029
I knew something was on her mind but I

1101
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,583
could not get her to talk to me about it.

1102
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,719
The baby was Greg's.

1103
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,059
No.

1104
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,709
So you had no idea at all?

1105
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,359
No, she didn't say a thing.

1106
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,439
I mean, we weren't really all that close.

1107
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,887
We were just kind of hanging out.

1108
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:38,926
It wasn't a real big deal.

1109
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:40,559
Her mother, Tina, she seemed to think

1110
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,803
it was a very big deal.

1111
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,679
She said you were the only boy

1112
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,619
Emily was sexually involved with.

1113
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,550
Well...

1114
00:56:46,551 --> 00:56:49,319
There was nothing casual about this.

1115
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,153
She loved Greg.

1116
00:56:50,154 --> 00:56:52,599
She thought they'd get married someday.

1117
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,509
The baby was his and he panicked.

1118
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,923
He was desperate, backed into a corner.

1119
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,149
Tina, what are you saying?

1120
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,359
Are we in some kind
of trouble here, Phil?

1121
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,010
Should I be looking for a lawyer?

1122
00:57:07,822 --> 00:57:09,139
I just wanted to discuss this quietly

1123
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,853
before it spread like wildfire.

1124
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,009
There's no evidence yet
it was even Greg's baby,

1125
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,256
aside from what Tina DeCapprio is saying.

1126
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:18,449
And what else is Ms. DeCapprio saying?

1127
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:22,529
I have tried to hold my
tongue but I can't any longer.

1128
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,480
Too many things are starting to add up.

1129
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,989
Why didn't he ever come and
see me while she was missing?

1130
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,839
And why was he so
uncomfortable at the funeral?

1131
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,319
He wouldn't look me in the eye.

1132
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,613
And that that whole story
about her planning to run away.

1133
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,139
Emily wouldn't do that.

1134
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,523
Not six weeks pregnant.

1135
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:45,759
She, she got pregnant and he panicked.

1136
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,982
No, no, Greg couldn't do this.

1137
00:57:48,983 --> 00:57:50,409
It's not possible.

1138
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,559
He did it.

1139
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,359
He strangled my baby with his bare hands

1140
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,539
and then he dumped her body in the middle

1141
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,379
of that lake like a piece of garbage.

1142
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,989
He did it, Nicole.

1143
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,913
Greg murdered Emily.

1144
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,996
(melancholy music)

1145
00:58:07,997 --> 00:58:08,830
No.

1146
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:21,890
(chattering)

1147
00:58:33,164 --> 00:58:34,664
I hate this.

1148
00:58:34,665 --> 00:58:35,500
Everybody's looking at me.

1149
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,150
It's like people know everything.

1150
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,973
You don't have to go in.

1151
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:43,153
It's okay as long as you stay close by.

1152
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,769
Have you been smoking?

1153
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,119
I've never had a cigarette in my life.

1154
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,423
You smell like cigarettes.

1155
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,379
Poor guy, he looks so depressed.

1156
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,569
Who wouldn't be?

1157
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,506
Hauled in and accused of murder.

1158
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,609
And Nicole hanging around
with the dead girl's mom

1159
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,175
all the time.

1160
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,370
Like it isn't enough
problems to deal with.

1161
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:14,739
Things sure haven't
changed at the old school.

1162
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,253
Punch is still weak and
the band still sucks.

1163
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,499
Yeah.

1164
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,053
So, with me the police
suspect Greg anyway?

1165
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:23,890
They don't suspect him.

1166
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:25,989
They just wanted to talk to him.

1167
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:28,809
It's Tina DeCapprio that's
been pointing fingers.

1168
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,669
Well, apparently she's
saying all kinds of things

1169
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,826
about Greg to the police.

1170
00:59:31,827 --> 00:59:33,919
No, she just told them the truth,

1171
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,415
that Greg was seeing Emily.

1172
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:37,069
You know, I don't know why
you're defending her Nicole.

1173
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,529
She's saying Greg's a murderer.

1174
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,439
And I don't know why
you're attacking her, Sharon.

1175
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,713
You don't even know her.

1176
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,683
Yeah and you seem to be her best friend.

1177
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:49,031
(chattering)

1178
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,959
He was president of the student council

1179
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,599
last year and she was council treasurer.

1180
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,019
Let's welcome Steven Ray and Dori Street.

1181
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,270
(cheering)

1182
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,969
Next to the dance floor one of our

1183
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,959
favorite couples of the graduating class.

1184
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,969
He was our starting quarterback and she

1185
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,139
was captain of the cheerleading squad

1186
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,539
and they're both headed
for Chapel Hill this fall.

1187
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,936
Let's hear it for Greg
Dunleavy and Nicole Voss.

1188
01:00:25,937 --> 01:00:28,187
(cheering)

1189
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,214
Yeah, I can't believe she has the nerve

1190
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,365
to go out there and dance with him.

1191
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:36,652
Well, give her a break.

1192
01:00:36,653 --> 01:00:37,610
(chattering)

1193
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:40,883
Let's everybody dance and have fun.

1194
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:41,717
(uptempo music)

1195
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:45,710
♪ And as sure as there's a sky above ♪

1196
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:50,711
♪ And fools still searching ♪

1197
01:00:51,675 --> 01:00:55,624

♪ Ain't no rules for love ♪

1200
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,883
[Greg] Tina tell you
that Emily was pregnant?

1201
01:01:05,845 --> 01:01:07,989
[Nicole] Yes.

1202
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,953
Probably best if that didn't get around.

1203
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,189
You know you probably don't wanna tell

1204
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,189
Tina this but it could have
been any one of a dozen guys.

1205
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,649
I mean Emily really liked to get drunk

1206
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,799
and when she got drunk...

1207
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,850
Greg, she isn't here to defend herself.

1208
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,196
So what kind of stuff
did the police ask you?

1209
01:01:31,197 --> 01:01:32,633
Normal kinds of stuff.

1210
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,419
They didn't ask you where you were the

1211
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,470
night she was killed?

1212
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,613
Yeah.

1213
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,050
So where were you?

1214
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:45,409
I can't believe you're asking me that.

1215
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,179
First you cheated on me, then that same

1216
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,013
girl is found murdered.

1217
01:01:48,013 --> 01:01:48,846
Now the police...

1218
01:01:48,847 --> 01:01:50,485
I can't believe what you're saying.

1219
01:01:50,486 --> 01:01:53,136
Do you really think I could
strangle someone, Nicole?

1220
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,843
Have these hands ever hurt you?

1221
01:01:57,353 --> 01:01:59,709
I want you to stop seeing Tina DeCapprio.

1222
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,009
You understand me?

1223
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,509
She is bitter and she's angry.

1224
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,932
She's turning you against me.

1225
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:06,349
Now, I am fighting for my
life here, you understand?

1226
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,923
And you just better figure
out whose side you're on.

1227
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:14,701
(melancholy music)

1228
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,234
(tires squealing)

1229
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,333
No, thank you.

1230
01:02:34,881 --> 01:02:36,969
Who the hell does she think she is?`

1231
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,803
Who, dear?

1232
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,729
Although Tina DeCapprio
has avoided the press,

1233
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,899
sources say that she
has told police bluntly

1234
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,527
who she suspects committed the crime.

1235
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:48,878
A young man from a
prominent Tarrington family.

1236
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:52,027
(thudding)

1237
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,729
[Phil] Detective Rodlauer.

1238
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,869
Hi, I'm Nicole Voss.

1239
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,152
Yes, I know who you are.

1240
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:01,653
What can I do for you, Nicole?

1241
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,429
I'm very close with Greg Dunleavy.

1242
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,183
I've known him for many years.

1243
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,029
I've also recently become
friendly with Tina DeCapprio.

1244
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,929
I just wanted to talk to
you and get a sense of where

1245
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,543
your investigation is going.

1246
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,409
You know, see if you really think

1247
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,539
that Greg could've...

1248
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,403
Murdered Emily?

1249
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,839
I was thinking of calling you in

1250
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,749
to ask the exact same question.

1251
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,899
You've known Greg a while.

1252
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,349
Has he ever hit you,
shown signs of violence?

1253
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,230
No.

1254
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:33,319
[Phil] Good upstanding boyfriend?

1255
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,260
Yeah.

1256
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:35,803
Never cheated, never lied?

1257
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,063
What do you think Nicole?

1258
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:40,330
Do you think he killed her?

1259
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,319
Of course not.

1260
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,623
But you wouldn't say
it's impossible, would ya?

1261
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,453
[Connie] Phil.

1262
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,860
Thanks for stopping by.

1263
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:17,739
There you are.

1264
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,573
You're just in time.

1265
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:20,259
Come on we're celebrating.

1266
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,093
Celebrating what?

1267
01:04:21,094 --> 01:04:23,273
Cal and Ted just closed the deal.

1268
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:24,376
It's so exciting!

1269
01:04:24,377 --> 01:04:26,460
Don't say anything, okay?

1270
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,069
[Cal] Look who's here.

1271
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:29,903
Nicole.

1272
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:30,770
Hello, dear.

1273
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,713
Could you possibly be more adorable?

1274
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:34,964
(laughing)

1275
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,839
A lot of people are shying away
from new home construction.

1276
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,673
Boy, not me.

1277
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,558
I say let's keep Tarrington expanding.

1278
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:42,392
Yep.

1279
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:43,609
Thank you.

1280
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,749
Especially if you want to have a healthy

1281
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,662
economy by the time our
grandkids are grown up.

1282
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:48,099
The way things are going that

1283
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,723
might not be too long from now.

1284
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,469
[Ted] Nicole you must be
excited about heading off

1285
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,929
to Chapel Hill in a couple of months huh?

1286
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,763
Yes, I am.

1287
01:04:56,764 --> 01:04:58,939
[Ted] Oh, I know Greg sure is.

1288
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,959
[Rachel] I'm just afraid
that he won't return.

1289
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,229
I mean what with the way the police

1290
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,469
have been treating him lately.

1291
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,589
[Liz] Oh, they'll sort
that out, don't you think?

1292
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:08,149
It'll sort itself out
if that DeCapprio woman

1293
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,209
would just concentrate on waiting tables.

1294
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,473
Leave the police work to the police.

1295
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,839
Nicole I understand
she's a friend of yours.

1296
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,993
Yes, she is.

1297
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,689
Nicole is the kind of girl who's very

1298
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,266
fond of bringing home
stray animals, puppies.

1299
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:28,649
(chuckling)

1300
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,779
[Cal] That's right.

1301
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,629
Mom, she's not a puppy.

1302
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,980
She's a woman whose
daughter has been murdered.

1303
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,333
I know that, I know.

1304
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,779
Nicole, it's a horrible
thing that's happened,

1305
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,959
but she can't just go around

1306
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,019
telling lies about
innocent people, can she?

1307
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,529
You know I was hoping
that maybe you could try

1308
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:50,980
and talk some sense into her.

1309
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,723
I mean since you two
are such close friends.

1310
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,476
(melancholy music)

1311
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:05,229
You'll have to excuse me.

1312
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,063
Nicole.

1313
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,493
She's upset.

1314
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,673
Excuse me.

1315
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,583
Nicole come back.

1316
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,413
Nicole.

1317
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:27,033
(phone ringing)

1318
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,030
Hello?

1319
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:32,279
Hi Nicole.

1320
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,113
It's Kim.

1321
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,959
Look I just wanted to let
you know there's gonna be

1322
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,809
a party fourth of July on the lake.

1323
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,049
North shore by the rowboats.

1324
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:39,883
I don't think so.

1325
01:06:39,884 --> 01:06:41,859
I, I don't think I can.

1326
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,419
You know, Nicole Greg
is going through a very

1327
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,539
difficult time right now.

1328
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,669
The least you can do is show some support.

1329
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,739
He's lied to me before.

1330
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,940
How do I know that he's
not lying to me now?

1331
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,359
I want to believe him, I do.

1332
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,193
I just,

1333
01:06:55,723 --> 01:06:57,869
I just don't know what to do believe.

1334
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,810
Forget it then.

1335
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:00,229
You know, I'm only even
telling you because

1336
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,099
I thought Greg might want you there.

1337
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,923
You know Sharon and Stacey
didn't even want to invite you.

1338
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:09,267
(dial tone blaring)

1339
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,973
I'm not asking for
anything unreasonable.

1340
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:22,769
My family's been slandered.

1341
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,709
My son's been falsely accused of murder.

1342
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:27,239
Mr. Dunleavy, no one here's
accused your son of anything.

1343
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,929
Oh for heaven sakes, Phil.

1344
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,557
The entire town is accusing him.

1345
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,953
You owe us a statement,

1346
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,219
a letter to the press
that fully exonerates Greg

1347
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,770
of an evil criminal wrongdoing.

1348
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
I'm afraid we can't do that right now.

1349
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,540
What do you think, Connie?

1350
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,064
We got enough to make stick?

1351
01:08:03,065 --> 01:08:04,232
It'll stick.

1352
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:06,114
Let's go.

1353
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:11,504
(tense music)

1354
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:30,778
(thudding)

1355
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:32,131
[Cop] Freeze!

1356
01:08:32,132 --> 01:08:33,040
Get down!

1357
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,011
On the floor!

1358
01:08:34,012 --> 01:08:36,242
On your knees, right now!

1359
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:37,423
[Phil] Aaron Clemens,
you're under arrest

1360
01:08:37,424 --> 01:08:41,519
for the kidnap and murder
of Emily DeCapprio.

1361
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,724
[Connie] Get him out of here.

1362
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:45,685
(rock music)

1363
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,890
Against my Constitutional rights.

1364
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:48,724
This is against the Constitution

1365
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,259
of the United States of America

1366
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,462
which was written by Thomas
Jefferson, George Washington.

1367
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:53,296
You ever read it?

1368
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,559
Read it, read it.

1369
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,604
I can paint anything I want.

1370
01:08:56,605 --> 01:08:57,438
This is America.

1371
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,440
I can do anything I want.

1372
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,341
This is fascism, that what (mumbling).

1373
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,249
(rock music)

1374
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,083
Jeez.

1375
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:08,788
Look at this.

1376
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:11,289
Let's get some photos in here.

1377
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,123
Looks like we found our boy.

1378
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:24,827
♪ Something across the light ♪

1379
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,613
Okay, but why Emily?

1380
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:28,829
Look, I'm the only person in this room

1381
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,713
who cares anything about Emily.

1382
01:09:31,809 --> 01:09:34,259
To you guys she's
nothing but another case.

1383
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,609
To me, she was...

1384
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,619
His name is Aaron Clemens.

1385
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,489
He has a long history of mental
illness and violent crimes.

1386
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:43,699
In fact, he was just released
from a correctional mental

1387
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,053
institution upstate 90 days ago.

1388
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,899
There was plenty of evidence in his house

1389
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,469
and he's the one who's been drawing

1390
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:53,019
the murals of Emily all over town.

1391
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,220
It's like he's been
crying out to be caught.

1392
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,389
Are you sure?

1393
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,979
Are you absolutely sure?

1394
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,393
Yeah, we're sure.

1395
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,139
[Phil] Look, you've got her
pictures all over your walls.

1396
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,019
When I take her picture,
when I'm painting her pictures,

1397
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,853
she's still alive.

1398
01:10:06,854 --> 01:10:07,989
Don't you see that?

1399
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,823
She's still alive.

1400
01:10:08,824 --> 01:10:09,939
I'm the only one keeping her alive

1401
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,399
and there's a killer out there.

1402
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,529
There's a killer out there who

1403
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,483
took Emily and it's not me.

1404
01:10:17,236 --> 01:10:19,229
[Nicole] I'm home.

1405
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:20,063
Nicole.

1406
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,273
Did you hear the news?

1407
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,749
No, what happened?

1408
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,700
The police arrested the man
who murdered Emily DeCapprio.

1409
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,053
His name is not Greg Dunleavy.

1410
01:10:42,025 --> 01:10:43,319
(tense music)

1411
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,361
[Woman] Taking off, Tina?

1412
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:45,195
[Tina] Yeah.

1413
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:46,379
[Woman] Okay, you have a
good night now, you hear?

1414
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,213
Okay.

1415
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:54,199
Nicole.

1416
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,033
[Nicole] Hi.

1417
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:56,909
Hi, I was gonna call you.

1418
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,199
I don't know if you heard.

1419
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,819
Yeah, I did.

1420
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,419
Police think they got the right guy.

1421
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,499
I mean, this guy's got
a record a mile long

1422
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,289
and he has the strangest eyes.

1423
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,299
If you could just look into those eyes.

1424
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,600
Yeah well, I guess it
wasn't Greg after all.

1425
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,573
Oh, Nicole.

1426
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:12,406
I'm so sorry.

1427
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,660
Tina, I am glad that they found him.

1428
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:19,145
I'm just sorry it had
to ruin everybody else's

1429
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:21,209
life in the process.

1430
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,329
Oh, Nicole.

1431
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,539
It was my fault.

1432
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,563
It was all my dumb suspicions.

1433
01:11:26,564 --> 01:11:29,779
I mean, I was irresponsible.

1434
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,163
I apologize.

1435
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,579
Well, it's over.

1436
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,523
I'm glad for you.

1437
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,773
I gotta go.

1438
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,999
Hey you know I was thinking about going

1439
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,889
down to the lake later this week to check

1440
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,379
on Emily's flowers, see how they're doing.

1441
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,319
Maybe you want to come along?

1442
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,070
I don't think that's a good idea.

1443
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:55,736
Take care.

1444
01:11:57,435 --> 01:12:00,018
(somber music)

1445
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:17,552
(uptempo music)

1446
01:12:17,553 --> 01:12:20,636
(excited chattering)

1447
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,030
Look who's here.

1448
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:46,449
Guess they must have run out of hot dogs

1449
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,283
over in Vernon.

1450
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:49,478
(laughing)

1451
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,373
Hey, Nic.

1452
01:12:56,547 --> 01:12:57,849
Hey.

1453
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,339
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1454
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,173
Sure.

1455
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:08,157
I'm sorry.

1456
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,423
I was confused.

1457
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,363
There's so much coming at me so fast.

1458
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,993
Tina is a good person, she is.

1459
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:20,758
I don't know.

1460
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:21,660
Maybe I shouldn't have been spending

1461
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:23,334
so much time around her.

1462
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:25,826
That really hurt Nic, you know?

1463
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:28,849
I mean all my friends
were totally there for me,

1464
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:29,753
everyone but you.

1465
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:33,597
We had something special.

1466
01:13:33,598 --> 01:13:35,379
I thought we loved each other.

1467
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,887
Greg, I do love you.

1468
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,129
I do.

1469
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:40,963
I messed up.

1470
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:44,500
All I can do is ask you to forgive me.

1471
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,170
I guess that's what love's all about.

1472
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,123
Forgiveness.

1473
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,713
Hey.

1474
01:13:56,714 --> 01:13:58,429
Let's go for a row.

1475
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:59,263
[Nicole] Greg.

1476
01:13:59,263 --> 01:14:00,096
Come on.

1477
01:14:00,097 --> 01:14:01,429
what better way to celebrate
the fourth of July?

1478
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:02,649
Greg, it feels weird.

1479
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,209
Nic, we've been on this
thing a hundred times.

1480
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,319
Yeah, I know but,

1481
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,439
now it feels like we're
playing on someone's grave.

1482
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,273
Hang on.

1483
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,038
See?

1484
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,688
It's the same lake it always was.

1485
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,740
It just doesn't feel the same.

1486
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:27,074
I keep thinking about
what happened out here.

1487
01:14:27,075 --> 01:14:28,974
Something happened.

1488
01:14:28,975 --> 01:14:31,834
Something happened, but it's over, okay?

1489
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:33,950
This is our lake, Nic.

1490
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:34,886
We just have to take it back.

1491
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:35,803
Greg, no.

1492
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,411
(cheering)

1493
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:41,829
(chattering)

1494
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:56,217
(uptempo rock music)

1495
01:14:56,218 --> 01:14:57,051
You're back.

1496
01:14:57,052 --> 01:14:58,573
It's good to be back.

1497
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:01,337
[P.J.] Beer?

1498
01:15:01,338 --> 01:15:03,422
We got one right here P.J.

1499
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:05,085
[P.J.] Yeah, right.

1500
01:15:05,086 --> 01:15:06,677
(chuckling)

1501
01:15:06,678 --> 01:15:07,511
No?

1502
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:08,344
No.

1503
01:15:08,345 --> 01:15:11,743
It was fun for a while but
definitely not meant to last.

1504
01:15:11,744 --> 01:15:13,249
You're so bad.

1505
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,947
Hey, it's that guy they arrested.

1506
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:19,031
(uptempo rock music)

1507
01:15:34,143 --> 01:15:36,643
(tense music)

1508
01:15:39,975 --> 01:15:41,709
Weird huh?

1509
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,896
Our very own murderer.

1510
01:15:43,897 --> 01:15:47,147
Right here in sleepy little Tarrington.

1511
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:49,988
Nicole?

1512
01:15:49,989 --> 01:15:50,822
Hey!

1513
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,991
You know, I'm not feeling very well.

1514
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:57,575
I think I'm just gonna go home.

1515
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:00,605
Have fun.

1516
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:01,439
Bye.

1517
01:16:03,022 --> 01:16:03,939
Hey, Nic.

1518
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:06,860
What's up?

1519
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:08,247
I'm not feeling very well.

1520
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:09,729
I think I'm just gonna go home.

1521
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,955
Ah, I'll give you a lift.

1522
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:12,046
No, it's okay.

1523
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:13,664
I'll drive.

1524
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:15,582
I'll talk to you later.

1525
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:20,974
(uptempo rock music)

1526
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,763
Detective Rodlauer.

1527
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:37,570
You're back.

1528
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:40,379
Listen, I saw something on TV.

1529
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,149
I'm not certain that it
was what I think it was,

1530
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,284
but it may be something very important.

1531
01:16:45,285 --> 01:16:46,499
[Woman On Speaker]
Phil, the DA's are here.

1532
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,932
[Phil] I'm on my way.

1533
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:49,119
I just need a few minutes.

1534
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,789
Look, I got a lot of work to do.

1535
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,459
Your boyfriend's in the clear, okay?

1536
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,510
So just relax with the Nancy Drew routine

1537
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,913
Go home, have a nice summer vacation.

1538
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:01,523
Wait a minute.

1539
01:17:03,171 --> 01:17:05,921
(phones ringing)

1540
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,967
(clattering)

1541
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,056
(tense music)

1542
01:17:41,343 --> 01:17:44,010
(phone ringing)

1543
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,093
Hello?

1544
01:17:46,093 --> 01:17:46,926
What's up?

1545
01:17:46,926 --> 01:17:47,759
It's Greg.

1546
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,959
Remember me, your boyfriend
that you didn't call

1547
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,842
after you left the party early?

1548
01:17:50,843 --> 01:17:51,676
I was worried.

1549
01:17:51,676 --> 01:17:52,509
How you feelin'?

1550
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,340
I have a stomachache,
cramps or something.

1551
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,749
Well, I decided to go
waterskiing with my family

1552
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,639
this weekend and we're
leaving right after dinner

1553
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,159
so I'm gonna swing by
and see you before I go.

1554
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:01,993
No I can't.

1555
01:18:01,994 --> 01:18:03,089
Come on, Nic.

1556
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:04,649
I'm not gonna see you
for three whole days.

1557
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:05,543
I can't.

1558
01:18:05,544 --> 01:18:06,759
I have a family thing.

1559
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,769
You know, it's my mom's birthday.

1560
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,119
We're all going out to dinner.

1561
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,359
Okay, okay so I guess I'll
see you when I get back.

1562
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,489
Yeah, call me on Sunday okay?

1563
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,323
Sure.

1564
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:17,802
I love you.

1565
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:18,937
You, too.

1566
01:18:18,938 --> 01:18:21,438
(tense music)

1567
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,220
[Tina On Phone] Hello?

1568
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:28,023
Tina, it's Nicole,
I need to talk to you.

1569
01:18:28,024 --> 01:18:28,857
[Tina On Phone] I've
got the dinner shift

1570
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:29,690
in half an hour.

1571
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:30,969
I'll be back later, okay?

1572
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,803
It can't wait.

1573
01:18:31,803 --> 01:18:32,636
I need to talk to you right now.

1574
01:18:32,636 --> 01:18:33,469
I'm leaving.

1575
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:34,396
Wait for me, okay?

1576
01:18:34,397 --> 01:18:36,313
[Tina On Phone] Okay.

1577
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:39,678
(tense music)

1578
01:19:22,864 --> 01:19:25,114
(knocking)

1579
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:27,683
Can I come in?

1580
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,693
There's a warehouse up on Shattuck Road.

1581
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:40,393
It's out in the middle of
nowhere, all by itself.

1582
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,350
Greg's father owns it and

1583
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,123
he takes me there to be alone sometimes.

1584
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,230
I guess he takes other girls there, too.

1585
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,409
I found this there in the back room

1586
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,769
a couple of days after Emily disappeared.

1587
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,199
It's the button that was torn from her

1588
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,559
shirt the night that she died.

1589
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,529
I know what it is.

1590
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,363
It means...

1591
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:06,469
I know what it means.

1592
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,589
Oh my God!

1593
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:10,539
I took it to Rodlauer but
he wouldn't even talk to me.

1594
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,079
I thought maybe that
if you took it to him,

1595
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,329
he might talk to you.

1596
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,513
If he did it would be the first time.

1597
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,540
Nicole I don't know.

1598
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:18,989
They've already arrested someone.

1599
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,709
They've announced it to the press.

1600
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,769
I mean the last thing in the
world the police want to hear

1601
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,479
is contradictory evidence.

1602
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,623
If we just had something else to go on.

1603
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:33,995
(tense music)

1604
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,552
The door to the bathroom wouldn't close.

1605
01:20:37,553 --> 01:20:38,669
What?

1606
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,219
It wouldn't close
right, like it had been

1607
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,019
broken or something.

1608
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,319
Maybe there's something else there.

1609
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,429
Greg's going out of town this weekend.

1610
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,039
I could go there and I could look around.

1611
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,020
I could go there tonight.

1612
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:49,303
No, tomorrow.

1613
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:52,319
I have to work late tonight.

1614
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,143
We'll go there tomorrow together.

1615
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,000
Listen to me, Nicole.

1616
01:20:57,001 --> 01:20:58,639
There's nothing out there that can't wait

1617
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,790
until tomorrow morning.

1618
01:21:02,728 --> 01:21:05,228
(tense music)

1619
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:09,029
I'll be at work 'til midnight
but I'll be home after that,

1620
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,354
so if you need anything call me.

1621
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:12,188
Okay.

1622
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,600
(tense music)

1623
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,525
[Man On TV] Can you tell
me your friend's name?

1624
01:21:23,526 --> 01:21:24,808
Take your time.

1625
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:26,809
[Woman On TV] Uh, it...

1626
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,650
(tense music)

1627
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:56,543
Hey, Nic.

1628
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:01,610
(tense music)

1629
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,734
Decided not to go down
with my parents tonight.

1630
01:23:06,735 --> 01:23:07,869
I can go tomorrow.

1631
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,789
Hey, you know maybe you could come with

1632
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,890
if you're not doing anything this weekend.

1633
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,839
There is, there is so
much I have to tell you.

1634
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,269
It has been so hard
keeping all of this secret.

1635
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,170
I have done some horrible things, Nic.

1636
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:27,340
Really, just

1637
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,089
horrible things.

1638
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:30,923
I know.

1639
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,259
I want to talk about it.

1640
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,893
I want to tell you everything.

1641
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,373
I really do love you, you know that?

1642
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,680
And when you love someone,

1643
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:48,739
I mean really, really love someone,

1644
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,290
gotta know you can trust them.

1645
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:56,297
I mean, really trust them, no matter what.

1646
01:23:59,477 --> 01:24:01,027
Can I trust you that much, hon?

1647
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,423
Do you love me

1648
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,859
that much?

1649
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,810
What do you mean?

1650
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,807
We're about to go off to
college together, right?

1651
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:13,963
We can get married soon.

1652
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,760
We can share this secret

1653
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,369
for the rest of our lives

1654
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:20,429
and no one listens to anything

1655
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,263
Tina DeCapprio says, anyway...

1656
01:24:21,263 --> 01:24:22,096
Greg, no!

1657
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,680
You can't just send an
innocent person to jail.

1658
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,890
You're gonna have to tell the police,

1659
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,063
or I will.

1660
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:36,409
There's no way out of this.

1661
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,870
You have to turn yourself in.

1662
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:39,288
Turn myself in?

1663
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,493
Turn myself in?

1664
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,513
I'll cover my tracks.

1665
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:51,473
Those seem to be the only
choices I have left here.

1666
01:24:52,392 --> 01:24:53,330
What is that supposed to mean?

1667
01:24:53,331 --> 01:24:55,319
Cover your tracks?

1668
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,153
Look, Nic,

1669
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,939
sometimes people just
have to die, you know?

1670
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,409
I mean, it's, it may be ugly.

1671
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,009
It's, it's brutal but
that's just the way the

1672
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,399
world works you know?

1673
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,919
I mean Emily wasn't a bad person,

1674
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,973
and I am really, really sorry
about what happened to her.

1675
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,788
Just, why don't you sit down?

1676
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:13,622
I don't wanna sit down.

1677
01:25:13,622 --> 01:25:14,455
(mumbling) sit.

1678
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:16,959
Just sit down, okay, please, sit down.

1679
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,599
What are you gonna do?

1680
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,823
You gonna kill me too?

1681
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,270
You think that's gonna
solve your problems?

1682
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:28,609
Well, it doesn't matter now
because now there's evidence.

1683
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:31,210
There's hard evidence
that you killed Emily.

1684
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:32,839
(tense music)

1685
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,463
Police are gonna have it
tomorrow with or without me.

1686
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:38,711
You mean this, Nic?

1687
01:25:38,712 --> 01:25:41,212
(tense music)

1688
01:25:49,614 --> 01:25:52,197
Why don't you have a drink Nic?

1689
01:25:54,205 --> 01:25:56,038
Could be a long night.

1690
01:26:09,892 --> 01:26:12,725
(thunder booming)

1691
01:26:33,469 --> 01:26:35,636
You can't do this, Greg.

1692
01:26:37,077 --> 01:26:38,579
You think you can, but you can't.

1693
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,919
Shut up, Nic.

1694
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,559
Greg, this is me.

1695
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,393
You love me.

1696
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:43,759
You can't kill somebody that you love.

1697
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,939
You're not a monster.

1698
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:45,773
Wait a minute.

1699
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,629
It was an accident right?

1700
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:51,959
Well, the police will understand that.

1701
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:52,840
You didn't mean to do it.

1702
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:54,890
You just you just
brought her up here to...

1703
01:26:58,059 --> 01:27:00,473
Oh, God, please tell
me it was an accident.

Greg Dunleavy, having pleaded guilty to

1740
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,979
the killing of Emily DeCapprio,

1741
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,759
you've been convicted by this court

1742
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,379
on one count of murder
in the first degree.

1743
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:24,309
You have been sentenced to
a term of life in prison,

1744
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:27,289
a sentence you will begin
serving immediately.

1745
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:32,110
Before concluding today, you
are required by state law

1746
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,370
to now face the survivors of your crime

1747
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,277
and to make a statement.

1748
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,393
I'm sorry.

1749
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,283
I did a horrible thing.

1750
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:03,203
I killed an innocent girl
who didn't deserve to die.

1751
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:08,773
I have lied and hurt
the people who love me.

1752
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,080
I didn't know

1753
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:16,023
what to do.

1754
01:30:19,178 --> 01:30:20,011
I didn't,

1755
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,409
I didn't know who to

1756
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,323
talk to,

1757
01:30:26,138 --> 01:30:27,033
or to turn to.

1758
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,290
I wanted to protect

1759
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,673

01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,097
I did a horrible thing.

1763
01:30:53,372 --> 01:30:57,922
I'm sorry.

1764
01:30:57,923 --> 01:30:58,756
I'm sorry.

Yeah.

1769
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,030
I want you to meet my mother.

1770
01:31:31,031 --> 01:31:32,497
I'd love to.

1771
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:33,331
Be back.

1772
01:31:38,135 --> 01:31:40,490
Mom, this is Tina.

1773
01:31:40,491 --> 01:31:41,553
Hello, Tina.

1774
01:31:41,554 --> 01:31:42,578
It's so nice to meet you.

1775
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,856
It is very nice to meet you, too.

1776
01:31:44,857 --> 01:31:46,447
You have quite a daughter.

1777
01:31:46,448 --> 01:31:47,281
I do.

1778
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:49,586
Well, you ready for this?

1779
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,503
