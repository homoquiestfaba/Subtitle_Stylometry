1
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,752
Do I look okay?

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,495
You look nice.

3
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,729
Really? You really think so?

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,377
Is the state prepared
to make an opening statement?

5
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,253
We are, Your Honor.

6
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,824
Susan Lucille Wright stabbed
and mutilated her husband, Jeffrey Wright.

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,853
Theirs was not a perfect marriage,
as the evidence will show you,

8
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,931
but whose is?

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,891
You will hear evidence
that will help you understand

10
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:15,532
why Susan Wright made the decision
to murder rather than divorce.

11
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,077
You're never gonna understand it all.

12
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,438
Because you're never gonna understand her.

13
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,516
How could you?

14
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,944
She's a monster.

15
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,088
Suse, pretty, ain't they?

16
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,390
Shut up, Jess.

17
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,532
Come on, Suse, man up.

18
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,195
Let's go watch.

19
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,271
Yeah.

20
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,437
Yeah, no more of this "shy little sister" stuff.

21
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,270
You are hot, act like it.

22
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,704
Grab a wine cooler, ladies, we're going in.

23
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,937
Oh, yeah.

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,087
So cute.

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,625
Little help?

26
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,027
Go get him.

27
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,024
Hi.

28
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,395
I'm Jeffrey Wright.

29
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,596
I'm Susan Wyche.

30
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,105
Wanna play?

31
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,400
Go, go, go.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,739
Come on, you can't sit on the sidelines
being pretty your whole life.

33
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,312
Sometimes you gotta get in the game.

34
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,402
Here we go.

35
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,538
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,910
Jeffrey Wright?
You literally just met Mr. Right.

37
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,176
Go!

38
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,654
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,285
Yeah, we're gonna watch that.

40
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,450
Nice.

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,834
All right, it's your serve, pretty lady.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,036
Okay.

43
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,239
So, relax.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,565
Let the ball settle in this hand.

45
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,070
The left hand is your constant.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,304
Right hand, swing it through.

47
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,314
Gotta love a girl
who brings her own cheerleaders.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,312
So hold the ball still,

49
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,312
breathe...

50
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,055
-Swing away, pretty lady.
-Okay.

51
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,792
Okay, wow.

52
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,068
I get it. That whole sweet, innocent thing
was just an act.

53
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,739
I don't even know how I did that, I swear.

54
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,040
Well, whatever you did, keep it up.

55
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,305
You just might be my lucky charm, darling.

56
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,417
So you moved to Houston for...

57
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,412
I was studying to be a nurse.

58
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,316
I'm saving to go back.

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,385
Nurse, huh? Damn, you are a good girl.

60
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,251
I'm not that good.

61
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:25,555
Okay, you just go ahead and shock me
with stories of your sordid past.

62
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,428
Well, after I graduated high school
and I moved to Houston,

63
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,597
I had to make some money, so...

64
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,801
I was an exotic dancer at the Gold Cup.

65
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm sorry?

66
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,277
You're the church leader by day,
stripper by night?

67
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,184
It was only for two months.

68
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,314
All right.

69
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,114
So when you did that dancing

70
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,124
for that short period oftime
that you told us all you didn't like,

71
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,528
you will agree with me that
the way you make money doing that

72
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,796
is to seductively, provocatively,
with no clothes on at all,

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,264
Iet strange men come up to you,

74
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,931
and pretend to those men that
you liked them.

75
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,638
It's what being a dancer's all about, isn't it?

76
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,402
Actually, no.

77
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,110
I enforced the two-foot rule.

78
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,248
And I just didn't like people touching me.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,183
I mean, I'm sure that's the case with others,
but that wasn't the case with me.

80
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,885
So you were the most
prim and proper dancer

81
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,863
to ever hit the history of the Gold Cup?

82
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,589
-You should...
-Yeah, I think l...

83
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,886
I probably have one.

84
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,686
No, I meant you should take me home.

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,656
What'd I do? Why?

86
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,600
Nothing, it's just...

87
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,933
We don't have to do everything in one night,
and I really like you.

88
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,837
I like you, too.

89
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,637
I don't mean to rush you, it's just...

90
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,647
Do you sleep with all the girls
that you take out on first dates?

91
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,546
Well, yeah.

92
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,977
I'm kidding. No. I'm sorry.

93
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,056
It's just, you're a very sexy woman.

94
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,892
And you,

95
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,628
are a very sexy man.

96
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,868
Which is precisely why we have to stop.

97
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,296
Even that is sexy.

98
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,368
I swear, pretty lady,
you are gonna be the death of me.

99
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,041
So did you and Jeff go on a date after that?

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,105
Yes.

101
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,182
Where did you go?

102
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,745
We went to a crawfish festival
in Old Town Springs.

103
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:01,877
Did you have fun?

104
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,689
-Yes.
-So,

105
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,685
did you and Jeff go on a third date
after that?

106
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,091
Yes, it was my 21st birthday.

107
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,319
Where did y'all go for your 21st birthday?

108
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,492
We went to a bar called Lola's.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,266
I remember it because Jeff told me
that he loved me

110
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,331
and I told him that
we barely knew each other.

111
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,874
But it is correct to say that

112
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,910
you were interested in getting to
know him better.

113
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,902
-Right?
-Yes.

114
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,349
He was sweet.

115
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,844
-Hey, I think that's gonna be the one.
-Okay.

116
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,010
Yeah, let me just make sure
there's no one coming...

117
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,281
Let's go, ladies, back to work.

118
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,516
All right, we've gotta get back to work.

119
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,321
So wait, he told you he loves you,
and he hasn't even slept with you yet?

120
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,790
Well, he's really sweet like that.
He's letting me take my time.

121
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,397
He makes me feel like a princess,
like nothing could ever hurt me.

122
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,397
I just feel so good, Jess, like,

123
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,433
I don't know, maybe he really is Mr. Right.

124
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,508
Look at you, little sister.

125
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,984
Dude, so you've been out with this girl
like, five times,

126
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,652
and you still haven't slept with her?

127
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,026
What, are you saving yourself for marriage?

128
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,098
Yeah, maybe.

129
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,230
What, are you saying
you're gonna marry this girl?

130
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,428
I'm saying that she's cool.

131
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,138
And hot.

132
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,773
And I'm almost 30.

133
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,637
My parents got married
when they were teenagers.

134
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,539
And they've been together almost 40 years.

135
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,908
Hate to be the one to break this to you, man,

136
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,271
but you're not your parents.

137
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,474
I would just like to point out that
we're having this conversation

138
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,415
with half-naked girls grinding in our laps.

139
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,882
Yeah, I had noticed that.

140
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,420
Hey, Suse, it's Jeff.

141
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,693
I don't know
if you have plans tomorrow night,

142
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,699
or if you're working,

143
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,101
I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over

144
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,066
and, I don't know, I thought
we could just have some dinner

145
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,674
and have a quiet night.

146
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,358
Wow.

147
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,059
Thanks.

148
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,190
Please, come in.

149
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,931
Did you have any trouble finding the place?

150
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,869
You did all this for me?

151
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,439
I ordered the food,
but I didn't pick out the flowers.

152
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,709
And the candles?

153
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,578
And you bought a new shirt?

154
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,643
How did you know I got a new shirt?

155
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,717
This is the sweetest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

156
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,625
Buy a shirt and light some candles?

157
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,491
No, I mean, you thought about me.

158
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,665
Thought about what I'd like.

159
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,628
I can't stop thinking about you.

160
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,908
I hope whatever you got for dinner
will still be good cold.

161
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,551
Well that was...

162
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,823
That was...

163
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,351
It was okay.

164
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,856
I mean...

165
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,254
I love you.

166
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,396
It's okay to say it during sex.

167
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,434
Yeah, but that was...

168
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,772
...after sex.

169
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,471
I love you, too.

170
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,456
You mind if...

171
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,292
No, I don't mind.

172
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,337
You sure? 'Cause I don't have to.

173
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,097
No, not at all.

174
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,739
All right, cool.

175
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,011
So let's move forward a little bit.

176
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,012
Later on, in August into September,
what happened to you?

177
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,980
-I became pregnant.
-By who?

178
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,318
-By Jeff.
-Were you on birth control pills?

179
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,919
At this time, yes, I was.

180
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,890
But they didn't work?

181
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,456
No, they did not.

182
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,131
You trap Jeff at all
into getting pregnant with you?

183
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,402
No, I did not.

184
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,928
So you're pregnant now.

185
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,198
I didn't do it on purpose.

186
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,443
I swear.

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,869
Are you mad?

188
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:33,879
No, I'm not mad.

189
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,979
You haven't even looked at me.

190
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,655
We don't have to have the baby if you don't...

191
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,751
I want whatever you want.

192
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,024
I just need, I need some time.

193
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,234
We don't have to do anything
right away, right?

194
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,704
We can wait?

195
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,011
Yeah.

196
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,708
Suse, I do...

197
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,945
I love you.

198
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,093
-You do?
-Yeah.

199
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,624
And I want you, I want kids. I just...

200
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,490
This is a little faster than I expected.

201
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,394
You can take all the time you need.

202
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,596
It's okay. We can wait.

203
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,218
-What are you doing?
-Listen.

204
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,453
We can do this.

205
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,350
We love each other. Nothing else matters.

206
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,390
-Jeffrey...
-Let me do this right.

207
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,518
Susan Wyche, will you marry me?

208
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,893
I'll get a ring and we'll do it perfect.
But for now...

209
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,330
Yes. Yes, I'll marry you.

210
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,386
How you holding up there, son?

211
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,256
I'm good, Pop.

212
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,491
Your mom and I are real proud of you.

213
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,865
The man you're becoming,
you did the right thing.

214
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,004
Thanks.

215
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,398
I hope me and Suse
will be just like you guys.

216
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,975
Well, that's a tall order.

217
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,576
But you just take care ofyour family, right?

218
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,776
A man takes care of his family.

219
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,055
You look absolutely magical.

220
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,256
She looks all right.

221
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,286
I just want him to think
that I'm the prettiest girl that he's ever seen.

222
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,054
You're the prettiest girl in the world.

223
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,152
Thanks, Mom.

224
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,257
Trust me, Suse, the way he looks at you,

225
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,802
you could be in a sack
and he'd still think that.

226
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,435
We are so excited to have you
be a part of our family.

227
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,804
Louis and I were saying just the other night
how changed Jeffrey is.

228
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,040
For the better, I mean.

229
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,511
You're so good for him.

230
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,142
Thanks, Mrs. Wright.

231
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,849
You don't happen to have
any other sons, do you?

232
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,178
They are good for each other.

233
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,950
You're going to make a great team.

234
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,481
I love you, Mom.

235
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,391
And that is one lucky baby.

236
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,557
-Ladies, let's have a toast.
-Yes.

237
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,998
Here's to the Wright family.
May they live a long and happy life together.

238
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,198
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

239
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,010
The future's bright!

240
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,780
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

241
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,524
Hi. Hi, guys.

242
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,737
Hey. Thank you. Hi.

243
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,809
Hi. Hi.

244
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,574
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'd like to borrow my wife for a second.

245
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,051
I just couldn't stay away from you.

246
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,463
-I love you, Mr. Wright.
-I love you, Mrs. Wright.

247
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,930
We'll be the happiest couple ever.
I just know it.

248
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,038
What did you do with this knife?

249
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,237
I stabbed him in the neck.

250
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,680
You stabbed him in the neck the first time?

251
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,846
Yes.

252
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,431
Based on what you saw,
what you observed with your own eyes,

253
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,797
what did you see of the relationship
between Jeff and his wife, the defendant?

254
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,698
Susan was quiet.

255
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,471
I wouldn't necessarily say a shy person,
but she...

256
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:37,280
I dunno, to coin a phrase,
Leave It to Beaverfamily.

257
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,649
That's kind of what I saw.

258
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,509
He's amazing.

259
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,218
So are you.

260
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,775
You're home.

261
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,546
Let me see.

262
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,549
He's beautiful.

263
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,387
-What's his name?
-Andrew.

264
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,527
Andrew Wright.

265
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,429
You are a lucky little boy, Andrew Wright.

266
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,162
Congratulations, you two.

267
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,136
If you need anything,
I'm right across the street. Just holler.

268
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,666
-Thanks, Allie.
-We'll see you guys later.

269
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,374
Tell Bobby
maybe we'll watch the game on Saturday.

270
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,844
He can't. Little League. You know
that's gonna be your life, too, soon.

271
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,279
No more hanging out with the buddies
on the weekends.

272
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,279
Let's show the little man his castle.

273
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,468
We did good, huh?

274
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:08,873
We did great.

275
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,667
Wanna practice making another one?

276
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,916
The doctor said four months.

277
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,212
Four months?

278
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,189
I don't think
I can stay away from you that long.

279
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,716
It'll go by in a flash.

280
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,090
We have our whole lives together.

281
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,789
There's plenty of time.

282
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,595
I'm gonna go work in the yard.

283
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,396
Get rid of some of this pent-up energy.

284
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,540
Okay.

285
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,175
I'll be down in a minute.

286
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,155
Jeff, lemonade?

287
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,970
Thank you.

288
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,766
Next I'm gonna rip up the patio
and put a fountain over there.

289
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,174
I thought the girl
was supposed to do the nesting.

290
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,176
I'm building us a home, pretty lady.

291
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,282
I'm gonna be so good to you.

292
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,475
I'm gonna work so hard.

293
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,248
I'm gonna be so good to the two of you.

294
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,285
So do you recall at some point
your son not being

295
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,262
particularly excited about getting married
to Susan?

296
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,832
Jeff spoke with me about the fact that
Susan had gotten pregnant on purpose.

297
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,497
And that she had told him
she was on birth control pills.

298
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,235
And asked for some fatherly advice.

299
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,013
We'll pass the witness.

300
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,413
What was that fatherly advice, Mr. Wright?

301
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,783
That the child needed a father.

302
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,626
He wants to own his own business.

303
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,892
So, it's long days.

304
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,527
I want him to be successful.

305
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,965
You guys are so great together.

306
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,238
Yeah, it's not easy, but we love each other.

307
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,080
Don't forget about the potluck
tonight at my house.

308
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,910
Are you making your apple pie?

309
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,509
I will, if Tim makes those potatoes
that Jeff likes so much.

310
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,054
You're on.

311
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,991
Relax, Jeff,
we're having a couple beers at lunch.

312
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,851
Sorry, you know I appreciate this, I just...

313
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,793
I probably should get back to work.

314
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,660
Yeah, no, no, we shouldn't celebrate.

315
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,126
Sorry, what would we celebrate?

316
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,828
Baines is real happy.

317
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,440
Corporate just told me
you got the promotion.

318
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,508
I got the promotion?

319
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,037
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

320
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,270
Thank you so much!

321
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,406
Hey, okay, buddy, you're hugging me.
You're hugging me.

322
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,482
Yeah, sorry.

323
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,312
Hope you don't have dinner plans.

324
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,918
I know, yeah.

325
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,677
Thanks for bringing everything.

326
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,455
We're gonna get some food.

327
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,394
Yeah.

328
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,261
Wait, let me help you with the Boy Wonder.

329
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,493
-Thank you.
-Come here, Boy Wonder.

330
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,169
Hey, where is your man, by the way?

331
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:29,365
He better hurry up
or he's gonna miss out on Tim's potatoes.

332
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,441
I know.

333
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,506
He should be here soon.
He's probably just got stuck with a client.

334
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,679
Speak of the devil.

335
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,753
Hey, babe, where are you?

336
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,987
Babe, I got the promotion.

337
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,586
You know we have people over here tonight.

338
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,681
What? I can't...

339
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,594
Crap, the potluck thing.

340
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,223
Babe, I'm so sorry.

341
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,632
Where are you?

342
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,163
I'm just at a...

343
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,970
...a bar.

344
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,898
Okay, when will you be home?

345
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm probably gonna be late.

346
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,743
Just tell everybody hi,
and that I'm sorry, okay?

347
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,139
Okay, I'll see you when you get here.

348
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,016
Okay, hi.

349
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,185
Thank you, sir.

350
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:22,882
Mr. Wright!

351
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,427
Doesn't this beat going home?

352
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,496
How can it...

353
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,315
You missed a great party.

354
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,644
Yeah.

355
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,287
When did everybody leave?

356
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,485
About an hour ago.

357
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,957
Andrew fell asleep
as soon as the house was quiet.

358
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,734
So what bar did you guys go to?

359
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,498
Can we not do this?

360
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,664
Do what, Jeff?

361
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,766
Just asking my husband where he's been.

362
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,105
I was at a bar.

363
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,712
With clients. It went late.

364
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,272
I missed the potluck. I'm sorry, all right.
I am not the perfect husband.

365
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,083
-Nobody ever said anything.
-But I'm trying though.

366
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,414
Okay, I really am.

367
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,922
Please don't raise your voice okay?
I don't want you to wake Andrew.

368
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,886
Always that.

369
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,222
"Don't wake the baby.
The doctor said we should wait.

370
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,820
"I'm really tired.
I'm sorry the house is a mess, but..."

371
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,230
God, what the hell
is happening to us, Susan?

372
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,063
I'm really trying,
but you're always out with your clients.

373
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,295
Yeah, I'm always out.

374
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,599
Because what the hell
do I have to come home to?

375
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,671
This? You?

376
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,867
I'm working my ass off for this family,

377
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,274
trying to be a good husband
and a good father.

378
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,142
What the hell more do you want from me?

379
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,114
-I just want you here.
-Now I'm right fricking here.

380
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,117
I'm sorry, baby.

381
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,550
I'm really sorry. I...

382
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,029
Look, you just got to give me some...

383
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,663
Maybe I'm not good at this.

384
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,669
Okay, maybe I'm just not cut out.

385
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,402
No. Yeah, you're amazing, okay?

386
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,770
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,510
God, you've been working really hard
and I'm sorry, you know, that...

388
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,644
I know that I can be distant.

389
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,985
And tired. But I'll be better.

390
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,217
Okay?

391
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,619
I love you and I know
we can get back to us, okay?

392
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,287
I know. I just know it.

393
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,362
Yeah, we can get through this, pretty lady.

394
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,835
It's just a little bump on a long road.

395
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,036
-That's all.
-I know.

396
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,407
I'm pregnant again.

397
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:15,298
December 1st,
your son Cody was born, correct?

398
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,234
Yes.

399
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,266
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, hey, hey.

400
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,675
Sorry.

401
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,608
Didn't mean to wake you,
go back to sleep, okay?

402
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,652
Night, sport.

403
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,355
Did the sex continue
after the birth of your child?

404
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,135
Yes, it did.

405
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,131
Was it forced or unforced?

406
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,608
Both.

407
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,851
Now, when Jeff forced you to have sex.

408
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,952
What'd you do?

409
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,427
-I'm tired.
-I'm not.

410
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,695
I can still smell the booze on you.

411
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,262
You don't want to wake the kids.

412
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,568
I would just lay there.

413
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,513
And close my eyes.

414
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,810
And pretend that I was somewhere else.

415
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,618
-Yeah, definitely...
-Dad, look what Rippy can do.

416
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,557
Hey, yeah.
Okay, just one second, buddy, okay?

417
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,787
Yeah, thank you. Okay?

418
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,056
Give Daddy a minute to finish his call.

419
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,424
Kaboom!

420
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,330
You guys should try some of this,
there's black beans in it.

421
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,235
-Just like Louis likes.
-Grandpa.

422
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,501
When did you become
such a Susie homemaker?

423
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,576
I'm trying.

424
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,042
Jeff, come here, it's family time.

425
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,409
It's okay, a man's got to do his job.

426
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,448
Mom, I taught Rippy a trick.

427
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,743
You did?

428
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,851
Sit.

429
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,381
-Whoa.
-Well done.

430
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,319
Thank you. Thank you so much.

431
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,515
Did you show your daddy?

432
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,286
Well, I know that some of us
wanted me off the phone,

433
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,191
but that call might have just
landed me an account

434
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,764
that will make me regional manager
by the end of the year.

435
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,926
-Wow, congratulations.
-Congratulations, Jeff.

436
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,696
Oh, my gosh. Jeff, that's great.

437
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,696
You know, as long as
we're sharing big news.

438
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,469
I've decided to go back to school.

439
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,067
-What?
-You are? Wonderful.

440
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,444
Yeah, when Jeffrey and I first met,
I told him that I wanted to be a nurse.

441
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,216
So I signed up at the junior college,

442
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,786
and I'm going back
and I'm going to get certified.

443
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,651
And it's night classes,

444
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,350
so I can still take care of the kids
during the day and then

445
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,427
at night, we can trade off.

446
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,861
Yeah, this is a picture.

447
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,962
Come on, you guys. Go, right here.

448
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,466
-Go, go, go, one. Love it!
-Get Rippy in. Good one.

449
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,337
You wait until the whole family's here
to bring that up?

450
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,335
Is that so I can't say anything?

451
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,770
I just thought the kids
are going to be in school, so...

452
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,676
You think we have a money
tree growing in the back yard?

453
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,646
-You just got a promotion.
-I didn't get it yet.

454
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,313
I'm going to be working.

455
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,945
I got to work some nights.
I can't be rushing home at 6:00

456
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,490
so you can go out and learn
how to clean bedpans.

457
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,386
Working at night?

458
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,627
Is that what you're doing?

459
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,294
I'm busting my ass for this family.

460
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,597
You are not going back to school.

461
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,397
You are going to take care
of your damn house,

462
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,803
you are going to take care of your kids,
and you are going to take care of me.

463
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,810
Mom?

464
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,311
We're just talking, sweetie. Ready to go?

465
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,423
In November, you discovered these
underneath your bed, correct?

466
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,993
-Yes, I did.
-Did you put them there?

467
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,289
No, I did not.

468
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,467
-Did Jeff put them there?
-Yes, he did.

469
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,971
Did he tell you why
he put these underneath your bed?

470
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,435
He kept them under the bed on his side.

471
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:24,340
And he told me that he could

472
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,450
bash my head in within minutes.

473
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:40,357
You testified that during these beatings,
he kicked you as hard as he could,

474
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,093
and he would hit you as hard as he could.

475
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,198
-Yes.
-And he smashed your head against the wall.

476
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,703
-Dashboards, yes.
-Dashboards.

477
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,535
Car windows, floors, all these things.

478
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,969
-Yes.
-You never suffered a broken bone,

479
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,838
and you never went to a doctor?

480
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,938
-I wasn't allowed...
-And you never went to a doctor?

481
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,013
No, I did not.

482
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,691
Is Daddy coming with us?

483
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,885
No, Daddy had to work.

484
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,825
But he might meet up with us later.

485
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,359
She's killing me, man.

486
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,992
My mom and dad made it look so easy, but...

487
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,230
Between the kids and the bills and all that...

488
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,371
Jeff, look. First of all,
you're completely bringing me down.

489
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,067
This is supposed to be
the fun part of the day.

490
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,375
Second of all,
every marriage goes through rough patches.

491
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:31,940
Just work it out.

492
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,513
That's what couples do.

493
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,052
-How you doing?
-Hey.

494
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,965
Susan?

495
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,361
Hey, honey, you home?

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,628
He was just upset.

497
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,029
Do you hear yourself?

498
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,228
Susan, he hit you.

499
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,406
What would you do if Dad grabbed you?

500
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,273
Would you leave him?

501
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,410
-Kids are asleep.
-Thanks.

502
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,911
Did you guys decide what's next?

503
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,011
-I told her she could move in here.
-I'm not leaving him.

504
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,987
-Suse...
-He's my husband.

505
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,887
Well, yeah, but he hit...

506
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,887
I'll get it. You stay here.

507
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,163
-Jeff?
-Jess, where is my wife?

508
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,734
She doesn't want to talk to you.

509
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,435
How did you know that I'd be here?

510
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,577
'Cause I know you, darling.

511
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,778
Where else you gonna go?

512
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,513
What do you want, Jeff?

513
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,915
I want my wife back.

514
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,685
I want my kids in their beds
where they belong.

515
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,085
Just get out of here
or I'm going to call the police.

516
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,749
Suse, I made a mistake, okay?

517
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,853
I'm sorry, and I'll make it right.

518
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,928
Just like it was in the beginning.

519
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,095
You remember what it was like
in the beginning, right?

520
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,730
Please give me a second chance.

521
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,997
This is crazy.

522
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,333
Please come home.

523
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:41,578
I love you.

524
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,497
Susan.

525
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,702
Don't ever do that again.

526
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,799
We're a family.

527
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,298
You understand?

528
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,042
You will never take my children
away from me again.

529
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,045
We are a family.

530
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,919
Do you understand?

531
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,559
Let's talk about the relationship
with Jeff and Susan.

532
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,333
How would you describe that relationship?

533
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,257
Controlling.

534
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,671
What do you mean by controlling?

535
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,104
Jeffwas very controlling towards Susan.

536
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,936
It was not a loving relationship.

537
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,375
Oh, please don't make a mess, sweetie.

538
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,507
Gosh, Jeff's been working so hard.

539
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,012
And Andrew's having
so much fun at preschool.

540
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,677
And Cody, we're having fun
at Mommy & Me, aren't we?

541
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,285
So everything's great. We're great.

542
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,957
Did you get a new haircut?

543
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,553
No, I just spent a little extra time on it.

544
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,465
Cody!

545
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,167
What did I just tell you?

546
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,127
I said, "Do not make a mess."

547
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,570
Did you ever see...

548
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,700
When you visited,
when you went to their house.

549
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,606
Was it clean, or was it dirty?

550
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,907
It was immaculate.

551
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,579
Now, would you describe
Jeff and Susan's relationship

552
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,049
as one of equal footing?

553
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,086
No, no.

554
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,055
So it was more like
a master-slave relationship.

555
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,384
Definitely.

556
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,121
Who was the master?

557
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,661
Jeff.

558
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,924
-So you got a new promotion.
-Did you want it, Jeff?

559
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,459
-To you.
-Wanna celebrate?

560
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,667
-Oh, hell yes. Yeah, yeah.
-Give me that.

561
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,565
And who was the slave?

562
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,499
Susan.

563
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,650
Okay, you know what?
Let's not play with those.

564
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,456
Let's put them back in the cart.

565
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:27,871
Hey, Susan.

566
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,539
Allie, hi.

567
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,942
When did you become such a runner?

568
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,740
I just started.
I'm trying to get back into shape.

569
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,780
Honey, have you seen yourself?
'Cause you're gorgeous.

570
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,679
Well, Jeff's always at the gym
and whatnot, so...

571
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,922
You know, I figure
he's working so hard, I should too.

572
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,856
You look amazing. But if you ever
want to run, give me a call, it'll be fun.

573
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,392
-All right. Bye.
-Bye, Cody.

574
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,205
Hi, honey. Nice to see you.

575
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,537
How was your day?

576
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,706
Sorry.

577
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,410
I was just trying to figure this out.

578
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,217
There's a bunch of unpaid bills?

579
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,853
I was just trying to make sense of it all.

580
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,522
-You know, the life insurance was...
-What are you trying to say?

581
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,432
I was just worried.

582
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,228
It'll be okay.

583
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,669
So it's late, huh?

584
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,176
Yeah. It's late.

585
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,771
I had to work.

586
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,285
Yeah.

587
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,322
What, do you wanna...
You wanna say something to me?

588
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:54,958
No.

589
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,228
Are you sure?

590
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,124
-Jeff, you're drunk.
-I'm a good father.

591
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,893
I provide for you, don't l?

592
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,826
Yes.

593
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,970
Go ahead.

594
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,646
Go to bed, I don't want to
sleep with you anyway.

595
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,255
Let's take a five or 10 minute recess.

596
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,593
All right. Approach.

597
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,060
Judge, I request that you
instruct the defendant.

598
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,867
I didn't do this in front of the jury,
now the jury has left the courtroom.

599
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,566
To compose herselfwith crying.

600
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,870
She can compose herself.

601
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:50,504
Because the minute the jury leaves the room,
every time, she stops crying.

602
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:54,277
She is the only woman I've ever seen
who can cry without ruining her mascara.

603
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,545
That is cheap.

604
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,246
Of course the defendant cries
when gruesome photos are shown.

605
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,417
Ms. Wright?

606
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,587
Please be aware that you should
try to control yourself

607
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,888
as best as you possibly can.

608
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,929
Frankly, I think you've done
a pretty good job.

609
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,601
Excuse me.

610
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,345
Someone's having a party.

611
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,952
I want it to be a special night.

612
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,700
Sorry, your card's been declined.

613
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,365
No. No, no, no.

614
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,467
Geez, I want it to be special.

615
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,309
I have cash. I have cash. I have...

616
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,372
I have $60. Is that enough?

617
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,282
I can take some stuff out. I don't need this.

618
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,351
Don't need this, I don't need this.

619
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,682
I don't need this. I don't need...

620
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,892
Is that enough? I can take out more.

621
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,106
How come I'm not going to
eat dinner with you guys?

622
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,285
Mommy and Daddy are having date night.

623
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,142
Okay.

624
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,004
-Did I forget something?
-Daddy!

625
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,203
Mommy do fancy dinner.

626
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,972
She's all dressed up and everything.

627
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,711
Come on sissy, show me what you got.
Come on.

628
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,684
-Come on.
-I don't want to fight.

629
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,878
We got to toughen you up.

630
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,423
You can't survive out there
unless you're tough. Come on, bud.

631
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,991
-I don't think he wants to fight.
-Stop, Dad.

632
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,218
Really? Well, he's gonna.
Boy's got to learn to fight a little.

633
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,562
Oh, my God, Jeff!

634
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,030
Are you okay? Let me see, let me see.

635
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,427
-Oh, my God.
-He leaned into it, it was a tap.

636
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,731
Go to your room, all right.
Mommy's going to bring you some ice.

637
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,473
I'll bring you some ice. I'll meet you in there.

638
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,132
-Okay?
-Come on, nothing happened.

639
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,812
What? I barely touched him.

640
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,306
What the hell is wrong with you?

641
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,080
-With me?
-Do you see what I did for you?

642
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,848
I have been trying so hard
to be good for you.

643
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,353
-I made this beautiful dinner.
-You made a fricking chicken.

644
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,224
You think that fixes things?

645
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,161
And then you tart yourself up.

646
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,688
Why? Think it makes you look sexy?

647
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,160
Honey. You look like a whore.

648
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,208
I already ate.

649
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,174
I'm gonna go to bed.

650
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,946
You, don't bother coming in
unless you want to act like a real wife.

651
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,535
What should have been a love nest.

652
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,996
Turned into a torture chamber.

653
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,974
There's blood everywhere.
Blood was on the ceiling.

654
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,938
There's blood on the TV.
There was blood on the ironing board.

655
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,911
The carpet was soaked in blood.

656
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,949
The bed was covered in blood.

657
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,915
Jeffrey soaked in blood.

658
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,953
And don't you know it,
she was covered in blood too.

659
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,377
Ladies and gentlemen,

660
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:29,444
the anger that lies beneath
this beautiful blonde face

661
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,448
is unfathomable.

662
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,290
Do I look pretty now?

663
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,893
"What a strange illusion it is
to suppose that beauty is goodness."

664
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,260
Tolstoy said that.

665
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,333
To suppose thatjust because
something is beautiful

666
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,094
that that same thing is good.

667
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,771
Kelly and I spoke this morning.

668
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,946
And she graciously informed me

669
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,846
that at 10:00 a.m.
she planned on taking a break

670
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,011
and then bringing the actual bed
into the courtroom.

671
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:41,780
She'll proceed to reenact her theory
of what she thinks the case is.

672
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,218
I, of course, strongly object.

673
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,457
The demonstration
will be permissible, Miss Siegler.

674
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,795
But know that I will
have you on a short leash.

675
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,273
Ben will be the victim in this case.
On the bed.

676
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,782
Object to the term "victim."

677
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:11,011
It's up to the jury to decide
whether JeffWright's a victim in this case.

678
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,236
Ben, are both your wrists tied tightly?

679
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,576
-Yes.
-Try to lift them.

680
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,746
Okay. Now the same with the ankles.

681
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,620
What are you doing?

682
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:55,957
Took my makeup off.

683
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,328
Do I still look like a whore?

684
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,594
Untie me, bitch.

685
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,691
Now!

686
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,334
Is that sexy?

687
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,271
Judge, if I could?

688
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,404
-You may.
-lf the defendant

689
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,712
climbed on top of Jeffrey Wright.

690
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,551
Something like this, and straddled him.

691
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,017
And she is right-handed.

692
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,850
And how do you think she held the knife?

693
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,519
Ifyou don't untie me,
I swear to God, I am gonna...

694
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,086
You can just put it in my hand.

695
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,857
This is total speculation.

696
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,100
I object to the term
"How do you think she held the knife?"

697
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,481
The State calls medical examiner
Dr. Richard Sloak.

698
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,743
What do you see in 271?

699
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,681
That's a tip of a knife embedded in bone.

700
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,366
Leave me alone.

701
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,301
You're saying he was tied up

702
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,370
and she was on top of him.

703
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,734
That she managed to somehow stab him

704
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,438
toward the center of the back
and under the shoulder blade.

705
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,745
I believe it's possible
when you see that injury.

706
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,285
How's that possible if he's tied up?

707
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,721
I think you'd be surprised by his mobility
once you put a knife in his chest.

708
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,489
And what about the rest of his body,

709
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,090
down to the legs, to the knees, to the thighs?

710
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,633
If I wanted to.

711
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,435
Was there any evidence
of a stab to the penis?

712
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,004
No, not to the penis itself.

713
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,139
-Because you saw what?
-lt was nicked.

714
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,710
It was more of a superficial cut
instead of a slice.

715
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,903
A superficial slicing like this.

716
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,017
Oh, come on, Mrs. Wright.

717
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,979
Why did you stab him directly in the eye?

718
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,357
Can you say because
you were that mad at him?

719
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,654
-Can you say it?
-I wasn't that mad at him.

720
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,289
I was afraid.

721
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,292
But you did stop stabbing at some point.

722
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,365
Yes.

723
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,197
What'd you hear that made you stop?

724
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,563
-Andrew was at the door.
-Your son?

725
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,411
One minute.

726
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,483
I heard noises.

727
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,353
It's okay, honey.

728
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,623
Everything's fine.

729
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,527
Come on, let's go back to bed.

730
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,827
Okay, Mommy, goodnight.

731
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,331
Goodnight sweetie.

732
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,696
Where'd you go?

733
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,975
I realized that I left the knife
in the other room.

734
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,338
And I was scared to death, so

735
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,317
I went to the kitchen
and grabbed another knife.

736
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,885
You got another knife?

737
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,416
Now, did you go back in the room?

738
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,650
Yes.

739
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,060
Why?

740
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,756
Because I didn't want to die.

741
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,067
And I was scared, so
I started stabbing him again.

742
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:25,601
And then I thought of
all the times that he hit me.

743
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,971
And all the times that he kicked me.

744
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,239
And all the times that
he told me how horrible I was,

745
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,680
and I just couldn't stop, I couldn't.

746
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,518
Did he die a painful death, Doctor?

747
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,191
Objection. Calls for speculation.

748
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,360
He may offer an opinion if he has one.

749
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:50,561
Again, none of these wounds
would have caused instantaneous death.

750
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,835
And there's no indication that...

751
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,995
That he lost consciousness
immediately from any of them.

752
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,231
So, yes.

753
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,808
Yes, I believe it was a painful death.

754
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,350
It was my sheer will to live.

755
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,451
Say that again.

756
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,547
That was good.

757
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:19,488
It was just your sheer will to live.

758
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,466
Yes, that's exactly what I just said.

759
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,162
After you did stop.

760
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,964
What'd you do then?

761
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,540
I realized that I had to
get him out of the house.

762
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,206
'Cause I was so scared.

763
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,179
And...

764
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,679
So I grabbed him by his ankles
and I tried to drag him off the bed.

765
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,711
So you got him off the bed.

766
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,586
You got him on the floor.

767
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,821
Where'd you drag the body?

768
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,312
So you rolled him into a hole?

769
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,917
I didn't want him to get up
and keep hurting me.

770
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,989
What'd you use to put the dirt on top of him?

771
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,367
There was dirt already there
from when he had dug the fountain.

772
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,232
And I put that on top of him.

773
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,563
I kept thinking that I had to weigh him down

774
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:41,269
so that he wouldn't be able to
get back up and keep hurting me.

775
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,472
After you got him covered up,
what'd you do?

776
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:49,816
I took my shoes off because
I didn't want to get the floor dirty.

777
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,484
It would make Jeff angry
if there was dirt on the floor.

778
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,586
And I went inside and I took a shower.

779
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,059
You washed off the dirt.

780
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,062
You washed off the blood.

781
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,365
What's going through the mind
of Susan Wright at that point?

782
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,297
I'm afraid of Jeff.

783
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:11,005
I'm afraid that he's going to come,
and he's gonna keep trying to kill me.

784
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,372
You have stabbed him 193 times.

785
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,707
You have put him in a hole,
you've weighted him down,

786
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,805
you've covered him with dirt,
but you think he's still alive?

787
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,478
He was still alive.

788
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,185
Still alive.

789
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,881
You made a phone call. Who did you call?

790
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,117
-I called his mother.
-What'd you tell her?

791
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,993
-Hello?
-What is it, Susan?

792
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,397
-ls everything all right?
-Jeff and I had a fight.

793
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,867
And...

794
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,532
He was on drugs.

795
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,868
And he hurt me. And he hit Andrew.

796
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,177
And he took his keys and he left.

797
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,711
What are you talking about?

798
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,817
So you lied to his mother
about the keys and about him leaving?

799
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,452
No, that was real to me.

800
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,954
It was real and he was still alive.

801
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,547
After you hung up

802
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,221
what'd you do with the rest ofyour night?

803
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,097
I waited.

804
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,589
And I watched for Jeff to get back up.

805
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,064
Because I knew that
the second that I went to sleep,

806
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:15,763
he was gonna get up

807
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,141
and he was gonna come inside
and he was gonna try and get me.

808
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:21,904
So I stayed awake.

809
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,292
She was one busy lady

810
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,524
that week of lies and fabrication,

811
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:46,033
trying so hard to pretend
that Jeffrey just walked out on her.

812
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,229
On her and his children.

813
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,563
They say post traumatic stress syndrome.

814
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,442
How about "cover your tail syndrome"?

815
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,944
One more thing. One more thing.

816
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,279
One more thing.

817
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,947
I just got to grab this.

818
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,751
Susan?

819
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:11,190
Hey, Susan!

820
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,523
-Hi.
-Are you redecorating again?

821
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,894
Just, the walls were so drab.
We're starting a new project in the backyard.

822
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,364
Got it.

823
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,599
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

824
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:25,963
-Okay.
-Bye.

825
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,335
See you later. Bye!

826
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,569
Bye.

827
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,839
Let's get another bag.

828
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,809
I'd like to close my account.

829
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:38,947
I'm sorry, it's a joint account,
we'll need the other party's signature.

830
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,523
Well, then I'd like to withdraw some money.

831
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,955
Okay. How much?

832
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,794
All of it.

833
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,956
Where's Daddy?

834
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,826
He had to away for work.

835
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:49,990
Can I call him?

836
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,294
Come on, Andrew, we'll make an early dinner
and we'll watch a movie.

837
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,699
Go ahead in, kids,
you're sleeping at Grandma's.

838
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,770
Susie, there's a pattern now.

839
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,301
He's out of control.

840
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,636
-I don't think it's safe for you or...
-Thanks for watching them.

841
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:06,379
The fog, it just came and went
during that week

842
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,977
after Jeff was cold and dead in the grave
just a few feet from your bed?

843
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,046
I was never fully coherent
about what I was doing.

844
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,460
How'd your big night go?

845
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,396
The flowers and the champagne.

846
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,427
Good, good.

847
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,439
Hello?

848
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,709
Susan?

849
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,619
Hey, I'm looking for Jeff.

850
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,522
-Did I call the house phone by accident?
-He's not here right now.

851
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:28,783
Well, everything okay?

852
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,519
He hasn't called or been in since Monday.

853
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,390
He left.

854
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:36,158
He was drinking and we fought, and...

855
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,262
I think he should be back soon.

856
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,427
You okay?

857
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,726
I'm cleaning right now.

858
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:42,960
He hates it when it's messy.

859
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,164
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

860
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:49,402
Miss Susan, some people say
it's awfully convenient

861
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,571
for you to forget parts of that night.

862
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,940
But you don't remember parts of the week
following the death, do you?

863
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,609
No, I don't.

864
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,210
How is that?

865
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,619
I mean, how is it that you don't remember
every single detail?

866
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:01,690
No!

867
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,386
It's cloudy... It's foggy. It's like...

868
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,094
It's like I was in a day dream.

869
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,398
I can see myself
going through certain motions,

870
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,597
but it's just not all there.

871
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,856
-Hello?
-Hi, Susan, it's Joan.

872
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,763
I was just calling to see
if you'd heard from Jeffrey.

873
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,599
-Yes. He came back.
-He did?

874
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,062
-When?
-He's home?

875
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,039
Is he okay? What did he say?

876
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,044
He screamed at me.

877
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,107
And then he took a bleach
and he threw it all over the carpet.

878
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,980
And then he took some shirts and pants
and he left again.

879
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:07,579
And I have to replace the carpet.

880
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,884
That doesn't really sound like...

881
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,996
Susan, this is Lou. What's going on?

882
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,733
He left.

883
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:19,895
He left.

884
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,165
Crap!

885
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,051
I need protection. I need...

886
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,354
I don't know what's it called.

887
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,931
-A restraining order?
-Yes.

888
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,268
I keep thinking that I'm hearing him at night.

889
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,499
I just... I know that he's gonna come back.

890
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,034
Okay.

891
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,740
Can you give me your full name?

892
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,835
Susan Lucille Wright.

893
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,071
This is Susan.
We're not here to take your call right now,

894
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,341
so leave a message.

895
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,849
This is Susan.
We're not here to take your call right now...

896
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,581
By Saturday, you'd gone to the doctor,

897
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:17,556
you'd gone to the cops,
you'd tried bleach, you'd tried paint,

898
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:21,562
you tried ripping up the carpet,
you'd tried dismantling a king-sized bed,

899
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,326
you'd tried burying the body,
but Rippy sort of messed up,

900
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,332
kind of dug Jeff up, didn't he?

901
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,534
Susan!

902
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,339
Susan, are you all right?

903
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:13,643
What are you doing out here?
Why don't you come inside, honey?

904
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,988
I think I did something awful, Mom.

905
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,925
Baby, what are you talking about?

906
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,596
I think I killed Jeff.

907
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,679
Hi.

908
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,147
I'm Thomas Dean,
attorney your mother hired.

909
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,984
Thank you for coming.

910
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,718
She said that there was something
you wanted me to see.

911
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,340
Is there anything more?

912
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,337
Oh, my God! Rippy! No!

913
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,750
Oh, my God! Is that a...

914
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,691
He beat me.

915
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,221
He threatened my life.

916
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,288
So this was self defense, right?

917
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,398
What's he gonna do
when he gets home, Mr. Dean?

918
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,471
He's gonna see this awful mess.

919
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,267
-He's gonna be so mad!
-Come on, come on.

920
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,041
You'll be safe here.

921
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:52,637
But you are not to talk to anyone without me.

922
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,079
Understand? No one.

923
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,743
We'll arrange for a doctor to interview you.

924
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,877
But that's only gonna be
under my supervision,

925
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,047
and that's the only person you can talk to.

926
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,149
Now it is important
that you follow my instructions.

927
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,452
Can you do that?

928
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,119
You a family member?

929
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,218
I'm her lawyer.

930
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,730
Now I'll tell the police what happened.

931
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:14,131
Eventually, a detective will have
to interview you, but not right now.

932
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,834
We're gonna get through this, okay?

933
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,033
When are the boys coming to visit?

934
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,969
Come on, this way.

935
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,844
There is a body at this address.

936
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,420
I can't say anything more
without breaking attorneylclient privilege,

937
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,284
but you need to send somebody there now.

938
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,757
When you heard
that there was a body found in the house,

939
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,986
whose did you think it was?

940
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,430
I thought it was Susan's.

941
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,496
I thought my best friend was dead.

942
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,869
Do you think the door is locked?

943
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,141
Why are you whispering, Susan?

944
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,382
It started with pushing.

945
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,444
Sometimes he grabs me too hard.
He's on drugs, you know.

946
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,317
Cocaine.

947
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:13,323
Sometimes he hits me in places
that people can't see.

948
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,224
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

949
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:16,861
Why are you whispering?

950
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,399
Because he can hear us.

951
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,066
He's gonna be so mad at me
when he wakes up.

952
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,736
You do realize that Jeffrey is dead,
don't you, Susan?

953
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,070
I mean, you keep referring to him
in present tense.

954
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,572
When he sees the house like that,

955
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,078
he's just gonna kill me.

956
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,518
Let's do it right so we can get it right.

957
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,187
-This is gonna take us three years.
-Yeah.

958
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,557
-What've you got?
-Multiple stab wounds.

959
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,696
How many, give or take?

960
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,128
A hundred, two?

961
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,994
The ME will have to do the math.

962
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,192
Holy crap!

963
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,801
Anybody see the wife?

964
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,161
Anybody talk to the neighbors?

965
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,105
I'll be canvassing the whole area.
Co-workers, everyone.

966
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,702
-Where are the kids?
-Grandmother's.

967
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,809
We just sent someone over there
to talk to her now.

968
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,710
What about the victim's family?
Anybody talk to them?

969
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,214
Get on that.

970
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,216
Hello, everybody. Breaking news today
in the suburb of Cypress Fair

971
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:16,758
where police are investigating
the murder of a man named Jeffrey Wright

972
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,425
We don't know a lot about Mr. Wright
other than he was a...

973
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,257
-Louis!
-What?

974
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,695
But reports we're getting from the scene
are of a grisly and violent murder,

975
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,599
the likes of which have not been seen before
in this peaceful suburb.

976
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:29,995
No!

977
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,434
Breaking news, live from Harris County.

978
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,237
We are outside the residence of a...

979
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,608
Everybody move back. Come on, let's go.

980
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,647
The wife reported domestic violence
to a neighbor on Wednesday.

981
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,652
The Fourth Precinct has a record
of her coming in

982
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,154
and telling her story on the same day.

983
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,884
So they issued a warrant for his arrest
and a restraining order.

984
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,358
So this is a domestic dispute.

985
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,521
She gonna say self-defense?

986
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,530
If he came back that night,
it could have happened like this.

987
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,059
Tell him what you just told me.

988
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,662
We rolled him before we bagged him.

989
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,497
Almost every stab wound was on his front.

990
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,328
There's no defensive wounds
on his hands at all.

991
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,916
So the last time he's at work,
or anybody talked to him, was Monday night.

992
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,145
Except she told the in-laws
she'd seen him Tuesday morning.

993
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,481
Yeah, but they didn't see him.

994
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:23,781
The only person that can confirm seeing him
after Monday night was the wife.

995
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,294
-What do we know about him?
-He's got some priors.

996
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,123
Felony conviction for controlled substance.

997
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:30,255
Marijuana.

998
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,390
And he's got...

999
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,659
Felony assault charge.

1000
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:34,895
Brandy Davenport, ex fiance.

1001
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,229
So this is a pattern?

1002
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,606
Signs seem to point to it.

1003
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,037
Well, let's just say that's how it happened.

1004
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,130
Monday night, he beats her up.

1005
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:43,234
Tuesday morning,
he comes back for another shot.

1006
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,336
Wednesday, she goes to the police,
files a report.

1007
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,506
He finds out about it,
he comes back for revenge.

1008
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,641
They go at it, she gets a knife and...

1009
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,780
And it all goes to hell.

1010
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,049
Battered wife, angry husband?

1011
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,388
What do you do after you've just
killed someone in self defense?

1012
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,920
-Call the cops.
-Exactly.

1013
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,825
You're not gonna spend a week
trying to cover it up.

1014
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,226
-Maybe she panicked.
-For a week?

1015
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,827
Then got her lawyer to put her in hiding?

1016
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,363
He's here.

1017
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,837
-What?
-He's here.

1018
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,769
No, no, no.
That's your attorney, Mrs. Wright.

1019
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,009
Okay, okay.

1020
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,237
What? What is it?

1021
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:21,238
No.

1022
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:25,849
He was sleeping.

1023
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,415
And there was a knife.

1024
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,123
He's dead.

1025
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,021
Jeffrey's dead.

1026
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,098
So, you've put her on suicide watch?

1027
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,998
It's for her own protection.

1028
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,661
You really think
she's gonna try to kill herself?

1029
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,638
I think she's suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

1030
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,739
From the murder?

1031
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:48,969
From abuse.

1032
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,877
How do you explain her behavior
in the days following the murder?

1033
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,979
She was in a dissociative state.

1034
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,486
I'm not sure if she's even fully recovered
from it yet.

1035
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,222
So she shows the signs
of battered woman syndrome?

1036
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,454
She's a poster child.

1037
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,128
At some point he just bled to death.

1038
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,094
-What else?
-There was cocaine in his system,

1039
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,932
which he'd ingested
within five hours of his death.

1040
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,165
And scrapes on his back.

1041
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,538
That's from being dragged to the patio.

1042
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,668
I don't get it.
I mean, how does a little girl like that

1043
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,336
take control of a 200 pound guy?

1044
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,014
Pretty little girl bats her eyes
at big, scary guy,

1045
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,913
says she wants him to lie down,
he lies down.

1046
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,679
One more thing.

1047
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,016
The time of death puts this on Monday night,

1048
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:34,446
not Wednesday.

1049
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,748
So she lied about him coming back.

1050
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,487
-And her whole trip to the police...
-Was a cover up.

1051
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,929
This sweet, little girl

1052
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,063
constructed her entire defense

1053
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:49,331
after burying her butchered husband
in their yard.

1054
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,030
I want her picked up.

1055
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,769
I want formal charges brought against her.

1056
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,907
I want Susan Wright charged with the murder
of Jeffrey Wright.

1057
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,819
Susan, why did you stab him so many times?

1058
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,254
Why didn't you just call the police?

1059
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,759
Susan, what made you snap?

1060
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,021
Susan, why did you kill him?

1061
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,321
Why didn't you report it right away?

1062
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,471
Why did you never call the police?

1063
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,472
They let her out on bail?

1064
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:29,570
She stabbed her husband 193 times
in self defense.

1065
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,272
She spent the last week
under psychiatric supervision.

1066
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:34,848
Does this make sense to you?

1067
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,111
-Are you falling from the prom queen?
-No, I'm just... I'm saying...

1068
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,310
Did you see that face?

1069
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,321
Did you see those weepy, doe-y eyes
and the way she played the judge?

1070
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,290
That jury is gonna take one look at that girl
and melt.

1071
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:45,382
Just like you did.

1072
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,019
I...

1073
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,819
Find me motive.

1074
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,232
Good evening. I'm Nancy Grace,
I wanna thank you for being with us.

1075
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,668
Bomb shell tonight.

1076
01:12:56,772 --> 01:13:00,538
A beautiful Texas blonde,
the blue-eyed butcher,

1077
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,577
allegedly ties her 34-year-old husband
to the bed

1078
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,873
and during what promises
to be quite a night...

1079
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,504
Okay, we'll just get out of the car quick.

1080
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,105
...something goes wrong.

1081
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,650
It goes wrong all right.

1082
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:13,210
Hubby ends up being stabbed
over 200 times.

1083
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,887
Have you read the ME's report, ma'am?

1084
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,717
You are not allowed on this property.

1085
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:21,420
This is private property. Go!

1086
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,664
Just a few days
before the body was discovered,

1087
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,894
Susan Wright made a report of abuse
to police

1088
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,629
-an arrest warrant was...
-You can't keep watching this.

1089
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,639
They let her out on bail,

1090
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,269
to be around our grandchildren.

1091
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,870
How could they let her out, Joan?

1092
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,379
She murdered our son.

1093
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,672
They'll convict her.

1094
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,778
What if they don't?

1095
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,559
You sure you don't want me to stay?

1096
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:53,886
No, I'm okay.

1097
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,488
-Why don't you come back to my house?
-I can't.

1098
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,368
The kids are with Jessica.

1099
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,835
You can stay with us
until this whole thing is over.

1100
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,767
I think I just wanna sleep in my own...

1101
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,168
I think I just wanna be home.

1102
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,841
Yeah.

1103
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:56,680
Allie, hi.

1104
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:00,053
Hey, I hope all this
isn't disturbing you guys?

1105
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,131
No. No, no, it's fine.

1106
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,828
Are those Jeff's things?

1107
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,960
I know. It's just the legal fees and the kids...

1108
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,129
And the bills are still coming in.

1109
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,702
Hey, if I buy these, will you sign them?

1110
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,172
Thomas.

1111
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,215
You have to shut this down.

1112
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:22,783
Why? I've made over $100 already.

1113
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,648
You can't be selling Jeffrey's things.

1114
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,243
People should know that I'm struggling.

1115
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,290
This is private property.
Ifyou don't get off it, I'm calling the cops.

1116
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,484
-What do you mean?
-Wait. No. But the...

1117
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:32,855
Let's go. Come on.

1118
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,292
That's it, the show is over.

1119
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,864
I can't just leave my stuff out here.

1120
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,696
That reporter just got a photo of you.

1121
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,196
What, showing that I'm broke?

1122
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,637
Showing you selling
your dead husband's possessions.

1123
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,800
I was defending myself and my children.

1124
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,902
Susan, there is a jury pool
reading about you right now.

1125
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,571
Is that really the image
you want them to see?

1126
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,564
You know they're
calling me the blue-eyed butcher?

1127
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,996
Well, they're crass.

1128
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,035
Or mean.

1129
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,379
You like me, though, don't you, Mr. Dean?

1130
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:31,017
You need to get your rest,
we got a long day ahead of you tomorrow.

1131
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,554
All eyes are
on the Harris County courthouse today

1132
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:42,653
as the trial of Susan Wright kicks off.

1133
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,562
Wright, the young housewife

1134
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,363
accused of murdering her husband
in their sweet suburban home.

1135
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,666
...alleged to have stabbed Jeffrey Wright...

1136
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,797
She took that knife

1137
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:56,275
and she stabbed and she cut

1138
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:01,182
and she sliced and she diced
and she mutilated

1139
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,116
193 times.

1140
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,449
That is a conservative estimate.

1141
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:11,857
That is how many times this woman stabbed
her own husband in the bedroom that night.

1142
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,860
You will hear testimony that at that point

1143
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,988
Susan has
a total psychotic break from reality.

1144
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:21,830
She sees herself from
above stabbing Jeffrey.

1145
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,736
A total break.

1146
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,100
$200,000?

1147
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,200
Yep, brand new policy.

1148
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,643
And the friend will testify to this?

1149
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,578
We got motive.

1150
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:38,007
-That girl is not gonna get away with murder.
-No, ma'am.

1151
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,987
Describe the state of the defendant's voice
during that phone conversation.

1152
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,590
She was angry.

1153
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,723
She wasn't screaming but it was loud enough
that I could hear her on the cell.

1154
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,956
And what did you hear the defendant say
in that loud, angry voice on the phone?

1155
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,589
I can't say verbatim, but she said that

1156
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,726
she couldn't believe that he had
filled out the paperwork incorrectly.

1157
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,805
That she... That there was only so much time
to get it turned in.

1158
01:17:57,906 --> 01:17:59,305
Paperwork regarding what?

1159
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,069
Jeff's new life insurance policy.

1160
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,201
And how'd this conversation end?

1161
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:04,335
Jeff said...

1162
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:08,314
Honey, don't worry,
if I die you're gonna be a very rich lady.

1163
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,421
How can you let her
tell all these lies about me?

1164
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,496
That's the way the system works.

1165
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,860
They tell their version
and then we get to tell ours.

1166
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,523
Well, the system isn't working.

1167
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,535
That woman is standing up there and
she's making me out to be the bad person.

1168
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,969
I would like to submit into evidence

1169
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:34,338
state's exhibits 257 to 341.

1170
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:40,445
Actually, I was able to identify
over 200 separate injuries on the body.

1171
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,782
There were so many, in fact,

1172
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,949
that some of them even overlapped.

1173
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,849
46 stab wounds to the chest,

1174
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:50,925
I can't watch this.

1175
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,857
30 stab wounds through the ribs,

1176
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,396
23 stab wounds in the neck,

1177
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,159
20 in the abdomen,

1178
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,234
seven in the groin.

1179
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,430
Just put me on the stand, please.

1180
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,673
I can't, she'll come after you.

1181
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:06,934
I don't care.

1182
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:10,341
She's making me sound like
somebody that I'm not.

1183
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:14,380
Okay? They'll like me. I know they will.

1184
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,708
Kelly spread-eagled on top of her ADA,

1185
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:23,785
slamming the actual murder weapon
on the blood-stained mattress.

1186
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,018
That's a slam dunk.

1187
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,527
I disagree. She finally went too far.

1188
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:28,926
Now how would...

1189
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:33,193
The sister heard us. And the neighbor.

1190
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:34,768
And the mother.

1191
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:38,101
I am so sick of hearing about
poor victimized Susan.

1192
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,102
Who do we have left?

1193
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,370
Doctor that interviewed her
at the psychiatric hospital.

1194
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,969
He's gonna argue battered wife syndrome.

1195
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:48,748
Susan.

1196
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,380
He put Susan on the witness list.

1197
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,484
-Doesn't mean he'll call her.
-Are you kidding?

1198
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,648
He's already got the shrink saying abuse.

1199
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:59,727
He puts Susan on the stand crying, timid,

1200
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:00,920
jury's never gonna believe

1201
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,462
such a beautiful girl
could do such a horrible thing.

1202
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,930
They're gonna think
the husband did something to her.

1203
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,132
You're up.

1204
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:13,965
What?

1205
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,134
I'm not putting the doctor on the stand.

1206
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,236
But why not?

1207
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:21,110
You told the doctor that Jeffrey was asleep.

1208
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:24,977
I don't remember.

1209
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,418
You told me that Jeffrey was
hovering over you with a knife

1210
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,114
saying, "Die, bitch."

1211
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,818
-He was.
-You lied, Susan.

1212
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,794
You lied to one of us.
And I can't put the doctor on the stand

1213
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:38,457
and have him contradict the story
that I've already established.

1214
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,364
Do you agree with me that in these records

1215
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:44,666
you are the sole beneficiary
of the life insurance policy?

1216
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,100
Yes, but I only learned that here.

1217
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,109
Do you agree with me that the records show

1218
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:52,544
you are the sole beneficiary
of the life insurance policy?

1219
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:53,909
Okay, but at this point...

1220
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,346
Do you agree with me that the records say

1221
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,476
you are the sole beneficiary
to the life insurance policy?

1222
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,487
-I'm not arguing...
-ls that a yes?

1223
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01,920
Yes, ma'am.

1224
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,054
What did it feel like?

1225
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,559
Watching him take his last breath,
gurgling with blood.

1226
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,289
Dying before your eyes, what is that like?

1227
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:14,768
And when you stabbed him the 56th time,
or the 89th time,

1228
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,567
or the 158th time,
was your arm getting tired?

1229
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,608
-lt wasn't like that.
-Like you're mad, like you're afraid.

1230
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,406
-Like you can't, can't stop.
-No.

1231
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:26,747
His chest. His head.

1232
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,409
His eyes.
And then you grabbed another knife

1233
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,847
to make sure he was really good and dead.

1234
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,644
Slicing at his penis.

1235
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:37,350
-Just please stop.
-Why are you crying, Susan?

1236
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,254
Does looking at this make you cry?

1237
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,852
How can somebody not cry
when they look at something like that?

1238
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,658
How can somebody do that?

1239
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,023
At all?

1240
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,372
Monday night, January 13th.

1241
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,137
Susan Wright decorated her bedroom
in a sexual manner.

1242
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,842
Lights on, ties ready.

1243
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,845
And said, "Guess what, Jeffrey?

1244
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,283
"It's gonna be your lucky night."

1245
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,887
She lured him in and tied him up.

1246
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:12,991
And then it all changed.

1247
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,087
You've seen the pictures.

1248
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:18,093
Can you imagine the look of betrayal
with that first cut?

1249
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,291
Jeffrey Wright used to have this saying.

1250
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,495
There's no answers for the dancers.

1251
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,540
Well, I submit to you

1252
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,403
that the answer for this dancer

1253
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,874
is guilty.

1254
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:45,993
What's next?

1255
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:47,728
Now we wait.

1256
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,658
The longer the better.

1257
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,675
Hey. Courthouse called.
Jury's in for the night.

1258
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:05,937
You thought they'd come right back,
didn't you?

1259
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,017
Goodnight.

1260
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,419
Yes, thank you.

1261
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,726
That was Mr. Dean.
He said that they're sequestered tonight.

1262
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,124
He said that's good news.

1263
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,201
Good, well, we'll wait and see.

1264
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,171
Let's just see what tomorrow brings, okay?

1265
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,707
Did you see her up there?

1266
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,673
They say she's pretty and...

1267
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,370
On the news and all that.

1268
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,377
She's the ugliest creature I've ever seen.

1269
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:49,981
But how important is the fact
that she claimed domestic abuse

1270
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,080
gonna be in the sentence?

1271
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,285
I think it's the only chance
that she has basically,

1272
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,192
to have this jury feel some sympathy for her,

1273
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:58,663
that could mitigate in her favor,
so they don't basically throw the book at her.

1274
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:02,564
There was a history of domestic violence,
there was drug abuse on his part.

1275
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:06,106
But again, it seems to be a pretty
defenseless crime, in terms of the savagery,

1276
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,504
the viciousness...

1277
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,274
-It's been a strong case.
-Yeah.

1278
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,394
Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.

1279
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,042
In the State of Texas
v. Susan Lucille Wright,

1280
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,314
we the jury, find the defendant

1281
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,754
guilty of murder
as charged in the indictment.

1282
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,590
We direct her punishment as confinement

1283
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:03,221
in the institutional division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice

1284
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,893
for 25 years.

1285
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,430
Does the defendant
wish to say anything at this time?

1286
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:09,901
No, Your Honor.

1287
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,510
You have to let go, sorry.

1288
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:20,009
Got to take you away now, sorry.

1289
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,206
Right this way.

1290
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:46,606
Self defense, really?

1291
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,133
Only two people know the answer to that.

1292
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,276
Come on, your lawyer's waiting.

1293
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:27,574
This way please.

1294
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:45,997
Hello, Susan.

1295
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,229
Hello.

1296
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:50,962
I hope that I look all right.

1297
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:56,941
I would never wear this bright of a color,
but it's all that I can get in here.

1298
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:58,573
You look very pretty.

1299
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,109
Thank you.

1300
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,148
And thank you for coming.

1301
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,447
So you think you can get me out of here?

1302
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,020
I don't think you got a fair trial.

1303
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:11,586
I can tell you that.

1304
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:14,284
So I wanna ask you more questions.

1305
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,760
I need to know more about Susan Wright.

1306
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:23,433
Well, hope you like me.
