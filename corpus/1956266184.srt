[eerie music playing]

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,999
ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:
For the past 10 years,

3
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,914
New Yorkers have
known who to turn to

4
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,176
for the most accurate weather.

5
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,707
He's a MAN 1: who has broughtthem events as they were

6
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:58,841
happening before they happened.

7
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,277
[children chattering]

8
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:14,770
In fact, it's almost unnaturalhow accurate this man

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,119
has been about the weather.

10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,468
It's made us wonder.

11
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,269
Starting this winter,
he'll be giving

12
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,706
his heart and soul to
do it for the rest of us

13
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,011
all across the country.

14
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:07,127
[clicking]

15
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:22,359
This is your new
"Hello, USA" weatherman.

16
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,449
This man is Greg Harrison.

17
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,671
And he's willing to
do whatever it takes.

18
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,325
GREG: Well, let's cut to it.

19
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,804
I'm getting the sense youdidn't like the commercial.

20
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,372
Now what makes you think that?

21
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,244
Because you haven't
said a word about it,

22
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:38,593
which is not like you.

23
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,727
Well.

24
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,033
Come on, out with it.
I can take it.

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,382
I can take the truth.

26
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,210
Tell me what the younger
generation thinks.

27
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:51,040
[laughs] I thought itmade you look a little evil.

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,782
The message is
that I'm ruthless,

29
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,914
that I'll do whatever
it takes to bring

30
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,351
the people the weather.

31
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,395
They like that.

32
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,398
But you're not ruthless, Greg.

33
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,095
Jane, you have to be
pretty ruthless to get

34
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,749
to be national weatherman.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,796
Or a good kiss ass.

36
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:12,192
Have you smelled this vanilla?

37
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,629
Smell it.

38
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,021
I--

39
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:20,591
See how ruthless I am?

40
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:24,465
My parent's brownstone
was just like this one.

41
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,162
Grove Street was just
around the corner.

42
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:32,342
I used to walk home from schooldown this street all the time.

43
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,828
[sighs]

44
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,267
[footsteps]

45
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:52,754
Hello?

46
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,280
[door slamming]

47
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,238
Not very friendly.

48
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:02,981
It's nice, isn't it?

49
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,073
Yeah, it's all
right, all right.

50
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,511
Sorry, it's not
exactly my style.

51
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,861
Oh, as if you
had a style, Greg.

52
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,780
That's why I hooked
up with you, dear.

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,524
So your aunt fell
down all those stairs?

54
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:28,224
That's a lot of stairs
for an old lady.

55
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,400
That is a lot of
stairs for anybody.

56
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,100
Somebody should have toldher to move somewhere else.

57
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,363
She wouldn't have listened.

58
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,674
My aunt depended on no one.

59
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:47,025
I would come here to visither when I was little.

60
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:50,638
I remember I used to
lie awake at night

61
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:54,468
and fantasize about havingmy own apartment just

62
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,338
like this one.

63
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,038
And now it's mine.

64
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,213
Yours?

65
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,954
She snuck my
name on the lease.

66
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:06,610
So I pay what she
payed, $400 a month.

67
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,090
$400?

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,092
The landlord can't be
too happy about that.

69
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:17,360
You might me able to subletthis place, $3,000-$4,000 easy.

70
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,755
I'm not going to
sublet it, Greg.

71
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,496
I'm keeping it.

72
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,411
Keeping it?

73
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,717
I don't understand.

74
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,458
We just got a place together.

75
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,460
I just want a little space.

76
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,462
Is that a crime?

77
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:36,988
My office is so small, andCheryl shares that with me.

78
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,555
I just-- this place is so cheap.

79
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,122
And you, this is yourgraceful way of telling me?

80
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,602
I was-- I was waiting for the--

81
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,907
that's why--

82
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,605
MAN 1: Hey, you're
Greg Harrison, "Rise

83
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,346
and Shine New York," right?

84
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,782
Let me shake your hand.

85
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:48,696
You're great.

86
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,958
Well, thanks a lot.

87
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,176
You know, I appreciate
that, really.

88
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,221
OK. [LAUGHING
NERVOUSLY] See you.

89
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,222
Thanks.
You have a good night.

90
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,442
[CHUCKLING] OK, heh-heh.

91
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,139
That's why you keptpushing back the moving day?

92
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,448
This is your graceful
way out of it?

93
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,840
You want me to live in theWestchester house by myself?

94
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,975
I'm in the middle of the
most important career

95
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,106
move of my life.

96
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,847
I need you now.

97
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,067
Why couldn't you tell me sooner?

98
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:12,981
I didn't know sooner.

99
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,551
Jane, you think
you can just throw

100
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,380
other people's lives intoturmoil and it doesn't matter?

101
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,424
It does.

102
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:24,775
It has serious repercussions.

103
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,429
Can we talk about this?

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,302
If you'd calm down, Greg.

105
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,521
What about dinner?

106
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:32,957
Look, you'll
have to forgive me.

107
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,264
I'm really not in the
mood to go out anymore.

108
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,110
I'm gonna go open up.

109
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,861
Oh, you've got keys.

110
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,428
How'd you get the keys?

111
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,212
I'm moving into theapartment on the fifth floor.

112
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,779
My name's Jane Emelin.

113
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,694
I've seen you here
before, haven't I?

114
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:14,738
Probably.

115
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,610
I used to visit my Aunt Cecile.

116
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,915
Did you know Cecile?

117
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,702
Oh, well, of course I did.

118
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:22,659
Hello, Jane.

119
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,748
My name's Martha Stewart--

120
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,880
not the famous one though.

121
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,272
Right.

122
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,927
Oh, you know, I'm
the one who found her.

123
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:33,757
It was just awful, herhead smashed to potatoes.

124
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,542
Poor dear.

125
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,195
Do you need any help
carrying your things in?

126
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,109
No, I'm fine.

127
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,067
I have movers coming.

128
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,069
I have a lot of stuff.

129
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,507
Oh, good, good, good.

130
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,291
That's what this building has--

131
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,990
can't be bought, can't be sold.

132
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,774
Have you met anyone else yet?

133
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,036
In the building, you mean?

134
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,647
No, not yet.

135
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,780
Oh, well, we're all avery friendly group here.

136
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,696
Mr. And Mrs. Bryant live
on the second floor.

137
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,959
Mr. Collins lives
on the third floor.

138
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,918
He's a dashing man.

139
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,224
You should probably
leave him alone though.

140
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,488
He likes his privacy.

141
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,141
What about the
person right beneath me

142
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,926
with all those trash bags?

143
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,101
The fourth floor?

144
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,145
Yeah.

145
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,191
Oh, dear Alice, poor thing.

146
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:19,542
She was hit really hard
by your aunt's death.

147
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,806
It was just about more
than she could stomach.

148
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,026
You won't have to
see much of her.

149
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,159
She's a hermit, an
eccentric, you know.

150
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,639
Yeah.

151
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,642
Oh, what's this?

152
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,644
So you like older men, do you?

153
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:38,126
No, not necessarily.

154
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,607
He looks a lot likethat weatherman, you know,

155
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:43,044
the "Rise and Shine" guy?

156
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,349
Yeah, that's him.

157
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,612
Where did you meet?

158
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,352
I helped him with his office.

159
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,919
Secretary?

160
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,051
Not quite.

161
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,705
I help him with acquisitions.

162
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,141
I'm an interior designer.

163
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,055
Well.

164
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,535
[pounding]

165
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:58,494
Yes?

166
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,196
What's going on here?

167
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,678
You just come here and noone says anything to me?

168
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:09,592
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,855
You're sorry?

170
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,422
You will be.

171
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,079
You can't just move inhere without talking to me.

172
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,733
Give me your keys.

173
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:20,647
Give me your keys.

174
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:21,517
Now, Jerry.

175
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,737
Jerry, calm down.

176
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,869
Calm down, dear.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,263
You know you're
not allowed keys.

178
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,220
It's all right.

179
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,134
It's all right.

180
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:41,058
What was that about?

181
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,234
He's the super.

182
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,020
Well, he's actually
the landlord's nephew.

183
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,937
He probably just thought he'dbe moving into the apartment.

184
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,114
He has to live in the basementwith all the storage, you see.

185
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,115
He's got a disability.

186
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,029
Oh.

187
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,479
Oh, shit.

188
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,442
[soft music playing]

189
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:22,682
Oof.

190
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:30,777
Ah.

191
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,691
[nail clattering]

192
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:32,561
Whoa.

193
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,739
Shit.

194
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,653
OK.

195
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,582
[distant scream]

196
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,583
[man yelling]

197
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:00,545
[tense music playing]

198
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,445
[intercom buzzing]

199
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,547
Hello?

201
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,378

204
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,304
Who is it?

206
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,165

00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,527
[intercom buzzing]

209
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,055
Hello?

210
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:02,015
DELIVERYMAN [ON INTERCOM]:Delivery for Jane Emelin.

211
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,017
What?

212
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:05,757
He said it has to be
set up in your bedroom,

213
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,544
and we have to
program it for you.

214
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,938
He said you wouldn't
know how to.

215
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:17,073
Yeah, I don't know howbecause I hate television.

216
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,161
I'm sorry, ma'am.

217
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,294
I'm just trying to do my job.

218
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,295
OK.

219
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,123
Well, I have to get ready.

220
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,254
Yeah, we'll just set this up.

221
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,386
Then we'll get out of your way.

222
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:26,300
Yeah, OK.

223
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:55,895
Altercation?

224
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,338
[sighs]

225
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,087
Jerry?

226
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,920
Did you have something--

227
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,887
I know you meant it as
a nice gesture, Greg.

228
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:35,630
But the thing takes
up half my bedroom.

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,979
I don't know.

230
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,589
Get somebody to come
and get rid of it.

231
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:42,854
Yeah, what surprise?

232
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,731
Cheryl, you want to
come bring those in?

233
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,863
OK.

234
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,648
I've got to go.

235
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:55,345
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

236
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,608
Goodbye.

237
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,655
Everything OK with him?

238
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:01,873
Yeah, everything's fine.

239
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:02,787
Why?

240
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:03,658
I don't know.

241
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,790
You seem a little tense.

242
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,488
That's because
the lady downstairs

243
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,229
left me this crabby note.

244
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,492
I want to move my furniturearound before it gets too late.

245
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:14,103
Jeez.

246
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:15,931
I have to bring in
those tear sheets.

247
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:16,845
I know.

248
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,455
I know.

249
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,283
You know, I have a goodidea of what you're going for.

250
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,632
I could start it for you.

251
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,374
And then you could unpack.

252
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,288
Yeah, that would be great.

253
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,812
Would you do that for me?

254
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:31,468
So call me at home if
you have any questions.

255
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,643
I've got it all under control.

256
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,604
I'm just trying
to figure it out,

257
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,215
what I could have
done differently.

258
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,087
It's not about you.

259
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,350
It's about me.

260
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,961
It's about this place.

261
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:46,918
[sighs]

262
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,227
When you asked me
to move in with you,

263
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,229
I really wanted
for it to be right.

264
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,014
I really did.

265
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,712
And I tried to convince myself.

266
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:01,020
Look, Greg, I've nevereven lived on my own yet.

267
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,502
I'd hate to have to us move allthe way out there and find out

268
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:09,724
that we didn't really know whatwe were getting ourselves into.

269
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:12,074
I just know that
this isn't going

270
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,077
to turn out the way you want.

271
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,472
Can't we just keep it
the way it is for now,

272
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,649
and then we'll see?

273
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,521
Well, I don't see
that I have much choice.

274
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,182
[thunder booming]

275
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,279
Ah.

276
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,106
Hey.

277
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,590
Hey, wait.

278
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,223
Oh, I thought you
were Mrs. Stewart.

279
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,572
Mrs. Stewart?

280
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,053
[BREATHLESSLY] Yes, thank god.

281
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,664
That woman pursues me everytime I walk into this place.

282
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,537
It's getting me in shape,I'll tell you that.

283
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:24,407
How do you do?

284
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,669
I'm Mr. Collins.

285
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,715
You must be Miss
Emelin, the new tenant.

286
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,891
We, none of us, knew that, um--

287
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,633
that Mrs. Lewis had anyone.

288
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,026
Such a tragedy, what happened.

289
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,550
Yeah.

290
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,987
I'm sorry I haven't comeup to introduce myself.

291
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:39,857
It's bad form.

292
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:40,945
No, not at all.

293
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,339
I should have introduced myself.

294
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,386
Actually, I'm kind of
off to a rocky start

295
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:47,735
with half the building already.

296
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:48,649
[laughs]

297
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,088
I've always been amazed
at your profession,

298
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,742
to go into other people'shouses and decide

299
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:55,873
how they should live.

300
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,571
It's true.

301
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,574
But I find that people don'tknow what they really want.

302
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:04,447
And most of the time, I havea better idea than they do.

303
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:10,236
The job is to try and get insidetheir heads and figure it out.

304
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,715
Sometimes that's tough.

305
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,587
Oh, the million
dollar question, what

306
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,415
goes on inside others' heads?

307
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,942
We only know what they show us.

308
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,770
It's true.

309
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,554
Quite a collection
you have here.

310
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,861
Oh, thank you, Mr. Collins.

311
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:28,776
It's kind of all over
the place right now.

312
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:32,997
That carving, is
that South American?

313
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,913
Actually, that's aCambodian protective spirit.

314
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:39,526
And you hang it above thedoorway, and it protects you.

315
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,268
I haven't figured out
just how to hang it yet.

316
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,707
I'm a collector
myself, you know--

317
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,709
Mid-East, mostly.

318
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,101
I'm terrible.

319
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,495
I keep on getting
more and more things.

320
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,975
And I don't have
the space for it.

321
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,504
Well, I could really
chat all night.

322
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,245
But you've obviously got
some work ahead of you.

323
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,291
Yeah.

324
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:08,207
It's good to get a bettersense of you, Miss Emelin.

325
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,124
[fly buzzing]

326
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,469
[suspenseful music playing]

327
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:03,914
[gasps]

328
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,779
OPERATOR [ON PHONE]: 911,what's your emergency?

329
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,215
Hi.

330
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,695
I'm not sure if this
is an emergency or not.

331
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,044
But--

332
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,089
OPERATOR [ON PHONE]:
Name and address?

333
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:51,179
Jane Emelin, 146 11th Street.

334
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,181
I just saw something
in the window right

335
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,400
across the way from mine.

336
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,838
And I'm not sure
what the address is.

337
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:58,752
I just know it's right--

338
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,144
[knocking on door]

339
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,367
Can you hold on for
one second, please?

340
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,350
Sorry to bother you so late.

341
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,613
I hope you don't
still have company.

342
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:35,397
On the phone with
your boyfriend?

343
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,051
No.

344
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,575
Just wondering if I couldborrow a little sugar, dear.

345
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:40,750
Sure.

346
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:41,751
Oh, thank you.

347
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:57,985
GREG [ON TV]: Good morning.

348
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,682
Rise and shine, and getout of bed, New York City.

349
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,031
Wipe that sleep out of you eyes.

350
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:01,945
Come on, everybody.

351
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:03,643
Don't be a plain-Jane.

352
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:04,557
Ugh.

353
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:05,993
[plays harmonica note]

354
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:09,170
GREG [ON TV]: And[SINGING] Rise and shine,

355
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,998
and give out your glory, glory.

356
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:14,567
Rise and shine, and give
out your glory, glory.

357
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:18,005
Rise and shine, and give
out your glory, glory.

358
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:23,184
And I got a letter from
Todd Jacobs, age 5,

359
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:26,100
asking how to
become a weatherman.

360
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,102
Well, Ted, there's
a lot you can do

361
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,931
to learn more about the
environment around you.

362
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,542
This week is a
good week to start.

363
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,544
As you can see

Sorry.

"You've been warned.

Uh.

[ominous music playing]

383
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,630
You need any help
back there, young lady?

384
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,023
Oh, no.

385
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,415
I'm just looking for
the right size nails.

Come on.

389
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:51,348
For the last time,
I'm telling you.

390
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,830
Uh, open up.

391
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:58,312
Come on.

MARTHA: It's Mrs. Bryant.

393
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,186
Her husband accidentally
locked her out again.

394
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:06,668
They're both deaf,
blind as bats too.

395
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,844
Oh, and don't touch her.

396
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,891
They scare very easily.

397
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:15,721
So I gather you met
Mr. Collins last night.

398
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,374
Yeah, he's very nice.

399
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,420
Well, I'm glad you met.

400
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,813
But it's best not
to bother him again.

401
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:23,337
Well, I didn't think
I was bothering him.

402
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,513
Well, I understand, dear.

403
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,211
But it's really best
to leave him alone.

404
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:30,561
OK.

405
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,563
MRS. BRYANT: Open the door.

406
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,522
Just open this door.

407
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,680
[SIGHING] Oh, damn it.

410
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,024
Hello?

411
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:52,948
Apartment 5?

412
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,748
You just move in, Jane?

413
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,189
I saw your note on
the door downstairs.

414
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,103
Oh, yeah.

415
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,105
I haven't met her yet.

416
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,159
You stick something inhere trying to open the door?

417
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,639
No.

418
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,380
Well, there's something
jamming this up.

419
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,211
You're gonna need a new lock.

420
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,065
OK, I think this
should cover it.

421
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:19,687
We saw each other
last night, didn't we?

422
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,471
I'm sorry?

423
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:26,563
I live right over
there across the way.

424
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,087
You were looking
in my apartment.

425
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,044
No.

426
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:30,567
I-- well, I wasn't--

427
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,266
Don't you know aboutpeople and their privacy?

428
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:37,226
I'm just kidding.

429
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:40,186
Don't worry about it.

430
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:43,711
I hope you didn't call thecops on me or anything.

431
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,365
No.

432
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,454
No, of course not.

433
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,369
I just happened tonotice you and your wife.

434
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,807
She's not my wife.

435
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,461
She's just helping
me with something.

436
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,161
Here's your new set.

437
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,992
Thank you very much.

438
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,254
It's a great apartment.

439
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:11,695
It's one of my
favorite buildings--

440
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:13,697
It's impossible to get
into this building.

441
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,877
Is that key to my place also?

442
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,316
Yeah.

443
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:31,063
I keep a master to every lockI work on in this building.

444
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:35,241
The super isn't allowed
to keep keys here.

445
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,111
He's a little strange.

446
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:46,992
You know, you have a
really interesting face.

447
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:00,527
[SIGHING] Uh.

448
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,501

449
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,032
Aw, come on.

450
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:27,989
This is absurd.

451
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,643
I gotta move in, Granny.

452
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,430
[stomping on floor]

453
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:40,915
Unbelievable.

[pounding continues]

455
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:42,917
Unbelievable.

[footsteps approaching]

458
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,575
Oh, man.

459
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,273
OK, listen to this.

460
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:37,232
"You must lay large area rugsor buffers down to reduce

00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:54,597
She keeps saying that.

470
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,034
Oral disturbance.

fucking kidding me?

Pages, pages upon
pages of this stuff.

477
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,659
And then the last sentencesays, "You have now been warned,

478
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,922
so there will be
no forgiveness."

479
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,447
You know, you should askaround about this lady.

480
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,754
She sounds a little kooky.

481
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:22,103
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

482
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,677
I mean do you think a little oldwoman could have written that?

483
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:31,547
Yeah, why not?

Hey, you gotta close yourwindows or something.

488
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,904
Oh, I don't know.

489
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:44,386
I'm probably
overreacting, but it--

490
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:49,783
it just seems so
vicious and weird,

491
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:52,220

492
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,007
I understand.

00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,058
You're loving
this, aren't you?

[laughs]

495
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,016
Don't say I didn't warn you.

496

very predictable.

MR. COLLINS: I saw this
at an auction today.

I thought you would like it.

504
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,223
Consider it a housewarming gift.

505
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,659
Wow, that's very nice.

Thank you.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't realize that--

No, that's OK.

That's Greg Harrison,
the weatherman.

Well, you know, I watch youevery morning that you're on.

512
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,283
Oh, that's very kind.

513
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,719
Thank you.

same high school, PS 4.

My name is Albert Collins.

Collins?

You used to live downin this area, didn't you?

518
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,209
Did we know each other?

519
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,124
No, no, no.

520
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,778
You wouldn't have known me.

521
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,215
But I thought that sinceyou're such a famous alumnus,

522
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,521
I had to mention it anyway.

523
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:16,609
I didn't mean to intrude.
I--

524
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:17,827
[phone ringing]
- Not at all.

525
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,741

Excuse me.

528
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:21,744
I have to take this.
- Yeah.

529
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,658
OK?

530
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:23,572
Have a seat.

531
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,573
Oh.

532
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,661
JANE: Yes, I'm listening.

533
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,968
Thank you.

534
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:30,927
So you decided
to stay down here.

535
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:31,972
Oh, yeah.

536
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:32,886
[LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] Excuse me.

537
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,279
Don't worry about it.

538
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,237
Have a seat.

539
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:40,415
So they still talk
about me at PS 4?

540
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,677
Yes, I understand.

541
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:44,419
Of course, it's very hard.

542
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,466
I'm on your side
though, Mrs. Adamson.

543
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:48,423
I know.

544
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:49,990
I know.

545
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,036
I'll speak to you firstthing tomorrow morning, OK?

546
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,081

730
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,504
Well, I called them
because I had to.

731
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:05,943
I'm being attacked by
the woman downstairs.

732
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:09,337
I'm afraid Alice didn't likeyour Aunt Cecile very much.

733
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:12,950
She must be taking
it out on you.

734
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,213
Martha told me that
they were friends.

735
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,650
Friends?

736
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,217
Not at all.

737
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:20,131
No.

738
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:27,877
No, the truth is Alice doesn'tget along with anyone, really.

739
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,792
I'm sorry this has been
so difficult for you.

740
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:34,275
But you know, sometimes it justtakes time to find your groove.

741
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:37,887
Of course, sometimes peoplejust never do find it.

742
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:41,239
It's like oil and water.

743
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:44,459
Buildings like this are
just about compromise.

744
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,896
So maybe this is a sign
that it was smart of you

745
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:50,813
to move to
Westchester after all.

746
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:52,902
Westchester?

747
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,079
You mean Greg's house?

748
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:58,212
Aw, you-- it sounds
like a lovely home.

749
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:02,477
And he-- he's such a nice man.

750
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,175
Yes.

751
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:06,394
He is.

752
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:09,876
No, I'm not moving there.

753
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,487
I'll fit in just fine here.

754
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:14,141
Thank you very much.

755
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:16,317
I didn't mean to
insult you, Miss Emelin.

756
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,406
I'm just trying
to look after you.

757
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:20,756
No, I appreciate your
concern, Mr. Collins.

758
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:21,627
But I'll be fine.

759
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:22,541
Not to worry.

760
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,373
[knocking on door]

761
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,766
MR BRYANT: Will you let
me in, Betty, please?

762
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:31,637
Betty!

763
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,030
Good evening.

764
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:33,987
MR BRYANT: Betty.

765
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,380
Oh, very well, thank you.

766
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,774
Just trying to find
the groove here.

767
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,341
Betty, come on.

768
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:42,256
Betty, will you
let me in, please?

769
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:43,388
Darn it, Betty!

770
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:49,584
[clanging]

771
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:28,379
[water running]

772
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,807
LOCKSMITH: You
just move in, Jane?

773
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:06,721
Ah!

774
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:13,815
[breathing heavily]

775
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:33,748

776
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:37,752
Oh, my god.

777
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,251
[gasping]

778
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,690
Oh!

779
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,692
Ah!

780
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:07,304
Oh, shit!

781
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:08,217
Oh!

782
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,060
Oh-ho, whoa.

783
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:27,715
Oh, you got an army in there.

784
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,456
How long's this been going on?

785
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,850
Just this morning.

786
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,026
I mean, don't you think
that's a little strange?

787
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:38,117
You clean up after
yourself and everything?

788
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:39,205
Yes.

789
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,467
I'm gonna be a while.

790
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:41,338
OK.

791
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,513
So what do you think?

792
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:43,601
I come back later
this afternoon?

793
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:44,776
Is that good?

794
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:45,907
Yeah, I may need
reinforcements.

795
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:46,952
Fine.

796
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:50,303
Do whatever you have to do.

797
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,783
Yeah, get back.
Hey!

798
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,045
Get back in.

799
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:54,351
I'll be right
over, Mrs. Adamson,

800
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:55,874
and then we'll work it out.

801
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,745
I've just been having someproblems-- and these--

802
00:55:57,876 --> 00:55:59,138
at home lately.

803
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:01,488
Um, can I get you to
deliver this to my place

804
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:02,924
at around 5:00?

805
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:03,838
No problem.

806
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,057
What's your address?

807
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:08,539
JANE: 146 11st
Street, Apartment 5.

808
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:09,931
Of course.

809
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,498
Well, you'll be comfortablewith everything.

810
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:13,108
It's not a problem.

811
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,675
OK, I'll see you soon.

812
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:17,983
Say hello to
Miss Cooper for me.

813
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:19,767
Miss Cooper?
You know her?

814
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:22,161
We've been bringing her
groceries for 15 years.

815
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,642
Then two months ago therewas a note saying she doesn't

816
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:26,078
want deliveries anymore.

817
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:28,515
Will you tell her
we're asking about her?

818
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:29,908
Yeah, OK.

819
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:30,822
I'll tell her.

820
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:34,565
Thank you very much.

821
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:35,827
Come back soon.

822
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:37,916
We know your address

823
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:41,006
I wanted to talk to
you about Alice, Martha.

824
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:42,224
Alice?

825
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:44,139
I was down at
the Korean grocery.

826
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,012
And he told me that
she, all of a sudden,

827
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,709
just stopped ordering
groceries from them.

828
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,580
Wait a minute.

829
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,972
Wait a minute.

830
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:53,322
Why are you asking the
Koreans about Alice?

831
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:54,498
I didn't ask him.

832
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:55,716
He just told me that.

833
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,371
What is it with you?

834
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,765
First, the police--
then the Koreans?

835
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:03,463
Don't you have any respectfor people's privacy?

836
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:04,812
Who do you think you are?

837
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:06,988
A spy?

838
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,338
No, I'm not a spy.

839
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:11,993
And what about what Itold you about Mr. Collins?

840
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,909
I asked you to leave
the poor man alone.

841
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,608
He told me that you'vebeen knocking on his door,

842
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:20,306
asking about this and
that, and this and that.

843
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,395
There are rules here.

844
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,875
But you have to be
a rebel, don't you?

845
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:26,965
You are just like your aunt.

846
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,968
Why are you attacking meall of a sudden, Martha?

847
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:31,709
I'm not attacking you.

848
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,667
I'm warning you.

849
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:37,323
You are walking on very
thin ice down here.

850
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,805
You're putting thethermometer on the radiator.

851
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:44,896
Some of us are
trying to live here.

852
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:46,985
We gotta talk.

853
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:49,335
You been noticing a lotmore flies in your apartment

854
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,641
these days?

855
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,251
Yeah, a few, now
that you mention it.

856
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:54,775
They've been coming upthrough the drain in your tub.

857
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:57,169
Them white things in
your tub are maggots.

858
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,519
Something must have
died in those pipes.

859
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,174
They like to nest
in soft tissue.

860
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:03,436
Something died?

861
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,350
Ah, don't worry.

862
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,873
I sprayed pretty good.

863
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:08,528
But I'd keep a plug inthat drain for a few days.

864
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:09,703
OK.

865
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,792
Now about the mice.

866
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:16,188
I was cleaning up
when I found this.

867
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:17,842
Now take a close look.

868
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,017
You see that white mouse?

869
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,671
That's an albino mouse.

870
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:21,933
That ain't natural.

871
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,674
That's a laboratory mouse.

872
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:26,546
People use them to
feed their pet snakes.

873
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:28,113
I don't understand.

874
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:31,333
At first, I didn't either.

875
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:32,291
Come here.

876
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,820
I covered this up for you.

877
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:42,127
That's the mousehole there?

878
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,650
Take a look at that hole.

879
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:45,130
That ain't no mousehole.

880
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,001
Somebody drilled that.

881
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:49,003
You don't have a
mouse problem, lady.

882
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:50,178
You got a neighbor problem.

Will you pick up, please?

887
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,088
OK, there's some verybad things happening now.

888
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:33,134
I think something really strangeis going on with the neighbor

890
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,400
I really need you
to call me back.

891
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,881
OK, please?

892
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:41,795
Can you hear me?

893
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:45,016
Are you there?

912
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,247
X-ray tech to ICU.

913
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:16,728
NURSE 2: Over here,
she needed an EKG.

914
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:17,772
Let me know.

915
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,296
Thank you.

916
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:20,688
JANE: I'm trying to tellyou that somebody hit me.

917
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:21,950
And look at my forehead.

918
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:24,214
You passed out
from the gas, Jane.

919
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:26,216
You hit your head on the floor.

920
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:27,826
You're my lawyer, OK?

921
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:29,088
Now help me out here.

922
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,351
I'm telling you that
somebody hit me.

923
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:32,265
Did you see him?

924
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:33,962
I don't remember.

925
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:38,010
They said her memory wasgoing to be a little shaky.

926
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:41,492
I remember everything.

927
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:44,843
I remember everything
that happened to me.

928
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:49,674
I remember-- he sent me apicture of Cecile's dead body,

929
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:53,330
Greg, like he was behind it.

930
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,766
[crying]

931
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:58,509
And I was taking these pictures.

932
01:07:58,639 --> 01:07:59,771
I was going to show you.

933
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,338
I had all the proof.

934
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:04,167
He stole everything that I had.

935
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:05,690
What pictures?

936
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,735
This fucking
maniac, he diagrammed

937
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,868
my apartment on his ceiling.

938
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:11,174
I saw it.

939
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,611
He knew exactly
where everything was,

940
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:14,916
and he had it all mapped out.

941
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:16,657
I saw it.

942
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:18,746
ASHLEY: Who is he?

943
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:22,185
There is no old
woman downstairs.

944
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:24,230
An old woman couldn't
have done what I saw.

945
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:30,193
He did something to her.

946
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:31,585
Did any of the
neighbors see anything?

947
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,550
They don't think
anything is going on.

948
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,774
Well, we have to
go to the police.

949
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:48,211
ASHLEY: With what?

950
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:51,431
Can we show the police anything?

951
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:56,175
My floor, he drilled
a hole in my floor.

952
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:58,395
Um, there's no hole.

953
01:08:58,525 --> 01:08:59,265
What?

954
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,662
POLICE OFFICER: You
sure it was here?

955
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:05,663
JANE: Yes.

956
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:09,275
I'm positive it was here.

957
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:11,190
Oh, I don't understand.

958
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:17,544
Are you all right?

959
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:20,765
[WEAKLY] Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

960
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:27,119
We have a reoccurring
10-90 with Jane Emelin.

961
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,076
MAN 3 [ON POLICE RADIO]: Yes.

962
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,165
I have 1785--

963
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:30,862
It just doesn't
make any sense.

964
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,690
MAN 3 [ON POLICE RADIO]: --asa recurring special case.

965
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,692
You've called a fewtimes before, haven't you,

966
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:35,693
Miss Emelin?

967
01:09:35,823 --> 01:09:36,607
A few times?

968
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,089
Yes.

969
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,178
I tried to get help.

970
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:47,095
Copy that.

971
01:09:47,226 --> 01:09:48,488
All right.

972
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,273
I'll go down and check
the hall downstairs

973
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:54,102
and see if I can see anything.

974
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,321
I don't understand.

975
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:00,413
GREG: So how come youdidn't tell me about calling

976
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:01,371
the police those other times?

977
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,506
Keep a list.

978
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:08,639
You know, they think
we're both crazy.

979
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:11,772
I saw the plans in the
fourth-floor apartment.

980
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:14,514
And whoever this
guy is, he wants

981
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:16,864
to take the building back.

982
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:20,738
How about all the peopleon the other three floors?

983
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:23,523
Why hasn't anything
happened to them?

984
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:25,873
Nobody knows what you're
talking about, Jane.

985
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:30,878
We could go back theretomorrow when I feel better.

986
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:34,012
And then I'll show you exactly
what I'm talking about.

987
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:35,666
I could find the exterminator.

988
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:38,495
No.

989
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,846
No, this has got to stop.

990
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:43,064
Nobody believes you, Jane.

991
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:55,642
Listen, you never even haveto go back in that building.

992
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,776
The phone gets
turned off tonight.

993
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:00,865
I'll get the movers to
pack you up tomorrow.

994
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:03,607
You are safe.

995
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:08,046
You've got a great
house up in the country.

996
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,875
Things got out of hand.

997
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:16,184
And it happened badly.

998
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:23,496
But it's a good thing thatwe're moving in together.

999
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,719
And I will give
you what you need.

1000
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:34,246
I promise.

1001
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:09,150
[dramatic music playing]

1002
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:28,126
Knock, knock, knock!

1003
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:32,130
You think you can get rid of me?

1004
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,133
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1005
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:36,656
Face me now.

1006
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:40,617
Come on out and face
me, you motherfucker.

1007
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:42,140
I'm not afraid of you.

1008
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,576
Come out, you fucking coward.

1009
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:05,685
You'd better come downstairs.

1010
01:13:05,816 --> 01:13:08,296
He wants to take
my place, take

1011
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:10,951
it over, that fucking coward.

1012
01:13:11,082 --> 01:13:12,605
I know you think I'm crazy.

1013
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:13,476
But I'm not.

1014
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,303
I'm not crazy.

1015
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:18,394
No, not at all.

1016
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,439
Because I know what I know.

1017
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,486
I know he did something
to that woman.

1018
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,575
And I know he did
something to my aunt.

1019
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,406
I know it now.

1020
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,886
I believe you.

1021
01:13:33,017 --> 01:13:34,497
You do?

1022
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:35,411
Yeah.

1023
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:51,209
There is something
really evil going on.

1024
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:54,255
Evil-- you think so?

1025
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:57,215
I saw it.

1026
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:58,434
I saw it upstairs.

1027
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:08,400
It's not something that I'mjust going to walk away from.

1028
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,923
I'm trying to own what's mine.

1029
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:11,621
And I have rights.

1030
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:15,799
And I won't have somebodyjust try to take that from me.

1031
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:17,322
I understand.

1032
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,717
I have a right to be herejust like anybody else.

1033
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,589
And he wants to take thataway from me-- my right?

1034
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:31,249
You were saying?

1035
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:32,729
[WHISPERS] Portcullis.

1036
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:42,129
[grunts]

1037
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:50,834
MR. COLLINS: I tried tolook after you, to give you

1038
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:55,316
the clues, to make
you see that this

1039
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,579
was not where you belonged.

1040
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:02,062
Unlike the others, I gaveyou the chance to leave.

1041
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:07,198
But you wanted to
know the answer

1042
01:15:07,328 --> 01:15:09,374
to the million dollar question.

1043
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,681
Do you know it now?

1044
01:15:11,811 --> 01:15:12,551
You're here.

1045
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:18,992
Welcome to my design.

1046
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:22,605
Welcome to the
inside of my mind.

MR. COLLINS: Ever been caughtin a portcullis before?

1051
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:57,525
A chamber to insulate thepharaohs in their tombs.

1052
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:58,526
This is my version.

1053
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:02,966
Help!

1054
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:03,836
Help!

1055
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:12,453
Silence is the mostbeautiful noise in the world.

1056
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:14,804
But you don't understand that.

1057
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:19,852
A building is an organic
creature, you know?

1058
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:22,246
And the organism of this
building, what I need

1059
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:24,422
is not a lot to ask for.

1060
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,250
But you have to
have your own rules.

1061
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,078
Cecile didn't understand.

1062
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,819
Alice didn't understand.

1063
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:31,995
You, all of you, are infections.

1064
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:37,087
And infections have to
be cleared or cut out.

It's very sad, Miss Emelin.

1073

We see the world in much
the same way, I think.

1074

Territory is very
important to us.

1078
01:21:24,096 --> 01:21:27,186
I think is the only way out.

01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:50,503
Shh.

1093
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:09,174
GREG [ON TV]: Rise and
shine, New York City.

1094
01:24:09,305 --> 01:24:11,568
Even though we've had
a very feisty fall,

1095
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:16,834
we've unfortunately got an evenmore active winter on the way.

1096
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:20,359
This is also,unfortunately, my last show

1097
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:21,665
as your local forecaster.
[applause]

1098
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:23,841
[audience booing]
Now, now, now.

1099
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:25,625
I'll still be with you
though every morning--

1100
01:24:25,756 --> 01:24:26,670
MAN 4 [ON TV]: You suck, Greg.

1101
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,367
GREG [ON TV]: --on "Hello, USA."

1102
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:30,108
But first, let me give
you that one last look

1103
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,327
at the weather in your area.

1104
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:32,589
Showers--

1105
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,417
Did you get everything
we wanted today?

1106
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:36,636
Yeah, the Adamson's
are back on track.

1107
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:38,943
Of course, I made
a few suggestions.

1108
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,684
I think you'd approve.

1109
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,903
Well, I'm sure I would.

1110
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:44,949
I have total faith
in you, Cheryl.

1111
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,865
Hey, I'm just
trying to do my job.

1112
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:51,347
Oh, yeah, that locksmith guycalled and left his address.

1113
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:52,435
Said he needs to see you.

1114
01:24:52,565 --> 01:24:54,480
He has something to show you.

1115
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:55,742
Oh, good.

1116
01:24:55,873 --> 01:24:57,396
I never got a
chance to thank him.

1117
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:29,689
ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:
For the past 10 years,

1118
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,127
New Yorkers have
known who to turn to

1119
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:33,693
for the most accurate weather.

1120
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,609
He's the man who has broughtthem events as they were

1121
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,568
happening before they happened.

1122
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:42,311
In fact, it's almost unnaturalhow accurate this man

1123
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:43,660
has been about the weather.

1124
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:46,532
It's made us wonder.

1125
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:48,230
Starting this winter,
he'll be giving

1126
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,667
his heart and soul to
do it for the rest of us

1127
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:52,756
all across the country.

1128
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:56,586
This man is your new,
"Hello, USA" weatherman.

1129
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:59,676
This man is Greg Harrison.

1130
01:25:59,806 --> 01:26:04,028
And he's willing to
do whatever it takes.

1131
