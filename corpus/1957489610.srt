Kate Miller?

32
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,328
That's the fourth quarter right there.

33
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:45,765
So tell me, Kate.

34
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,440
Why do you want to work here?

35
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,809
Well, I thought I could
make a difference and-

36
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,175
- That's great, and so did I.

37
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:55,339
You can't make a difference
in the world without money.

38
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,005
You want to feed the kids in Africa?

39
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:58,242
You're gonna need money.

40
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,061
You want to clean the water in Thailand?

41
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,029
You're gonna need money.

42
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,568
You want to save the South
American three-toed tree frog?

43
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,466
What are you gonna need?

44
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,589
Money?

45
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,722
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

46
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:11,424
That's right, money.

47
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,404
And that's what we do.

48
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,714
Without money, there is no business.

49
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,847
There is no adventure, there
is no making a difference.

50
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:19,088
There's no saving the tree frogs.

51
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,423
Tree frogs are dead, money.

52
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,432
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

53
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,020
You can't make a difference
in the world without money.

54
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:23,933
Money, money.

55
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,685
Shipyards, power plants, steel
factories, medical imaging.

56
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:29,157
Money, money, we're gonna make money.

57
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,844
We are prepared to offer
you a position at this firm.

58
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,493
I'm gonna have to say no.

59
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,746
- No? Did she just say no?
- I really appreciate it

60
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,621
but I just, I can't.

61
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,133
I can't breathe in this coat and-

62
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,181
- I mean, you're exactly
what we're looking for.

63
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,407
I know, I know, and
there are 1000 applicants

64
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,842
who would shave their right arm off

65
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:49,421
for this position, I'm sure.

66
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,781
But it's not me.

67
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:52,137
It's my parents.

68
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:55,216
They want me to be successful
and self-sufficient.

69
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:56,823
See, I'm an actress.

70
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:59,157
And I like drama and comedy.

71
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:01,476
And show tunes.

72
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,453
And these clothes, I cannot breathe in.

73
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:09,537
And if I can't breathe,
then I can't live, can I?

74
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:15,923
Thank you.

75
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,956
Thank you, Mr. Mendelson.

76
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,696
Oh, and good luck with the money.

77
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,535
Well.

78
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,907
That was different.

79
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,908
- You need this more than me.
- Penny.

80
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,265
Could you send up someone
who actually wants the job?

81
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,507
Jo, I'm coming to the fair.

82
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,912

00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:37,913

a burger with us after practice?

91
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:01,965
Oh man, I can't.

92
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,259
I gotta go get Professor Shockworthy

93
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,938
to sign off on all my absences.

94
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,565
Yo, you better have him
sign off on that, Will,

95
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,240
because if you don't, you're
not starting next year.

96
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,190
If you don't start, no NFL.

Literature is the lifeblood of learning.

102
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,410
So I close this course on the Renaissance

103
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,494
with words from the Bard.

104
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,414
Be not afraid of greatness.

105
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,479
Some are born great.

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,557
Some will achieve greatness.

107
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:50,558
And others will have
greatness thrust upon them.

108
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,897
So I say unto you, go forth and flourish.

109
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,690
Class dismissed.

110
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:16,776
Plenty of me to go around, ladies.

111
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,760
Just take a piece and move it on, huh?

112
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,876
Oh, I see, ladies.

113
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:22,098
Oh, it's the volleyball team.

114
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,192
Bring it inside.

115
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,247
Bump, set, spike, guys.

116
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:26,975
Bump it, set it, I'll spike it myself.

117
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,638
Oh, you guys are terrible.

118
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,539
- Call me, Will.
- Professor Shockworthy,

119
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,308
- how you doing?
- Ah.

120
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,472
Mr. William Pepperidge,
the great quarterback.

121
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,534
What brings you by my humble classroom?

122
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,981
Surely not a desire for knowledge.

123
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,853
Nah man, I got all the
knowledge I need right here.

124
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:46,089
I just need you to sign off on my absences

125
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,096
so I can start next season.

126
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:51,436
Do you recall how many
classes you actually attended?

127
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,458
Zero?

128
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,054
Touchdown, exactly.

129
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,581
I didn't even know you were in my class.

130
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:59,938
Listen, all my other
teachers already signed.

131
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,842
I am not other teachers.

132
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,142
You're not gonna make me
go to summer school, are you?

133
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:06,560
I mean, that's...

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,038
Well sadly, I won't be
teaching summer school this year.

135
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,543
But I will be attending the Ye Olde Times

136
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:19,286
Renaissance Pleasure Fair.

137
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,345
You mean one of those places

138
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:24,639
where the dorks sword
fight and wear the tights?

139
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh man.

140
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,293
Yes, tights.

141
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,127
- Tights, so stupid.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,888
Similar to the ones you're wearing now.

143
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,276
That's a good one,
Professor Shockworthy.

144
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,610
I thought so.

145
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,241
Are you really going
to a Renaissance fair?

146
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,242
Yes.

147
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,087
And so are you.

148
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,692
There's no way I'm going to one of those

149
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,156
dork-a-thons with you.

150
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:04,171
My friend is the proprietor
of said dork-a-thon.

151
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,257
And I'm sure she'll be more than happy

152
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:08,002
to give you a job at the fair

153
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:10,203
once I appraise her of your predicament.

154
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,061
I see what you're doing
here, Professor Shockworthy.

155
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:13,431
I'm gonna go to the fair

156
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:14,634
and I'm gonna get a turkey leg

157
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:17,397
and I'm gonna walk around and
I'm gonna grow as a person.

158
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,227
And then I'm gonna understand everything

159
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,563
that you wanted to teach
me and it's gonna be great.

160
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,465
So why don't we just skip all that

161
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,391
and just go ahead and just sign away?

162
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:27,433
That would be nice.

163
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,371
That's not why I'm doing this.

164
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:33,539
I'm asking you to do this
because I like to harass

165
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:36,835
spoiled, dumb little athletes

166
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,214
who get everything handed to them!

167
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,749
So what are we talking
about here, a day?

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,648
Three weeks.

169
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,085
And I'll be there
watching your every step.

170
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,560
Come on, man, please
don't do this to me.

171
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:56,040
Oh no, I didn't do this to you, William.

172
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,255
You did this to yourself.

173
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:01,707
Now you work at the fair and
you play football next season.

174
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,375
Take it or leave it.

175
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,486
I guess I'll take it.

176
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,984
Oh fret not, Mr. Pepperidge.

177
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,994
The fair is a magical place.

178
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,325
You'll love it.

179
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,117
Where else can a
dishwasher become a royal?

180
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,409
Or a librarian become a witch?

181
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,699
People from all walks of
life come to experience

182
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,839
the values of the Renaissance.

183
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:45,993
Huzzah!

184
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,570
Take that!

185
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:03,814
Well, we're gonna have to get you

186
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:04,727
out of those clothes.

187
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:05,894
- Jo!
- Hi, hi!

188
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,664
So glad you made it.

189
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,605
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

190
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,000
Hi, Benny.

191
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,828
You look beautiful, I love that dress.

192
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:14,662
Thank you.

193
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,225
Wait 'til you see the
one I've got for you.

194
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,285
- Yay.
- Come on.

195
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:18,755
I've got to get you ready for the play.

196
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm so happy you're here.

197
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,089
Me too.

198
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,696
So I guess the guys here are pretty hot.

199
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:29,223
- Oh my God.
- Hey, I'm Horny!

200
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,431
That's great, man.

201
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,941
No, that's my name, you big dummy.

202
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,615
Horny, don't be rude.

203
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,093
I'm Jester Roy.

204
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:37,565
And of course, you met Horny.

205
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,479
And welcome!

206
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,479
To the
Renaissance Pleasure Fair.

207
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:46,659
Dude, you can take it
down a notch if you want.

208
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,958
Cool.

209
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,098
I'm gonna be working here

210
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,609
and they told me I have to find a queen.

211
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,092
Ooh, the queen.

212
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,927
Her Royal Highness, Her Majesty.

213
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,812
I shall take you to her.

214
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:01,209
In fact, I shall ride
you like a royal steed.

215
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,210
Tally-ho!

216
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:04,348
Are you serious right now?

217
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,417
He's serious, dude, go.

218
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:07,417
Oh my God.

219
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:10,198
Oh there it is, the queen's castle.

220
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,827
Looks like a dump to me.

221
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,022
Ahoy there, matey.

222
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,273
Giddy up, nave!

223
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:17,798
Hi everybody, look at my new horsey.

224
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,611
He's fuel efficient, very green,

225
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:22,059
and allows us to be less
dependent on foreign oil.

226
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,331
He's like a Prius with hair gel.

227
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:25,165
That's awesome.

228
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,202
Halt, who goes there?

229
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,736
I go here.

230
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,251
And I go bye-bye.

231
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:33,822
Hi, my name's Will Pepperidge.

232
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,163
I was sent here-
This is the young man

233
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:36,616
- I told you about.
- By Professor Shockworthy

234
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,160
to meet a queen.

235
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:39,675
Ah, yes.

236
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,341
The bad student.

237
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,280
We've been expecting thee.

238
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,281
Sweet.

239
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,919
You may approach.

240
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,333
Thank you.

241
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,032
Hi, I'm so glad that you're
a queen and everything

242
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,958
and it's really nice to meet you.

243
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,466
You will address me as Your Majesty.

244
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,467
Seriously?

245
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,362
Yes, Your Majesty.

246
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,258
Now kneel, nave.

247
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,851
Listen ma'am, I just met you.

248
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,470
I don't typically kneel.

249
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,341
Kneel before the queen!

250
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,613
Now I'm definitely gonna do it

251
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,635
'cause that guy yelled at me.

252
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:15,778
Step forward.

253
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,779
Okay.

254
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,654
Now listen to me.

255
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:23,524
Professor Shockworthy told me

256
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:27,354
that you might be a little
unwilling to play along.

257
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,752
So I'm telling you now, kid.

258
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,552
Either you believe in the fair

259
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:33,738
and all the hierarchy within it,

260
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:37,130
or you'll be fired and fail your class.

261
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,314
Got it?

262
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,009
Yeah I got it, thank you.

263
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,352
Well, what a humble peasant.

264
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,947
Indeed.

265
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:49,493
Now, those who work here
are divided into two camps.

266
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:53,609
The upper class, who enjoy
the privileges of nobility,

267
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,610
and the lower class, who perform
the less desirable tasks.

268
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,574
I've assigned you to the lower class,

269
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:04,312
where you will work as a fetch boy.

270
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,955
Sounds like a lot of fun.

271
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:07,502
And at the end of the fair,

272
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,992
we hold the grand finale in which

273
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:12,597
all of the members of the shire perform.

274
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:15,931
And I expect you to participate as well.

275
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:18,698
I'll be there, Your Majesty.

276
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,964
Ah, Your Majesty!

277
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:24,882
Your beauty shines like
that of the summer sun.

278
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:28,590
Oh, such a beauteous visage.

279
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,667
'Tis the stuff of poetry.

280
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,327
Sonnets, literature, such as,

281
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,245
oh, for a muse of fire-

282
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,107
- Yes, yes, yes, Prince Rank.

283
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:43,046
Your excessive compliments
will have to wait.

284
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,191
I'm having an audience
with the new fetch boy.

285
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:51,058
So glad you're here, fetch boy.

286
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,695
I've run out of toilet paper.

287
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:56,386
Now I'll use you to
wipe my buttocks for me.

288
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:57,732
Why don't I just kick those buttocks,

289
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:58,865
how does that sound?

290
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,444
Why don't I kick that boyish face?

291
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,341
Enough!

292
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,676
Guards, take this new
fetch boy to his quarters.

293
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,694
Get him properly attired

294
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:09,925
and confiscate those street clothes.

295
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,979
You're gonna make me wear
one of these coffee filters?

296
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,563
Be gone with you.

297
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:18,077
I'll fix thee.

298
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:21,320
In your dreams, weird guy.

299
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,914
Ramon, I tell you.

300
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:27,142
It's people like that that
make me twirl my mustache.

301
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,143
Si.

302
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,222
We've reached the camp.

303
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,930
Whose underwear is all that?

304
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:37,200
Princess Jeanette.

305
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,077
- Hi Jo, hey.
- Hi, ladies.

306
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:42,425
- This is my cousin, Kate.
- Hi, Kate.

307
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,305
Home sweet home.

308
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:45,306
Oh wow.

309
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,904
Wow, it's so pretty.

310
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,286
I know, right?

311
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,120
Is that my bed?

312
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,259
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

313
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,089
I brought in some things of my own.

314
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh my God.

315
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,851
Tell me that's my dress.

316
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,904
I love it.

317
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,143
I knew you'd love it.

318
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:02,445
I do, I love it.

319
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,696
It's so pretty.

320
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,186
Oh.

321
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,990
Oh God.

322
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,847
You know what this reminds me of?

323
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:11,681
What?

324
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:12,771
When we used to play dress-up

325
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,775
when we were kids in England.

326
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,244
Oh my goodness, yeah.

327
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,673
Don't you miss it there?

328
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,104
What, miserable
weather and rubbish food?

329
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:20,938
No.

330
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,420
And don't even get me started on the men.

331
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:28,789
Well, what happened to
that guy you were seeing?

332
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,417
Oh, is that the time?

333
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:31,977
- Jo?
- Are you hungry?

334
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:33,102
You must be starving.

335
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,440
There's this really good turkey leg stand

336
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,359
- I want to take you to.
- Oh my God.

337
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,908
What?

338
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,125
He's here.

339
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,817
- Forget it.
- He's here, isn't he?

340
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:42,955
Forget about it, I have.

341
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,008
And what about you?

342
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,302
Are you still seeing that guy

343
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,312
that used to play Xbox all the time?

344
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:48,568
No.

345
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,417
He played Xbox all day
and for some reason,

346
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:56,418
I thought he was living some
kind of ironic lifestyle.

347
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,089
That he was smart and sarcastic and dry.

348
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,021
But he was actually just a stupid person.

349
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,021
Great.

350
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,675
I just want to meet
somebody who is exactly

351
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,343
who they seem to be.

352
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,064
No assumptions, just they
tell you who they are

353
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,982
and you can believe it.

354
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,307
Come on, nave.

355
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,403
- Easy.
- Let's go.

356
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:22,011
- Easy, buddy.
- Move it, fetch boy.

357
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,959
What the hell is this place?

358
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,327
- Up the stairs.
- Shouldn't you kids

359
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,387
be playing Dungeons and Dragons?

360
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,043
Go!

361
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,180
You know you're dressed
like a clown, right?

362
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,425
Like a small clown?

363
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:34,454
Get back to the castle.

364
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:36,706
- The queen beckons.
- What's up, man?

365
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,638
Oh, look who it is, everybody.

366
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,994
This is the new fetch boy
I was telling you about.

367
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,964
Fetch boy, everybody.
Everybody, fetch boy.

368
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:46,638
Hey, guys.

369
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,231
I'm not a big fan of fetch boy.

370
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,988
Fetchling? Fetchenburg.

371
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,543
No.

372
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:52,794
Fetchenstein.

373
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:54,858
Will.

374
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,269
Not really close to any of those.

375
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,956
- Will Fetcherson?
- Is he always crazy?

376
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:02,957
Yeah, every single day he's.

377
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,824
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

378
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,653
- I'm Rusty Crockett.
- Nice to meet you, man.

379
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:06,646
You're the fetch boy.

380
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,501
I'm kind of in charge
of you for the summer.

381
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,007
Allow me to officially welcome you

382
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,600
to the peasant world of the green briars,

383
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,101
also known as the lower class.

384
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,570
That sounds great.

385
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:18,988
Rusty Crockett?

386
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,863
Ow!

387
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:22,008
Natalia, is that you?

388
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,959
Oh hi, I never could've guessed.

389
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,717
Long time no see, how was your year off?

390
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,137
Ow, that's my hair!

391
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,881
Why are you cutting my hair?

392
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:32,121
This is for your cheating heart.

393
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:33,604
I don't have a cheating heart.

394
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,447
I have a very nice heart, ask these guys.

395
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,282
I'm a nice-hearted guy, aren't I?

396
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,916
You told us we were special.

397
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,943
You are, you're special.

398
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,471
You're all very special.

399
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:44,054
You will pay for this, Crockett.

400
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,055
What?

401
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,245
You have abused your
gifts, Rusty Crockett.

402
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,187
- Gifts?
- Gifts that have brought you

403
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,511
much pleasure and fame.

404
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:11,436
So in accordance with the
laws of the cosmic womb,

405
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:14,937
I invoke the power of Lilith to curse you.

406
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,996
The very next time you use your manhood,

407
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:23,159
it will separate from you
and fall to the ground

408
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,743
like a lonely twig.

409
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,808
Separate from me?

410
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,819
Like a twig, what does that mean?

411
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,878
I believe it means
the junk in your trunk

412
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,164
shall be defunct.

413
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,434
Can't we negotiate something here?

414
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,220
I mean, other than burning my hair?

415
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,554
It's too late.

416
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,126
Fire, fire!

417
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,343
More fire, more fire!

418
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,125
God.

419
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:51,063
It is done.

420
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,731
Long live the curse!

421
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:55,940
Was that a real curse?

422
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,493
No, no, no, no, not a curse.

423
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:01,327
What was that thing?

424
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,342
- That was hot.
- What the hell was that?

425
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,307
Who are they?

426
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,538
The witches.

427
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,554
They're the witches,
they're bonafide witches.

428
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,241
They live out in the forest.

429
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:14,314
They're not bonafide.

430
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,754
She's just like one of those
goth chicks at the mall.

431
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,791
She did the thing and
the thing and the Lilith

432
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,641
and then the thing is gonna fall.

433
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,264
Your wang is gonna be fine, man.

434
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,582
Says you!

435
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,993
Ooh, ooh, you know what we need to do?

436
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:28,601
We need to get the witch's
book and break the curse.

437
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,307
I've gotta get that book back.

438
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,994
If I get that book back,
there's gotta be some kind of

439
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,818
uncurse thing in the book, right?

440
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,964
We gotta go, come on.

441
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,868
We gotta get the book, you're with me.

442
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,703
There's nothing wrong
with your ding dong, bro.

443
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:44,542
I'm not taking a chance
'cause there is a possibility.

444
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,793
No, they're not bonafide.

445
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,601
- It looks amazing.
- I love it.

446
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:54,347
There's your boyfriend.

447
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,723
Yeah, thanks.

448
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:57,971
I know, I'm sorry.

449
00:20:57,972 --> 00:21:00,041
That's definitely your boyfriend.

450
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,804
That's Carl, he's a creep.

451
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,132
From the beginning of time,

452
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,225
witches have had these kinds of powers.

453
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:06,226
Right.

454
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:09,889
Hi.

455
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:12,149
Hey, Jo.

456
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,870
Crockett.

457
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,747
This is my cousin, Kate.

458
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,371
- Hi.
- It's her first fair.

459
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:20,475
I'm sorry, I'm Crockett.

460
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:22,605
- I'm Kate.
- Hi, Kate.

461
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:24,827
- I'm Will.
- Hi, Kate.

462
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,392
This is the new fetch boy.

463
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,334
Oh, I'm the new fetch girl.

464
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:29,883
We both fetch.

465
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,723
I like your tights.

466
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,959
It's not my tights.

467
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,784
You're wearing another man's tights?

468
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:37,825
No, they're not anyone's tights.

469
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:38,826
Okay.

470
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:40,564
Is that a dog?

471
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:41,452
Hey, buddy.

472
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:42,971
- It's Benny.
- Hey, Benny.

473
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,075
He fetches too.

474
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:45,726
So we were just on our way.

475
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,870
We've got, I just got cursed.

476
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,521
These witches cursed my-

477
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,532
- Weenus.
- My weenus.

478
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,814
My weenus is in danger of falling off.

479
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,118
So we have to go.

480
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,119
- We do.
- Fix the thing.

481
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:00,808
Yeah?

482
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:01,800
Cool, bye.

483
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,800
They're not my tights.

484
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,194
God, I hope his weenus is okay.

485
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,222
Natalia, do you know
where my crystal ball is?

486
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,507
Mm-mm.

487
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:41,841
I think I left it in the van, come on.

488
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,353
The book.

489
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:49,968
Here it is, a curse of the fallen loins.

490
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,710
Rub the freshly spilled urine of a goat

491
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,648
on your loins at midnight.

492
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,107
- It's right there.
- Natalia, wait.

493
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,965
- Go, go.
- I forgot my keys,

494
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,633
I'll be right there.

495
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:11,722
Come on, here they come.

496
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,184
You hold that side, it's-

497
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,970
- Are you familiar
with the term make believe?

498
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:23,369
Dude, we're talking
about my little man here.

499
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,798
It's always been there for me.

500
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,546
I'm not gonna turn my back on it now.

501
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:27,515
Oh, peasants.

502
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,851
Time for your chores.

503
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,879
Hey Rank, how's it going, pal?

504
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,276
Crockett, so sorry to hear about

505
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,438
your potentially fallen phallus.

506
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,944
The whole fair is abuzz
with talk of your ding dong.

507
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:42,060
I thought it only fitting for
you to sell pickles today.

508
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:43,808
Oh, that's good.

509
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:44,642
You get it?

510
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:45,475
Pickles.

511
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,309
'Cause I'm having a curse
thing going on, right?

512
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,530
That's a good one, Rank.

513
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,588
You're so funny.

514
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:50,901
You get it, go on now.

515
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:52,809
Off you go, sell some pickles.

516
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,064
Yes, my liege, of course.

517
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,794
Anon, good luck.

518
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:56,629
Have fun, man.

519
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,462
And now, prepare for loneliness.

520
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,428
Who put you in charge, weird guy?

521
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:04,820
- Weird guy?
- Weird guy.

522
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,992
Weird guy?

523
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,983
I mean, you're obviously
a very weird guy.

524
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:11,959
You will address me
as sir or sire or lord!

525
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,939
Okay, Lord Weird Guy.

526
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,980
Listen to me, I'm a noble
and you are a peasant.

527
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,434
And a lowly one at that.

528
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:22,785
Now, before you do your chores,

529
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:25,165
allow me to introduce to you

530
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,859
my royal legion of allegiance.

531
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:30,586
He maybe short in stature,

532
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:33,170
but he's grandiose in ferocity.

533
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,513
Count Le Petite.

534
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:48,052
Je m'appelle Count Le Petite.

535
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,246
I will cut you where it hurts.

536
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:51,572
Whoa, easy, buddy.

537
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,280
Wonderful, CLP.

538
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:54,355
Wonderful.

539
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:56,256
Like a pearl from the orient.

540
00:24:56,257 --> 00:24:59,032
Like fine china from China.

541
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,348
The fierce warrior, General Tso.

542
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:15,013
And last but certainly not least,

543
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,152
my most trusted ally,

544
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:20,035
the Rosecrantz to my Guildenstern,

545
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:22,826
the Proteus to my Valentine.

546
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,086
The menace from Mexico.

547
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,504
Jamón del diablo.

548
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:35,500
Well done, guys.

549
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,982
Those are great intros.

550
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:38,604
Now, I totally respect you,

551
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,129
respect all of you.

552
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,130
Mock us all you like, but
your future is in my hands.

553
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,980
Okay, man, so what do you want me to do?

554
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,588
I thought you'd come around.

555
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:52,365
Petite, Tso,

556
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:54,193
keep an eye of the peasants.

557
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:55,351
Go on, now.

558
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,758
It's really good to meet you guys.

559
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,358
Maybe we can all go
trick or treating later.

560
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,359
It begins.

561
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:05,993
What?

562
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,137
You want me to go that way?

563
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:08,138
Yes.

564
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,684
Sir, stupid dance.

565
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:14,921
Did you just say something?

566
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,089
I'm listening.

567
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,903
Hey, can you guys hold up for a second?

568
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:22,160
Thanks, just gotta grab the arrows.

569
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:23,626

00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,044
You never told me that being a peasant

616
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,885
could be so much fun.

617
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,438
I know, right?

618
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,616
Very well, my lords and ladies.

619
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:13,410
God speed you on your merry way.

620
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,304
- Bat.
- You're an ape.

621
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:24,825
- The London Bridge!
- You're a monkey.

622
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:30,421
Hey, excuse me.

623
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:31,497
Sweet hellos, ladies.

624
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:33,415
Eiffel Tower!

625
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,750
Really angry?

626
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,855
Beer keg

627
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:40,120
Which way?

628
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:43,853
Yes!

629
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,448
That, my friend, is charades.

630
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:52,164
Get used to it, we play it all summer.

631
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,853
So, how was your first day at the fair?

632
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:56,104
It was terrible.

633
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,928
Why is Rank a prince?

634
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,060
He's part of the Stratford camp.

635
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,548
And last year Stratford
beat us in the Grand Finale

636
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:05,003
and so now they're nobles all summer.

637
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes, we've lost five years in a row.

638
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,029
But if we get our act together,

639
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,115
maybe we can win something this year.

640
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,584
It's tradition for fetch boy

641
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,160
and fetch girl to do something together.

642
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,501
Oh yeah.

643
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:17,236
All we can do is fetch
pretty much, right?

644
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:19,070
Let's try something.

645
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:21,510
Come on!

646
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,344
Oh, yeah.

647
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,676
Come on, fetchy.

648
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:24,892
I like to watch and sit.

649
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:25,726
Come on.

650
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:26,928
Get up here stat.

651
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,152
Let's see what you're made of.

652
00:29:28,153 --> 00:29:29,231
I mean, we've seen what you're made of.

653
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,065
We could get you

654
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:33,065
- some loser tights.
- Shut up, Horny.

655
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:35,484
She is-

656
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:36,890
- Riding a motorcycle.

657
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:37,724
No, it's a horse.

658
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,688
That's a horse.

659
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,333
Oh, she has hit her head
on a low lying branch.

660
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,167
Are you okay?

661
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,664
Elizabethan English only, sir.

662
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,415
Are you'th okay'th?

663
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,404
Dude, that suck'th.

664
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:53,655
Oh, kind sir.

665
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:58,549
I am so grateful for
you coming to my rescue.

666
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,967
My pleasure'th.

667
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:03,691
You have been hit with
a non-talking spell.

668
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:04,559
Kapow.

669
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,298
I've waited for this moment all my life.

670
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:09,750
Now you can finally tell me all those deep

671
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:13,126
dark secrets you've been holding inside.

672
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:13,960
Yes.

673
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:15,054
I hit you with a spell.

674
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:16,777
No talking!

675
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:17,611
Just die.

676
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:18,944
Just fake death.

677
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:22,295
Always a good call.

678
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:26,630
Oh, he's pulled the dagger.

679
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:27,909
Oh.

680
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,243
Dead.

681
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,245
And he's out.

682
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,496
Poison I see.

683
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,769
Hath been, his time has end.

684
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,717
Oh child, drunk all and left no

685
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:41,967
friendly drop to help me after.

686
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,752
I will kiss thy lips.

687
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:45,705
She's pretty good, you know?

688
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:46,970
I know, right?

689
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,771
Yes, she's brilliant.

690
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:50,905
Will is not bad either.

691
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,480
Thy lips are warm.

692
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,795
Ye know'th?

693
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,456
Thy I will be brief.

694
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:58,755
Oh happy dagger, this is thy sheath.

695
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,756
Thy rust and let me die.

696
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,853
Poof.

697
00:31:05,854 --> 00:31:08,020
Will, you are alive again.

698
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:12,731
A kiss will revive her.

699
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:14,587
You want me to actually kiss her?

700
00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:15,421
Kiss her.

701
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:16,470
Like in real life?

702
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:17,343
Just do it!

703
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,846
Put a little tongue into it.

704
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:19,847
Shut up.

705
00:31:21,335 --> 00:31:23,086
Is it okay if I kiss you?

706
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,587
Yeah, it's okay.

707
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,662
And then we take a bow.

708
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:49,527
Bravo.

709
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,409
Bravo, Kate.

710
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:56,100
Your grasp of the
audience is breathtaking.

711
00:31:57,004 --> 00:31:58,904
Stolen my breath.

712
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:00,238
This boy, awful.

713
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:02,534
Excellent job, both of you.

714
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:03,535
Bravo.

715
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,771
But now I think it's
time the fetch boy and I

716
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:09,719
do a little scene of our own at my room.

717
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,519
Jeanette, just stop it.

718
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,968
Stop what, Jo?

719
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:15,269
It's the fetch boy's job to please me.

720
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,765
And I think it's right about that time.

721
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:21,266
So, I'll see you in my room in 10 minutes.

722
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,725
Get off me, I'm fine.

723
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,514
Have that step removed.

724
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,512
Kate, Kate, Ka-ta-ri.

725
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:37,170
Your performance was brilliant.

726
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,271
Your inflection, eloquent.

727
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,855
Not perfect, but some fews are.

728
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,391
Sure is promising.

729
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:47,784
Perhaps I could arrange
for a private tutorial.

730
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:49,868
Just a little one on one.

731
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,775
Easy buddy, don't touch her.

732
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:53,609
No.

733
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,930
That's right, fetch boy.

734
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,207
You have anything to say to me,

735
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,138
go ahead and say it to Jamóns fist.

736
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,017
You're a very creepy guy.

737
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,898
Okay, all right.

738
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:03,919
That's enough.

739
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,218
He was a total cock block.

740
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,314
You rubbed her cheek with your hand.

741
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:10,340
That's a total invasion
of her personal space.

742
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:12,297
I'll invade your personal space.

743
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:14,572
Put those nunchucks away.

744
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,654
You're all right.

745
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,292
No, you may not talk to a member

746
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,347
of the noble class in that tone.

747
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,908
- Oh.
- No, stop it.

748
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,806
- Stop it.
- No.

749
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,130
No, I did not say that.

750
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,300
Oh, I don't.

751
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,134
Stop it.

752
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:30,356
Oh, look at that it's midnight.

753
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:31,359
- Midnight.
- Good night.

754
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,193
You really sound just like that.

755
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,246
Don't let that fetch boy just fetch

756
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:40,168
himself up or he will be in trouble.

757
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,184
Team.

758
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,185
Away.

759
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:49,168
A kiss will revive her?

760
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,825
I didn't see you complaining.

761
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:52,659
What?

762
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,984
I didn't want to embarrass him.

763
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:54,818
You loved it.

764
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,501
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

765
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,942
So what did Jeanette mean

766
00:33:57,943 --> 00:34:00,375
when she said that I had to please her?

767
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:01,661
That was just like drunk talk, right?

768
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:02,567
It was drunk talk,

769
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:04,174
but you do have to please her.

770
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,238
Traditionally, in Renaissance times,

771
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,395
any virgin, anywhere at

772
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,333
anytime had to bed the
king if he so desired.

773
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:11,899
If not the king, then the queen.

774
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,183
But see, as our faire doesn't have

775
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,165
a king and the queen is off-limits.

776
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,118
You are Jeanette's play-thing.

777
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,164
Play-thing?

778
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:20,844
I've never considered myself a play-thing.

779
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:21,678
Okay, let's get

780
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,327
some goat pee to break the curse.

781
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,719
All right, what do you think?

782
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,744
We got to pick one, right?

783
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:28,992
That's a goat, a goat.

784
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,233
That's a sheep.

785
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,573
It is disqualified
if it's a sheep.

786
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,534
It's that one.

787
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,367
We got 10 minutes.

788
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,546
Let's do it.

789
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:38,674
You stay there

790
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:40,998
while I corral this guy towards you.

791
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,957
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

792
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,637
- He's got horns, man.
- Okay, pick him up.

793
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:45,817
How am I supposed to pick him up?

794
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,819
Pick him up and hold him.

795
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,275
We're going to get a nice stream of

796
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:49,916
pee coming out of his wiener right there.

797
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,296
I think, right now, the best

798
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:54,781
thing to do is maybe tickle him

799
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,406
or hug him really strong.

800
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:57,380
Come on, buddy.

801
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,599
Whatever you do, don't pee on my face.

802
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,058
Try to pee down on this area.

803
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:01,059
Oh, gross.

804
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,158
Not in my face.

805
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,992
Yes.

806
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:06,490
Pee on him.

807
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:07,504
That's enough.

808
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,636
Stop peeing.

809
00:35:08,637 --> 00:35:10,197
Oh, my God.

810
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:11,781
It smells terrible.

811
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,203
It worked.

812
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:16,204
Good job.

813
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:24,765
The Renaissance Pleasure
Faire is now officially open.

814
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,062
Open the gates.

815
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,215
The Pleasure Faire!

816
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:03,631
Oh, so close.

817
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,876
That was really close.

818
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:06,710
What?

819
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,543
Don't do anything.

820
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:08,376
I'm not.

821
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,209
I'm just encouraging the kids.

822
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,099
Let the kids have their fun.

823
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,065
It's for kids.

824
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,771
All right, see if you can hit that.

825
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:14,946
Oh, they're close though.

826
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:16,017
I'd never do that.

827
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:16,935
Why would I do that to you?

828
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:17,935
I would never-

829
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:31,785
- Oh boy.

830
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,909
Whoa.

831
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,511
One, two, three.

832
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,013
Master, do you believe in love?

833
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:44,847
Yes.

834
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,163
You do!

835
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,581
My lady, he believes in love.

836
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:53,917
There is no such thing as true love.

837
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:56,928
True love comes and goes with the wind.

838
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,910
If you can't make it in love

839
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:00,447
what chance do I have?

840
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:04,070
Life without love is
like a tree without fruit.

841
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:07,982
Thank you.

842
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:10,284
Enjoy your time at the faire.

843
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:11,641
- Next.
- Hey, man.

844
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,439
That's a sweet hat.

845
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,813
- Hey.
- Hi.

846
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:16,695
What's this all about?

847
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:18,438
Kiss the Wench?

848
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:19,479
No way.

849
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,235
I don't like it that they
call you a wench though.

850
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:22,767
It's good plank work, man.

851
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:23,742
You're doing a great job.

852
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,992
You're really good out there.

853
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,536
Would you stop bothering my customers?

854
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:30,501
- I'm encouraging them.
- You're warm.

855
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:31,621
- Thank you.
- Good work, buddy.

856
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:33,366
- Enjoy the faire.
- First base.

857
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:34,367
Next.

858
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:36,455
So, what do you say after

859
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,123
this whole thing we grab a beer?

860
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,707
Thanks, but no.

861
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,742
Because I thought that

862
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:45,326
last night we really connected.

863
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:47,022
No.

864
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,784
It was a bit of a moment.

865
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:49,618
Remember?

866
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,708
When-
Oh, in the scene.

867
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,314
You kissed me.

868
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:54,093
Yeah, but I was acting.

869
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,492
I thought you were acting
like you were pretty into me.

870
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,183
Sir Rank enters, finally.

871
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:04,559
Oh, walk the plank and kiss the wench.

872
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:07,796
Sounds like a lark.

873
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:08,795
Command.

874
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:09,795
Assistance.

875
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:14,649
- He's acting.
- Gracias, hombre.

876
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,275
Like a swan.

877
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:22,389
Oh, my God.

878
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,723
I hope he falls.

879
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:28,523
As expected, I crossed with ease.

880
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:29,691
Now, my prize.

881
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,878
Mmm.

882
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,879
I'm ready.

883
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:41,334
Lovely.

884
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:42,335
One more.

885
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,921
Bravo.

886
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:45,755
What's that?

887
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,005
Encore, encore.

888
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,275
Shall I, dear?

889
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:54,884
I am a noble.

890
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,950
You shall put me down at once.

891
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:04,201
Put him down immediately.

892
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:13,174
Your Majesty!

893
00:39:13,175 --> 00:39:16,390
Your second day and you've
already made a mockery

894
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,474
of this fair.

895
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,699
But he started it.

896
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,881
To the stocks with you.

897
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,399
Stocks?

898
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,355
He should be beheaded.

899
00:39:25,356 --> 00:39:26,360
Okay, come on.

900
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,950
This is the man I was telling you about.

901
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:29,784
Oh, hey, Kate.

902
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,295
Very bad, mean ogre.

903
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:33,555
What's with the basket and the fruit?

904
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,806
Are we having a picnic today, kids?

905
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,640
One.

906
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,629
- Two.
- Hey come on.

907
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,705
That's not cool.

908
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:40,777
That's not nice.

909
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,023
I love them.

910
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:42,861
Come on, man.

911
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:44,060
They're vegetables, kids.

912
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:45,900
Could you not throw them at me?

913
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:46,734
Oh, no.

914
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:48,683
The kid in the vest has an arm.

915
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:51,022
He's not a kid, he's at least 13.

916
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:51,856
That's great.

917
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:54,307
Thanks, guys.

918
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,635
Go find your parents.

919
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:59,990
Tell them you all need counseling.

920
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:00,824
You enjoyed yourself?

921
00:40:00,824 --> 00:40:01,789
That was fun for you?

922
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,416
Yeah, it was kind of fun.

923
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,429
How about you unlock me now?

924
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,632
How does that sound?

925
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:07,959
Why should I?

926
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,880
Because the only reason
I'm in here is that

927
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,531
I defended your honor in front of Rank.

928
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:13,945
You did and I do appreciate it.

929
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:14,779
He really is a jerk.

930
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,612
He is.

931
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,340
You know who's not a jerk?

932
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:18,436
This guy.

933
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:19,500
So, why don't you unlock

934
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,009
this lock so that I can get out of here?

935
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,916
Mmmm.

936
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:26,345
You are in a rather compromising position.

937
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:27,885
Why, you want to spank me?

938
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:28,752
Don't tempt me.

939
00:40:28,753 --> 00:40:30,671
Your butt is looking
pretty good right now.

940
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,160
I didn't want to be the one who said it.

941
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,659
Okay.

942
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,493
Oh.

943
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,003
How did that feel, bad boy?

944
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,687
That was really good.

945
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,390
Have you been naughtier than that?

946
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,734
Not a lot naughtier but

947
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,178
I've been pretty naughty.

948
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,595
Want a lot more of that,

949
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:46,065
wherever that came from.

950
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,233
Oh, wow, Kate.

951
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:49,889
How about that one, big guy?

952
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,881
Not bad, you really got into that one.

953
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:54,497
Oh, hey, oh my God.

954
00:40:54,498 --> 00:40:55,580
No hands.

955
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,198
No hands?

956
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,281
What is going on?

957
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,197
What are you doing?

958
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:01,676
Good day, master.

959
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:03,097
Was it good for you?

960
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,287
Dude, I'm gonna kick your ass.

961
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:05,583
Don't forget to call me.

962
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:08,001
I'm going to kick your ass.

963
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,061
Dude, I'm going to kill you.

964
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:22,746
♪ Everything, I give it all away ♪

965
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:27,444
♪ Anything I would give for you ♪

966
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:31,859
Oh, that place looks really safe.

967
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:39,435
♪ 'Cause I was meant to love ♪

968
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:41,590
♪ Yeah, I was meant to love you ♪

969
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:42,745
Yeah, my parents wanted me

970
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,592
to study business administration.

971
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,099
They want me to work on Wall Street.

972
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,168
They think the faire is
just a waste of time.

973
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,903
It is a little silly.

974
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:53,061
What do you mean?

975
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,859
It's beautiful.

976
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,381
You're such a loser.

977
00:41:56,382 --> 00:41:57,215
Watch out.

978
00:41:57,216 --> 00:41:58,423
That's my throwing arm.

979
00:41:58,424 --> 00:41:59,424
Oh.

980
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:04,875
Did you always want to
be a football player?

981
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:06,211
Yeah.

982
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:07,608
You know, my dad wanted me

983
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:11,968
to be a classical pianist
like him, but not for me.

984
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,333
Can you play the piano?

985
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,073
My dad made me play every day.

986
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,981
I was playing Bach when I was five.

987
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,095
I always wanted to play catch

988
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:20,934
with my friends on the street.

989
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,136
So what did you do?

990
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:24,043
You just stood up to him?

991
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,883
Pretty much, yeah.

992
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,884
- On the port side.
- Si.

993
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:31,317
No, you're overshooting.

994
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:33,520
I'm okay.

995
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:34,844
Of course I'm all right.

996
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,468
Great, it's Captain Morgan.

997
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:40,002
So sorry to interrupt your sunny soirée.

998
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:44,576
But the fetch boy is needed
to pick up road apples.

999
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:47,017
There's no way I'm
leaving her alone with you

1000
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:48,518
and your mustache.

1001
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:51,767
Well then, I'll just have you fired.

1002
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:52,705
How about that?

1003
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:55,038
I can handle his mustache.

1004
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,647
Fare thee well, fetch boy.

1005
00:42:58,648 --> 00:42:59,906
Tata.

1006
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:01,311
Fare thee not well.

1007
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,738
Fare thee not well.

1008
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,751
Yes, "Fare thee not well".

1009
00:43:04,752 --> 00:43:06,265
Good one.

1010
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:07,914
Darling, Kate.

1011
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:08,890
Please sit.

1012
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:11,307
Join me for a spot of picnic.

1013
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:13,288
Yes.

1014
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:14,538
Gracias, Jamón.

1015
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:17,566
My dear.

1016
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,652
Over the years I've had the fortune

1017
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:23,303
to work with many talented actresses.

1018
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:25,250
Last night when I saw your performance

1019
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,876
for Juliet's death scene,
despite the fact that you were

1020
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:31,210
opposite of giant oaf, I was mesmerized.

1021
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,545
This is why I'm here today.

1022
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:38,876
I would like you to play
Juliet opposite to my Romeo

1023
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,210
at this year's grand finale.

1024
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:45,049
I'm flattered.

1025
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,073
But I'm on the peasants
team, so how would that work?

1026
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:52,842
Surely, we can make an
exception for such an actress.

1027
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:55,176
Such beauty, grace, panache.

1028
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:59,854
I have always wanted to play Juliet.

1029
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:01,272
Haven't we all?

1030
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,910
I perform with the peasant's team,

1031
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,195
so I'm going to have to say no.

1032
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:07,297
All right, then.

1033
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:09,385
Lovely chatting with you.

1034
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:13,512
I thought we made a real connection today.

1035
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:28,487
My hat!

1036
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:31,737
Pick up my hat and place it on my head.

1037
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:35,969
Oh God, that felt great.

1038
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,564
Whoo!

1039
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:39,458
Road apples.

1040
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:42,527
Yeah, I've learned my lesson, professor.

1041
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:45,697
Don't go to class or shovel
poo all day, you are a genius.

1042
00:44:45,698 --> 00:44:47,916
You are a genius, Shockworthy.

1043
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,361
So, isn't the faire
everything you dreamed of?

1044
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:54,134
I do love it and it is
everything I imagined.

1045
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,622
Except for Rank.

1046
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:57,449
I know, right?

1047
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,673
He asked me to play
Juliet in the grand finale.

1048
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:03,044
But Jeanette always plays Juliet.

1049
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,915
And anyway, you're on our team.

1050
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,485
You'll be helping them win.

1051
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,220
I don't see that happening.

1052
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,363
As long as Will is around, anyway.

1053
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:12,052
You are so horny for him.

1054
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:12,886
I'm not.

1055
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:15,014
I saw the way you looked
at him when he kissed you.

1056
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,352
That was acting.

1057
00:45:16,353 --> 00:45:17,969
Well, then you're a really good actor.

1058
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,690
Yeah, I am.

1059
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:20,611
You're amazing.

1060
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:22,680
You're gonna win the Oscar.

1061
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:25,584
Get away from her.

1062
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,275
Hey, hold fire, dragon.

1063
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:31,789
Hey!

1064
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,122
Unhand thy lady.

1065
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,183
Shoo, dragon.

1066
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,345
Me thinks you have been at
the tavern too long today.

1067
00:45:37,346 --> 00:45:38,684
Let go of her.

1068
00:45:38,685 --> 00:45:40,000
Hey!

1069
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,357
Get off, dude.

1070
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:43,291
Let go of her, man.

1071
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:47,948
Stupid dragon.

1072
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,993
That happens, man.

1073
00:45:50,994 --> 00:45:54,494
Mistress, I have slayed thy foul dragon.

1074
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,744
Thank you, kind sir.

1075
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:58,578
No worries.

1076
00:45:58,578 --> 00:45:59,411
Huzzah!

1077
00:45:59,412 --> 00:46:01,393
Huzzah!

1078
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:02,237
Get him!

1079
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,723
Get him!

1080
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:17,374
Ye old Miller time.

1081
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,902
So, Will, did you satisfy tradition

1082
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,302
and please Jeanette?

1083
00:46:22,303 --> 00:46:25,036
Not a big fan of your
creepy little tradition.

1084
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:27,036
Better honor it or
you're going to get fired.

1085
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:28,270
Why don't you just do it, man?

1086
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:29,827
Why don't you do it for me?

1087
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,844
It's your job.

1088
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:32,419
I mean you are the fetch boy.

1089
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,934
Do you think she'd really have me fired?

1090
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:38,937
I'd rather set you on
fire if it were up to me.

1091
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:39,777
Hey.

1092
00:46:39,778 --> 00:46:42,795
I was just wondering, where is Rank?

1093
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:46,288
Well, off you go to Jeanette's trailer.

1094
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:47,122
All right.

1095
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:49,202
I'll go in that trailer.

1096
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:51,624
But I feel really degraded.

1097
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:54,390
So, Rank, how's the beer?

1098
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:56,510
Thank you for the libation, Horny.

1099
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,344
What?

1100
00:46:57,345 --> 00:46:58,372
- No tip?
- Here's a tip.

1101
00:46:58,373 --> 00:46:59,366
Ditch the doofus.

1102
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:01,133
You are alike.

1103
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,273
Kind of attached.

1104
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,897
Kind of attached.

1105
00:47:04,898 --> 00:47:05,973
Love it.

1106
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:15,187
Who is it?

1107
00:47:15,188 --> 00:47:16,287
It's Will.

1108
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:18,205
I'm here to please you.

1109
00:47:19,132 --> 00:47:20,299
Come hither.

1110
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,618
Hither.

1111
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,695
I thought you'd never show up.

1112
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:30,064
Listen, I don't know about
this whole tradition thing.

1113
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:31,232
Not a big fan.

1114
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Okay.

1115
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,791
What is going down?

1116
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,592
Whoa.

1117
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:46,260
You know what to do with this.

1118
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:51,323
You want me to polish your nails?

1119
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:52,157
Don't worry.

1120
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:53,240
I don't bite.

1121
00:47:57,618 --> 00:47:58,779
Want me to
start with the big toe?

1122
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,030
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1123
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:04,644
Really?

1124
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:05,478
Oh, yeah.

1125
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:06,573
Say I'm a pretty princess.

1126
00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:07,999
You're a pretty princess.

1127
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,833
Oh yeah.

1128
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,361
This one went to market.

1129
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:11,481
This one.

1130
00:48:11,482 --> 00:48:14,172
- That one had roast beef.
- Oh yeah, he did.

1131
00:48:14,173 --> 00:48:15,316
This one went all the way home.

1132
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:16,150
He did.

1133
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:18,146
He went all the way home.

1134
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:19,654
All the way home.

1135
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,721
I know there's something going on

1136
00:48:20,722 --> 00:48:22,920
with you and Crockett.

1137
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:23,879
Crockett.

1138
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,889
How long have you guys known each other?

1139
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,473
Well, it was our first faire.

1140
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:35,488
We performed in the grand
finale together and won.

1141
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:36,739
It was amazing.

1142
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:40,773
We got to be nobles the following year.

1143
00:48:40,774 --> 00:48:43,607
- But it didn't work out.
- Why not?

1144
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:46,348
Well, let's just say it was

1145
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:48,682
undone by certain tradition.

1146
00:48:49,988 --> 00:48:51,302
Jeanette?

1147
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,731
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

1148
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:53,565
She's a cow.

1149
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:56,373
Must have every man she sets her eyes on-

1150
00:48:56,374 --> 00:49:00,124
Crockett just wasn't
strong enough to say no.

1151
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,826
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

1152
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:07,351
Oh yeah!

1153
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,090
Okay.

1154
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:21,752
Jesus.

1155
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,792
Horny, what are you doing?

1156
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:30,100
- Smoking a cigarette.
- No, no.

1157
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:33,536
All the doctors say that
smoking is bad for you, Horny.

1158
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,325
We must extinguish this immediately.

1159
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,210
Oh.

1160
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,351
See, it says right here.

1161
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:43,846
The curse of the fallen loins.

1162
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:44,886
There's actually a picture.

1163
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:45,720
I know.

1164
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:46,727
It's disgusting, right?

1165
00:49:46,728 --> 00:49:47,725
Look what it says.

1166
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:48,877
Goat urine does work but it could

1167
00:49:48,878 --> 00:49:51,179
take up to six to eight
week to take effect.

1168
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,339
"Could" is not a good word.

1169
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,784
"Could" is a bummer.

1170
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:56,043
Oh, I got it.

1171
00:49:56,044 --> 00:49:57,749
I got the perfect solution.

1172
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,097
I'll be right back.

1173
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:01,931
So maybe, does that mean I am no longer-

1174
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,062
- Here, put this on.

1175
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:05,090
What is it, Horny?

1176
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:08,275
It's a chastity belt from the chicks.

1177
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,939
I don't think that
will work at all, Horny.

1178
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,689
Six to eight weeks will
fly by with this thing.

1179
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,754
Yeah, especially when you
have metal on your wiener.

1180
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:16,934
Good job, Horny.

1181
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:18,926
Give me a hug, buddy.

1182
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:21,609
They're not real witches.

1183
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,068
Are you a real witch?

1184
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,094
Yes.

1185
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:26,222
So, make my sister disappear.

1186
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:31,223
Magic powers of the air with
the spell make her disappear.

1187
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,163
Mom!

1188
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,498
Can I come out now?

1189
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,026
All right, come on out.

1190
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:48,860
Thanks.

1191
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,693
Good girl.

1192
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:50,700
Hear ye, hear ye.

1193
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:54,012
The joust tournament is about to begin.

1194
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:55,641
Two tickets to the
joust, right here, come on.

1195
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:56,690
Two tickets to the joust.

1196
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:57,726
You want two tickets to the joust?

1197
00:50:57,727 --> 00:50:58,566
Hey you, you!

1198
00:50:58,566 --> 00:50:59,399
Come here.

1199
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:00,232
- Who me?
- Or me?

1200
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:01,065
Both of you.

1201
00:51:01,065 --> 00:51:01,898
Come here.

1202
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:02,731
Two tickets to the joust.

1203
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:04,131
I'll give you 100.

1204
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:04,965
Sold.

1205
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:05,798
Let's go.

1206
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:06,631
Yay!

1207
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,464
I win.

1208
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,297
100.

1209
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:09,130
As agreed upon.

1210
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:10,713
Come on, come on.

1211
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:14,206
What the hell is this?

1212
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:16,488
That is 100 magic beans-

1213
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,054
- As agreed upon.

1214
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:41,606
Welcome oh gentles to
the tournament of knights.

1215
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:12,023
Turkey legs.

1216
00:52:12,024 --> 00:52:13,347
Turkey legs.

1217
00:52:13,348 --> 00:52:15,485
They're kind of warm.

1218
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:17,319
They're not super bad.

1219
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,985
Want that?

1220
00:52:19,986 --> 00:52:21,406
That's a smart move right there.

1221
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:22,407
Smart lady.

1222
00:52:23,756 --> 00:52:25,171
Yeah.

1223
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:26,026
Turkey legs.

1224
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:26,859
Oh!

1225
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,381
Turkey legs, I love turkey legs.

1226
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:29,215
Oh, Crockett.

1227
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:30,048
What's up, man?

1228
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:30,881
What's going on?

1229
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:31,775
Can I sit down?

1230
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:32,608
Yeah, it's the joust.

1231
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:34,018
Good start.

1232
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:36,426
Rest your turkey legs.

1233
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:38,450
Knights, to your rings.

1234
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:55,165
Knights at the ready!

1235
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,598
Charge!

1236
00:53:06,352 --> 00:53:07,820
Ah!

1237
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:10,321
He's cut his head clean off.

1238
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:15,804
I am, how you say, okay.

1239
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:19,795
Ah!

1240
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:33,636
No man can best me.

1241
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:35,804
- I'm unstoppable.
- Please.

1242
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:38,655
What a medieval jerk.

1243
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,006
All the time jerks.

1244
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:42,303
I am all that is power.

1245
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,637
All that is man.

1246
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:46,367
I am virile.

1247
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:49,308
I will impregnate all of you.

1248
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:52,957
That's right, even the men.

1249
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,348
I can't take this anymore, man.

1250
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:56,234
It's going down.

1251
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:57,870
Hey, Rank.

1252
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,006
Yes?

1253
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:01,374
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

1254
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,375
Like me.

1255
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,057
What's he doing?

1256
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:07,141
Oh, so sorry, kind sir.

1257
00:54:07,993 --> 00:54:08,993
Alas.

1258
00:54:08,994 --> 00:54:11,892
We're not accepting
challenges at this time.

1259
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:13,180
Thank you though.

1260
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:14,399
Very flattered.

1261
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,702
We can't do it though.

1262
00:54:15,703 --> 00:54:16,832
But thank you.

1263
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,620
What's the matter, Rank?

1264
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:19,621
Chicken!

1265
00:54:23,816 --> 00:54:25,066
Yes, chicken.

1266
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:28,162
Alas, the Pleasure Faire doesn't

1267
00:54:28,163 --> 00:54:31,992
carry insurance for this sort of thing.

1268
00:54:31,993 --> 00:54:33,455
Not really my call.

1269
00:54:33,456 --> 00:54:34,289
I'd love to.

1270
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:35,122
Really I would.

1271
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:35,955
But I can't.

1272
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:36,788
I'd love to.

1273
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:37,621
But I can't.

1274
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,591
Let them joust!

1275
00:54:38,592 --> 00:54:46,592
Let them joust!

1276
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:57,684
I will vanquish thee.

1277
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:07,969
So, can I ask you a
kind of a stupid question?

1278
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,803
Yeah, totally.

1279
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,898
You ever jousted before?

1280
00:55:10,899 --> 00:55:12,232
No, I haven't.

1281
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:17,625
Take this moment to say goodbye forever.

1282
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:20,760
Are you ready?

1283
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:22,188
I'm going to be fine, man.

1284
00:55:22,189 --> 00:55:23,922
I got chest plates.

1285
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:25,387
The horse is just like a car.

1286
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,383
A big hairy car.

1287
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:28,384
Roll over.

1288
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:32,876
- Yes, all right.
- Here's your helmet.

1289
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:34,455
You want to put that on.

1290
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,535
Squire, get me his lance.

1291
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:37,369
Yeah, that one.

1292
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,855
You want to put that face thing down.

1293
00:55:39,856 --> 00:55:41,939
How do I make it walk?

1294
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,741
Grab him and kick in the
ass, you just go that way.

1295
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,596
- That way.
- Come on, baby.

1296
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:52,251
Make sure Kate is watching, bro.

1297
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,893
Dead man riding.

1298
00:55:57,581 --> 00:55:59,445
Prepare to be lanced.

1299
00:55:59,446 --> 00:56:00,481
A lot.

1300
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,719
Ah.

1301
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,667
It's a pretty good joke.

1302
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:04,751
For an idiot.

1303
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:11,017
You're the idiot.

1304
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:12,761
You're an idiot.

1305
00:56:12,762 --> 00:56:14,175
They're both idiots.

1306
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,094
Fetch boy, to your ring.

1307
00:56:16,095 --> 00:56:17,845
Knight, to your ring.

1308
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:23,970
Is jousting a skill that
can come naturally to people?

1309
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:26,473
No, it takes years.

1310
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:28,646
Knights at the ready.

1311
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:29,647
Charge!

1312
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:47,483
His stick is broken.

1313
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:49,057
That means he lost, right?

1314
00:56:49,058 --> 00:56:50,954
He needs that.

1315
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:52,496
He's still on the horse.

1316
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:54,080
So technically, no.

1317
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:58,113
Will, get off the horse.

1318
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,970
Fall off the horse.

1319
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:01,849
I can't do that, Kate.

1320
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,732
I don't know how.

1321
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:21,805
I am victorious, yet again.

1322
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,958
Ha!

1323
00:57:22,959 --> 00:57:24,089
He's not moving.

1324
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:28,417
Kate, my darling.

1325
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:30,743
Come mount this noble steed, then me.

1326
00:57:30,744 --> 00:57:32,175
Where are you going?

1327
00:57:32,176 --> 00:57:33,009
Will?

1328
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:33,842
Will?

1329
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:35,479
Are you okay?

1330
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,446
Did I win?

1331
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:37,416
No.

1332
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:39,197
You came in second.

1333
00:57:39,198 --> 00:57:40,873
Did I look cool?

1334
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,304
What is wrong with you?

1335
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:43,715
I just got so fired up.

1336
00:57:43,716 --> 00:57:45,726
You could've been killed.

1337
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,310
You look amazing.

1338
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:49,904
You're an ass.

1339
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:51,988
You're an angel.

1340
00:57:53,465 --> 00:57:54,298
Here you go.

1341
00:57:54,299 --> 00:57:55,805
Nice cup of tea.

1342
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,011
That really was the stupidest

1343
00:57:57,012 --> 00:57:58,088
thing I've ever seen in my life.

1344
00:57:58,089 --> 00:57:59,494
Congratulations.

1345
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:00,912
So, tell me, how are you feeling there,

1346
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,462
you big brave knight?

1347
00:58:02,463 --> 00:58:03,966
Can't believe I lost to that guy.

1348
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:04,800
Yeah.

1349
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:07,898
You want to bring him
down, you beat him at

1350
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:09,316
the grand finale.

1351
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:12,292
If you guys haven't noticed yet,

1352
00:58:12,293 --> 00:58:13,813
I'm not much of an actor.

1353
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:15,666
I'm not much of a jouster.

1354
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,748
Not a lot of I can bring to the table.

1355
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:19,243
Stop being such a big baby.

1356
00:58:19,244 --> 00:58:20,077
We can do it.

1357
00:58:20,077 --> 00:58:20,973
I am not a baby.

1358
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:22,019
You're a little bit of a baby.

1359
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,020
I'm not a baby.

1360
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,495
Look at him.

1361
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:38,213
What is he wearing?

1362
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:42,370
He's like some kind of
big, dumb, giant baby.

1363
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,002
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

1364
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:46,057
We're in the middle of a show.

1365
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:47,058
Hey, guys.

1366
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:49,980
What's going down?

1367
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:51,162
What's going on?

1368
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:52,590
Just having some breakfast.

1369
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:54,098
You're wearing a bonnet.

1370
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:55,758
I'm not wearing a bonnet, bro.

1371
00:58:55,759 --> 00:58:57,351
It's a little hat.

1372
00:58:57,352 --> 00:58:58,757
Just a little hat.

1373
00:58:58,758 --> 00:59:00,065
What's with the bib?

1374
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:00,944
This?

1375
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:01,998
This is not a bib.

1376
00:59:01,999 --> 00:59:03,175
It's like a tiny shirt.

1377
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:04,836
Nope, that's clearly a bib.

1378
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:05,670
It's not a bib.

1379
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,670
Fetch boy?

1380
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,746
I said, "fetch boy".

1381
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,849
Oh, she must be talking to you.

1382
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,106
Fetch boy.

1383
00:59:14,107 --> 00:59:15,175
Yes, your Majesty.

1384
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:18,314
There seems to be some mud in my path.

1385
00:59:18,315 --> 00:59:21,647
Would you be so kind
as to help me with it?

1386
00:59:21,648 --> 00:59:23,463
Ah that is a bummer, your Majesty,

1387
00:59:23,464 --> 00:59:25,381
because I don't have a jacket,

1388
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:27,610
so I can't be super chivalrous.

1389
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:28,687
You'll do.

1390
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:30,014
I will do.

1391
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:31,564
What do you mean by that?

1392
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,398
I said, you will do.

1393
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:36,806
You want me to lay in that mud for you?

1394
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:37,807
Yes.

1395
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:39,882
Right now?

1396
00:59:39,882 --> 00:59:40,882
Now.

1397
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:49,282
- You want me to-
- Yes.

1398
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:51,200
Totally hurt himself.

1399
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,344
He's got a coat.

1400
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,979
Happy birthday to me.

1401
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,397
Always remember that faire comes first.

1402
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,313
Well done, fetch boy.

1403
01:00:14,253 --> 01:00:16,130
Can't say no to the queen.

1404
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:19,131
Who's calling the blade now?

1405
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:23,465
Such a psycho.

1406
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:33,219
Little bastard.

1407
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,377
What's the point of that?

1408
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:36,718
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

1409
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:44,216
♪ Everybody dance now ♪

1410
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:50,061
Check this guy out.

1411
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,362
♪ Everybody dance now ♪

1412
01:00:57,465 --> 01:00:58,922
Later, fetch boy.

1413
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:00,525
♪ Give me the music ♪

1414
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:02,503
Where are your friends now?

1415
01:01:04,936 --> 01:01:06,614
Hey!

1416
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:08,216
It is enough.

1417
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:09,329
Sorry, your Majesty.

1418
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,330
Of course.

1419
01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:13,212
Now, come along.

1420
01:01:16,217 --> 01:01:17,967
We should help him.

1421
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,328
Oh, my God, Will.

1422
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:22,862
It's so cold.

1423
01:01:22,863 --> 01:01:24,692
Do you have any idea
how many people would kill

1424
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:26,198
to be stepped on by the queen?

1425
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:27,574
None?

1426
01:01:27,575 --> 01:01:28,913
No, lots.

1427
01:01:28,914 --> 01:01:30,402
Seriously.

1428
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:31,807
Dude, are you all right?

1429
01:01:31,808 --> 01:01:33,788
There's stuff all over.

1430
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:35,351
By the way, bro, that Rank dude,

1431
01:01:35,352 --> 01:01:36,943
he's going down, man.

1432
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:37,902
What we need to do

1433
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,226
is kick his ass in the grand finale.

1434
01:01:39,227 --> 01:01:41,165
Dude, I'm so down to kick his ass, bro.

1435
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,543
You and Kate have to get together

1436
01:01:42,544 --> 01:01:45,405
some kind of really good scene.

1437
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:46,239
Okay.

1438
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,131
He danced on me.

1439
01:01:48,132 --> 01:01:48,965
Okay.

1440
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:50,969
We should probably work

1441
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,676
on what we're going to
do for the grand finale.

1442
01:01:52,677 --> 01:01:53,510
Totally.

1443
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,343
I can act.

1444
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,550
What can you do?

1445
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:58,718
I can throw a football insanely far.

1446
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:00,923
Great.

1447
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:05,184
I can also ask where a
bathroom is in Spanish.

1448
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,554
And then they point.

1449
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:10,311
I don't think that's going to help us.

1450
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:12,640
Oh I shall no longer be a Montague.

1451
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:13,803
Capulet!

1452
01:02:13,804 --> 01:02:16,238
The line is Capulet.

1453
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:18,760
Blast, this is just not working.

1454
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:21,416
I'm not feeling it, darling.

1455
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:22,250
Why?

1456
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,083
Whatever is wrong?

1457
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:25,081
This new fetch girl, Kate,

1458
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:27,546
poses an actual threat to our dynasty.

1459
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:30,989
Her talent alone could dethrone us.

1460
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,573
We must step it up.

1461
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:35,759
I can step it up!

1462
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,418
Well, step's is the only thing you need.

1463
01:02:40,653 --> 01:02:43,882
Why must you drown yourself
in the bottles of liquor?

1464
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:46,927
Drown yourself in the prose
of William Shakespeare.

1465
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:48,407
Like I have.

1466
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:50,842
Are you implying that I
have a drinking problem?

1467
01:02:50,843 --> 01:02:51,736
I'm telling you.

1468
01:02:51,737 --> 01:02:54,295
You have a drinking problem.

1469
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:04,669
This brings back memories, huh?

1470
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,852
What happened to us, Crockett?

1471
01:03:06,853 --> 01:03:08,599
I made a mistake.

1472
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,683
I screwed up.

1473
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,946
Did I ever tell you I was sorry?

1474
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:14,364
No, you didn't.

1475
01:03:18,163 --> 01:03:20,602
Allow me to take this moment, my lady.

1476
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:22,103
I am so sorry, Jo.

1477
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:27,062
Maybe it's not too late.

1478
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,118
What are you wearing?

1479
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:42,005
What is that?

1480
01:03:42,006 --> 01:03:43,818
Chastity belt.

1481
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:44,959
For the curse?

1482
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,272
Yeah, the curse.

1483
01:03:46,273 --> 01:03:48,141
Why don't you just reverse it?

1484
01:03:48,142 --> 01:03:50,138
You know, to undo a curse all you have

1485
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:52,096
to do is do it in reverse.

1486
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:53,236
Reverse the curse?

1487
01:03:53,237 --> 01:03:55,509
Everybody knows that.

1488
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,656
That's a great idea.

1489
01:03:57,657 --> 01:03:59,084
Why are we going to the witch's?

1490
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,471
The foolproof method to reverse

1491
01:04:00,472 --> 01:04:02,605
the curse is to burn a lock of hair

1492
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:07,523
from the witch that cursed me
and blow it back in her face.

1493
01:04:08,691 --> 01:04:10,312
- Really?
- Yes.

1494
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,349
I thought you said it was

1495
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,791
to have goat pee on you.

1496
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,375
I made a mistake.

1497
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:18,629
This is it.

1498
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:19,629
Let's go.

1499
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:26,667
Come on.

1500
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:29,912
See?

1501
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:36,863
Ah, there were strippers
in the renaissance.

1502
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:37,968
They're not strippers, they're witches.

1503
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:39,589
Bona fide witches.

1504
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:42,090
They're bona fide strippers.

1505
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:44,700
Give me my scissors.

1506
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:47,873
I have to get a lock of her
hair to reverse the curse.

1507
01:04:47,874 --> 01:04:49,529
- If they're real witches-
- I'm a little scared anyway.

1508
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:50,393
You shouldn't be at all.

1509
01:04:50,394 --> 01:04:53,056
What if they turn me into, like, a pig?

1510
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,674
Yeah, what if they
turn you into like a pig?

1511
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:57,905
Like they do all this
crazy portions stuff.

1512
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,461
Dude, what are you doing?

1513
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:03,541
Can I help you with something?

1514
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,957
We were looking for-

1515
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:06,791
- A Frisbee.

1516
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:09,531
We dropped a Frisbee.

1517
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:14,115
You have a totally great
fire, and we thought we would-

1518
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:20,127
This is a great opportunity
to maybe mend our friendship.

1519
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:22,436
And we could hug, as they say-

1520
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:24,308
- Hug it out.
- It out.

1521
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:25,309
So.

1522
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:29,528
Maybe.

1523
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:33,637
Oh, great.

1524
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,389
A hug.

1525
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:42,609
Crocket.

1526
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:45,941
Drop it.

1527
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,875
You love me.

1528
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,778
Perhaps you'd like to join us.

1529
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,938
How did you do that with one hand?

1530
01:05:50,939 --> 01:05:51,955
A little help, please.

1531
01:05:51,956 --> 01:05:54,237
What do you want me to do, man?

1532
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:55,732
Hi, BFF.

1533
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:57,961
Now is the time to come help your buddy.

1534
01:05:57,962 --> 01:05:59,611
I still gotta find the Frisbee.

1535
01:05:59,612 --> 01:06:00,445
Help!

1536
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:02,308
I think the Frisbee is over here, bro.

1537
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:03,309
Have fun.

1538
01:06:04,776 --> 01:06:07,150
Are you ready to test the curse?

1539
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:09,291
I'm not really.

1540
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:13,005
What the hell is this?

1541
01:06:13,006 --> 01:06:14,839
- Oh!
- It's protection?

1542
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:19,796
This is not going to stop us.

1543
01:06:19,797 --> 01:06:21,488
Take your best shot.

1544
01:06:31,832 --> 01:06:32,915
Let's rock.

1545
01:06:57,002 --> 01:06:58,384
Oh, there you are.

1546
01:06:58,385 --> 01:06:59,543
Hey.

1547
01:06:59,544 --> 01:07:00,688
I've been looking for you.

1548
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:02,090
Where have you been?

1549
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:03,539
I've been looking for you.

1550
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,696
I want you to get your sexy

1551
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:06,643
butt in my trailer, right now!

1552
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:08,368
Enough of the horse thing.

1553
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,202
I'm ready.

1554
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:10,035
I want you.

1555
01:07:10,036 --> 01:07:11,093
And I want you now.

1556
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,203
You keep that emotion going.

1557
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:13,907
I'm gonna go slip into
something more comfortable,

1558
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:16,815
put on my nice shoes, and come right back.

1559
01:07:18,293 --> 01:07:19,126
Just get nice and relaxed.

1560
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:21,052
Have a couple sips.

1561
01:07:21,053 --> 01:07:22,435
And I'll be back.

1562
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:25,043
Okay, don't you keep
your princess waiting.

1563
01:07:25,044 --> 01:07:26,044
Roy.

1564
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,711
Roy, wake up.

1565
01:07:32,794 --> 01:07:34,707
Roy, what's up, man?

1566
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:35,810
Roy is asleep.

1567
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:37,050
I need your help with Jeanette.

1568
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:39,210
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

1569
01:07:39,211 --> 01:07:40,211
Roy!

1570
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:42,652
What is it?

1571
01:07:42,653 --> 01:07:45,841
We got a date with Jeanette.

1572
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:46,675
Oh!

1573
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,327
Let's go.

1574
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:49,161
Here we go.

1575
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:49,994
Come on.

1576
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:50,827
Wakey, wakey, time to get nakey.

1577
01:07:50,828 --> 01:07:52,611
- Wake up, buddy.
- Oh, okay.

1578
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:56,995
So, you're gonna go in
there and pretend you're me.

1579
01:07:56,996 --> 01:07:59,793
And she's going to ask you to
do some really crazy stuff.

1580
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:00,860
Oh, kinky.

1581
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:01,747
I like it.

1582
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,196
Just treat her like a princess.

1583
01:08:03,197 --> 01:08:04,776
That's what she's all about.

1584
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:05,610
Got it.

1585
01:08:05,611 --> 01:08:08,441
And your name is Will.

1586
01:08:14,664 --> 01:08:15,664
Fetch boy.

1587
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,013
Brush.

1588
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:29,755
Beautiful.

1589
01:08:30,595 --> 01:08:31,595
Handsome.

1590
01:08:32,496 --> 01:08:33,496
Intelligent.

1591
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:35,868
Brush.

1592
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:36,977
Jamón.

1593
01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:38,170
Brush.

1594
01:08:38,171 --> 01:08:41,466
Brush every sun-kissed golden follicle.

1595
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:45,369
Looking glass.

1596
01:08:46,442 --> 01:08:47,479
Hello.

1597
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,313
Sunshine.

1598
01:08:48,313 --> 01:08:49,146
Haha.

1599
01:08:49,147 --> 01:08:50,432
Away with it.

1600
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:51,367
Damn it.

1601
01:08:51,368 --> 01:08:53,193
Jeanette is incapable of delivering the

1602
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:56,006
performance we need to assure victory.

1603
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,424
Kate must be my leading lady.

1604
01:08:59,288 --> 01:09:02,703
For without her, we stand
to lose the grand finale.

1605
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,780
And I refuse to be a peasant next season.

1606
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,119
Hello.

1607
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,887
What's going on, Pete?

1608
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:16,721
No, no, no.

1609
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:17,764
Listen, listen.

1610
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:21,044
You press record once so you
only TiVo the one episode.

1611
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:22,790
You gotta press record twice

1612
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,308
and you're going to get a season pass

1613
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:26,222
and you can TiVo every episode.

1614
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:29,057
Yes, that's how it
works in the modern age.

1615
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:31,437
Do not delete over "Gossip Girl", okay?

1616
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:33,273
Do not delete "Gossip Girl."

1617
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:34,906
All right, water my ficus.

1618
01:09:34,907 --> 01:09:35,740
All right.

1619
01:09:35,741 --> 01:09:36,946
I'ma holler at you, B.

1620
01:09:36,947 --> 01:09:38,364
All right, peace.

1621
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:41,733
Where was I?

1622
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,587
There is no other option.

1623
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:45,700
Kate must be my Juliet.

1624
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:48,625
Even if I have to kill to make it happen.

1625
01:09:49,926 --> 01:09:51,706
Oh, Jamón, really?

1626
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:54,874
Maybe not kill, but something killish.

1627
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:13,507
- Hey.
- Hey.

1628
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:16,397
- It's a good looking fire.
- Yeah, it's warm.

1629
01:10:16,398 --> 01:10:18,649
So, where is Benny the dog?

1630
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,017
He's sleeping.

1631
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:23,704
- That's very adorable.
- Yeah, he's cute.

1632
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:26,068
Are you gonna go to the faire tonight?

1633
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:26,922
Isn't it closed?

1634
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,788
It's very dark outside.

1635
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,166
No, it's open for fare opening night.

1636
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,120
It's the moonlight walk.

1637
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:33,954
I'm totally down.

1638
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:34,787
- Do you wanna do it?
- Yeah.

1639
01:10:34,787 --> 01:10:35,620
All right.

1640
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,620
Cool.

1641
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,788
I've never been here at night.

1642
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:41,351
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- It's cool.

1643
01:10:41,352 --> 01:10:42,777
It's kind of dark.

1644
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:43,746
Yeah.

1645
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:45,388
But it's pretty.

1646
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,905
Hey, bobbing for apples, let's do it.

1647
01:10:47,906 --> 01:10:49,070
Do you wanna do it?

1648
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:50,287
Do you wanna do it?

1649
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,503
Can you hold on to this by the way?

1650
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:52,337
What is that?

1651
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:54,089
It's a key to Crockett's chastity belt.

1652
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:54,923
Ew.

1653
01:10:54,923 --> 01:10:55,922
Get it out of my pocket.

1654
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:59,008
It didn't go in the bob bucket.

1655
01:11:02,744 --> 01:11:04,559
Oh, shoot.

1656
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,489
Humiliating.

1657
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,073

1708

- Yes.
- Really?

1709
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,143
Yes.

1710
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:22,143
All right.

01:13:23,703 --> 01:13:25,449
I don't know bar songs though.

1712
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,582
All my songs are written by people

1713
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,524

1720
01:13:45,107 --> 01:13:46,578
That's definitely what we
should do for the grand finale.

1721
01:13:46,579 --> 01:13:50,256
If you can play that well
then I think we should use it.

1722
01:13:50,257 --> 01:13:51,090
Definitely.

1723
01:13:51,091 --> 01:13:52,582

of things this evening.

1751

Yes, we learned
a lot of things, too.

1752
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,870
We learned about bobbing.

1753
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:40,873
That's right.

1754
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:42,188
Bobbing is unsanitary.

1755
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:44,068
I learned about wax hands.

1756
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:45,050
Not so awesome.

1757
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:46,199
Not so great.

1758
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,836
I learned that you are good with pies.

1759
01:14:49,837 --> 01:14:51,262
Not good with pies.

1760
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,020
Just good with getting them on my face.

1761
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,807
You got it all over your face.

1762
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:55,641
I learned about,

1763
01:14:55,642 --> 01:14:57,926
that doing it doesn't always
have to mean doing it.

1764
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:58,760
No.

1765
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,402
You do lots of things.

1766
01:15:00,403 --> 01:15:02,210
- Yeah, so we just did it.
- Yeah.

1767
01:15:02,211 --> 01:15:03,717
We worked that all out.

1768
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,124
This is you, right?

1769
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,123
Yes.

1770
01:15:07,123 --> 01:15:08,097
I had a really good time tonight.

1771
01:15:08,098 --> 01:15:09,214
Yeah, me too.

1772
01:15:09,215 --> 01:15:10,376
And we figured out what we're going

1773
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:11,637
to do for the grand finale.

1774
01:15:11,638 --> 01:15:12,654
We can work on it tomorrow.

1775
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:14,388
We'll just practice tomorrow.

1776
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:16,553
So, tomorrow morning, you
wanna meet at the piano?

1777
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,604
Yeah, that place is
totally empty in the morning.

1778
01:15:18,605 --> 01:15:21,195
So, we'll have use of the piano.

1779
01:15:21,196 --> 01:15:22,029
Okay, cool.

1780
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:22,876
Let's do it tomorrow.

1781
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:24,084

1782
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:25,220

1783
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:26,054

1786
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:28,850

Fare well.

1796
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:05,825
I'd do it to you, too.

1797
01:16:05,826 --> 01:16:06,926

1798
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:09,476

Kookookachu.

1801
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:16,876

1802
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:18,191
Hi, sweet boy.

1803
01:16:18,192 --> 01:16:19,765
How are you, Benny?

1804
01:16:19,766 --> 01:16:21,110
Did you have a good time?

1805
01:16:21,111 --> 01:16:22,267
Are you well rested?

1806
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:24,185
Yes, I had a good time.

1807
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:28,856
Oh.

1808
01:16:28,857 --> 01:16:29,878
Wait, Will.

1809
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:30,879
Will?

1810
01:16:42,455 --> 01:16:46,921
So sorry to see of your
tall friend's infidelity.

1811
01:16:46,922 --> 01:16:47,755
Yeah.

1812
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:48,588
I'm sure you are.

1813
01:16:48,589 --> 01:16:50,227
Can't say I'm surprised though.

1814
01:16:50,228 --> 01:16:52,897
Under the circumstances perhaps you'll

1815
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:56,327
reconsider my previous proposition.

1816
01:16:56,328 --> 01:16:58,443
Oh, what proposition?

1817
01:16:58,444 --> 01:17:02,023
For you to play Juliet
at the grand finale.

1818
01:17:02,024 --> 01:17:03,302
What about Jeanette?

1819
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:07,580
Looks like she has
already found her Romeo.

1820
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,425
Yeah, I'll do it.

1821
01:17:09,426 --> 01:17:10,259
You'll do it?

1822
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,092
Yes, I will do with you.

1823
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:11,947
Yes, of course.

1824
01:17:11,947 --> 01:17:12,943
Why wouldn't you?

1825
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:13,845
Get over here.

1826
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:15,639
- No.
- Don't touch me.

1827
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,473
I won't.

1828
01:17:16,474 --> 01:17:17,506
I do not like men like you.

1829
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,770
I don't either.

1830
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:19,604
Leave.

1831
01:17:19,605 --> 01:17:20,943
I am leaving.

1832
01:17:20,944 --> 01:17:21,777
Do not lurk.

1833
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:22,824
No lurking.

1834
01:17:22,825 --> 01:17:24,243
I'm walking away.

1835
01:17:24,244 --> 01:17:25,549
Walking away.

1836
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,215
Advantage, right.

1837
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:28,530
I told you!

1838
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:30,138
Respect the stache.

1839
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,359
Jerk.

1840
01:17:48,849 --> 01:17:52,266
- Oh, fetch boy.
- Just a fetch boy here.

1841
01:17:53,676 --> 01:17:55,593
Just combing your hair.

1842
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:03,862
Pretty princess.

1843
01:18:05,274 --> 01:18:06,274
Sweet.

1844
01:18:25,474 --> 01:18:26,593
I made it.

1845
01:18:26,594 --> 01:18:27,814
I'm home.

1846
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:28,815
Are you all right, bro?

1847
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:30,576
You?

1848
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:32,836
You left me out there for the witches.

1849
01:18:32,837 --> 01:18:35,307
And they attacked my weenus again

1850
01:18:35,308 --> 01:18:37,518
and again and again with the belt.

1851
01:18:37,519 --> 01:18:39,414
Listen to that, it held up.

1852
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,388
Chastity belt.

1853
01:18:40,389 --> 01:18:41,521
It worked.

1854
01:18:41,522 --> 01:18:43,166
Can't beat steel, brother.

1855
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,000
Yeah.

1856
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,886
Where are you going?

1857
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:45,719
It's early.

1858
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,831
I gotta meet Kate and finish that song.

1859
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:49,653
Grand finale.

1860
01:18:49,654 --> 01:18:51,838
The finale is today.

1861
01:18:51,839 --> 01:18:55,201
I've got to, I've gotta find Jo.

1862
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:56,673
We gotta win.

1863
01:18:56,674 --> 01:18:57,674
Jo!

1864
01:19:03,934 --> 01:19:06,017
I'm really sorry, babe.

1865
01:19:26,168 --> 01:19:29,878
Jo, I need to tell you something.

1866
01:19:29,879 --> 01:19:31,100
What?

1867
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,212
I did something kind of bad.

1868
01:19:33,213 --> 01:19:34,796
What?

1869
01:19:34,797 --> 01:19:38,544
Well, last night when I
saw Will go into the trailer

1870
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:42,612
and I saw everything that
happened, and then, you know,

1871
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:44,104
Rank showed up.

1872
01:19:44,105 --> 01:19:47,688
I told him that I would
be Juliet with him.

1873
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:51,825
With the nobles?

1874
01:19:51,826 --> 01:19:53,171
I'm really sorry.

1875
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:54,005
I'm sorry.

1876
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:55,074
I just,

1877
01:19:55,075 --> 01:19:58,527
I just want to get back at Will so much.

1878
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:01,195
He really hurt you, didn't he?

1879
01:20:04,603 --> 01:20:05,436
I'm really sorry.

1880
01:20:05,436 --> 01:20:06,269
I don't have to do it.

1881
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,686
I can just leave.

1882
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:10,138
Come on.

1883
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:13,599
You've always wanted to play this role.

1884
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,602
You're going to be a beautiful Juliet.

1885
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:17,948
It's fine.

1886
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:20,199
Jamon, I'm so excited.

1887
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,887
Here, grab this for me, won't you?

1888
01:20:21,888 --> 01:20:23,415
Won't be needing this.

1889
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:24,249
Now!

1890
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,628
Have you delivered Kate's
Juliet costume to her tent?

1891
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:28,462
Si.

1892
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:30,514
Good boy, Jamón, good boy.

1893
01:20:30,515 --> 01:20:32,015
Now, just in case,

1894
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:34,242
I have a plan B.

1895
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:37,969
Si!

1896
01:20:37,969 --> 01:20:38,802
No, Jamón!

1897
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:39,814
Plan B.

1898
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,399
- Si.
- B.

1899
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,258
Can you even say "B"?

1900
01:20:44,259 --> 01:20:45,259
Si.

1901
01:20:46,283 --> 01:20:47,414
You're going to be a good boy?

1902
01:20:47,415 --> 01:20:48,914
How are you feeling, honey?

1903
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:49,938
Nervous.

1904
01:20:49,939 --> 01:20:51,731
Really nervous.

1905
01:20:51,732 --> 01:20:53,519
Well, you look amazing.

1906
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,353
Okay.

1907
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:55,263
You're gonna be great.

1908
01:20:55,263 --> 01:20:56,096
Okay.

1909
01:20:56,097 --> 01:20:57,731
Rank is actually a pretty
good actor, you know?

1910
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:59,048
That's what I'm told.

1911
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:12,183
Hey, Jo!

1912
01:21:12,184 --> 01:21:14,259
I can't find Kate.

1913
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,012
You sound surprised.

1914
01:21:16,013 --> 01:21:17,549
That's because I am surprised, Jo,

1915
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:20,939
because I was supposed to
meet her to work on our song.

1916
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,669
Never showed up.

1917
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:25,082
She doesn't wanna see you, Will.

1918
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,329
Why doesn't she wanna see me?

1919
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,709
Chop the dumb act.

1920
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,777
Not an act.

1921
01:21:30,778 --> 01:21:32,092
Kind of dumb.

1922
01:21:32,093 --> 01:21:33,217
Yeah, you are.

1923
01:21:33,218 --> 01:21:35,455
We all know about you and Jeanette.

1924
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:37,762
Me and Jeanette?

1925
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:40,846
Oh, she thought that was me in the...

1926
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,633
I gotta go.

1927
01:21:43,634 --> 01:21:44,634
Jeanette!

1928
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:49,735
May I be bold enough to say
I find you irresistible.

1929
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,734
You do?

1930
01:21:52,735 --> 01:21:53,568
Yes!

1931
01:21:53,569 --> 01:21:54,630
Yeah, sure I do.

1932
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:56,644
Let me see those darling digits.

1933
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,653
Let me see those cute cuticles.

1934
01:21:59,654 --> 01:22:01,026
Yes.

1935
01:22:01,027 --> 01:22:02,347
It's in there.

1936
01:22:02,348 --> 01:22:03,181
Oh, Rank!

1937
01:22:03,182 --> 01:22:04,763
I didn't know you were so kinky.

1938
01:22:04,764 --> 01:22:05,764
Oh, yeah.

1939
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:09,198
Actually darling, I'm not kinky.

1940
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,670
I'm a rather conservative lover.

1941
01:22:11,671 --> 01:22:14,659
But aren't you going
to take advantage of me?

1942
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,827
Darling, I already have.

1943
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,934
Your Grace, unfortunately,

1944
01:22:24,935 --> 01:22:28,947
it seems that due to severe intoxication,

1945
01:22:28,948 --> 01:22:30,709
Jeanette will be unable

1946
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:35,275
to attend tonight's performance
of the grand finale.

1947
01:22:35,276 --> 01:22:36,276
Rank!

1948
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:39,017
Will!

1949
01:22:39,726 --> 01:22:41,976
I've taken the liberty
of asking Lady Kate

1950
01:22:41,977 --> 01:22:45,055
to become a noble and
perform with me in her stead,

1951
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:48,438
with, of course, your royal permission.

1952
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:51,189
Well, this is highly irregular.

1953
01:22:52,437 --> 01:22:54,590
Since I feel partly responsible

1954
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:57,005
for my daughter's behavior,

1955
01:22:57,006 --> 01:22:59,051
I will allow it.

1956
01:22:59,052 --> 01:23:00,654
Thank you.

1957
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:03,392
Doesn't anybody care?

1958
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:04,393
Hello!

1959
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,430
Kate, Jo told me that you're mad at me?

1960
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,557
I don't wanna talk to you.

1961
01:23:07,558 --> 01:23:08,759
You think I was with Jeanette?

1962
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,593
Oh, my God.

1963
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:10,462
- Get away.
- Why won't you just listen?

1964
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:11,462
- Just listen.
- Go away.

1965
01:23:11,463 --> 01:23:13,963
Guards, take away this low-caste filth.

1966
01:23:13,964 --> 01:23:15,188
All right, fetch boy.

1967
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:16,022
Let's go.

1968
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:17,175
Yeah, we can go.

1969
01:23:20,594 --> 01:23:23,660
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

1970
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:25,578
It is the grand finale.

1971
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,332
At the end, a champion will be chosen,

1972
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:32,916
and new nobles will be crowned.

1973
01:23:37,401 --> 01:23:39,679
And now,
from the Greenbriar camp,

1974
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,660
Horny and Roy.

1975
01:23:45,075 --> 01:23:45,988
Oooh.

1976
01:23:45,989 --> 01:23:48,022
What are we going to do today, Horny?

1977
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:48,856
Oh, I got it.

1978
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,161
Let's tell some jokes.

1979
01:23:50,162 --> 01:23:52,313
Okay, Horny, but keep them clean.

1980
01:23:52,314 --> 01:23:53,679
Oh, I know a clean joke.

1981
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,953
What is it, Horny?

1982
01:23:54,954 --> 01:23:57,761
How can you tell if you're
girlfriend is ticklish?

1983
01:23:57,762 --> 01:23:58,595
I don't know.

1984
01:23:58,595 --> 01:23:59,578
How?

1985
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:01,020
Give her a test-icle.

1986
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:05,283
Rubbish.

1987
01:24:05,283 --> 01:24:06,116
Get it?

1988
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:07,116
Testicle.

1989
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,371
From Bradford camp,

1990
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:21,039
Count Le Petite and General Tso.

1991
01:24:22,435 --> 01:24:23,927
All right.

1992
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:25,595
Here comes the show.

1993
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,619
Go, get him, CLP.

1994
01:24:35,784 --> 01:24:36,784
Yes.

1995
01:24:41,346 --> 01:24:42,811
Le sausage.

1996
01:24:48,356 --> 01:24:50,035
Le Fast food.

1997
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:02,556
Brava.

1998
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:04,566
Amazing, my boy!

1999
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:08,944
I taught them everything they know.

2000
01:25:08,945 --> 01:25:10,043
I don't believe it.

2001
01:25:10,044 --> 01:25:12,406
Well, I'll get you a
sandwich if you like.

2002
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:13,240
All right.

2003
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,073
You can stop now.

2004
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:16,827
From the
Greenville camp, Jo and Crocket.

2005
01:25:34,143 --> 01:25:35,143
Boring.

2006
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:05,785
Dude, that was amazing.

2007
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:07,230
Good, right?

2008
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:08,872
Dude, we totally kicked ass.

2009
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:10,391
Yeah!

2010
01:26:10,392 --> 01:26:11,225
You're amazing.

2011
01:26:11,225 --> 01:26:12,058
It was good, right?

2012
01:26:12,058 --> 01:26:12,933
Dude, you crushed!

2013
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,433
You were awesome.

2014
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:15,434
Chest bump!

2015
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:20,343
You're going to leave me
hanging on a chest bump?

2016
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:22,874
Why is she not chest-bumping?

2017
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:25,087
I did not hook up with Jeanette.

2018
01:26:25,088 --> 01:26:25,921
Tell Kate.

2019
01:26:25,921 --> 01:26:26,754
Not me.

2020
01:26:26,755 --> 01:26:29,325
I tried telling Kate and
Rank won't let me near her.

2021
01:26:29,326 --> 01:26:31,259
Well, maybe you should try harder.

2022
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,802
How am I supposed to try harder?

2023
01:26:33,803 --> 01:26:35,053
She's pissed.

2024
01:26:36,505 --> 01:26:39,553
There is
a change in the program.

2025
01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:42,669
Kate will not be performing
with the peasants.

2026
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,766
Here now, Will, the fetch boy.

2027
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,563
It's you.

2028
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:48,396
Go, go, go.

2029
01:26:48,397 --> 01:26:49,408
No, no.

2030
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:51,182
Yes, you have to go.

2031
01:26:51,183 --> 01:26:52,395
I'm only half the act.

2032
01:26:52,396 --> 01:26:53,435
Kate's not here.

2033
01:26:53,436 --> 01:26:55,086
Just go up there and make it up.

2034
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:55,920
We need you.

2035
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:57,176
What am I supposed to do?

2036
01:26:57,177 --> 01:26:58,326
Just make up a song.

2037
01:26:58,327 --> 01:27:01,192
The first thing that comes to your mind.

2038
01:27:01,193 --> 01:27:02,026
Giraffes.

2039
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:02,859
Go!

2040
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,541
Go, go, go!

2041
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:14,688
Today I'm going to play
a song for my friend Kate,

2042
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:16,966
because I was originally
going to do a duet with her,

2043
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:20,307
but she got mad at me, and I
tried to explain myself but

2044
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:22,568
there's some stuff she needs to know and,

2045
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:25,076
what better time than on
stage in front of a group

2046
01:27:25,077 --> 01:27:28,283
strangers to have an
intimate conversation.

2047
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,783
So I wrote her a little song.

2048
01:27:33,259 --> 01:27:37,152
♪ You make this crazy place seem right ♪

2049
01:27:37,153 --> 01:27:40,644
♪ You make me feel okay to wear tights ♪

2050
01:27:40,645 --> 01:27:45,645

01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:51,186

01:27:55,936 --> 01:28:00,769
♪ Ask you If you want to do it with me ♪

2055
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:01,770
Oh, Lord.

2056
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,154
♪ I never did it with Jeanette I swear ♪

2057
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:08,479

2058

♪ Because I care I just
painted her nails ♪

2061
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:20,789
♪ And brushed her wasted hair ♪

01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:24,567
♪ Her super drunk hair ♪

♪ Her blacked-out hair ♪

2064
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:28,342
Too much information.

2065
01:28:28,343 --> 01:28:32,690
♪ Her shit-faced hair ♪

2066
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:34,550
♪ I love your smile ♪

2067
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:36,564

2070
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:46,400
♪ Wants to do it with you ♪

2071
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:48,511
♪ Just do it with you ♪

♪ And only you ♪

2073
01:28:50,891 --> 01:28:53,184
♪ This giraffe ♪

2074
01:28:53,185 --> 01:28:57,114
♪ Wants to do it with you ♪

2075
01:29:00,131 --> 01:29:01,572
This song is now called,

2076
01:29:01,573 --> 01:29:04,613
"This Giraffe Wants to Do it With You."

2077
01:29:04,614 --> 01:29:08,364
- That was wonderful.
- Indeed, your Majesty.

2078
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:12,922
What do you think?

2079
01:29:12,923 --> 01:29:14,524
Where did that come from?

2080
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:15,358
It just started flowing.

2081
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:16,908
I was just singing what I felt.

2082
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:18,157
Do you know you are a champ?

2083
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:20,159
That was amazing.

2084
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,713
Kate, time for stage.

2085
01:29:21,714 --> 01:29:23,741
Rank, I don't think I can do it anymore.

2086
01:29:23,742 --> 01:29:24,820
I'm really sorry.

2087
01:29:24,821 --> 01:29:26,659
I misunderstood some things.

2088
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,047
Yes, I've prepared for this.

2089
01:29:28,048 --> 01:29:31,131
I've taken the necessary precautions.

2090
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:34,223
That's my dog.

2091
01:29:34,223 --> 01:29:35,223
Yes.

2092
01:29:36,242 --> 01:29:37,474
What is wrong with you?

2093
01:29:37,475 --> 01:29:38,308
Oh, such fire.

2094
01:29:38,308 --> 01:29:39,141
Such passion.

2095
01:29:39,142 --> 01:29:40,304
Save it for the stage.

2096
01:29:40,305 --> 01:29:41,199
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

2097
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,137
Or am I just acting crazy?

2098
01:29:43,138 --> 01:29:44,466
Don't answer that.

2099
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:47,638
Get on the stage to
perform or the dog dies.

2100
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:48,722
I hate you.

2101
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,825
I think Rank is up to something.

2102
01:29:52,826 --> 01:29:54,660
Why is she still with Rank?

2103
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:56,558
And now for the Stratford camp,

2104
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:58,521
Lady Kate and Sir Rank.

2105
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:02,614
She's gonna perform with Rank

2106
01:30:02,615 --> 01:30:05,386
after I just sang a song telling everybody

2107
01:30:05,387 --> 01:30:08,835
that I think she's a koala bear?

2108
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,100
Amazing.

2109
01:30:10,101 --> 01:30:11,101
Come on.

2110
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:26,182
Will, that was wonderful.

2111
01:30:26,183 --> 01:30:27,739
Thanks, Jo.

2112
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:28,740
But, soft.

2113
01:30:29,954 --> 01:30:31,438
What light.

2114
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:33,856
Through yonder window breaks.

2115
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:36,438
It is the East.

2116
01:30:37,795 --> 01:30:39,628
And Juliet is the sun.

2117
01:30:41,571 --> 01:30:43,221
I can't believe Kate's with him.

2118
01:30:43,222 --> 01:30:44,839
It's ridiculous.

2119
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,777
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

2120
01:30:46,778 --> 01:30:48,039
Deny thy father.

2121
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,771
And refuse thy name.

2122
01:30:49,772 --> 01:30:51,687
Or, if thou wilt not,

2123
01:30:51,688 --> 01:30:53,588
be but sworn my love.

2124
01:30:53,589 --> 01:30:55,708
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

2125
01:30:55,709 --> 01:30:59,542
Shall I hear more, or
shall I speak at this?

2126
01:31:05,144 --> 01:31:06,158
'Tis but thy name

2127
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,829
that is my enemy, Will.

2128
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,080
Yes, to Will.

2129
01:31:11,713 --> 01:31:13,190
So gorgeous.

2130
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:14,555
What's Montague?

2131
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:15,556
Will?

2132
01:31:17,108 --> 01:31:19,191
It is not hand, nor foot,

2133
01:31:20,127 --> 01:31:25,127
nor arm, nor face, nor any
other part belonging to a man.

2134
01:31:25,266 --> 01:31:27,599
O, be some other name, Will.

2135
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:30,297
Does that seem weird to you

2136
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:31,437
that she keeps saying Will?

2137
01:31:31,438 --> 01:31:32,612
It's definitely not in the script.

2138
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:34,503
By any other word would smell as sweet.

2139
01:31:34,504 --> 01:31:37,442
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called.

2140
01:31:37,443 --> 01:31:39,266
Why does she keep
looking at the side stage?

2141
01:31:39,267 --> 01:31:41,818
Perfection which he
owes without that title.

2142
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:44,055
Romeo, doff thy name, and for thy name,

2143
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:46,138
which is no part of thee.

2144
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:47,963
Take all myself.

2145
01:31:47,964 --> 01:31:49,314
Will!

2146
01:31:49,315 --> 01:31:50,148
Will.

2147
01:31:50,148 --> 01:31:51,050
Haha.

2148
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:54,027
That doesn't sound like Shakespeare.

2149
01:31:54,028 --> 01:31:55,137
Something is wrong, man.

2150
01:31:55,138 --> 01:31:56,756
Something is definitely wrong.

2151
01:31:56,757 --> 01:31:58,231
Come with me.

2152
01:31:58,232 --> 01:31:59,847
Were I twill a rose?

2153
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,878
I am as beautiful.

2154
01:32:01,879 --> 01:32:03,333
What are you doing?

2155
01:32:03,334 --> 01:32:04,238
Focus!

2156
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,707
Never add to Shakespeare.

2157
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,958
Stick to the script, idiot.

2158
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:10,889
I take thee at thy word.

2159
01:32:12,097 --> 01:32:13,213
They got Benny.

2160
01:32:13,214 --> 01:32:15,615
Dude, he's forcing her to act with him.

2161
01:32:15,616 --> 01:32:16,800
That's why she's doing it because

2162
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:18,103
they're got Benny at gunpoint.

2163
01:32:18,104 --> 01:32:21,922
Henceforth, I will never be Romeo.

2164
01:32:25,425 --> 01:32:27,088
So stumbles the council.

2165
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:28,354
I hate you.

2166
01:32:28,355 --> 01:32:30,231
So stumbles the council.

2167
01:32:30,232 --> 01:32:32,899
Say the line or the dog gets it.

2168
01:32:35,822 --> 01:32:36,655
We gotta save him.

2169
01:32:36,656 --> 01:32:37,988
Dude, just go.

2170
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:42,830
Don't be foolish, Bon Ami.

2171
01:32:42,831 --> 01:32:43,664
Ha!

2172
01:32:43,665 --> 01:32:44,696
Guys.

2173
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:46,473
This is a renaissance faire.

2174
01:32:46,474 --> 01:32:48,130
It's all make-believe.

2175
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:50,091
He's not really from France.

2176
01:32:50,092 --> 01:32:51,892
And you're not really Asian.

2177
01:32:51,893 --> 01:32:53,313
- Yes, I am.
- Are you really?

2178
01:32:58,956 --> 01:33:01,611
Come here, I'll choke your ass.

2179
01:33:01,612 --> 01:33:03,356
I got him.

2180
01:33:03,357 --> 01:33:04,718
Thank God.

2181
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,557
Do something!

2182
01:33:08,558 --> 01:33:11,782
Shoot him, shoot him while
he's handing the dog.

2183
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:13,728
I don't remember a dog.

2184
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,757
Behind you.

2185
01:33:19,228 --> 01:33:21,469
Thank you, my lady.

2186
01:33:26,905 --> 01:33:29,294
You're gonna have him
shoot me with a crossbow?

2187
01:33:29,295 --> 01:33:30,128
Yes.

2188
01:33:30,128 --> 01:33:30,961
Da-da-da.

2189
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:32,832
Horny to the rescue!

2190
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:33,833
Oh, no.

2191
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:38,022
Are they still acting?

2192
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:41,904
Is this part of the show?

2193
01:33:41,905 --> 01:33:43,342
Dude, all joking aside,

2194
01:33:43,343 --> 01:33:44,689
I'm going to kick your ass.

2195
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,771
Oh, wonderful.

2196
01:33:45,772 --> 01:33:48,340
Use that energy with swords!

2197
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,470
Like they did in the
age of the renaissance.

2198
01:33:51,471 --> 01:33:52,484
Haha.

2199
01:33:52,485 --> 01:33:53,745
I'm not going to play
swords with you, buddy.

2200
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:55,635
Did you hear that, folks?

2201
01:33:55,636 --> 01:34:00,150
The big shaved ape is
also a big bloody chicken.

2202
01:34:02,863 --> 01:34:04,828
Okay, I definitely
will sword fight you now.

2203
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:05,829
En guard.

2204
01:34:06,759 --> 01:34:07,592
Okay.

2205
01:34:07,593 --> 01:34:08,868
Now you say en guard.

2206
01:34:08,869 --> 01:34:10,497
I'm not gonna say en guard.

2207
01:34:10,498 --> 01:34:12,546
But you just did.

2208
01:34:12,547 --> 01:34:13,547
Damn it.

2209
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,208
Lunge.

2210
01:34:38,664 --> 01:34:42,223
Looks like someone lost their sword.

2211
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,561
I don't think you're
supposed to say the W in sword.

2212
01:34:44,562 --> 01:34:45,905
I say it.

2213
01:34:45,906 --> 01:34:47,241
What I say is right.

2214
01:34:47,242 --> 01:34:48,659
I have the sword.

2215
01:34:51,088 --> 01:34:53,948
On your knees, fetch boy.

2216
01:34:53,949 --> 01:34:55,966
Kneel, kneel before me.

2217
01:34:55,967 --> 01:34:58,284
Romeo still in character.

2218
01:34:58,285 --> 01:34:59,779
Respect the piece.

2219
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,538
I'm not gonna kneel near your piece.

2220
01:35:01,539 --> 01:35:02,661
Fine.

2221
01:35:02,662 --> 01:35:03,794
Don't have to.

2222
01:35:03,795 --> 01:35:07,545
Any final words before
I kill you, fetch boy?

2223
01:35:08,731 --> 01:35:10,015
Yeah.

2224
01:35:10,016 --> 01:35:11,973
You're a very weird guy.

2225
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:22,839
That was so cool.

2226
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,938
You saved me.

2227
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:25,303
Thanks for catching me.

2228
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:26,137
It's no problem.

2229
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,336
I thought it was the obvious move.

2230
01:35:28,337 --> 01:35:29,354
You saved my dog.

2231
01:35:29,355 --> 01:35:30,188
I did.

2232
01:35:30,188 --> 01:35:31,188
Where is he?

2233
01:35:31,855 --> 01:35:33,765
- Benny.
- Come here, Benny.

2234
01:35:33,766 --> 01:35:35,250
Who's a good boy?

2235
01:35:50,452 --> 01:35:51,739
Fake sword.

2236
01:35:52,811 --> 01:35:54,495
Fake sword.

2237
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:55,496
Real fist.

2238
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,473
Come on, guys.

2239
01:36:18,367 --> 01:36:19,346
Guys, you look great.

2240
01:36:19,347 --> 01:36:20,866
You look good up here in this theater.

2241
01:36:20,867 --> 01:36:22,784
Come on up here, buddy.

2242
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:29,807
Thank you.

2243
01:36:36,223 --> 01:36:38,494
Well done, everyone.

2244
01:36:38,495 --> 01:36:39,828
It was splendid.

2245
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:44,378
Now, I have made my decision.

2246
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,060
The Greenbriars

2247
01:36:51,663 --> 01:36:53,996
shall be next year's nobles.

2248
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:07,263
Hip, hip, hooray!

2249
01:37:07,264 --> 01:37:10,670
Kate and Will, please approach.

2250
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:12,088
Dear, dear, Kate.

2251
01:37:14,068 --> 01:37:15,030
You may rise.

2252
01:37:15,031 --> 01:37:16,576
Thank you.

2253
01:37:16,577 --> 01:37:18,660
You were simply divine.

2254
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:23,474
- Thank you, your Majesty.
- Absolutely, I agree.

2255
01:37:23,475 --> 01:37:24,398
What's that?

2256
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,231
Guard, get your ass over here.

2257
01:37:31,557 --> 01:37:33,188
Professor Shockworthy?

2258
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:34,022
Yeah.

2259
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:34,855
It's my professor.

2260
01:37:34,856 --> 01:37:36,066
That's the dude who made me come here.

2261
01:37:36,067 --> 01:37:37,466
Oh.

2262
01:37:37,467 --> 01:37:41,580
Mr. Pepperidge, when I first
sentenced you to work here

2263
01:37:41,581 --> 01:37:45,648
at the fair, it was purely
for my own amusement.

2264
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:47,482
But after watching you

2265
01:37:48,824 --> 01:37:52,723
turn yourself from an arrogant quarterback

2266
01:37:52,724 --> 01:37:54,990
to a selfless fetch boy,

2267
01:37:54,991 --> 01:37:58,347
showing growth I thought
you were incapable of.

2268
01:37:58,348 --> 01:38:02,213
You have embraced the
values of the renaissance.

2269
01:38:02,214 --> 01:38:03,099
Yeah, I totally-

2270
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:07,182
- Like a rough iron ingot,
sharpened and polished

2271
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:11,337
into a finely tuned sword.

2272
01:38:12,316 --> 01:38:14,476
You say sword like the other crazy guy.

2273
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:18,979
Your greatest weakness
has been forged into

2274
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,897
your ultimate strength.

2275
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:23,020
Bravo!

2276
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,020
Bravo!

2277
01:38:26,623 --> 01:38:29,408
So, does that mean I passed?

2278
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:30,602
Yes.

2279
01:38:30,603 --> 01:38:31,752
Yes, you passed.

2280
01:38:34,214 --> 01:38:35,450
Yes.

2281
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,264
Wanna bump it?

2282
01:38:37,265 --> 01:38:38,730
Thank you for that.

2283
01:38:44,998 --> 01:38:46,831

Oh.

2290
01:39:14,102 --> 01:39:16,282

2293
01:39:19,694 --> 01:39:22,142
Because I'm the one who cursed you.

What?

2295
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:33,462

We're meant to be together, stupid.

2297

You don't know anything.

2298

2302
