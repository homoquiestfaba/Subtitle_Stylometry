00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,792
- Wait. Who are you?
- The name's Nimona.

174
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,792
- And how did you...
- Whoa! Yeah! Sick arm.

175
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,125
- Did it bleed a lot?
- What?

176
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,125
- Did they let you keep the old one?
- No. Let go!

177
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,792
What is wrong with you?

178
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,292
- Ooh! Can I have it?
- What? Put that down.

179
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,125
That is not for little girls.

180
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,750
Little girls? [laughs]

181
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,958
Okay, how old do you think I am?

182
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,292
I don't know. Ten?

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,042
- Help me out. More or less than ten?
- Not a lot of kids in your life, huh?

184
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
You know what? No. I'd like it
to stay that way. You have to go.

185
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,583
But I'm here about the job.

186
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,167
Job? What job?

187
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,208
It's all here in my application.

188
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,250
This is just a bunch of drawings.
Very disturbing drawings.

189
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,292
Oh, look, it's me. [chuckles]

190
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:21,083
On a rhinoceros, skewering several guards
like a human kebab.

191
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,833
Yeah! Do you like it?

192
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,875
I thought a visual aid
would really make my resume pop.

193
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,500
- What?
- Up here.

194
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,792
So, about the job?

195
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,333
What job?

196
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,958
To be your sidekick.

197
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,500
To help you do whatever it takes

198
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,917
to get revenge on the cruel world
that rejected you.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,393
Shall we pillage a village?
Lay low until they don't remember you.

200
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,000
Then we rise
like a fiery phoenix from the ashes

201
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,625
to overthrow the government!

202
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,375
Or we could just talk.

203
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,708
The point is,
whatever your dark heart desires, boss.

204
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,208
Your sidekick has arrived.

205
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,518
- I don't need a side...
- Every villain needs a sidekick.

206
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,375
- Wait, I am not a...
- Whoa! Sweet murder wall!

207
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,976
- Murder wall?
- Are these your next targets?

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,393
- That's not...
- Who do you wanna kill first?

209
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,583
- I'm not killing anybody.
- This one.

210
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,708
- What?
- This guy looks extremely punchable.

211
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:11,958
You're right. He is extremely punchable.
No, wait. Look. That is not a murder wall.

212
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,250
It's an... innocence wall?

213
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,125
Innocence wall. [sputters]

214
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,417
Wait. Are you saying
that you're not a villain?

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,667
Yes!

216
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,208
[bottle shatters]

217
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,042
Yes, you are?

218
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,042
No! No, I'm not a villain. No.

219
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,625
Oh.

220
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,417
What? Are you disappointed
that I'm not a murderer?

221
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,542
[sighs]

222
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,500
I mean, a little.

223
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,250
- You know what? We're done here.
- Why?

224
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,833
The real villain is still out there,
and I do need help.

225
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,375
- Not from you.
- Aw, fine! Then from who?

226
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
The guy who cut off your arm?

227
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,667
- Seriously?
- It's complicated, okay?

228
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,208
Have fun getting arrested.

229
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,417
I am not gonna get arrested!

230
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,875
Murderer.

231
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,500
- Wanna get some lunch?
- Yeah, I love lunch.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,750
You had to take the arm, huh?

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,250
Ballister?

234
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,083
Director?

235
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,917
I'm innocent.

236
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,583
I swear on Gloreth's name.

237
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,917
I don't know how it...

238
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,875
how it happened.

239
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,292
We all saw how it happened.

240
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,917
I feel so foolish, and...

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,917
I trusted you.

242
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,667
The queen believed in you.

243
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,000
She thought someone like you
could be a hero.

244
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,792
And it cost her her life.

245
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,417
Director, please.

246
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,792
You know I love the queen.
I love the Institute.

247
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,083
Talk to Goldenloin.

248
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,292
Can I speak to Goldenloin?

249
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,958
He is as heartbroken
as the rest of this kingdom.

250
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,625
You won't be talking
to anyone anymore, Ballister.

251
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,750
Please!

252
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,417
Please, just listen to me.

253
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,958
No. I won't make that mistake again.

254
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,625
Director, give me a chance.

255
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,375
We gave you a chance.

256
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,250
But I didn't do this!

257
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,083
Uhh!

258
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,833
- [Nimona] I told you.
- Oh! Good Gloreth!

259
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,083
Hey, boss.

260
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,542
What? How...

261
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,333
Did I know this was gonna happen?

262
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,583
Because once everyone
sees you as a villain,

263
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,083
that's what you are.

264
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,292
They only see you one way,
no matter how hard you try.

265
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,167
You gave it a good shot, though.
I gotta hand it to you.

266
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,667
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

267
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,708
- I still gotta get you out of here.
- Wait. How did you get out?

268
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,292
I know the code.
Beep bop boop beep bop.

269
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,917
[automated voice] <i>Invalid password.</i>

270
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,667
After you.

271
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,417
No?

272
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,458
You could sit here
for the rest of eternity,

273
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,750
slowly watching your muscles atrophy,
your skin turning to rot,

274
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,417
your nails growing
into long, curly-fry-looking talons.

275
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,750
You know there's no toilet in there.

276
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, okay, but I lead.

277
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,625
If you see anyone...

278
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,792
Murder 'em.

279
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,542
Hide. If you see anyone, hide.

280
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,583
Fine, because we're still
gonna break stuff.

281
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,375
[vocalizing]

282
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,083
- That's a hard no.
- Uhh!

283
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,208
Psst.

284
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
[candelabras clatter loudly]

285
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,792
This place should be crawling with guards.

286
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,292
How exactly did you get past...

287
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,542
[guards groaning]

288
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,625
...them?

289
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,208
They were like this when I got here.

290
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,333
[alarm buzzes]

291
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,684
- [knight] Grab them!
- [knight] Stop 'em!

292
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,792
- Over here!
- Charge!

293
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,833
The One-Arm Club's about to get
some new members.

294
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,292
[sputters] Get it?

295
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,208
Uhh!

296
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,250
- What? Too soon?
- [knight] Murderer!

297
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,000
He is a murderer... of fun.

298
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,375
- Did you even have a plan?
- This is the plan!

299
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,309
I break you out, chaos, destruction,
something, something, something, we win.

300
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,250
The "old something, something, something,
we win." Terrible plan.

301
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,542
Better than your plan of, "Sit in the dark
and mope in a room with no toilet."

302
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,625
- I was not moping!
- [knights shouting]

303
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,625
[knight] Queen killer!

304
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,917
Knights don't mope.
We brood. I was brooding.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,458
Oh. [raspberry]

306
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,792
Okay, fine. You know what?

307
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,042
Why don't we do it your way? Yeah?

308
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,708
Murder him, murder her, murder everyone!

309
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,250
Bal?

310
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,000
- Ambrosius.
- <i>Gesundheit.</i>

311
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh, nemesis.

312
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,292
Nemesis?

313
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,375
[knight] Queen killer!

314
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,958
- Oh, look! It's Gloreth!
- Where?

315
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,875
- [knight] Open the door!
- Not an exit. That's on me.

316
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,518
- [thump]
- Did you see the way he looked at me?

317
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,542
[knights shouting]

318
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,625
He really thinks I killed the queen.

319
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,750
- Everyone thinks you killed the queen.
- [thump]

320
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,583
- Snap out of it.
- What was that for?

321
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,583
I can get us out of here,
but things are about to get weird.

322
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,333
<i>- About</i> to get weird?
- Promise me you won't freak out.

323
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,292
How, if I don't know what's gonna happen?

324
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,667
- I guess you'll just have to trust me.
- Why would I trust you?

325
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,583
Yaah!

326
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,000
- If you don't, you'll die in this closet!
- Die?

327
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,292
- Now promise!
- I promise.

328
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,000
- Promise promise?
- On my life!

329
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,167
- Then say it again.
- I promise!

330
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,125
Wow. Even when you see the horn?

331
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,875
Horn? You mean like a trumpet?

332
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,833
Just promise!

333
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,125
I promise I will not freak...
Uh...

334
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,375
This is the part where you run.

335
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,958
- [screams]
- Everyone get out of here!

336
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,250
- Yeah!
- Oh no!

337
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,417
No! Stay away! Get back!
No! This is not happening!

338
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,875
Yee-haw!

339
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,042
Oh no. Oh, good Gloreth!

340
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,167
Aah!

341
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,833
Rhinoceros?

342
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,333
[yelling]

343
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,292
- Leave that guy alone!
- Take that!

344
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,542
- No! Not the stairs!
- Ooh, stairs!

345
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,917
- Whoo!
- Not the stairs!

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
- What are you?
- I'm Nimona!

347
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,167
- So, you're a girl and a rhino?
- I'm a lot of things.

348
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,917
- What is happening?
- [roars]

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,167
Ohh! Uhh!

350
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,000
Yaah!

351
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,917
- Are you gonna be okay?
- No!

352
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
- You promised.
- Right!

353
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,875
Right. You promised not to freak out.

354
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,250
- Turn right!
- Oh!

355
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,208
Halt!

356
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,750
Whoa!

357
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,333
Huh. This floor is surprisingly stable.

358
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,250
Ah, there we go.

359
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,958
- Cold in here?
- Uhh!

360
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,750
Help me! Help me!

361
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,667
You. You did that on purpose.

362
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,417
You catch on quick, boss. Yeah.

363
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,417
No. We've gotta get out of here.

364
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,125
Whoa!

365
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,500
No! No! No! No going down!
No going down!

366
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,958
Staircase! No going down!

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,583
[Nimona] Whoo-hoo-hoo!

368
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,667
Yeah!

369
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Ha!

370
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,833
Ha ha!

371
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,875
Oh, no.

372
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,250
Something, something, something, we win.

Don't be so gullible.
It was just a couple of hours.

Breakfast tacos?

394
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,375
Wait. Wait. Last thing I remember,
we were in a supply closet.

395
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,833
And now... How did I get here?

396
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,833
I dragged you for, like, seven miles.

397
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:45,792
What happened?

398
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,083
Your head bounced
on the sidewalk a few times.

399
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,125
It's all so foggy.

400
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,708
Really? You thanked me,
said you'd forever be in my debt,

401
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,208
and that we'd always be best friends.

402
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,875
Uh...

403
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,958
Totally happened.

404
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,208
Hey, I spruced up the lair.

405
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,333
I arranged the weapons
in order of deadliness,

406
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,042
unchildproofed the place,
opened the poisons laying around,

407
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,583
and pulled some rusty nails
one centimeter out of the floorboards.

408
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,708
Overall, just made it
much more evil lair-y in here.

409
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,292
[gasps] Evil Larry.
That's a great villain name.

410
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,458
- You should change your name.
- Never gonna happen.

411
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,375
Whatever, Larry.

412
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,292
And I updated your murder wall.

413
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Oops.

414
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,750
Plus, I drew up plans
for revenge, torment,

415
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,458
and good old general malfeasance.

416
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,625

00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:51,458
You look freaked.
You promised you'd hold it together.

419
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,083
You're not human.

420
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,500
- You looking for something?
- My sword.

421
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,375
It exploded. Remember?

422
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,792
You're a mo...

423
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:03,292
What? Marsupial? Mariachi? Meatball?

424
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,708
You're a monster.

425
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,375
Do not call me that!

426
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,375
[thunder crashes]

427
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,250
No. No, no, no. Of course not.

428
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,042
You're obviously not
a massive fire-breathing, you know...

429
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,042
But you do do
the shifty-shift-shifting-shape thing.

430
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,542
And you're a girl who can turn into...

431
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
What are you?

432
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,375
I'm Nimona.

433
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,083
No, that's not an answer.

434
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,583
People don't just turn into things.

435
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:29,667
I do.

436
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,167
Okay. Fine.
Then I have a million questions.

437
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,292
You get one.

438
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,333
Why are you helping me?

439
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,542
Because I'm bored.

440
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,583
And everybody hates you too.

441
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,667
The squire has to know something.

442
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,792
He's the one that gave me the sword.
The sword that...

443
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,833
that...

444
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,083
You need the squire?

445
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,083
Then let's go kill... Get him.

446
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,917
Let's go get him.

447
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,792
You and me.

448
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,958
No, absolutely not.

449
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,083
The thing you do? It's too much. No.

450
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,958
I think you're trying to say,
"Thanks for saving my life."

451
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,542
Three times, if you're keeping score.

452
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,500
But you're right.
I'm sure you can do this alone,

453
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,958
with every knight in the entire kingdom
gunning for you. Good luck.

454
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:53,958
Wait.

455
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,583
Yes, Evil Larry?

456

457
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,875
- I...
- I'm in.

458
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,667
Here's the thing. When we clear your name,
then I am your official sidekick forever.

459
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,583
No take-backsies. Deal?

460
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,583
- I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
- Don't overthink it.

461
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,833
Can you just be you, please?

462
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:22,917
I don't follow.

463
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,208
Girl you.

464
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,417
But I'm not a girl.

465
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,583
I'm a shark. [snaps teeth]

00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,750
[sighs]

467
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,542
Hey. You ever put your head
in the mouth of one of these?

468
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,167
- Should've just stayed in jail.
- Come on!

469
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,958
You know you wanna!

470
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh man! Look at this place!

471
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,375
A thousand years of history destroyed.

472
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,583
- Huh. Hey, Mansley.
- What?

473
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:52,458
Your uncle's head
fell on my grandma's butt.

00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,333
[laughter]

475
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,018
- [knight 1] That's hilarious.
- [knight 2] Nice.

476
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,375
Oh, so sad, though.

477
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,917
[knight 3] Well, if Goldenloin
hadn't helped him...

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,542
- [knight 4] I never liked...
- Let me get this straight.

479
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,958
The murderer of the queen escaped

480
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:13,958
with the help of a girl,
an ostrich, and a whale?

481
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,208
It destroyed our showers!

482
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,667
This is his fault!

483
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,250
- [knight 4] Tell him, Todd.
- Me?

484
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,167
Why didn't you tell us
Ballister was working with whales?

485
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:25,958
Whales? Really, Todd?

486
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,083
Oh, what? Whale? Really? Yeah.
You knew him better than anyone, bro.

487
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,292
I tried to stop him, <i>bro.</i>

488
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:35,167
Really? Like this?
"Oh, hi, Ballister. Come right in."

489
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,833
"And of course you can bring your whale,
ostrich, and big fat unicorn."

490
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,542
- Fat unicorn?
- Yeah, you saw it.

491
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,976
- One with the horn that broke everything.
- You mean rhinoceros?

492
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,934
If I meant rhinoperos,
I would have said rhinoperos.

493
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,000
Enough!

494
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,125
There is a villain on the loose
in our kingdom.

495
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,083
Look at you, acting like common children.

496
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,125
Remember your training.

497
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,083
Remember who you are.

498
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,042
We are born to protect this kingdom.

499
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,167
<i>I</i> was born.

500
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,125
Let me take the lead, Director.

501
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:18,500
There's only two things I want right now.
A, to have a really big sword.

502
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:20,542
Check.

503
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:25,500
And three, to treat Ballister
like the queen-killing monster he is.

504
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,917
- I'll hunt him down.
- [knights] Yeah!

505
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,333
I'll make it hurt. I'll make...

506
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,833
- I'll do it.
- [knight 5] Huh?

507
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,917
[knight 6] Why?

508
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,625
If anyone can find Bal...

509
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,167
find Ballister

510
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,500
before someone else gets hurt...

511
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,208
it's me.

512
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,833
This is the greatest threat
we've faced in generations.

513
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:59,500
Thankfully, we have
a descendant of Gloreth to lead us.

514
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,583
What?

515
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,542
Knights of the realm,

516
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,500
search every street, every shadow.

517
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:12,375
<i>Find Ballister, and bring him to me.</i>

No. We're doing things my way this time.
No one gets hurt.

I was going
for the "hurting people" version.

530
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,917
- We find the squire and question him.
- Then hurt him.

531
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,042
- No. And then find the proof.
- By hurting him.

532
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,125
No. Can we just get to the market, please?

533
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:53,667
Roger that.

Eh, sorry.
I can't be seen with that! Aah!

Don't you get it?

The second we let our guard down,
something terrible comes over that wall.

Have you ever even been outside the wall?

556
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:58,958
Yeah, 'cause I have a death wish.
No! No one has!

557
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,458
So, maybe there's nothing there?

You know what? We're going underground.
Without the wings.

00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,625
- I told you, it's...
- Complicated. I know.

694
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,833
Look! Squire.

695
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,708
Hi. Hi. Uh, excuse me.

696
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,958
Okay. We've gotta get him
out of here quietly.

697
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,292
On it. [grunting]

698
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,375
Wait, not like that.
Not like that, either.

699
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,726
You want me to shift.
You don't want me to shift. Pick a lane.

700
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,958
And now you're a boy.

701
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,042
- I am today.
- Wait, no!

702
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,208
- [automated voice] <i>Wanted. Wanted. Wanted.</i>
- Excuse me.

703
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,625
- [gasps]
- Come on.

704
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,852
[Goldenloin]
I know he's here! Find him!

705
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,500
- [woman] Look, it's Goldenloin!
- [man] I can't believe it.

706
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,417
[boy] Goldenloin.

707
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,309
- Please move aside.
- Can I get your autograph?

708
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,653
- Just one signature. Who am I signing?
- Do you sign skin?

709
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,375
- [woman] Don't move!
- [gasp]

710
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,667
'Cause if you do, you're gonna miss out
on a great deal today!

711
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,875
[cute voice] Excuse me, Mr. Squire, sir.

712
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,917
I can't find my mommy.

713
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,875
She went to that scary alley over there.

714
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,958
Can you help me find her?

715
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,000
Please?

716
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,583
Oh, no.

717
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:49,833
Let me go ahead and pass this problem
on to someone else.

718
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,958
- [deep voice] There's no time!
- Aah!

719
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:55,708
This baby's fully loaded.
State-of-the-art sound system.

720
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,375
[rock music plays]

721
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,792
There. Can we just part the waters?

722
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,542
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Move aside.

723
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,958
Please help me. Help me, please.

724
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:06,458
A little demon baby is after me.
Please help me.

725
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,000
- [growls]
- Aah!

726
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
Aah!

727
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:10,625
Check this out.

728
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,417
With our 360-degree dashcams,
you'll always see what's coming.

729
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,667
And our news feature will keep you
up to date with the kingdom's headlines.

730
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,333
- Uh, you look a lot like...
- I'm innocent!

731
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,917
Help!

732
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,667
No!

733
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:30,042
Pineapple on pizza? Bleah!

734
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,375
- There!
- Excuse me. I need to get through. Move!

735
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,208
- Uh-oh.
- Ah ha ha ha!

736
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,292
- Aw. Why did you get to kill him?
- He's not dead. I hope.

737
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,695
- [man] Is that Ballister?
- [woman] It's the queen killer!

738
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,458
- He's working with a demon baby!
- I thought he ate babies!

739
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,250
Ballister! Stop! Halt

740
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,833
- Yeah!
- [Ballister] Get in!

741
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,625
- Bal!
- Shoot him in the face!

742
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,292
What are you doing?

743
00:37:58,917 --> 00:37:59,958
We'll take it.

744
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,583
Aah!

745
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,333
- Dang it!
- [screaming]

746
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,833
I hate to say it,
but you make a pretty good bad guy.

747
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,333
Oh! Yep. I like it.

748
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:47,042
We're gonna shake this dude down
in this sketchy part of town.

749
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,417
Look, let's just question the squire
and get out... Your leg.

750
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,458
- Huh?
- There's an arrow in your leg!

751
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,792
- Oh.
- Okay, you really need to sit down.

752
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,625
- No, it's fine. It's totally...
- Look at you. You're not fine.

753
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,583
- It's a splinter. It'll work itself out.
- You're bleeding. Sit.

754
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,375
We're just gonna take a look, okay?

755
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,583
Yah! Okay. Okay. Okay.

756
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,917
That's... It's... That's in there.

757
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,625
Uh, everything's fine.
We're just gonna...

758
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,167
[exhales]

759
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,625
We're gonna do this on three.

760
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,625
You ready?

761
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,792
One, two, three.

762
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,875
Okay, most people scream at that part.

763
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,583
I'm not a people.

764
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,667
Right.

765
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,125
Right. Um...

766
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,500
- does it hurt at all?
- It does.

767
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,667
But I've been through worse.

768
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,417
What does it feel like?

769
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,917
Pretty stabby in my leg region.

770
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,417
[laughing] No. No. The shape shifting.

771
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,208
Does it hurt, or does it...

772
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,708
Sorry. Small-minded question.

773
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,750
Hold still.

774
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,667
Honestly?

775
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,042
I feel worse when I don't do it.

776
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,375
Like my insides are itchy.

777
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,375
You know that second
right before you sneeze?

778
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,125
That's close to it.

779
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,708
Then I shape-shift, and I'm free.

780
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,000
What if you held it in?

781
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,417
If you didn't shape-shift?

782
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,875
- I'd die.
- Good Gloreth, that's horrible!

783
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,625
Don't be so gullible. I wouldn't <i>die </i>die.

784
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,500
I just sure wouldn't be living.

785
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,417
[pounding]

786
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,583
[Squire]
So nice to hear you guys bonding.

787
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:58,500
Ah, it's such a shame I have to go.
Let me go.

788
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:03,542
Oh yeah, the punk in the trunk.
Let's go dunk on the punk in the trunk.

789
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,000
[whimpering]

790
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,625
- Start talking.
- He wants blood.

791
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,958
- Blood?
- Your blood!

792
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,601
- I don't want blood.
- Buckets of blood!

793
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,625
What I want is answers, so start talking.

794
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,917
Or we start stabbing.

795
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,125
- No stabbing.
- Slapping.

796
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,292
No! Why did you set me up?

797
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,542
- I didn't.
- Then who?

798
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,458
- You!
- No!

799
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:20,375
- Who?
- Let me explain.

800
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,500
Blanche? Chad? Todd?

801
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,792
- Todd?
- Punchable face guy?

802
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,792
Of course.
Todd swapped my sword, didn't he?

803
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,475
- What? No.
- Why are you protecting him?

804
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:27,542
Who'd protect Todd?

805
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,167
Guess we're just gonna
have to do things the hard way.

806
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,667
Hard way? Hold on a second.
Wait. Just wait.

807
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,333
Peekaboo.

808
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,708
Yaah! Here, look.

809
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,167
<i>Check it out. I'm in the locker room,</i>

810
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,208
<i>and you are looking at history
in the making.</i>

811
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,458
<i>Ballister's armor. It's speaking.</i>

812
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:49,792
<i>It's saying, "Respect me. Protect me.
Put me on. No one's watching."</i>

813
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,250
Awkward.

814
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,042
Oh, we can just fast-forward.

815
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,750
Okay, this is the part you have to see.

816
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,167
The Director set me up.

817
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,292
She killed the queen.

818
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:27,125
I, I didn't know what to do.
I tried to show you before...

819
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,833
None of this makes sense.

820
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,458
Oh. Hey, buddy.

821
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm sorry for kidnapping you.

822
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,375
It's okay.

823
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,958
- [deep voice] Or am I?
- Oh! Oh!

824
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,042
[wailing]

825
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,208
Ha ha!

826
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,083
Look, boss, you got betrayed
by someone you trusted.

827
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:57,500
I get it. It sucks. But we did it.
You're innocent, and we have the proof.

828
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,263
- Once we upload that video...
- We're not.

829
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,417
What? Everybody needs to know the truth.

830
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,083
The system is jacked.
The Institute needs to shut down.

831
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,375
Will you be quiet?

832
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,417
<i>Prospective target.
Clear on Avenue Three. Over.</i>

833
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,708
I will not be quiet about this.

834
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,417
This video could damage people's faith
in the Institute.

835
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,667
No duh!

836
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,083
Look, I don't know why she framed me,
but the Institute's not the problem.

837
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,333
The Director is.

838
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,083
That's why I'm taking this to Ambrosius.

839
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,042
- Who cares?
- Ambro...

840
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:29,625
This is the man who cut off your arm.
Arm-chopping is not a love language!

841
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:33,125
He didn't cut off my arm.
He disarmed a weapon.

842
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,375
It's how we were trained.

843
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,792
[Nimona] Wow!

844
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,583
They brainwashed you good.

845
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,000
You think this stops with the Director?

846
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,542
You should be
questioning everything right now.

847
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,125
The will of Gloreth,
the Institute, the wall.

848
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,458
What's it all really for?

849
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,125
For protecting the realm.

850
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,125
You mean from villains like you?

851
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,042
Or monsters

852
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,083
like me?

853
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,417
Look, if we get this to Ambrosius,
everything is gonna be okay.

854
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:11,708
For both of us.

855
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:15,750
[sighs]

856
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:22,917
Okay, fine. But when things go south,
I'm breaking stuff.

857
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,125
- That won't be necessary.
- [vocalizing]

858
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,917
Is something on your mind, Ambrosius?

859
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:46,958
You can talk to me.

860
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,375
My mind?

861
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,167
[exhales] I've lost my mind.

862
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:54,292
I've lost everything.

863
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,375
The man I love, my best friend.

864
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:01,000
Although now he's got a new best friend.
What's that about?

865
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,625
What else is he hiding?
Who is the real him?

866
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:04,583
Who am I?

867
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:07,708
A direct descendant of Gloreth?
I never asked for that.

868
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,792
Now everyone expects me
to arrest Ballister.

869
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,583
If I don't, I'm a traitor to you.
If I do, I'm a traitor to him.

870
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,500
Oh, and on top of that,
I chopped off his arm!

871
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,125
His arm! Who chops off an arm?

872
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:22,292
Because I was trained to?
Arm chopping is not a love langua...

873
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,583
I'm fine, Director.

874
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,000
- Ma'am.
- Stay strong, Ambrosius.

875
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,833
The blood of Gloreth
runs through your veins.

876
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,917
- Ambrosius.
- Knights!

877
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,458
They were like this when I got here.

878
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,000
You.

879
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,500
Me.

880
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,333
Ambrosius, the Director killed the queen.

881
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,125
- What?
- Another desperate lie.

882
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:09,625
He's not a liar.

883
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:12,542
[laughing]
Says the miscreant, whispering in his ear.

884
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,917
Aw, thank you.

885
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,583
I'm innocent, and I have proof.

886
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,958
- He's got a weapon.
- No!

887
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,292
Not anymore! Todd rules!

888
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,667
[laughs]

889
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,542
It doesn't matter.
You shouldn't need proof.

890
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,417
You know I'm not a murderer.

891
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,875
What are you waiting for, Captain?

892
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,208
[Todd]
Hurry before the whale gets here.

893
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,292
Come on, man.

894
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,167
Do the right thing.

895
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,417
Who is she, Bal?

896
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:51,083
What is she?

897
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:54,542
Ambrosius, I am begging you to trust me.

898
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:01,792
Arrest them.

899
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,750
You wanna know who the kid is?

900
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,458
Oh, I like where this is going.

901
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:08,667
You wanna show 'em?

902
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,958
I'd love to.

903
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,375
Let's break stuff.

904
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,792
Metal.

905
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,000
Is that a gorilla?

906
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,083
Oh!

907
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,417
[roars]

908
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,250
Bloop.

909
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,417
[roaring]

910
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,292
- Give me a sword.
- We need to get you to safety.

911
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,042
- Aah!
- Get this thing in the air now!

912
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,167
[Nimona laughs]

913
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:41,833
- Oh!
- Sorry, not sorry!

914
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:48,125
- You see a way out of here?
- Of horse I do.

915
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,625
Okay, that was terrible.

916
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,250
Stop that... horse?

917
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:55,250
- We're going over, aren't we?
- Yep! The only way out is down.

918
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:58,667
- Horse!
- Why are we always falling?!

919
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,208
Ha ha! Told you you'd want the wings.
Whoo-hoo!

920
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,375
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

921
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,042
- Okay, that was super gross.
- Ha ha, I know!

922
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,125
Well, if it isn't the golden boy.

923
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:28,708
- That's the otter that bit me!
- I can see your confusion.

924
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:31,500
It has the tail of a river otter,
but the webbed back feet...

925
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:36,542
Did I ever mean anything to you?
Or was it all just a lie?

926
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,833
A lie? Says the guy running around
with a monster!

927
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,875
Don't call her that! She's smart,
kind, and quite sophisticated.

928
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,333
That guy just peed his armor!
He peed his armor!

929
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:48,583
And she has my back, unlike you.

930
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,417
You lied to me about everything!

931
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,875
Only one lying to you is the Director!

932
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,083
What? You're gonna kill me now too?

933
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,167
You believe that?

934
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,875
Then you never knew me at all.

935
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,000
[laughing]

936
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:14,208
Yeah. Now I'm gonna punch you in the face.

937
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,417
Now, I'm no doctor,
but this cast looks delicious.

938
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,167
Boss?

939
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,042
[growling]

940
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,250
You think this hurts?

941
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,833
Wait till you see what we do
to your pet monster.

942
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:35,833
[growling]

943
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,625
No! Leave her alone!

944
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,625
Kwispy! Wait, what?

945
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,000
Hope you brought milk.

946
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,875
No!

947
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:53,833
Wait, wait! No, no!

948
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
What?

949
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,875
[siren blares]

950
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,083
[automated voice]
<i>Monster attack. Monster attack.</i>

952
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,375
[gasps]

953
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,917
<i>- Monster attack. Monster attack.</i>
- It's okay.

954
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,333
<i>...immediate shelter.</i>

955
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,750

[whimpering]

<i>- Monster attack.</i>
- [knight] Her! Come on!

961
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,708
- I've got you, kid!
- No! Stop!

962
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,333
- Are you okay?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

963
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,083
- I know something's wrong.
- I said I don't wanna talk about it!

964
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,500
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

965
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,042
I don't need your help!

966
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:53,083
[panting]

967
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,833
[panting]

968
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:02,292
Did you see the way
that little girl looked at me?

969
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:04,917
Kids.

970
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:06,875
Little kids.

971
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:11,208
They grow up believing
that they can be a hero

972
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:14,708
if they drive a sword into the heart
of anything different.

973
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:17,833
And I'm the monster?

974
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,667
I don't know what's scarier.

975
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:32,875
The fact that everyone in this kingdom
wants to run a sword through my heart...

976
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,417
or that sometimes

977
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:39,833
I just wanna let 'em.

978
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,833
We have to get you out of here.

979
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,250
We'll go over the wall.

980
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,375
We won't stop
until we find someplace safe.

981
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,208
Okay, we'll go together.

982
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,833
Together?

983
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:58,958
Listen, you were right about everything.
The Institute, the wall...

984
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,417
Ambrosius.

985
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:08,083
No matter what we do,
we can't change the way people see us.

986
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:12,667
You changed the way you see me.

987
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:17,958
Didn't you?

988
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:26,000
We can't let the Director
get away with this.

989
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,583
We shouldn't have to run.

990
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,292
And you made a deal, right?

991
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:33,292
We clear your name,
you make me your sidekick.

992
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,333
You can't back out on a deal
because you believe in truth and honor

993
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:38,375
and blah, blah, blah.
All that stupid stuff.

994
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,042
Truth and honor aren't stupid,
but all right.

995
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,250
So, you got a plan?

996
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,583
'Course I got a plan.

997
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,375
Something, something, something...

998
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,458
We win.

999
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,813
[knight] Excuse me, but the Director
isn't available right now.

1000
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,333
We need to talk!

1001
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:05,292
Alone.

1002
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,375
Was Ballister telling the truth?

1003
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:18,625
He could've said anybody killed the queen,
but he said you. Why you?

1004
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:23,708
Sir Goldenloin,
is your loyalty to this kingdom

1005
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,375
or to a knight
who consorts with a monster?

1006
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,292
Did you swap his sword?

1007
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,000
Did you set him up?

1008
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,250
Tell me the truth!

1009
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:38,250
[sighs]

1010
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,708
Ever since I was young,
I've had the same nightmare.

1011
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,667
I find a crack in the wall.

1012
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:51,125
I yell out,

1013
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,792
but no one listens.

1014
00:53:56,583 --> 00:54:00,083
And the crack grows bigger and bigger

1015
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,667
until the wall crumbles

1016
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,417
and the monsters pour in.

1017
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:11,208
I begged the queen
not to question the word of Gloreth.

1018
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:15,042
Not to question what's kept us safe
for a thousand years.

1019
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,208
But she wouldn't listen.

1020
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:23,792
Allowing Ballister to hold the sword
was the first crack in the wall.

1021
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,333
And now

1022
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:30,250
we have a monster in our kingdom.

1023
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:31,917
Is that...

1024
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,167
[sighs]

1025
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,458
I'm sorry, Ambrosius.

1026
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,417
Ahh...

1027
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,792
Ohh!

1028
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:52,708
So, yes, I framed Ballister.

1029
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,708
I killed the queen.

1030
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,875
Gloreth did whatever it took
to keep the monsters out.

1031
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:06,958
And so will I.

1032
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,583
[hacking]

1033
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:11,917
Ahh.

1034
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,292
[gasps]

1035
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,167
[groaning]

1036
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,083
May Gloreth forgive you.

1037
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:26,792
[fast-paced rewind]

1038
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,833
[Director]
<i>So, yes, I framed Ballister.</i>

1039
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:31,333
<i>I killed the queen.</i>

1040
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,750
I can't wait for the kingdom to see this.

1041
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:34,917
You.

1042
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,708
Well, and my sidekick.
Round of applause, ladies and gents.

1043
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:42,292
Was my acting okay? I was a little worried
my last "Ehh" was too over the top.

1044
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,917
If you're looking for feedback,
it was a little dramatic.

1045
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,083
You won't win any awards, but it was good.

1046
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:48,333
I've never taken a class.

1047
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:49,667
Really? That's a surprise.

1048
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,500
Not a one.
Oh, don't forget your sword, boss.

1049
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:53,792
Eh, she can keep it.

1050
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,667
I don't fight for her anymore.

1051
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,417
You called me your sidekick.

1052
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,583
I did, didn't I?

1053
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:01,500
[singsong]
You called me your sidekick.

1054
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,250
And I regret it already.

1055
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,542
[singsong] You called me your sidekick.
You called me...

1056
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:09,458
We need to talk.

1057
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:11,417
[growl]

1058
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:12,958
Bad time?

1059
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,083
Come on, come on!

1060
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:22,833
Whoo-hoo!

1061
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:26,208
Yes! Let's take that pooch for a walk.

1062
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:27,583
Eight, nine, ten.

1063
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:31,583
Ooh, landing you in the Enchanted Forest,
which is my domain.

1064
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,542
Cha-ching. 600 gold, please.

1065
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,542
My Scottie dog
will not pay your tyrannical toll.

1066
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,875
He rallies the oppressed
woodland creatures and starts a rebellion.

1067
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,583
[blows fanfare]
Squirrels scale the castle walls!

1068
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:47,167
Bears batter down the gates!
Letting chaos ensue!

1069
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,167
[burbles, screams]

1070
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,667
- I'm still taking the 600 gold.
- What?

1071
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:04,083
You didn't tell me you could breathe fire.

1072
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,375
Oh.

1073
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:10,417
[chuckles]
Metal. Best two out of three?

1074
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:14,417
What?

1075
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:16,292
Nothing.

1076
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,833
[beeping]

1077
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,167
Hey, check it out.

1078
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:25,000
Whoa! A hundred... 500... 30,000...

1079
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:28,542
Seventy-five...
The whole kingdom is seeing this thing.

1080
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,458
Well, I guess
there's only one question left.

1081
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:32,667
What's that?

1082
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:34,667
Can a shark dance?

1083
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,458
Can a shark dance?

1084
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,875

What?

This was all her plan.

All of it.

1173
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,125
She's evil, Bal.

01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,750
E-Evil?

1175
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:55,417
No, you're wrong.
We've been wrong about everything.

Wrong about everything? Then explain this.

01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,792
It's her, Bal.

1181
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,833
She's Gloreth's monster.

1182
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,708
She's come back
to finish what she started,

1183
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:17,167
and she's using you to do it.

1184
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,500
But she's my friend.

1185
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,000
Aren't I more than that?

1186
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,625
We can slay this monster.
We can go back to the way things were.

1187
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,292
- This was a mistake.
- Bal, please.

1188
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,042
- No, I can't do this. I'm done!
- Listen to me!

1189
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,167
She's using you to destroy the kingdom!

1190
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,708
- You know what she is.
- Stop!

1191
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:36,625
- Why won't you admit it? You're in danger!
- Why can't you just leave me alone?

1192
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,833
Because I love you.

1193
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:11,250
Ohh.
I have not slept like that in forever.

1194
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,458
Why do you have your cloak on?

1195
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:20,917
Is this you?

1196
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:25,083
Where did you get that?
Who have you been talking...

1197
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,583
Tell me this isn't you.

1198
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,792
You think that I would do that?

1199
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,375
That that's who I am?

1200
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:32,458
I don't know.

1201
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,750
You're the one who told me
not to trust anybody, question everything.

1202
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,542
That's right! Even now, with this,

1203
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,708
think about everything
we have been through together.

1204
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:42,833
I'm thinking about everything we've done.

1205
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:47,458
Broken out of jail, stolen cars,
kidnapped people, manipulated people.

1206
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:48,542
I was helping you.

1207
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,375
You were using me!
