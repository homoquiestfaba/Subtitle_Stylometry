Thanks, but I could've sworn
that I heard voices.

Your mother was selling cotton candy
at the church fair.

01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:08,043
And when I saw her...

969
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:12,450
...I just kept buying it,
just so I could talk to her.

970
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:19,485
And that night, I saw her sitting
on the stairs outside the church hall...

01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:24,687
...inside the band was playing this song,
and everybody was dancing.

...but I was too nervous.

974
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:36,267
So instead I just asked her
if I could sit with her.

We just sat there.

Listening to this song, our song...

...not saying a word.

You're late.

997
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:08,796
You're old. Let's cut the chitchat
and get down to business.

998
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:12,665
- Who are you calling old?
- Gee, let me think.

999
01:06:13,105 --> 01:06:16,836
DENISE: Yeah, well, you know what?
This old lady is the one holding the cash.

1000
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:20,410
So listen, you little punk,
you will do exactly as I say...

1001
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:25,040
...or I will find you
and I will get back more than this money.

1002
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:35,150
Oh, boy.

1003
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,420
EDDIE: After everything
I've put you and the girls through...

1004
01:06:38,598 --> 01:06:40,532
...this would just be my way of...

1005
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,498
...you know, making it up to everybody.
What do you say?

1006
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:48,037
Well, if you really think
you can pull this off, you can stay.

1007
01:06:48,207 --> 01:06:49,674
Yes.

1008
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,977
Eddie.

1009
01:06:56,148 --> 01:06:59,049
That was a wonderful thing you did
for your daughter out there.

1010
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,519
It took a great deal of courage.

1011
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:07,216
You faced your fears, and I dare say,
you are a changed man.

1012
01:07:09,428 --> 01:07:10,452
Yes, ma'am.

1013
01:07:21,841 --> 01:07:25,106
- Get Rocky on the phone, call in that favor.
CATALINA: Eddie.

1014
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:28,611
Thank goodness you are back.
We got Denise trouble.

1015
01:07:29,482 --> 01:07:32,110
This hat contains four slips of paper...

1016
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:35,914
...with the name
of the four final relay events.

1017
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:37,214
Wow.

1018
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,723
One of you will swing your way
to survival.

1019
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:45,887
And you will then tag-off to another
who will scale the Wall of Destiny.

1020
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:49,728
And finally, the last two
will work as a team...

1021
01:07:50,636 --> 01:07:54,766
...high atop the rock,
a treacherous ropes course.

1022
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:58,468
The most challenging of all.

1023
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:02,508
EDDIE:
All right, hold it right there.

1024
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:05,615
Hey, look. It's the inverted man.

1025
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:07,753
We're not used to seeing you
upside-right.

1026
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,047
And his friend, Special Agent Matthews.

1027
01:08:10,222 --> 01:08:15,285
And his even better friend,
Special Agent Gomez.

1028
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:18,259
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1029
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:19,693
You brought the feds?

1030
01:08:19,865 --> 01:08:22,834
- What did she want you to do?
- Just mess with some girls.

1031
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:24,936
Slime the ground, a few ropes.

1032
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:27,538
You're looking at two, four,
maybe 10 years.

1033
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,873
CATALINA: You got any tattoos?
- No, ma'am.

1034
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:32,374
Don't worry, you will.

1035
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:38,012
- Unless you boys decide to cooperate.
- Okay.

1036
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:40,709
- Yeah.
- Good.

1037
01:08:42,655 --> 01:08:45,283
All right. All right, Wasps.

It's okay, you go first.

Oh, no. I knew it.

I'm on top.

It's okay, I'm drawing your safety line.
I got your back.

I am not comfortable
with you doing the course.

1055
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:46,541
- I'll talk to Miss Hulka, see if we can...
- It's okay. I'll do it.

1056
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,486
- There is no reason that you have to...
- No, really. I want to.

1057
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:55,349
All right. But if you change your mind...

1058
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:57,462

- Looking for someone, Denise?
- I'm surprised they let you back in.

1073
01:10:55,254 --> 01:10:58,849
I think today's gonna be full of surprises.
Time to change the baby.

I don't know what you're up to,
but it's not gonna work.

- Baby go boom-boom.
- What?

Stinky boom-boom for Daddy. Over.

Oh, no.

Go.
