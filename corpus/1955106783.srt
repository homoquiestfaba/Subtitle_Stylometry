1
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:08,039
<i>Ready.</i>

2
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,542
<i>Set, hut!</i>

3
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,483
<i>Nice job, nice job.
Tempo, tempo. Let's go.</i>

4
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:22,751
<i>On the ball, on the ball. Let's go.</i>

5
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:23,719
<i>On the ball, let's go.</i>

6
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:25,254
<i>Reset.</i>

7
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,024
<i>Tempo, tempo. Let's pick
it up this time, boys.</i>

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,192
<i>What personnel they got, Coach?
All right, let's change it.</i>

9
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:31,193
<i>Wall right, wall right.</i>

10
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:32,728
<i>Make sure you pick off the flyer.</i>

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,330
<i>Here we go, here we
go. Everybody up!</i>

12
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,599
<i>Ready. Set!</i>

13
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,804
- <i>Watch the motion.</i>
- <i>Set, hut!</i>

14
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:44,107
<i>There you go, get it, get it.
Turn up, turn up, turn up!</i>

15
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,108
<i>Think fast! There you go.</i>

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,443
<i>Just like this.</i>

17
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,779
<i>There you go. Nice job. Nice job.</i>

18
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:57,285
<i>Mike did. Someone to help me</i>

19
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:58,754
<i>with maximum protection. Mike did.</i>

20
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,757
<i>Someone to help me call
the play. Mike did.</i>

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,559
<i>Someone to help me get the
team in line. Mike did it.</i>

22
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,795
<i>Mike controlled it, Mike ran it.</i>

23
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:09,798
<i>We needed him, we used
him, we leaned on him.</i>

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,336
<i>He was our strength in our offense.</i>

25
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:16,706
<i>I know this man. I know his
backside as well as anybody.</i>

26
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:23,578
<i>Simply, nothing has ever
compared to Mike Webster.</i>

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,648
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the greatest center in</i>

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,783
<i>the history of the
National Football League,</i>

29
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:29,485
<i>your inductee into the Hall of Fame,</i>

30
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:33,556
<i>number 52, "Iron Mike" Webster!</i>

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,396
Way to go, Mike!

32
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,533
<i>Uh...</i>

33
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,202
<i>I'd like to begin...</i>

34
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:51,842
<i>Um, obviously, I want it to be
fun, but I want to be truthful.</i>

35
00:01:53,311 --> 00:02:00,550
<i>'Cause the people out there are
tremendous fans, uh, locally.</i>

36
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:05,220
<i>But as we, uh, as we go through
this, I want you to understand</i>

37
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:08,157
<i>the greatest thing
that has happened to me</i>

38
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,029
<i>in my experience of
professional football</i>

39
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:19,769
<i>is to have the opportunity to work
with people with a common goal</i>

40
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,108
<i>and with the same
purpose, and to sacrifice.</i>

41
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,317
<i>I'll say this,</i>

42
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,322
<i>it's painful playing
football, obviously.</i>

43
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:42,191
<i>And, uh, it's not a
lot of fun out there</i>

44
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:46,194
<i>to be in two-a-day drills
in the heat of the summer,</i>

45
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,230
<i>and, uh, banging heads.</i>

46
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,033
<i>It's not a natural thing.</i>

47
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:07,317
<i>I was scared I'd fail. Honest
to God, I was scared I'd fail.</i>

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,822
<i>I'm still scared of that.</i>

49
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:45,956
<i>And all we have to do
is finish the game.</i>

50
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:50,428
<i>If we finish, we win.</i>

51
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:55,834
<i>Yeah.</i>

52
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:25,361
The state has asked, after a lengthy trial,

53
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,729
a death sentence and two appeals,

54
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,732
why we would learn anything new from you.

55
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:34,703
Dr. Omalu, do you have a medical degree?

56
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:39,008
Uh, yes. From the University of Nigeria.

57
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,712
At Enugu, Nigeria.

58
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,513
And I did my residency

59
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:49,619
at Columbia University
Medical School in New York.

60
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:52,455
Um, I also have master's degrees

61
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:55,924
in Public Health and Epidemiology.

62
00:04:55,926 --> 00:05:00,462
In addition, I am a
certified physician executive,

63
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:04,299
uh, with a specialty in Emergency Medicine.

64
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,701
And, of course, I'm board-certified

65
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:12,008
in Forensic Pathology, Clinical
Pathology and Anatomic Pathology.

66
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,513
Uh, my... My focus is Neuropathology,
the examination of the brain.

67
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,049
- While working as a Medical...
- I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry.

68
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,886
Uh, I'm also completing my MBA
at Carnegie Mellon University.

69
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:29,525
Oh, uh, and, uh, before I came to America,

70
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,893
a master's degree in the Theory of Music

71
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,932
from the Royal School of Music in London.

72
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:42,638
Oh, but... Oh, your... Your original
question, uh, what can I add?

73
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,309
Um...

74
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:50,412
My specialty is the science of death.

75
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,748
I think more about why people die

76
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,954
than I do the way people live.

77
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,523
Hands of the deceased.

78
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,393
Broken and dislodged fingernails.

79
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:10,100
The hands of a woman who fought
wildly for her life and lost.

80
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,402
The hands of the
defendant, Thomas Chambers.

81
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,972
And that is, in fact,
the blood of the victim.

82
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:19,674
Now, doesn't that suggest that
the state has the right man?

83
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:23,679
I thought so, until I heard hour 217

84
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,847
of Mr. Chambers' police interview.

85
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:30,686
I heard him very clearly
say, "I hate blood.

86
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:33,022
"I had a tooth pulled as a child once

87
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,590
"and it would not stop bleeding."

88
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,893
- So, I got curious.
- What about?

89
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:41,963
Hands. I could not reconcile
these conflicting sets of hands.

90
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,965
So, my mind... My mind is... My mind

91
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,934
is going mad, and I'm trying to figure out

92
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:50,071
if Thomas Chambers' family
has a history of hemophilia.

93
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:52,974
So, I asked his father
and, uh, his father said no.

94
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:56,746
But there is a strain of
hemophilia, hemophilia A,

95
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,849
so rare that it is never tested for.

96
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:02,717
Mr. Chambers tested
positive for hemophilia A.

97
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,587
His hands may have touched the victim,

98
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,691
perhaps to aid her, as he claims.

99
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,693
If his hands had been the murder weapon,

100
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,727
if he had been scratched or bitten,

101
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,097
he would have bled to death.

102
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,868
If the state of Pennsylvania
moves forward to execute,

103
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,573
you will be killing an innocent man.

104
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,242
Way to go, Joe.

105
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,678
Good morning, Gracie.

106
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,114
Good morning, Dr. Omalu.

107
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:40,615
- Here are the cases for today. Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. This is from yesterday.

108
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:41,950
Hey, we got a full room today.

109
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:43,653
- Cycle 'em through.
- Yes.

110
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,697
Let's begin with Rachel Green.

111
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,191
Okay, Rachel, I need your help.

112
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:24,960
We are in this together.

113
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,528
Please help me find out
what happened to you.

114
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,062
Here we go.

115
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,734
Danny, come on.

116
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:36,205
Gracie.

117
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:39,509
Dr. Omalu uses different
stuff. Makes less of a mess.

118
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:31,125
<i>Possible causal relationship</i>

119
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:35,630
<i>between self-medication
and early head trauma,</i>

120
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,800
leading to narcotics abuse and overdose.

121
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,168
You're not her shrink, Bennet!

122
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,739
If I know how she lived,
I know why she died.

123
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,740
And you should be careful, Danny.

124
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,378
One day, I may be rushing
through your autopsy.

125
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:58,821
<i>Dr. Wecht, Dr. Omalu
is here to see you.</i>

126
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:02,090
You know the reason you're
not back in Nigeria, don't you?

127
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:04,692
Uh, yes. Because I remind you of you.

128
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,228
Only less handsome.

129
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,832
Sit.

130
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:12,234
What the hell is going on down there?

131
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,302
Nothing. I'm doing my work. I'm fine.

132
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,937
You're not fine.

133
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:19,974
Danny hates your guts. I've
never seen anything like it.

134
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,976
I think you're working a little too slow.

135
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:23,345
I'm a doctor.

136
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,849
The dead are my patients.
I treat them with respect.

137
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,850
But do you have to talk to them?

138
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,952
If you have to do that,
talk to them in your head.

139
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,123
And we discussed the knives.
You're still throwing them away.

140
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,393
We're a public agency in Pittsburgh.

141
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,994
They're expensive. Reuse them.

142
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,864
Would you want me to cut open your mother

143
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,769
with the same knife I
used on a serial killer?

144
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,439
Yes.

145
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:52,074
I'd probably request it.

146
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:56,345
Cyril.

147
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:58,980
You need a girlfriend.

148
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,652
You need to touch somebody
alive every once in a while.

149
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,421
Living women are... Well,
occasionally they're a pain in the ass,

150
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,022
but quite often, they're amazing.

151
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,456
Give it a try.

152
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,957
Okay.

153
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,393
Just be a little less of an artist.

154
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,364
- Fit in a little more.
- Yes.

155
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,897
It's another death row case.

156
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,268
The guy's being railroaded.

157
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,839
$1,000 for you.

158
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,575
Cyril.

159
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,744
Uh...

160
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,840
Webby.

161
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,808
Hey, man.

162
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,845
I am loving the digs.

163
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,849
Mike.

164
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,652
It's Justin.

165
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,353
I'll just sit with you for a minute, huh?

166
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,354
Yeah.

167
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,902
Jugger.

168
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:28,970
We're all worried about you, man.

169
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,205
What are you doing, Mike? Mike! Mike!

170
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,374
- What are y'all doing? Give me that.
- No, no, no!

171
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,009
It's all right. It's just...

172
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,845
I just...

173
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,349
I don't want to go to sleep.

174
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,952
I heard you sold your
Super Bowl rings, Mike.

175
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,890
Your Super Bowl rings, Mike.

176
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,130
Mike, hey.

177
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,967
Pam's your wife.

178
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,402
- Garrett's your boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

179
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,777
I'm starting to forget things.

180
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,513
I'm saying this crazy crap to my kids.

181
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:15,485
I nearly pushed Keana into a wall.

182
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,186
I never thought I'd do that to her.

183
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,521
All right, well, don't...

184
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,892
Just don't give up.

185
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:28,497
All we got to do is finish the game.

186
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,501
We'll all be winners. Okay?

187
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,954
Have a good day. It's good to see you.

188
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,489
Bennet! A moment?

189
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,091
Yes, Father.

190
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,960
- How are you?
- We have a new member.

191
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,296
A young lady from Kenya.

192
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:37,398
She came to us a couple weeks
ago and she needs our help.

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,867
Oh, sure. How much do you need, Father?

194
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:42,204
She needs shelter, Bennet. Until
we find her something permanent.

195
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,907
Father, I'm working on my MBA.

196
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,407
I'm studying. My books
are all over, everywhere.

197
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,976
She's a nice girl. She's from Nairobi.

198
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,412
Went to British school.

199
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,180
She wants to work.

200
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,017
We're letting her tidy
up around the church.

201
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,120
We're asking you because we know
she'll be safe and cared for.

202
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:01,989
I feel God in you, Bennet.

203
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,561
Thank you, Father.

204
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,998
Who is she?

205
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,164
So, uh...

206
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,167
You can see.

207
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:55,946
That is, uh, basically my office, there.

208
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,119
Is that your father?

209
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,456
Ah, yes. The chief.

210
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,059
Um...

211
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,695
Those are my peaches.

212
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:14,730
They should not be here.

213
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,065
Your room.

214
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,235
Uh, your room. There is a...

215
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:23,907
The key, I have it for you.

216
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,011
Um...

217
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,146
How are you for... For money?

218
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:32,883
I have some.

219
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,020
No...

220
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,924
Need is not weak.

221
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:45,128
Need is need.

222
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,496
I know where you are.

223
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,234
I was you.

224
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,503
You're in America now.

225
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:59,243
So, you have to be the
best version of yourself.

226
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,077
If you don't know what that is,

227
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,480
you pick something and fake it.

228
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,782
So, I will just...

229
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,717
There, for you.

230
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:12,053
What did you pick?

231
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,821
- What did I pick?
- To fake.

232
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:19,127
I picked an older bald-headed white man.

233
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,830
Why an older bald-headed white man?

234
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:27,271
Because he is the best at what he does.

235
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,041
Do you want to see your room?

236
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:51,061
I was a registered nurse at the
Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.

237
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,530
I understand.

238
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,567
I meant no offense.

239
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,538
Hey!

240
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,506
Hey, wake up!

241
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,243
Hey! Wake up, you.

242
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,579
Come on, now. This ain't no
hotel. You can't sleep here.

243
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,015
Put down your window, let's go!

244
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,721
Wait.

245
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,590
You're Mike Webster, right?

246
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:24,292
Iron Mike.

247
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,194
<i>I called for him. He's coming.</i>

248
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:28,165
Okay, but I don't see him.

249
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,532
Oh.

250
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:33,167
Come on, come on.

251
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,337
Come on, come on.

252
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,474
Oh, what? What is...

253
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,886
Oh, look at that.

254
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:53,389
Mike, he's here.

255
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,323
Hey, Mike.

256
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,926
- Look, can you, uh...
- Mike, can you hear me?

257
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,628
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You just, uh...

258
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,831
You just have to tell me
what to do, because I am...

259
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,833
I am freaking overwhelmed.

260
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,502
We're gonna get you some help, Mike.

261
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,670
What are you taking right now?

262
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:11,106
Oh, the Ritalin.

263
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,274
Dexedrine, Prozac, Klonopin,
you're still taking all of those?

264
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:14,376
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:15,644
Come sit down, Mike.

266
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,378
All of it, okay? And superglue.

267
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,446
- Okay.
- Yeah, superglue.

268
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:22,484
3.5 Haldol. You call his
wife. You tell her he's worse.

269
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:23,784
He's a lot worse.

270
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,419
You were my doctor. You
were my doctor, right?

271
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:26,754
I was the team doctor.

272
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:29,491
Okay! Okay, all right,
then, the team doctor!

273
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,693
All right? The team doctor!

274
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:33,661
All right? Then why aren't
you helping me, all right?

275
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,796
- I am gonna help you.
- You are not helping me.

276
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,399
You got to fix this! You
got to fix this! All right?

277
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,267
In here, all right?

278
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:43,838
And in here. I am dying in here!

279
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,372
- I'm dying in here, all right?
- Dr. Bailes.

280
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:46,808
I hear you, Mike.

281
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,946
It's okay.

282
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,513
Let me give you something
to help you rest, Mike.

283
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,715
You want to rest, don't you?

284
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:58,653
I just want you to help me, all
right? I just want you to help me.

285
00:20:58,655 --> 00:20:59,920
I will help you, Mike.

286
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,555
Just help me. Just...

287
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,260
- Come and sit down.
- Okay.

288
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,129
Come and sit down.

289
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,935
Well, go ahead, give me the
drugs, give me the drugs.

290
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,303
Show me how you're gonna help me.

291
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:17,973
- Don't move, Mike.
- Mmm-hmm.

292
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,909
Ow!

293
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:22,843
Come and sit down, Mike.

294
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,678
Ooh.

295
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,249
Ooh.

296
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,152
- Ooh.
- Come lay down, Mike.

297
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:37,094
You rest now, Mike.

298
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,964
What am I missing?

299
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:45,367
- Tumor?
- No.

300
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,936
All of his scans were clean.

301
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,808
<i>Through the years,
the dauntless Webster</i>

302
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,877
<i>had abandoned his
family, slipped into</i>

303
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,612
<i>financial chaos and homelessness.</i>

304
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,815
<i>This is a hard day for the city
of Pittsburgh. On a personal note,</i>

305
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,685
<i>I can remember sitting
down with my father</i>

306
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,954
<i>and him giving me examples
of hard work ethic</i>

307
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,624
<i>and telling me when you get knocked
down, you get back up again.</i>

308
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:46,494
I'm sorry, uh, I don't usually watch TV.

309
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,663
Then why do you have one?

310
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:51,501
One has a TV in this country.

311
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:05,080
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't
usually eat breakfast.

312
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:08,150
One should eat breakfast in this country.

313
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,730
Dear God,

314
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:23,465
thank You for the gifts You have

315
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,833
so graciously bestowed upon us.

316
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:29,404
Please help us to continue to
be deservant of Your blessings.

317
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,106
Amen.

318
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:32,875
Bennet!

319
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:35,409
<i>Just hours after he was
rushed to the nearby hospital,</i>

320
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:37,512
<i>football Hall of Famer,
Iron Mike Webster...</i>

321
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,847
What is going on?

322
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,115
Mike Webster.

323
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:41,683
Who's Mike Webster?

324
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,118
He's the greatest center
to ever play the game.

325
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,651
He's a true warrior.

326
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:45,719
Um...

327
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,821
I'm sorry. What is a center?

328
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,424
The big guy in the middle. Hikes it.

329
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:51,458
My kid plays football because of this guy.

330
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,594
Okay, I'm sorry. I just
did not know who he was.

331
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:54,795
Well, if you're gonna live in this town,

332
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,798
you gonna work in this town,
football is a good thing.

333
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,832
I freaking can't believe it's you.

334
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:01,602
Well, as you know, I was put on
the schedule for this weekend.

335
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,605
I am put on the schedule for every weekend.

336
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,610
Come on. Come on.

337
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,880
The whole town was out of work.

338
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:15,049
He was a guy who gave us hope
when there really was no hope.

339
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:18,522
Just leave him be.

340
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,626
Look at his teeth.

341
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:28,498
He was pulling them out and
supergluing them back in.

342
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,801
Gracie, full autopsy, please.

343
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,770
Hey, come on, man. There's no
need to cut this man's body.

344
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:38,807
Why does an apparently healthy
favorite son of this city

345
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,412
become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?

346
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:47,115
Cardiac arrest may be
how he died, but not why.

347
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,015
Prepare the body, please.

348
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:49,652
Yes.

349
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,992
I think what he's saying is that

350
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:01,663
sometimes in life, you know, you just...

351
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:04,032
You're asked to leave it alone.

352
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,934
But, uh, sometimes you can't.

353
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:08,168
Mmm.

354
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,473
Do you believe that he thinks this is
a time that I should leave it alone?

355
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,974
No, I don't.

356
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:15,209
I never leave it alone.

357
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:17,646
That's why people hate me.

358
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,694
Mike.

359
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:10,130
People are saying bad things about you.

360
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:13,201
I can tell something is wrong.

361
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:15,837
But I can't do this alone.

362
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,609
I need your help to tell the
world what happened to you.

363
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:08,758
Hmm.

364
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,343
Oh, uh, sorry. Um...

365
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,848
Regular folds of gray matter.

366
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,917
No obvious contusions.

367
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,689
No shrinkage from Alzheimer's.

368
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,395
What's wrong?

369
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,535
Uh, can you show me the
CT scan again, please?

370
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:58,840
How old are these?

371
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:00,707
Mmm, six months.

372
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,646
Six months.

373
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,430
This brain should be a mess.

374
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:25,534
- But it looks completely normal.
- Mmm.

375
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:33,374
Records say severe headaches,
double vision, voices in his head.

376
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,676
No documented concussions.

377
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,878
He did complain of dizziness.

378
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,447
- Yes. How often?
- Once.

379
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:44,418
In 18 years of professional football?

380
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,154
"Joseph Maroon."

381
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:48,425
Sign the certificate. Sew him up.

382
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:54,061
Fix the brain, please.

383
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:57,264
You know we don't have
the budget to do that.

384
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,434
People do not go mad for no reason.

385
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:00,435
I'm going to continue looking.

386
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,770
No, you're not going to.

387
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:04,871
Danny, you are out of line.

388
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,175
Hey, you do not speak to me like that!

389
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,142
- I am the pathologist on duty!
- Oh, man.

390
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,012
- I am the pathologist of record!
- Hey! Listen!

391
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:12,980
This is not your laboratory!

392
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:15,449
My hands are on this body!
If I am wrong, I am wrong!

393
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,285
- And you are wrong.
- Not you, me!

394
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,487
Fix that brain.

395
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:23,190
Hey, I am gonna make sure
they don't pay for any of this.

396
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:26,226
I am going to write my orders
for the tests that I need.

397
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:27,294
And you're paying for it yourself.

398
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:28,795
Yes, Danny.

399
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:30,933
Please, exit my workplace.

400
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,170
Please!

401
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:40,808
<i>In 25 years, I've never requested
a panel of tests like this.</i>

402
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,376
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

403
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:47,482
There is not a single
case in a book or in life

404
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:52,219
where a man that healthy
went that mad that young

405
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:54,990
with no visible abnormality of the brain.

406
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,826
I don't know what I'm looking for.

407
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:00,697
I can tell.

408
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:04,165
It's going to cost you a fortune.

409
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,067
I understand.

410
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,801
Okay.

411
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:09,837
Well, if you have to play hero,

412
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,408
just make sure we both come out okay.

413
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:55,817
Dr. Omalu. You got something
today. Left it on your desk.

414
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,350
Oh, thank you.

415
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,047
Prema!

416
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:28,650
It's very late. Where have you been?

417
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:35,322
I got a job.

418
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:37,591
- Look at you.
- Well, uh, a shift.

419
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:42,230
At a home. Feeding old people.

420
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,868
That is fantastic. Congratulations.

421
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,969
What is that?

422
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,973
Mike Webster.

423
00:31:58,215 --> 00:31:59,446
<i>...phrase is worth $1,000.</i>

424
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,083
<i>And here we go.</i>

425
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,656
Would you like me to get
you a TV for your room?

426
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:12,493
No. This one will be fine.

427
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,664
Oh, okay.

428
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:29,109
I can't tell what you're more afraid of.

429
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:33,513
What you will find, or what you won't.

430
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:35,017
Hmm.

431
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:01,704
My God.

432
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,777
My God.

433
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:33,867
<i>...jacked up from those guys</i>

434
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,669
<i>that are gonna be racing
those sides on this.</i>

435
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,771
<i>Let's get to Jacked Up Number 5.</i>

436
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:40,608
<i>We're gonna begin with
the Rams and the Chargers.</i>

437
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,510
<i>Mark Bulger gonna be delivering
the ball to Tony Fisher.</i>

438
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,579
<i>Throws it down around his feet.</i>

439
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:48,515
<i>So, Donnie Edwards is gonna
level him right there.</i>

440
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:51,251
<i>Always be looking out for
the big hit right there.</i>

441
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:54,555
- <i>Tony Fisher got jacked up!</i>
- <i>Jacked up!</i>

442
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:57,457
<i>Number 4, the Seahawks
and the Chiefs.</i>

443
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,660
<i>D.J. Hackett is gonna make the catch</i>

444
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:02,129
<i>and Ty Law will
launch him backwards.</i>

445
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:04,599
<i>How far backwards?</i>

446
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:08,301
<i>Eyes on me! Eyes on me! Gentlemen!</i>

447
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:11,137
This is a game of awareness.

448
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:14,541
It is a game of desire. That's why
we have the three-whistle drill.

449
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:16,410
Let's go!

450
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:18,546
<i>When I blow this
whistle three times,</i>

451
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:21,148
<i>you seek out a
teammate. Any teammate.</i>

452
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,584
You make collision, you be
physical, you be violent!

453
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:25,820
Bring it in here, let's go! Bring it in!

454
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:32,292
<i>The only way you're gonna get
this player's hands off you,</i>

455
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:34,461
you grab him by the throat and you squeeze!

456
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:39,100
You choke him until shit runs
down his leg! Do you understand me?

457
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,100
- Oh!
- Ooh, ooh, wow.

458
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,579
Let's go! Let's go!

459
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,816
Drive! Drive! Hit him!

460
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,751
Hit it! Drive! Drive!

461
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:01,187
<i>The Jaguars and the
Eagles. Dirk Johnson.</i>

462
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,858
<i>And I'm gonna wait for this
because the look on his face</i>

463
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,193
- <i>tells you that he got jacked up!</i>
- <i>Jacked up!</i>

464
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,135
<i>And our Number 1 hit of the week,</i>

465
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:17,704
<i>Jon Kitna dropping back the pass,</i>

466
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:22,609
<i>and Shawntae Spencer
lifts him off his feet!</i>

467
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:27,049
- <i>Oh, my God! And Jon Kitna got jacked up!</i>
- <i>Jacked up!</i>

468
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,273
You should see this, Bennet.

469
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:58,879
It's actually really beautiful.

470
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:01,814
<i>Priest Holmes, he's diving.
Yes, he's got it! Touchdown!</i>

471
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:04,352
<i>Oh, tremendous! Tremendous catch!</i>

472
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:09,323
I want to show you something.

473
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,559
A human brain

474
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:16,199
sits in a fluid completely
disconnected from the human skull.

475
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:56,138
Bennet, will you relax?
I can hear you breathing.

476
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,351
This is a really terrible brain.

477
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,352
Ever met the great DeKosky before?

478
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:14,924
Expect two minutes, tops.

479
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:18,024
Is that him?

480
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,029
So, you're our prize graduate.

481
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,682
Tell him.

482
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,050
It's Mike Webster.

483
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,352
The Pittsburgh...

484
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:46,887
I know who Mike Webster is.

485
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,354
Steve.

486
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,259
He was 50.

487
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:07,041
You have my attention.

488
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:15,783
The Cape gannet.

489
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:21,088
A diving bird capable of generating
speeds of up to 75 miles per hour,

490
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,161
turning itself into a missile as it
collides with the face of the sea.

491
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:30,898
The red-head woodpecker can
absorb a G-force of 1,000,

492
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,401
pecking a tree 12,000 times per day,

493
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:37,340
85 million times over its lifetime.

494
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,477
Bighorn sheep can generate...

495
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,181
- Bennet.
- Hmm?

496
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,250
Okay, okay.

497
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:54,887
All of these animals have shock
absorbers built into their bodies.

498
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:56,856
The woodpecker's tongue extends through

499
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:58,492
the back of the mouth out of the nostril,

500
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,827
encircling the entire cranium.

501
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,430
It is the anatomical equivalent

502
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:05,765
of a safety belt for its brain.

503
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,767
Human beings?

504
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,738
Not a single piece of our anatomy

505
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,573
protects us from those types of collisions.

506
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:17,811
A human being will get concussed at 60 G's.

507
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:21,981
A common head-to-head
contact on a football field?

508
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:24,552
One hundred G's.

509
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:29,856
God did not intend for us to play football.

510
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:33,394
Let's keep God out of this.

511
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,595
Okay.

512
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:38,066
Um, okay. Look.

513
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:45,539
What are the S's?

514
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,841
Uh, the Steelers.

515
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:50,144
- And the O's?
- The others, obviously.

516
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,611
Yes, the other team.

517
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,546
Do you even watch football?

518
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,182
Uh, no, not at all.

519
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:57,917
But I've been studying
Mike Webster's position.

520
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,586
The man in the middle is quite deceptively

521
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:02,756
the most violent position on the field.

522
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:05,057
The slaps, the punches, the forearm.

523
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,629
It is an unremitting storm
of sub-concussive blows.

524
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:12,633
The head as a weapon on every
single play of every single game

525
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,167
of every single practice, from the time

526
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:17,171
he was a little boy to a college man,

527
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:21,441
culminating in an 18-year
professional career.

528
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:23,176
By my calculations,

529
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:25,579
Mike Webster sustained

530
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:29,384
more than 70,000 blows to his head.

531
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,921
Now, now, these men, these men,

532
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:36,657
these are the fastest.

533
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:40,626
Now, their speed multiplied by
the speed of the men who hit them,

534
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,796
the G-forces generated

535
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:46,934
equivalent to hitting them on
the helmet with a sledgehammer.

536
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,135
All of this

537
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:52,539
triggered a cascading
series of neurological events

538
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,240
which unleashed killer proteins

539
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:58,077
upon Mike Webster's brain,

540
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,084
the tangles invading and strangling
his mind from the inside out.

541
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:08,689
Like pouring wet concrete
down kitchen pipes.

542
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:13,696
As it hardens, it chokes the
brain, leaving him unrecognizable,

543
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:17,366
even to himself.

544
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:22,635
I don't know football. I've never played.

545
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:28,209
But I am telling you that playing
football killed Mike Webster.

546
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:31,845
And I am certain that there are others.

547
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,213
And how can you possibly know that?

548
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:36,149
Common sense.

549
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:37,950
But they are either dead or lost

550
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:39,720
in the way that Mike Webster was lost.

551
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,088
I'm not interested in common sense.

552
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,224
I'm interested in science.

553
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,559
And science is knowing.

554
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,229
I know from these players' records

555
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:52,666
that their doctors believe
they have early Alzheimer's,

556
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:55,234
which is statistically impossible.

557
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:57,870
They're too young.

558
00:42:57,872 --> 00:43:01,140
Because it's not Alzheimer's.

559
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:02,777
It is this.

560
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,899
I don't like it.

561
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:28,334
No.

562
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:31,338
No, actually, I hate it.

563
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,676
But as a scientist,

564
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:37,746
I can't deny it.

565
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,217
Name it. You have to give this a name.

566
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,910
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

567
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:14,280
Did they agree what it is?

568
00:44:14,282 --> 00:44:16,350
Oh.

569
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:19,986
Yes, yes. We are going to publish.

570
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:21,722
They...

571
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,224
- With you?
- Yes.

572
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:27,059
In a medical journal.

573
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:28,695
With you?

574
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:32,099
Yes, with me. Together.

575
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,335
That's so...

576
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,972
Congratulations.

577
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:41,310
Thank you. Thank you.

578
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,812
Uh, you, um...

579
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:49,349
Are you going somewhere?

580
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:51,283
Yes.

581
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:53,887
With you.

582
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,321
To celebrate.

583
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,240
You don't dance, do you?

584
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:59,982
I had quite a revelation tonight.

585
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,818
This body was made for dancing.

586
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,521
When they say "dancing
machine," I am what they mean.

587
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,862
I'm very proud of you.

588
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,899
Okay.

589
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:46,358
May I kiss you?

590
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:34,874
- Good morning.
- Cyril.

591
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:37,878
It's very weird to bring
women into the morgue at night.

592
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,945
She is a friend.

593
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:41,481
You don't have friends.

594
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,515
Listen, Danny knows she's been in there.

595
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,285
He's thinking about
filing a formal complaint.

596
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:47,220
What?

597
00:48:47,222 --> 00:48:49,122
I was working on Webster.

598
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:51,091
I know. I'll take care of it.

599
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:54,126
How much has that cost you so far?

600
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:55,195
$20,000.

601
00:48:55,197 --> 00:48:56,629
Twenty?

602
00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:58,932
I save.

603
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:01,904
- Everything.
- Really? How un-American.

604
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:05,338
Well, maybe it was worth it.

605
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,207
I got the call.

606
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:09,675
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

607
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,244
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

608
00:49:11,246 --> 00:49:13,113
Yes. CTE.

609
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:15,115
So, what happens now?

610
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:18,984
We publish. Uh, DeKosky
is going to coauthor.

611
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:20,387
- DeKosky?
- Yes.

612
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:25,524
Omalu, DeKosky and Cyril Wecht.

613
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:27,094
Oh.

614
00:49:28,195 --> 00:49:30,664
Well, I'm very proud of you.

615
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,099
Thank you.

616
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:35,267
See? The gray's the right color.

617
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:37,504
The blue shows the dirt, even in the rain.

618
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:39,708
Here you go.

619
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:48,548
Let's go, baby!

620
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:52,017
Come on, get it, get it, get it!

621
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:55,387
<i>And watch the play-action.
The safeties jump up.</i>

622
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:57,289
<i>And look at that touch
by Ben Roethlisberger.</i>

623
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:00,059
<i>And Plaxico Burress
does a great job.</i>

624
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:00,693
<i>Looked like he tripped...</i>

625
00:50:00,695 --> 00:50:03,430
You may not!

626
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:06,666
I say not to, but he does.

627
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:10,570
<i>Roethlisberger scrambling
out of the pocket.</i>

628
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,972
<i>Throwing across the middle! Caught!</i>

629
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:15,541
<i>Burress at the 45!</i>

630
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:19,181
<i>And if you don't know, Plaxico!</i>

631
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:26,655
<i>Yeah. That was a pressure
toss by the rook.</i>

632
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:30,689
- I'm hearing voices.
- Are you serious?

633
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:33,026
- They're just talking.
- Stop. Justin, stop. You're scaring me.

634
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:34,361
You're scaring them.

635
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:35,428
Look at me!

636
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:38,430
They're telling me to kill you.

637
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:40,633
They're telling me to kill you!

638
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:45,704
Get out! Get out!

639
00:50:45,706 --> 00:50:47,775
Get out!

640
00:50:58,519 --> 00:50:59,586
No!

641
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:04,490
No!

642
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:06,059
<i>All units, black pickup</i>

643
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:07,461
<i>spotted on thruway eight miles...</i>

644
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:09,762
<i>Okay, I see him. Just
passing me. Where am I?</i>

645
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:12,664
<i>Reportedly driving into
opposite traffic last 10 miles.</i>

646
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,334
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

647
00:51:14,336 --> 00:51:16,169
<i>Pickup has collided.</i>

648
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:18,040
<i>All units. Reported collision.</i>

649
00:51:36,457 --> 00:51:39,425
<i>A few months after Steeler
favorite Justin Strzelczyk</i>

650
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:42,128
<i>was killed in that fiery accident,</i>

651
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,731
<i>yet another Steeler
favorite, Terry Long,</i>

652
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:47,633
<i>has apparently committed
suicide at the age of 45.</i>

653
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:49,468
Oh, Terry.

654
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,107
You wonder where they are now? Now we know.

655
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:56,475
Terry Long, Pittsburgh Steelers.

656
00:51:56,477 --> 00:51:59,678
I guess these guys only
die when you're working.

657
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,280
What other problems did he have?

658
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:03,182
Arrested a few times.

659
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:05,818
Fraud, federal theft.

660
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,519
Wow, arrested a lot.

661
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:09,222
I need a full autopsy.

662
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:10,722
Same tests as Mike Webster.

663
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:12,358
You're paying for that, too?

664
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,063
Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too.

665
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,304
Joseph Maroon.

666
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:20,929
<i>This is my dream.</i>

667
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:26,801
The schools are good.

668
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,337
You are good, Prema.

669
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:36,277
I'm sure you see good in me.

670
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:41,116
I see all that you are.

671
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:46,087
I want to marry you.

672
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:51,025
We can fall in love.

673
00:53:57,865 --> 00:54:01,267
If you want to marry me,

674
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:03,905
I will marry you.

675
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:08,408
That is good, because I
already made the down payment.

676
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:17,853
I saved all my money and
I bought this for you.

677
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:59,360
Get me Elliot Pellman.

678
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:17,744
<i>I have Chris Jones for you.</i>

679
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:19,214
I'm just looking at it.

680
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:22,649
Anything to be concerned about?

681
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:25,885
<i>This Omalu, he's a
coroner in Pittsburgh.</i>

682
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:28,655
He looks like a nobody,
but let me get into it.

683
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:30,324
All right.

684
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:51,044
- Hello? <i>
- Is Bennet Omalu there?</i>

685
00:55:51,046 --> 00:55:53,613
Uh, yes, he is.

686
00:55:53,615 --> 00:55:55,448
Okay.

687
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,050
Yes.

688
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,352
<i>I'm a neurologist who's worked
around football for years.</i>

689
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:02,055
<i>Very familiar with the
NFL's concussion research.</i>

690
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:03,655
<i>And the League
concluded unequivocally</i>

691
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:07,026
<i>that football players
do not get brain damage.</i>

692
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:09,829
<i>Webster is one random
case, Mr. Omalu.</i>

693
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,664
Dr. Omalu.

694
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:14,767
<i>Well, whatever. You're an uneducated
quack and your career is over.</i>

695
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:20,439
<i>They said you were uneducated?</i>

696
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:22,908
Did they even read your resume?

697
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,010
Well, I got calls, too.

698
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:28,113
Apparently, the National
Football League owns neuroscience.

699
00:56:28,115 --> 00:56:29,716
Who knew?

700
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:31,550
"Failure to find."

701
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:34,419
"Absence of clinical information."

702
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,689
- What do they want?
- Your head on a spike.

703
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:38,925
They want you to retract your findings.

704
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:41,596
They want you to say you made it all up.

705
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,099
- I made it up?
- They're accusing you of fraud.

706
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:50,038
If you retract, you'll be
fine. This all goes away.

707
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:52,671
Why... Why are they doing this?

708
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:54,640
They're terrified of you.

709
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:56,776
What did you think they
were gonna say? "Thank you"?

710
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:57,910
Yes.

711
00:56:57,912 --> 00:56:59,111
What the hell for?

712
00:56:59,113 --> 00:57:00,879
For being told.

713
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,583
For knowing.

714
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,885
Oh, I understand.

715
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:08,322
You think you're being a good American.

716
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:15,595
So, the city of Pittsburgh
spent $233 million

717
00:57:15,597 --> 00:57:19,698
to build their glorious
Steelers a new stadium.

718
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:25,004
All the while, they were closing
schools and raising taxes.

719
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:28,541
These people are not
out to change the world.

720
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:32,812
And this is not some
quaint academic discovery

721
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:36,749
stuck in the back of an
obscure medical journal.

722
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:41,153
Bennet Omalu is going
to war with a corporation

723
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:45,992
that has 20 million people, on a
weekly basis, craving their product,

724
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:48,160
the same way they crave food.

725
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:53,566
The NFL owns a day of the week.

726
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:56,035
The same day the church used to own.

727
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,070
Now it's theirs.

728
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:00,308
They're very big.

729
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:16,224
Terry Long.

730
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,660
The tests came back positive.

731
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:27,166
Football gave him CTE,
and CTE told his brain

732
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:31,572
to drink a gallon of
antifreeze, and he died.

733
00:58:32,673 --> 00:58:34,576
I told you there would be more.

734
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:38,510
You have done great work.

735
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:41,146
No one would blame you if you stopped now.

736
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:43,584
Oh, no one is stopping anything.

737
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:47,086
Then I'd be lying if I didn't tell you

738
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,590
how important your next move is.

739
00:58:57,564 --> 00:59:00,233
By the time Terry Long committed suicide,

740
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:05,104
his brain had been consumed by
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

741
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:09,075
<i>And it is probable,
perhaps even likely,</i>

742
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:11,176
<i>that a larger percentage of
professional football players</i>

743
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,845
<i>have and will die from CTE.</i>

744
00:59:13,847 --> 00:59:15,680
<i>This was the Pittsburgh
Medical Examiner's</i>

745
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,216
<i>own Dr. Bennet Omalu,</i>

746
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:20,986
<i>who today threw down the gauntlet at the
feet of the National Football League.</i>

747
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:22,254
Thank you.

748
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,225
What do you think?

749
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:29,563
I think you're gonna be an American hero.

750
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:31,997
I'm not even an American.

751
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:33,599
That's even better.

752
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,603
That's so fucking American.

753
00:59:39,941 --> 00:59:43,642
"Dr. Maroon, who is also vice-chairman of

754
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:46,979
"the neurosurgery department at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,

755
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:53,852
"said of Omalu's CTE diagnosis
that it was fallacious reasoning."

756
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:02,794
Yes.

757
01:00:02,796 --> 01:00:04,229
<i>Yeah, is this Bennet Omalu?</i>

758
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:06,631
Dr. Bennet Omalu.

759
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:10,169
<i>You want to pussify this country?
You want to vaginize football?</i>

760
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:13,575
<i>Get the hell out. Or they'll
be doing your autopsy.</i>

761
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:10,296
<i>Dr. Omalu?</i>

762
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:12,365
Yes.

763
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,100
<i>I took you to be an early riser.</i>

764
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:15,800
<i>I didn't want to call
you at your office.</i>

765
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:19,305
<i>This is Julian Bailes.</i>

766
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:20,840
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

767
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:24,042
I know who you are.

768
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:27,379
Mike Webster was a personal friend.

769
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:28,847
Was he?

770
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,383
<i>Dr. Omalu.</i>

771
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:35,153
You're in trouble, but you're not wrong.

772
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:37,558
I'd like to talk with you.

773
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:11,222
The NFL has known about this
concussion crisis for years.

774
01:02:11,224 --> 01:02:14,026
And what you have there is the research

775
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:17,129
that forms the basis for the
League's concussion guidelines.

776
01:02:17,131 --> 01:02:19,298
In this study,

777
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,269
some academics put helmets on
monkeys and shook them real hard.

778
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:27,939
They threw dogs and pigs and human
cadavers down elevator shafts.

779
01:02:27,941 --> 01:02:30,742
Helmets on crash-test dummies
and bashed them together.

780
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:32,647
And their conclusion?

781
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:40,019
"No striking player experienced
neck injury or concussion."

782
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:43,923
So, a concussion's no more
dangerous than a hangnail.

783
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:46,057
- And that was it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

784
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:48,994
The NFL did what every organization does.

785
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:51,463
They put together a
commission to study the study.

786
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:55,166
Dr. Elliot Pellman's Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.

787
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:57,068
You know who else was on that committee?

788
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,271
- Dr. Maroon.
- Joe, yeah, he was on there.

789
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:02,941
Plus a couple of other team doctors,

790
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:06,512
an equipment manager and two trainers,

791
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:08,446
guys who tape knees for a living.

792
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:10,784
I mean...

793
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:24,965
Why am I here, Dr. Bailes?

794
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,202
Doctor, I'm not with the Steelers anymore.

795
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:32,773
I'm not with the NFL.

796
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:38,144
Now, do you know how many Pittsburgh
Steelers, just Steelers, now,

797
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:41,247
have died in the last few years?

798
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:43,115
And I'm not talking about the older guys.

799
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:44,883
I'm talking about men that I worked with,

800
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:47,553
and just the ones that I know about.

801
01:03:47,555 --> 01:03:49,657
Twelve.

802
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:53,392
And I don't want to see

803
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:57,732
any more of these men vanish
in the back of a pickup truck.

804
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:11,410
<i>I know them.</i>

805
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:14,012
I was them.

806
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:15,981
And I think you're doing this wrong.

807
01:04:15,983 --> 01:04:19,818
As long as the NFL continues to
deny the truth, nothing changes.

808
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,954
It's only true if they say it's true.

809
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:24,590
And they've got to say it out loud.

810
01:04:24,592 --> 01:04:26,992
Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.

811
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:28,894
I want to sit with him, man to man,

812
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:31,597
face to face. I will
make him say it out loud.

813
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,399
They don't want to talk to you.

814
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:38,303
Football does not want to talk to you.

815
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:40,840
Like my daddy, a Louisiana
judge, always used to say to me,

816
01:04:40,842 --> 01:04:45,410
"Son, God is number one
and football is number two."

817
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:49,981
Besides, to them you're not even American.

818
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:52,450
You're not even African-American.

819
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:54,522
You're...

820
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,055
A doctor?

821
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,530
Okay.

822
01:05:04,532 --> 01:05:06,332
Look.

823
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:09,901
The League has kept everyone in the dark.

824
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:13,872
And you turned on the lights and
gave their biggest boogeyman a name.

825
01:05:13,874 --> 01:05:16,075
What's happening now, what you think

826
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:18,612
they're doing to you, that's nothing.

827
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:25,617
I've done my own research on
this NFL Brain Injury Committee.

828
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,519
You know what Dr. Elliot Pellman is?

829
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:30,356
He's a rheumatologist.

830
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:33,425
He's a specialist in
arthritis and joint pain.

831
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:36,227
Can you tell me what a rheumatologist

832
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:38,799
knows about the brain and brain disease?

833
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:45,537
Corporate men like this, in this
country, usually go to Harvard or Yale.

834
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:49,608
He went to medical school in Guadalajara.

835
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,242
- Mexico?
- Yes.

836
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:54,147
I did not know that.

837
01:05:55,483 --> 01:05:57,150
That's beautiful.

838
01:06:01,622 --> 01:06:05,990
Now, two cases does not meet
the scientific burden of proof.

839
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:07,828
You have to keep going.

840
01:06:09,363 --> 01:06:14,133
Just so you understand, this
does not show up on a CT scan.

841
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:17,336
Which means there's no
diagnosis before death.

842
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:21,273
In order for me to keep
going, more have to die.

843
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:24,110
Unfortunately, that's already happening.

844
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,519
Double D.

845
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:10,455
Did I hear right? We're losing you?

846
01:07:10,457 --> 01:07:12,591
Tapping you for mayor of Chicago?

847
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:14,760
Still a long, long road, my friend.

848
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:19,530
All-world killer athlete to civilian
to king, all in one lifetime.

849
01:07:19,532 --> 01:07:23,167
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you Mayor Dave Duerson...

850
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:25,570
...who has figured it out.

851
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:31,242
- Dave!
- Yeah.

852
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,412
It's me, man. Andre Waters.

853
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:35,213
How you doing, man?

854
01:07:35,215 --> 01:07:37,118
Look, let me walk with you.

855
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:41,620
This is not good, Dave, not
good. It's in the paperwork.

856
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:44,722
But, um, why is the
committee doing this, man?

857
01:07:44,724 --> 01:07:47,191
There are five other
trustees. You talk to them?

858
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,693
You're the only one who played, man.

859
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:50,629
You the only one who
knows what it is to be us.

860
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:53,765
Hey, hey, hey. You and me,
we were the same, man, huh?

861
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,501
We were bangers, hitmen.

862
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:58,303
File the appeal.

863
01:07:58,305 --> 01:08:01,273
You denied the appeal, Dave! Look,
something's wrong with me, man.

864
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:02,640
I can't sleep. Okay...

865
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:05,144
I mean, my eyes get crossed.
It just weirds me out.

866
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:07,211
- Hey, hey! Look at me!
- Jesus!

867
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,414
Look. Twelve years I paid my dues.

868
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,350
I made millions for those assholes.

869
01:08:11,352 --> 01:08:13,519
I mean, come on. It's
not even your money, man.

870
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:16,655
I'm just asking back what I gave!

871
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:20,191
Listen. Fat? Stop eating like a
pig. Got a headache? See a doctor.

872
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:23,595
I've seen 20 doctors!
I just need rent money.

873
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:26,297
Get your shit together!

874
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:28,300
You used to be a warrior.

875
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:30,802
- You fucking sellout.
- Get your hands off me!

876
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:33,137
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
Dave. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

877
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:34,773
Look, hey, hey, hey.

878
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:38,142
Remember when we were kids?
Remember when we were kids?

879
01:08:38,144 --> 01:08:41,113
Playing's what we lived for. Huh?

880
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:44,151
I need your help. I need your help, Dave.

881
01:08:47,687 --> 01:08:49,856
Dave, help me!

882
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:03,302
"Andre Waters, known as 'Dirty Waters, '

883
01:09:03,304 --> 01:09:05,770
"notorious for his aggressive style of play

884
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:10,342
<i>"and devastating hits that
filled highlight reels.</i>

885
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:13,744
<i>"Waters died of a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.</i>

886
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:15,982
"He was 44."

887
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:27,793
And, uh, this is the part
where he, uh, got knocked out.

888
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:30,695
<i>Andre Waters has
it. We'll be back...</i>

889
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:33,198
He said he was all right.

890
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,071
Said he was just a little dazed,
but he said he was all right.

891
01:09:39,874 --> 01:09:42,076
You look well.

892
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:44,743
How are the kids?

893
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,347
Kids are fine.

894
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,183
I'm fine.

895
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:54,855
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

896
01:09:56,223 --> 01:09:59,791
No one made it to the funeral.

897
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:01,894
<i>He was the sun.</i>

898
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:05,596
We was the planets.

899
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:10,270
And then, after he gave
me this card, he said, "Ma,

900
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:17,508
"I'm ready to go."

901
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,846
Because he knew people
was thinking he was crazy.

902
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:24,783
Not crazy.

903
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:28,186
He'd already become someone else.

904
01:10:28,188 --> 01:10:32,291
You definitely think he had this disease?

905
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:34,927
Because I want to believe that.

906
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,231
I believe so, yes.

907
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:42,902
And now you want what's left of my boy.

908
01:10:44,938 --> 01:10:47,007
You heard about Mike Webster?

909
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,476
And Terry Long and...

910
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:53,811
And...

911
01:10:53,813 --> 01:10:55,949
And who else?

912
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:03,089
What do you really want to ask me, Julian?

913
01:11:30,651 --> 01:11:34,188
Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Julian Bailes.

914
01:11:35,455 --> 01:11:37,290
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm-hmm.

915
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:44,898
Andre Waters.

916
01:11:53,339 --> 01:11:55,341
Justin Strzelczyk.

917
01:12:08,321 --> 01:12:10,655
I just kept sending them back out there.

918
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:13,958
What the hell were you thinking?

919
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,793
You've got to be a part of it.

920
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:20,599
You've got to be on the
sidelines with them to understand.

921
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:24,669
Whatever it takes to keep them in the
game, to keep the whole thing going.

922
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:29,041
Tape, needles, Vicodin, Toradol, Lidocaine,

923
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:32,513
Percocet, Lexapro, Zoloft.

924
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:36,515
- Have I left anything out?
- Mmm.

925
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:38,984
It's tires and oil.

926
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:41,686
Just mechanics trying to keep
the cars on the racetrack.

927
01:12:41,688 --> 01:12:45,791
Yeah, well, it's not medicine.
I don't know what it is.

928
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:48,894
It's business.

929
01:12:48,896 --> 01:12:50,395
Oh.

930
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:52,830
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.

931
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:56,534
Three cases is the
scientific burden of evidence.

932
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:58,470
We have four.

933
01:12:58,472 --> 01:13:01,539
That is far beyond anything
the NFL can or cannot deny.

934
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,676
This is bigger than they are.

935
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:07,982
They have to listen to us now.

936
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:27,498
Dr. Maroon.

937
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,868
- Would you like a drink?
- I said five minutes.

938
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,037
He doesn't want a drink.

939
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:35,606
Your conclusions totally
misrepresent the facts.

940
01:13:35,608 --> 01:13:38,976
To say that Webster and Long and
Waters were killed by football is...

941
01:13:38,978 --> 01:13:41,879
Is fallacious reasoning.

942
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:44,983
Yes, I know.

943
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,452
Where's he going with this?

944
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:50,055
Just hear him out.

945
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:53,824
I would like to propose
a formal, controlled study

946
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:57,695
of former and current NFL football players.

947
01:13:57,697 --> 01:14:00,431
We will bring together the greatest minds

948
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:02,601
in America to solve the problem.

949
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:04,405
We should be working together.

950
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:09,807
Who do you think you're talking to?

951
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:11,110
Excuse me?

952
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:15,012
I was the President of the
Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

953
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:18,150
And I was the man who
performed the autopsies

954
01:14:18,152 --> 01:14:21,752
on Mike Webster, Terry Long.

955
01:14:21,754 --> 01:14:24,422
Your men.

956
01:14:24,424 --> 01:14:26,627
Men under your care.

957
01:14:28,995 --> 01:14:31,829
Do you know what Mike Webster's wife said?

958
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:36,636
She said that if she had
known that Mike was sick,

959
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:41,175
she would have done more for him.

960
01:14:43,143 --> 01:14:47,945
But he died in disgrace.

961
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:49,516
Your man.

962
01:14:50,983 --> 01:14:53,051
Your man.

963
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:55,854
You took an oath.

964
01:14:55,856 --> 01:14:57,788
- Tell the truth.
- The truth?

965
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,859
- Tell the truth!
- The truth is

966
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:05,365
that the NFL is a blessing
and a salvation, my friend.

967
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:09,900
We employ hundreds of thousands of people.

968
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:13,971
We send thousands and thousands
of poor kids to school.

969
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:16,675
The ownership of this football club

970
01:15:16,677 --> 01:15:20,511
has donated millions of
dollars to countless charities.

971
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:21,946
Do you want me to go on?

972
01:15:21,948 --> 01:15:23,481
That won't be necessary.

973
01:15:23,483 --> 01:15:25,816
Oh, it is necessary.

974
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:30,154
Football is the most
popular sport in America

975
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:33,225
because it is so goddamn fantastic!

976
01:15:36,696 --> 01:15:39,265
And that, right there?

977
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:44,735
That is the beating heart of this city.

978
01:15:44,737 --> 01:15:46,971
And you want to, what, end it?

979
01:15:46,973 --> 01:15:51,243
You want to fold up the
National Football League?

980
01:15:51,245 --> 01:15:53,544
I want to solve the problem.

981
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:55,579
Who are you?

982
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:56,847
What are you asking?

983
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,717
You're a pathologist.

984
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,618
You perform autopsies.

985
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,119
Yes, I am a mere pathologist.

986
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:04,590
That's it. That's all I am.

987
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,263
Wow.

988
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:15,600
Do you have any idea of the
impact of what you're doing?

989
01:16:15,602 --> 01:16:16,801
Yes, I do.

990
01:16:16,803 --> 01:16:18,235
Do you understand the impact

991
01:16:18,237 --> 01:16:20,271
of what you are doing?

992
01:16:20,273 --> 01:16:24,074
If just 10% of the mothers in America

993
01:16:24,076 --> 01:16:26,877
decide that football is too
dangerous for their sons to play,

994
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:30,715
that is it. It is the end of football.

995
01:16:30,717 --> 01:16:33,318
Kids, colleges, and eventually, it's just

996
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,154
a matter of time, the professional game.

997
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:39,658
Joe, he does autopsies. He's
not in the outcome business.

998
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,892
He has no business.

999
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:45,763
Do you know what history does to people,

1000
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:48,033
trained physicians,

1001
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:50,168
- who ignore science?
- Oh, wow.

1002
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,270
Sir, I am not done!

1003
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:54,474
History laughs.

1004
01:16:55,808 --> 01:16:58,842
If you continue to deny my work,

1005
01:16:58,844 --> 01:17:01,514
the world will deny my work.

1006
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:06,820
But men, your men,

1007
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:12,359
continue to die, their
families left in ruins.

1008
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:17,630
Tell the truth.

1009
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:21,368
Tell the truth.

1010
01:17:32,245 --> 01:17:36,181
You sure... You sure you want to do this?

1011
01:17:36,183 --> 01:17:39,720
I would ask you that
same question, Dr. Maroon.

1012
01:17:43,857 --> 01:17:47,394
Oh, your study, I'll get back to you.

1013
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:02,308
Well, that went well.

1014
01:18:42,182 --> 01:18:46,453
When I was a boy growing up in Nigeria,

1015
01:18:49,755 --> 01:18:55,895
heaven was here and America was here.

1016
01:18:58,764 --> 01:19:03,369
To me, it was the place where God
sent all of His favorite people.

1017
01:19:05,272 --> 01:19:08,608
You could be anything,
you could do anything.

1018
01:19:10,177 --> 01:19:12,877
Americans were the manifestation

1019
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:15,415
of what God wanted us all to be.

1020
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,321
I have never wanted anything

1021
01:19:24,323 --> 01:19:27,893
as much as I wanted to be
accepted as an American.

1022
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:38,938
But Mike Webster goes
mad and nobody asks why.

1023
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:43,240
They make fun of him.

1024
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:45,843
They insult him on TV.

1025
01:19:45,845 --> 01:19:48,512
And now they want to pretend
that his disease does not exist.

1026
01:19:48,514 --> 01:19:51,517
And they want to bury me.

1027
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:56,656
It's offensive.

1028
01:19:58,224 --> 01:20:00,793
I am offended.

1029
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:10,435
I am the wrong person
to have discovered this.

1030
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:17,643
There is no coincidence in this world.

1031
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:22,247
Tell me,

1032
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:27,985
what is the statistical probability
that you, not just a doctor,

1033
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:33,056
but Bennet Omalu, came to America,

1034
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:36,261
ended up here in this rusty place

1035
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:40,500
for you alone to be the one to see this?

1036
01:20:47,406 --> 01:20:50,042
When I arrived in New York,

1037
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:53,544
I was attacked.

1038
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:55,245
What happened?

1039
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:58,485
Something that is better left unsaid.

1040
01:20:59,952 --> 01:21:03,889
But that man almost broke me.

1041
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:09,729
I wanted to give up and go back.

1042
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:15,668
But I knew God.

1043
01:21:17,036 --> 01:21:22,641
I decided to trust His wisdom and I stayed.

1044
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:29,547
And now I am looking at this man,

1045
01:21:29,549 --> 01:21:33,016
an Omalu Onyemalukwube.

1046
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:37,989
Your name, it means, "If you know,

1047
01:21:37,991 --> 01:21:40,694
"you must come forth and speak."

1048
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:44,428
How did you know that?

1049
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:46,263
I called your father.

1050
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:47,998
He was pleased to hear from me.

1051
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,202
Yes, I am sure he was.

1052
01:21:51,204 --> 01:21:54,808
If you don't speak for the dead, who will?

1053
01:21:56,576 --> 01:21:59,543
You are of the Igbo tribe, Bennet.

1054
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:02,079
When you have truth,

1055
01:22:02,081 --> 01:22:03,347
the thing you are told you cannot do

1056
01:22:03,349 --> 01:22:05,883
is the thing you must do.

1057
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:08,218
Embrace that

1058
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,525
and nothing created by
man can bring you down.

1059
01:22:18,964 --> 01:22:22,633
Omalu's gone to the
press now. Listen to this.

1060
01:22:22,635 --> 01:22:24,968
"After examining the remains

1061

"that led to his depression

01:22:40,987 --> 01:22:43,587

There's more Omalu and more Bailes.

Here he is.

1098
01:24:13,746 --> 01:24:15,078

1106
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:38,038
Julian.

1107
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:54,552
Why don't you throw in some football stuff?

1108
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:56,686
Some non-medical terms?

1109
01:24:56,688 --> 01:24:59,257
Things we'd say.

1110
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:02,062
Why do I need to say things they'd say?

1111
01:25:03,162 --> 01:25:05,430
I thought I was here for the other reason.

1112
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:06,830
No.

1113
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:09,233
You have what, seven, eight degrees?

1114
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:10,501
You're one of the smartest people

1115
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:14,404
they'll ever meet. You... Well...

1116
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:16,407
You know what?

1117
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:18,745
You're gonna be fine.

1118
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:29,822
How about you?

1119
01:25:31,124 --> 01:25:33,093
How will you be?

1120
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:44,101
You know, it is a mindless, violent
game and then it's Shakespeare.

1121
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:46,136
<i>I mean, to me it's
like life that way.</i>

1122
01:25:46,138 --> 01:25:49,806
<i>And I know you can't
see how exciting</i>

1123
01:25:49,808 --> 01:25:53,879
and beautiful all that
is, and I don't blame you.

1124
01:25:55,147 --> 01:26:00,319
But what I'm trying to tell
you is this is not fun for me.

1125
01:26:01,854 --> 01:26:03,553
All of the people we're going to

1126
01:26:03,555 --> 01:26:05,189
see tomorrow, I know them personally.

1127
01:26:05,191 --> 01:26:06,824
And that feeling you have

1128
01:26:06,826 --> 01:26:11,898
when someone you love and
admire screws you over?

1129
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:17,303
They're going to have that feeling.

1130
01:26:19,171 --> 01:26:21,173
Because of me.

1131
01:26:22,407 --> 01:26:25,277
And there is not a damn
thing I can do about it.

1132
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:46,631
Hey.

1133
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:48,298
We have to talk.

1134
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,136
What's wrong?

1135
01:26:52,705 --> 01:26:56,239
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm just going to say it.

1136
01:26:56,241 --> 01:26:58,210
They're not gonna let you speak.

1137
01:26:59,478 --> 01:27:01,511
What?

1138
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:04,082
They don't even want you in the room.

1139
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:08,087
They want me to do it.

1140
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,657
- One of their own.
- One of their own.

1141
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:13,557
So, they want to pretend...

1142
01:27:13,559 --> 01:27:15,726
That you don't even exist, that's right.

1143
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:17,627
Okay. Yeah.

1144
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:20,230
- They still have to sit and listen.
- To you.

1145
01:27:20,232 --> 01:27:22,566
Yes. You blew up their whole world.

1146
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:23,935
And yours, Julian.

1147
01:27:23,937 --> 01:27:26,636
Yes. Mine.

1148
01:27:26,638 --> 01:27:32,776
Because how can it be possible
that some African voodoo doctor

1149
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:36,413
could understand this
subject better than them?

1150
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:39,717
Or even better than you?

1151
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:42,852
Wait a second. You think
this is about Bennet Omalu?

1152
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:45,855
I'm not here because of you. I'm
here because people are dying.

1153
01:27:45,857 --> 01:27:47,824
You are here for redemption.

1154
01:27:47,826 --> 01:27:51,263
You are here to use me
to cleanse your sins.

1155
01:27:52,865 --> 01:27:56,300
You self-righteous bastard.

1156
01:27:56,302 --> 01:28:00,303
Do you have any idea what I
could have, how much I could have

1157
01:28:00,305 --> 01:28:05,011
if I went back to my side of the
ball and just kept my mouth shut?

1158
01:28:06,512 --> 01:28:08,279
Everything in my world is telling me

1159
01:28:08,281 --> 01:28:10,914
not to agree with you, except one.

1160
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:13,251
Science.

1161
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:15,953
So, here I am.

1162
01:28:15,955 --> 01:28:20,460
Up here, beside you. Not down
there in that audience with them.

1163
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:25,932
What more can I do to prove myself to you?

1164
01:28:54,594 --> 01:28:56,462
I am sorry.

1165
01:28:58,397 --> 01:29:00,966
Convince them, Julian.

1166
01:29:17,549 --> 01:29:19,917
You know, my father can't
remember a goddamn thing.

1167
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:22,052
He never played a day of football.

1168
01:29:22,054 --> 01:29:25,056
He was too busy working
in a factory, you quack!

1169
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:26,957
I beg your pardon?

1170
01:29:26,959 --> 01:29:29,860
You take your bullshit
science, go back to Africa.

1171
01:29:29,862 --> 01:29:31,497
And get away from our game!

1172
01:29:34,834 --> 01:29:36,667
What happened?

1173
01:29:36,669 --> 01:29:38,836
Roger Goodell just said that

1174
01:29:38,838 --> 01:29:42,806
Justin Strzelczyk may have
gotten his concussion swimming.

1175
01:29:42,808 --> 01:29:44,074
In a swimming pool.

1176
01:29:44,076 --> 01:29:45,676
That's insanity.

1177
01:29:45,678 --> 01:29:48,011
This whole thing was staged.

1178
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:50,748
They needed to say that they heard
us so they could goddamn bury us.

1179
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,450
The science means nothing to them.

1180
01:29:53,452 --> 01:29:54,819
<i>This is an important day</i>

1181
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:56,686
<i>in the National Football League.</i>

1182
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:59,056
<i>We've had some very good dialogue</i>

1183
01:29:59,058 --> 01:30:03,127
<i>which will help us improve
the care for our players.</i>

1184
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:05,096
<i>What do you think
when you hear about</i>

1185
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:07,998
<i>former NFL players
suffering from symptoms</i>

1186
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,600
<i>that has only been seen in boxers</i>

1187
01:30:09,602 --> 01:30:11,769
<i>and people at over 80 years old?</i>

1188
01:30:11,771 --> 01:30:14,704
<i>I mean, what does that say about the
effect of concussions on players?</i>

1189
01:30:14,706 --> 01:30:16,073
<i>I'm not a doctor here,</i>

1190
01:30:16,075 --> 01:30:19,810
<i>but you have to look at
their entire medical history.</i>

1191
01:30:19,812 --> 01:30:22,980
<i>This is an evolving
science. And that's okay.</i>

1192
01:30:22,982 --> 01:30:25,783
<i>While I agree with the Commissioner,</i>

1193
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:30,553
<i>no empirically determined
proof was presented today.</i>

1194
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:33,390
<i>Because there simply isn't any.</i>

1195
01:30:33,392 --> 01:30:36,394
<i>Because according to
the NFL's own numbers,</i>

1196
01:30:36,396 --> 01:30:38,462
<i>half of all players with concussions</i>

1197
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:41,065
<i>are sent back into the same game,</i>

1198
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:44,404
<i>including some who were
actually knocked out cold.</i>

1199
01:30:45,604 --> 01:30:48,004
<i>Ira Casson was head of the team of</i>

1200
01:30:48,006 --> 01:30:50,608
<i>NFL doctors who had
looked into the issue</i>

1201
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,743
<i>and determined that the concern</i>

1202
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:55,111
<i>over head injuries was overblown.</i>

1203
01:30:55,113 --> 01:30:58,416
<i>Is there any evidence, as
far as you're concerned,</i>

1204
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:00,484
<i>that links multiple head injuries</i>

1205
01:31:00,486 --> 01:31:03,087
<i>among pro football
players with depression?</i>

1206
01:31:03,089 --> 01:31:04,488
<i>No.</i>

1207
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:05,890
<i>With dementia?</i>

1208
01:31:05,892 --> 01:31:07,490
<i>No.</i>

1209
01:31:07,492 --> 01:31:09,427
<i>With early onset of Alzheimer's?</i>

1210
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:10,895
<i>No.</i>

1211
01:31:10,897 --> 01:31:14,565
<i>Is there any evidence
as of today that links</i>

1212
01:31:14,567 --> 01:31:18,769
<i>multiple head injuries with any
long-term problem like that?</i>

1213
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:21,174
- <i>In NFL players? No.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1214
01:31:48,934 --> 01:31:51,137
Hey, little one.

1215
01:31:52,537 --> 01:31:54,606
This is your father.

1216
01:31:58,076 --> 01:32:01,146
I am in deep shit.

1217
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,686
I have not done anything wrong,

1218
01:32:09,621 --> 01:32:12,324
but I am being punished.

1219
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:22,535
It might not be so nice
when you get out here.

1220
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:28,708
You are still with God.

1221
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:34,147
Please ask Him to help me.

1222
01:33:05,076 --> 01:33:07,547
It's all right. It's okay.

1223
01:33:13,952 --> 01:33:17,120
- What is this?
- This is the FBI.

1224
01:33:17,122 --> 01:33:19,722
Apparently, I'm being
relieved of my duties.

1225
01:33:19,724 --> 01:33:21,624
What? I don't understand.

1226
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:23,060
Dr. Wecht has been indicted

1227
01:33:23,062 --> 01:33:25,261
on 84 federal counts, including...

1228
01:33:25,263 --> 01:33:28,932
Please, please, Tex. Let me at
least have the joy of telling him.

1229
01:33:28,934 --> 01:33:32,136
I'm being indicted on 84 federal counts,

1230
01:33:32,138 --> 01:33:34,738
including mail fraud, wire fraud,

1231
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:38,074
other related offenses, arising out of

1232
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:42,779
my use of government resources
to advance my private practice.

1233
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:47,184
Including, but not limited
to, uh, mileage vouchers,

1234
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:52,624
misuse of office stationery and
my personal use of the fax machine.

1235
01:33:54,326 --> 01:33:56,092
- Faxes?
- Yeah.

1236
01:33:56,094 --> 01:33:58,294
They could not come up with
something this stupid in Nigeria.

1237
01:33:59,831 --> 01:34:02,400
This man has been a
public servant for decades.

1238
01:34:04,336 --> 01:34:06,703
Cyril.

1239
01:34:06,705 --> 01:34:09,907
Have you ever performed any
private services on county time?

1240
01:34:09,909 --> 01:34:11,941
- Have I?
- Whoa!

1241
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:14,744
Apparently, we've both hurt
the government's feelings.

1242
01:34:16,182 --> 01:34:20,184
Are you referring to the death row
case where I used my personal time?

1243
01:34:20,186 --> 01:34:24,087
We don't want you, Dr.
Omalu, but we can have you.

1244
01:34:24,089 --> 01:34:25,756
And what does that mean?

1245
01:34:25,758 --> 01:34:27,526
That means they want your testimony.

1246
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:33,163
- Against you?
- Yes.

1247
01:34:33,165 --> 01:34:35,999
I... I understand.

1248
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:39,703
You are attacking him to get to me.

1249
01:34:39,705 --> 01:34:41,971
I know.

1250
01:34:41,973 --> 01:34:45,109
This is because his name is on my research.

1251
01:34:45,111 --> 01:34:46,342
What research is that?

1252
01:34:48,347 --> 01:34:50,381
No. I will resign first.

1253
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:53,851
In which case, your immigration
status will be revised

1254
01:34:53,853 --> 01:34:57,253
since your status requires
full-time employment.

1255
01:34:57,255 --> 01:35:00,224
Then I will get another
job in another city.

1256
01:35:00,226 --> 01:35:01,691
That would be fine.

1257
01:35:01,693 --> 01:35:03,795
That would be fine.

1258
01:35:12,772 --> 01:35:14,639
Bennet.

1259
01:35:25,884 --> 01:35:30,253
All I asked is that if you did
this, we both came out okay.

1260
01:35:30,255 --> 01:35:32,391
Not professional ruination.

1261
01:35:35,428 --> 01:35:37,293
Whoever...

1262
01:35:37,295 --> 01:35:40,333
Whatever takes over for me,

1263
01:35:42,168 --> 01:35:45,603
they're going to want the CTE
information, you know that.

1264
01:35:46,839 --> 01:35:48,971
What if they show up here with a warrant?

1265
01:35:48,973 --> 01:35:51,141
On suspicion of what? Science?

1266
01:35:51,143 --> 01:35:55,145
Ah, suspicion of bullshit. We got screwed.

1267
01:35:55,147 --> 01:35:58,148
You didn't deserve it.

1268
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:01,485
You know the worst part? How easy it was.

1269
01:36:01,487 --> 01:36:06,457
Cyril, they are not going to
make me say one word against you.

1270
01:36:06,459 --> 01:36:08,792
What are you gonna say?

1271
01:36:08,794 --> 01:36:12,296
Cyril Wecht's a loudmouth asshole?

1272
01:36:12,298 --> 01:36:15,265
I don't care. I'm tired.

1273
01:36:15,267 --> 01:36:17,402
My balls are low.

1274
01:36:24,276 --> 01:36:26,911
I didn't do good enough by you.

1275
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,782
Cyril, um...

1276
01:36:32,852 --> 01:36:35,521
I cannot go back to Nigeria.

1277
01:36:37,223 --> 01:36:40,493
Everything that I am is here.

1278
01:36:42,061 --> 01:36:45,962
My child has got to be born in America.

1279
01:36:47,265 --> 01:36:48,966
Don't worry.

1280
01:36:48,968 --> 01:36:51,368
I'll get you a job.

1281
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:54,203
Hey, you can work with
me in the prison laundry.

1282
01:36:59,911 --> 01:37:02,044
Call the surgeon.

1283
01:37:02,046 --> 01:37:04,482
We need a goddamn drink.

1284
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,541
I solved the problem.

1285
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:06,610
All they have to do is put
on the side of the helmet,

1286
01:38:06,612 --> 01:38:09,212
"The Surgeon General has determined that

1287
01:38:09,214 --> 01:38:11,381
"playing football is
hazardous to your health."

1288
01:38:11,383 --> 01:38:13,316
You got to put it on
both sides of the helmet.

1289
01:38:26,898 --> 01:38:28,332
Did you know that Paul Tagliabue...

1290
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:30,467
This is the former Commissioner Tagliabue,

1291
01:38:30,469 --> 01:38:33,403
did you know that Paul was a
partner in Covington and Burling?

1292
01:38:33,405 --> 01:38:35,137
Which is the same law firm that represented

1293
01:38:35,139 --> 01:38:36,440
the big seven tobacco companies.

1294
01:38:36,442 --> 01:38:38,208
Of course he was.

1295
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,610
But now they're representing
the National Football League.

1296
01:38:39,612 --> 01:38:41,881
Of course they do.

1297
01:38:51,456 --> 01:38:53,489
<i>My last year with the Steelers,</i>

1298
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:57,261
we moved a game from a Sunday to
a Tuesday because of a blizzard.

1299
01:38:57,263 --> 01:38:59,562
And the League said that they
weren't concerned about the ratings

1300
01:38:59,564 --> 01:39:02,632
because the League was
immune from acts of God.

1301
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,224
Bennet!

1302
01:39:27,226 --> 01:39:28,761
Bennet!

1303
01:39:54,585 --> 01:39:56,153
I'm so sorry.

1304
01:39:56,155 --> 01:39:58,590
There's no heartbeat.

1305
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:04,593
May... May we have the room, please?

1306
01:40:04,595 --> 01:40:07,031
Excuse us. Thank you.

1307
01:40:24,616 --> 01:40:27,450
I'm so sorry.

1308
01:40:27,452 --> 01:40:30,587
I'm so sorry. I made a mistake.

1309
01:40:30,589 --> 01:40:32,989
This is my fault.

1310
01:40:58,049 --> 01:41:01,853
<i>Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.
Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.</i>

1311
01:41:04,555 --> 01:41:07,793
I wish I had never met Mike Webster.

1312
01:41:12,097 --> 01:41:14,667
They destroyed us.

1313
01:41:17,503 --> 01:41:22,807
And I don't understand why
it is happening this way.

1314
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:28,746
Bennet, listen to me.

1315
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:34,920
Do you know what I chose to fake?

1316
01:41:39,625 --> 01:41:41,160
You.

1317
01:41:47,265 --> 01:41:49,699
We will have this family.

1318
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:51,735
Yes.

1319
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:53,839
We will.

1320
01:41:56,407 --> 01:41:58,744
Just not here.

1321
01:42:01,647 --> 01:42:03,982
We have to go.

1322
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:42,087
Hello? Mr. Omalu?

1323
01:42:44,689 --> 01:42:46,489
Dr. Omalu.

1324
01:42:46,491 --> 01:42:49,360
I just need the measurements
for the flat screens.

1325
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:53,932
That won't be necessary.

1326
01:45:29,854 --> 01:45:33,323
Tell me what happened to you, Jose.

1327
01:45:33,325 --> 01:45:35,859
Tell me.

1328
01:45:35,861 --> 01:45:37,993
It's going to be okay.

1329
01:45:47,738 --> 01:45:49,506
Listen.

1330
01:45:49,508 --> 01:45:52,042
My mind keeps slipping.

1331
01:45:52,044 --> 01:45:55,678
I can't seem to find the
goddamn words no more.

1332
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,281
What?

1333
01:46:01,085 --> 01:46:03,288
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1334
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:07,757
I just can't do this.

1335
01:46:07,759 --> 01:46:09,962
And I'm sorry.

1336
01:46:52,838 --> 01:46:54,069
Yes.

1337
01:46:54,071 --> 01:46:56,073
<i>Bennet, it's Julian.</i>

1338
01:46:57,875 --> 01:47:01,377
Dave Duerson killed himself today.

1339
01:47:01,379 --> 01:47:03,846
<i>Shot himself in the
chest. In the heart.</i>

1340
01:47:03,848 --> 01:47:06,083
Hold on, hold on.

1341
01:47:11,689 --> 01:47:14,724
- My God.
- <i>He left a note.</i>

1342
01:47:14,726 --> 01:47:16,726
<i>He wants his brain to be donated.</i>

1343
01:47:16,728 --> 01:47:18,597
To be examined.

1344
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,269
They said that we were right.

1345
01:47:28,506 --> 01:47:30,409
<i>Benny, you there?</i>

1346
01:47:31,442 --> 01:47:33,645
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:17,189
I don't know what to say to them.

1353
01:48:21,526 --> 01:48:24,228
Tell them what's really happening.

1354
01:49:13,512 --> 01:49:14,677
<i>Hello.</i>

1355
01:49:16,615 --> 01:49:18,482
<i>Um...</i>

1356
01:49:20,785 --> 01:49:24,623
<i>A small boy, uh, came to me</i>

1357
01:49:25,823 --> 01:49:29,258
<i>and said, "Mister, why
do you hate football?"</i>

1358
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:32,294
<i>I said, "I don't hate football."</i>

1359

<i>He said, "Yes, my father
said you hate football."</i>

1360
01:49:36,101 --> 01:49:38,534
<i>I said, "You tell your

<i>My wife watches the games.</i>

<i>And she will scream

01:49:51,049 --> 01:49:53,652
<i>She startles me a lot.</i>

1364
01:49:56,021 --> 01:49:59,657
<i>But through her eyes,
I can see the beauty</i>

1365

<i>and the grace, the power.</i>

1366
01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:11,669
<i>I said to her that I wished
I'd never met Mike Webster.</i>

1367
01:50:23,781 --> 01:50:26,350
<i>But that was before I knew him.</i>

1368

<i>He has given me a great gift.</i>

1369
01:50:37,161 --> 01:50:39,496
<i>A dangerous gift.</i>

1370
01:50:41,165 --> 01:50:43,100
<i>The gift of knowing.</i>

<i>When a man is a soldier,

<i>He may be injured or even killed.</i>

1373

<i>he knows he may break

<i>of contracting a

1395
01:52:37,915 --> 01:52:41,083
<i>I just asked you a simple

1396
01:52:41,085 --> 01:52:42,752

01:52:45,924 --> 01:52:48,324
<i>when they kept saying,
"No, there's no link</i>

1399
01:52:48,326 --> 01:52:50,927
<i>"between smoking and, um,
damage to your health,</i>

1400
01:52:50,929 --> 01:52:53,061
<i>"or ill health effects."</i>

1401
01:52:53,063 --> 01:52:56,466
<i>And they were forced to
admit that that was incorrect</i>

1402
01:52:56,468 --> 01:52:59,135
<i>through a spate of
litigation in the 1990s.</i>

1403
01:52:59,137 --> 01:53:02,070
<i>And my question to you is...</i>

1404
01:53:02,072 --> 01:53:03,472
<i>Oh, we have heard</i>

1405
01:53:03,474 --> 01:53:05,242
<i>from the NFL time and time again.</i>

1406
01:53:05,244 --> 01:53:09,177
<i>You're always "studying," you're
always "trying," you're "hopeful."</i>

1407
01:53:09,179 --> 01:53:11,012
Son of a bitch.

1408
01:53:11,014 --> 01:53:12,882
<i>I want to know what are you doing</i>

1409
01:53:12,884 --> 01:53:14,717
<i>in the negotiations
that are going on now</i>

1410
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:19,788
<i>to deal with this problem and the
other problems related to the injuries</i>

1411
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:26,229
<i>that football players obtain
and its impact on their health.</i>

1412
01:53:26,231 --> 01:53:28,263
You did all this.

1413
01:53:28,265 --> 01:53:30,033
<i>I know my time is
drawing to a close,</i>

1414
01:53:30,035 --> 01:53:35,137
<i>but let me just say this to Mr. Goodell,
uh, and everybody who's here today</i>

1415
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:37,907
<i>that I think it's
time for the Congress</i>

1416
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:40,544
<i>of the United States to take a look.</i>

1417
01:53:42,847 --> 01:53:43,546
First time in Washington?

1418
01:53:43,548 --> 01:53:46,114
Uh, yes.

1419
01:53:46,116 --> 01:53:48,184
Well, we're thrilled you
accepted our invitation.

1420
01:53:48,186 --> 01:53:50,888
I was, uh, very curious.

1421
01:53:52,389 --> 01:53:55,423
Chief Medical Examiner
for Washington, D.C.,

1422
01:53:55,425 --> 01:53:58,794
means you would also
consult with the CIA and FBI

1423
01:53:58,796 --> 01:54:00,096
and any foreign government

1424
01:54:00,098 --> 01:54:04,132
requesting the assistance of
the United States government.

1425
01:54:04,134 --> 01:54:07,369
Essentially, you're America's
forensic pathologist.

1426
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:11,507
Wouldn't have to put on
scrubs or perform an autopsy.

1427
01:54:11,509 --> 01:54:14,012
You're beyond all that now.

1428
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:21,117
Would you like to hear
about the benefits package?

1429
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,252
No.

1430
01:54:23,254 --> 01:54:25,456
I mean, I'm sure it's fine.

1431
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:36,298
We know everything you did, Dr. Omalu.

1432
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:40,602
You exemplify everything
it is to be an American.

1433
01:54:40,604 --> 01:54:44,008
You belong here with us,
in the nation's capital.

1434
01:54:58,089 --> 01:55:01,826
Why don't you take a couple
days and think about it?

1435
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,794
Ready.

1436
01:55:39,196 --> 01:55:41,230
Hut!

1437
01:55:41,232 --> 01:55:43,399
Get up, get up field, get
up field, get up field!

1438
01:55:43,401 --> 01:55:45,434
You heard him. Move up field, let's go!

1439
01:55:45,436 --> 01:55:47,136
You, on the ball, on the ball.

1440
01:55:47,138 --> 01:55:49,741
Okay, let's huddle up!
Bring it back, huddle up.

1441
01:55:53,577 --> 01:55:56,979
All right, call it out!
Douglas, I'm talkin' to you.

1442
01:55:56,981 --> 01:55:58,247
Hut!

1443
01:55:58,249 --> 01:55:59,215
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em!

1444
01:56:00,418 --> 01:56:01,617
That's it. Good!

1445
01:56:01,619 --> 01:56:04,119
There you go. Good job,
good job, on the ball.

1446
01:56:04,121 --> 01:56:06,590
- Let's go, let's go, tempo, tempo!
- Tempo, tempo!

1447
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:15,498
How 'bout we hit somebody this time, huh?

1448
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,365
Try a little more contact.

1449
01:56:17,367 --> 01:56:18,835
One-sixteen,
one-sixteen!

1450
01:56:47,031 --> 01:56:48,965
<i>A tragic loss for
the family and fans</i>

1451
01:56:48,967 --> 01:56:51,300
<i>of former Chargers star Junior Seau</i>

1452
01:56:51,302 --> 01:56:54,169
<i>after he was found dead
in his Oceanside home.</i>

1453
01:56:54,171 --> 01:56:55,738
<i>Good evening and thanks
for joining us tonight.</i>

1454
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:59,641
<i>Junior Seau's death is being
investigated as a suicide.</i>

1455
01:56:59,643 --> 01:57:01,711
<i>Police say his girlfriend
reported finding him</i>

1456
01:57:01,713 --> 01:57:05,047
<i>with an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

1457
01:57:05,049 --> 01:57:06,983
<i>Tonight there's widespread shock</i>

1458
01:57:06,985 --> 01:57:09,185
<i>and disbelief over the sudden death.</i>

1459
01:57:09,187 --> 01:57:11,721
<i>Standing in front of her
son's beachfront home,</i>

1460
01:57:11,723 --> 01:57:15,091
<i>Junior Seau's mother poured
out her heart and her grief.</i>

1461
01:57:15,093 --> 01:57:18,026
<i>I'm shocked.</i>

1462
01:57:18,028 --> 01:57:21,196
<i>But I appreciate

<i>We love you, Mrs. Seau!</i>
