1
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:23,843
Oh, John!

2
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,162
John, this is
Lieutenant-Colonel Sinclair.

3
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,953
- Pleasure.
- My quest.

4
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,831
Sinclair is here for
Washington Observe.

5
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,935
She spent the last 3 years
researching the project...

6
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,462
...so I've finally decided
to go with her approach.

7
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,941
Yes, I heard about your idea.
Something about a steel cage?

8
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,879
- An exo-skeleton. 
- Exo-skeleton?

9
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,430
The steel frame allowed me
to control the diseased units,

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,394
and at the same time offering
mobility to make them...

11
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:49,894
...highly effective
bio-weapons.

12
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:52,373
Lucky for me, the Pentagon
decided to go with a more...

13
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,474
...humane approach.

14
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,870
<i>Post-mortem team to</i>
<i>Sector 6 bio-engineering.</i>

15
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:06,367
<i>Post-mortem team to</i>
<i>Sector 6 bio-engineering.</i>

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,669
Walsh, let me use your
cardkey, please.

17
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,568
Seems to misplaced mine
at home.

18
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,638
Then it did worry you.

19
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,139
For I've seen around here,
security seems rather low-priority.

20
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,175
Ah, well, those damn budget chopping fools
in Congress-

21
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,448
was it for them we had never
permanent facility by now.

22
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,043
God Julie,
What are you doing?

23
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,877
You're so mental!

24
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,048
Stop.

25
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,584
Lone Ranger is here.

26
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,455
Did you get it?

27
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,223
- You saw when didn't I?
- Let me see it.

28
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,895
How my dad looked
all over the house for it.

29
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,860
Just couldn't seem to find it.

30
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,800
Curt, this is so cool!

31
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,609
So, how do we get in the base?

32
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,610
No problem, I'm the boss' son,
remember?

33
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,478
I can do anything.

34
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,913
Can you guys gonna do Club Kill
of us tonight or what?

35
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,651
I'll call you later.

36
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,651
So, did you find out anything else?

37
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,621
Not even more than you heard
in the phone last night.

38
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,556
The big test, or whatever it is.

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,389
- It starts at 6 o'clock.
- What test?

40
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,223
No test, Mindy!
Butt out!

41
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,592
God, it's so cruel!

42
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,764
I bet they're cutting off
some poor animals or something.

43
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,633
What time is it?

44
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,901
- It's 5:30.
- 5:30?

45
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,770
Come on, Boy Scout!
We gotta jam!

46
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,887
The preliminary result gives
any indication,

47
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,625
maybe something	going to finally
come from the Trioxin after all.

48
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm sure it will, sir.

49
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,499
You were part of
the original team...

50
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,802
...that commission Trioxin
from Darrow Chemical, weren't you sir?

51
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,002
It certainly was.

52
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,105
We were going to use it
as a weapon...

53
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,307
...against the war on marihuana
and than came that leakage '69.

54
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,610
We found out about
its special properties.

55
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,512
We did the only thing we could.

56
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,947
After the gas brought the dead
back to life,

57
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,317
we rounded them up,
stuffed them in those barrels...

58
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,019
...did no then
we never be able to destroy them.

59
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,927
How're you doing?
I come to see my dad.

60
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,141
Come on.

61
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,146
It's G-17,
the same as on the card.

62
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,713
Let's try it.

63
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,283
Shit!

64
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,050
Would I?

65
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,420
What are you doing?

66
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,596
It's all the tongue.

67
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,766
Come on.

68
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,841
Curt, look at all this.

69
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
It's incredible.

70
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,218
Okay.

71
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,887
Yeah, I think this...

72
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,995
- Detective 6, please...
- Hurry, come on.

73
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,899
<i>...report all the</i>
<i>1800 hour perimeter rounds.</i>

74
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,399
Commencing around, sir.

75
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,752
Hey, come on.

76
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,129
What's this glass here for?

77
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,932
Oh, no. It looks like
they want to keep the air tight.

78
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,500
Hey, check it out.
We can still see inside.

79
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:19,305
Oh, my God,
What are they doing in there?

80
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,309
- My God.
- Oh, shit.

81
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,644
This is creepy.

82
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,947
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

83
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,918
Flatline set.

84
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,521
Check electrodes.

85
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,858
Check.

86
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,297
Ready?

87
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,836
We're all set here, sir.

88
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,937
All right.

89
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,939
Let's proceed.

90
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,415
God, Julie, that's my dad.

91
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,117
Don't worry, they can't see us.

92
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,552
Is that guy hanging up there dead?

93
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,656
Are you kidding? Definitely.

94
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,093
Come on.

95
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,035
All vital signs
confirmed at flatline.

96
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,072
Trioxin exposure
commencing at 18:21 hours.

97
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:28,675
Bring the Trioxin barrel into place.

98
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,478
All right.

99
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,013
I'm opening the valve now.

100
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,788
We got something.

101
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,923
Time's 18:24.

102
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,575
Jesus Christ.

103
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,677
He came back to life.

104
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,730
Phase one complete, sir.

105
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,865
Okay.

106
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,902
Proceed with the paretic infusion.

107
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,985
No! No!

108
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,557
... three... two... one.

109
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,466
We've got flatline.

110
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,134
Proceed with the visual inspection.

111
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,437
Optical reflexes-- none.

112
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,773
No response.

113
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:41,875
Yes! Looks like we did it.

114
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,644
Affirmative.

115
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:47,177
Paralysis has been
successfully attained.

116
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,349
This is really warped.

117
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,052
I can't believe my dad.

118
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,254
Oh, I know.

119
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,423
How do they do it?

120
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,595
I knew this would
be worth checking out.

121
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:02,629
I just knew it!

122
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,070
We've got to get out of here.

123
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,278
Come on.

124
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,490
Come on.

125
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,466
It's okay, Curt.
He didn't see us.

126
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,869
Look, Julie, I don't care.

127
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,235
I've seen enough.

128
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,176
Son of a bitch, John.

129
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,610
You have just changed
warfare forever.

130
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,480
We could put
those bio-units in,

131
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,014
have them run roughshod
over the enemy,

132
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,115
then just stroll on in,
freeze them up,

133
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,052
and pack them away
until the next time.

134
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,884
I must admit, Reynolds,

135
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,556
even though I think the
exo-skeletal approach...

136
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,224
...would be more efficient,

137
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,393
there's no arguing
with your results.

138
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,594
Thank you.

139
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:08,826
This was really a team effort.

140
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,197
Don't be modest, John.

141
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,865
This was your baby
from the start.

142
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,402
It was John who figured out
that these dead bastards...

143
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,903
...craved brains so they could get
electricity from the neurons.

144
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,538
Oh, is that right?

145
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,307
Then it was just
a matter of developing...

146
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,975
...the acid projectiles to
freeze them up again.

147
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,346
Well, we're on our way now.

148
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,048
No obstruction to mouth tissue.
Esophagus appears clear.

149
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,182
Aah!

150
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,619
Aah!

151
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,364
- It didn't hold.
- What's going on?

152
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,629
The paralysis didn't hold.

153
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,306
Alert security!

154
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,394
Use the projectiles!

155
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,902
Hook me up, damn it!

156
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,644
Hurry up, load it!

157
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,745
Projectiles!

158
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,384
Shoot the son of a bitch!

159
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,884
Load it again! Hurry up!

160
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,259
Shoot it, damn it!

161
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,465
My God!

162
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,168
He killed Dr. Hickox!

163
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,336
What happened?

164
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,437
What the hell happened?

165
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,673
I don't know.

166
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,841
It didn't hold.

167
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,778
Strap that damn thing down
before it wakes up again.

168
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,416
Ready? Lift.

169
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,182
Get the gurney.

170
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,254
Strap him down.

171
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,754
I'll get the legs.
You get the arms.

172
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,666
Tight!

173
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,033
Get it down tight there.

174
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,706
What about the mouth restraint?

175
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,778
Put it in. Sure.

176
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,817
What the hell
am I gonna tell them?

177
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,990
That'll restrain him.
Especially the mouthpiece.

178
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,326
What the--

179
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,263
Aah!

180
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,629
Jesus Christ!

181
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,730
It didn't hold!

182
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,769
Get him off of me!

183
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,105
Contain it, damn it!

184
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,673
Seal it off now!

185
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,647
Contained.

186
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,888
Open the door!

187
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,254
Open the door, God damn it!

188
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,634
I got him!

189
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,802
Send a team in.
Get everyone out.

190
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,172
I want them all
tied down, living or dead.

191
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,774
Put them all under observation.

192
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:45,110
I need an explanation
of what the hell happened here.

193
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,014
Son of a--

194
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:51,051
Washington is expecting
a call from me right now.

195
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,552
What am I gonna tell them?

196
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,788
Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of it.

197
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,291
Before I left I told
General Meade that I'd call him,

198
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,360
just to give him
my objective opinion.

199
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,884
God, I thought that
was incredible, wasn't it?

200
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,288
It was great.

201
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,192
I wonder if he could feel anything.

202
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,995
What?

203
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,432
When that bullet
smashed into his skull--

204
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,969
The dead guy-- I wonder
if he could feel anything?

205
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,072
And that scream--
remember that horrible scream?

206
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm trying not to.

207
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,676
I bet he was in hell.
It must be awful to be dead.

208
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,480
Would you just give it a rest?

209
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,115
What's the matter?

210
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,918
You're so carried away
with all this.

211
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,586
And you're not?

212
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,092
We don't even
know what we saw.

213
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,161
We don't know
if that was a corpse.

214
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,864
It could've been a mental patient
or somebody in a coma.

215
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,834
No way Curt,
that was definitely a corpse.

216
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,605
You're still hung up about
seeing your dad there, aren't you?

217
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,746
I told you,
I don't care about my dad.

218
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,882
I never ever see him anyway.

219
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,584
Good.

220
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,451
You don't need him.

221
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,817
You've got me.

222
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:37,990
I know.

223
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,490
And I'm never
gonna let you go.

224
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,826
Ever.

225
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,269
Oh shit!

226
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:53,740
- What?
- My dad's here.

227
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,105
Get dressed.

228
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:06,219
I got to put the cardkey back.

229
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:09,990
Curtis?

230
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,923
Yes, sir?

231
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,528
I need to talk with you, son.

232
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,931
What is it, Dad?

233
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,971
I need to talk with you alone.

234
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:28,173
In my office.

235
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,711
I think he knows something.

236
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,931
What is it?

237
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,394
Sit down.

238
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,604
I got a little bad news tonight.

239
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,538
I'm being reassigned
to another project.

240
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,074
What?

241
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm being relocated
to Oklahoma City.

242
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,807
We report in a week.

243
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,315
Oklahoma City?

244
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,651
Dad, we just got here six months ago.

245
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,486
Listen, Curtis, I'm sorry.

246
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,317
I don't like this
any more than you,

247
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,721
but it's nothing
we haven't done a dozen times.

248
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,125
Have your room
packed by Saturday.

249
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:23,063
Sunday you can
start on the garage.

250
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,438
Did you find that cardkey
we were looking for?

251
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,971
No, I didn't.

252
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,644
I don't understand.

253
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,814
That son of a bitch
has gotta be here somewhere.

254
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,721
Is there something else?

255
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,929
Dad, I'm not gonna go.

256
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,133
- What?
- I'm not gonna go.

257
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,634
I don't want to go.

258
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,932
I've finally got friends here.

259
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,006
Curtis, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

260
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,403
I'm being transferred.

261
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:11,375
We leave in a week.
Both of us.

262
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,846
I'm not gonna go.

263
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,316
- Curtis!
- What?

264
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:21,188
I've tried to be understanding
of you in the last few weeks.

265
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,586
I let you get that motorcycle.

266
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,653
I deal with you
wanting to be a Rock 'n' Roll drummer,

267
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:26,460
because you'll outgrow it.

268
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,497
I draw the line here. I won't have
you defying me, understand?

269
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,298
Don't think I don't know
where this is coming from either.

270
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,865
Getting you away from that girl will be
the best thing ever happened to you.

271
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,005
Dad, I'm not going!

272
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:41,403
Curtis, I'm not finished
talking with you yet.

273
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,375
Don't walk away from me!

274
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,644
What's going on?

275
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,615
My dad's being reassigned again.

276
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,250
- I told him I'm not going.
- You're kidding.

277
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:56,653
I'm not kidding.
I'm on my own.

278
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,595
- You're moving out?
- Yes. It's just me and you.

279
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,865
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- Yes, you are.

280
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,701
God damn it,
get back in my office!

281
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,000
Why don't you just leave him alone?

282
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,471
Tell your friend
to stay out of our business.

283
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,140
You tell her yourself.

284
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,641
Come on, let's go.

285
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,346
You never acted like this
when your mother was alive.

286
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:25,085
You keep your hands off of me!

287
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,054
Freak.

288
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,756
Come on, Curt.
I'm going.

289
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,798
I can't believe you did it, Curt.

290
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,432
We're free.
This is great.

291
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,836
It will be at least a week
before my mother notices I'm gone.

292
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,634
Send her a postcard.

293
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,740
Whoa!

294
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,576
- Take it easy!
- Take it easy?

295
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:53,313
I've never taken it easy on you.

296
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,517
You're mine, honey, all mine.

297
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:58,652
Julie!

298
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,519
Come on, stop it.

299
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,057
What's wrong?
You losing control?

300
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,160
You losing control?

301
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:42,296
Julie.

302
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,615
Oh my God!

303
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:02,682
No.

304
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,853
Julie.

305
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:08,355
Julie, talk to me!

306
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,519
Damn it, talk to me!

307
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,227
Help us!

308
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,692
Somebody help us!

309
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,009
You promised.

310
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,248
You promised me.

311
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,653
You can't leave.
You said you'd never leave me.

312
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,221
Right. Go ahead.

313
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,192
- Who is this?
- This is Emerson, sir.

314
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,672
God, I hope this works.

315
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:12,259
Oh my God, Julie!

316
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:43,690
God, Curt, that was incredible!

317
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,221
Let's do it again.

318
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,468
What is this?
What are you wearing?

319
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,803
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

320
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,538
Wait a minute.
Where are we?

321
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:03,644
Oh, God.

322
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,009
I'm so numb.

323
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,614
And my neck--

324
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,913
my neck hurts.

325
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,721
What's going on?

326
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,759
What's wrong with me?

327
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:22,557
Curt, what happened?

328
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,565
You see, we were on the bike--

329
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,969
What was that?
Come on.

330
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:31,738
What is it?

331
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:49,990
I think we'd better get out of here.

332
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,096
I heard something.

333
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,240
Close the fucking door!

334
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:20,884
Hurry!
What the fuck is that thing?

335
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,355
Damn it!
This thing isn't working.

336
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,595
What's wrong with me?

337
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:32,432
My heart.
I can't feel my heart.

338
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,932
It's gonna be okay.

339
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:39,269
What's going on, Curt?
Tell me what happened.

340
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,903
We had an accident.

341
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,678
What kind of an accident?

342
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:46,613
- On the bike.
- What happened?

343
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,317
You died.

344
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,390
I what?

345
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,625
I died?

346
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,567
Come on.

347
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,978
Halt!

348
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:11,198
Curt, is that
what I'm gonna become?

349
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:12,730
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

350
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,546
Sector 12, containment breach.

351
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,288
It's him, all right.

352
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,721
Looks like we found your card.

353
00:32:36,823 --> 00:32:39,459
Jesus, Curt...

354
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,028
what have you done?

355
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:45,730
I put out a statewide APB
on your son's motorcycle.

356
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:49,603
Also, I have the containment
squad assembling right now.

357
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:53,769
What are his chances?

358
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,910
It seems his girlfriend has been
brought back completely intact.

359
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,314
Obviously, there was a very strong
connection between them.

360
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:03,278
That should be enough to keep her
from attacking him,

361
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:06,286
at least until
her brain shuts down.

362
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:07,854
If she attacks him,

363
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,519
he becomes like her.

364
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:13,160
Pentagon Special Command
will be here in six hours.

365
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,192
They're leaving Washington now.

366
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,192
Thank you, Colonel.

367
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:20,133
I also suggested to
General Meade that I go ahead...

368
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,567
...and take over scientific operations.

369
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:23,737
I don't think you understand,

370
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,903
your command does not start
until 09:00 hours tomorrow morning.

371
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,875
Yes, I do understand,
but under the circumstances--

372
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,375
No.

373
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:35,980
John will stand his
command until they arrive.

374
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,259
Jesus.

375
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:54,134
Curt, am I really dead?

376
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,036
Am I really dead?

377
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,971
My skin--
my skin feels so weird.

378
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:01,673
I don't smell do I?
Do I smell?

379
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,240
You don't smell.

380
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,711
I'm so hungry, if I could
just get something to eat...

381
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:07,881
...I think I'll be okay.

382
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,882
Working on it, Julie.
I'm just trying to find someplace open.

383
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,585
- I saw a store back there--
- There were too many people.

384
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,088
They're gonna
be looking for us.

385
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:18,458
God damn it,
get me some fucking food now!

386
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,793
All right, Mogo!

387
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,003
Kill them all!

388
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,139
Grab the shit, man.
Get it out of there.

389
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,806
Get the fuck out of there.

390
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,411
Die, motherfucker!

391
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,679
Come on, Santos,

392
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,614
let's get out of here, I'm bored.

393
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:46,619
Just a few more minutes.

394
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,454
You said that an hour ago.

395
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,523
If we would have
left when you wanted to,

396
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,059
he would have never
made it to level seven.

397
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:54,327
Yeah.

398
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:18,952
You don't need all of this.

399
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:20,753
Leave me alone,
I don't know what I want.

400
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,389
- When are you gonna know?
- I don't know.

401
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,556
When I taste it.

402
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:30,896
Hey, man,

403
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,632
what the fuck is wrong with her?

404
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,800
Don't worry about it.

405
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,739
Don't you ever feed her?

406
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,550
Hey, he asked you
a fucking question.

407
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,652
Look, stay out of it,
all right?

408
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,621
Did you say something to me?

409
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,291
I don't want any trouble.

410
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,096
Whatever I said, I'm sorry.

411
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,697
Sorry ain't good enough.

412
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,199
You hit him.

413
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:09,902
I didn't see him there.

414
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:10,938
I'm sorry.

415
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,639
It was an accident.

416
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:14,273
You were standing right behind me.

417
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,376
Come on, give me a break!

418
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,244
Just let us go.

419
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:18,878
Hey, you guys,

420
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:20,146
take this outside, okay?

421
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,750
Go!

422
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,489
You pay for these
before you eat them.

423
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,226
- I have some money.
- Pay me.

424
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:35,362
- Okay.
- And go.

425
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,164
Here's a 20,
keep the charge.

426
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:41,768
Come on!

427
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:46,005
Hey, stop it!
Get away from there!

428
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,309
Hey...

429
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,478
easy, man.

430
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:54,114
Okay, man.
We're leaving.

431
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,114
You, move out of the way.

432
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,284
Move! Move!

433
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:01,487
And you, put the money down!

434
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,922
Put the money down!

435
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,204
My God, Santos,
what the hell did you do?

436
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,072
Let's get the fuck out of here!

437
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:21,708
Santos, he bleeds.

438
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,347
I'll see you later.

439
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,181
Felipe!

440
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,050
- Whoo!
- Mogo, let's go!

441
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:33,253
Get out of my way, bitch!

442
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:34,454
Aah!

443
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,590
That's his bike.

444
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,697
- Bitch!
- You son of a bitch!

445
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,768
Somebody's gonna be
right here for you, okay?

446
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:52,105
We've got to get out of
here before the cops get here.

447
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,315
Julie, we have to go,

448
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:02,315
before the cops come.

449
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,918
Shit!

450
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:08,855
Come on!

451
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,262
Get in.

452
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,063
Hurry!

453
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,302
Help me.

454
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,271
The hospital... two blocks.

455
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,974
All right. Give me the keys.

456
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,652
Stop! I'll go with them.

457
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:40,954
Halt!

458
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,628
They're shooting at us!

459
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,876
The police found your son, sir.

460
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,777
- Where?
- South Central.

461
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:06,079
They're in pursuit now.

462
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,108
I'm still hungry, Curt.

463
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,275
You're what?!

464
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,110
I'm starving, I'm still hungry.

465
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:40,547
Jesus Christ, how can
you think of food now?

466
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:43,516
Stop!

467
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,650
I want out.

468
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:51,324
Shit!

469
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,027
Don't shoot!

470
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,065
Don't shoot!

471
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:03,936
Oh shit!

472
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,472
They killed him.

473
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,273
Oh, shit.

474
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:14,047
Julie, no!
No, come back here!

475
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,797
Damn it, it's a dead end.

476
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:36,936
I think we lost them.

477
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,306
Julie...

478
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:41,474
What's that noise?

479
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,047
Brains...

480
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:50,617
Brains...

481
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,985
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

482
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,588
Stop it!

483
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:57,257
Julie!

484
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,494
Stop it!

485
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,742
You, in the van!

486
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,143
Put your hands on your head,

487
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,313
and step out
of the driver's side door!

488
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:23,550
This is your last warning!

489
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,351
Come out or you're
liable to be shot!

490
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,989
Oh my God!

491
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:53,706
Move! Move!

492
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,275
Contaminated unit, sir.

493
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,610
He's attacking the officer.

494
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:58,311
Charge me!

495
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:00,981
Ready. Aim. Fire.

496
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,420
Move in! Move!

497
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:08,521
Containment unit, get in there.

498
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:10,856
The rest of you, fan out.

499
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,293
Contain him!

500
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,262
Get a perimeter out there.

501
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,139
- Get down.
- Take no chances.

502
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:27,507
Squad three just came back.

503
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:28,541
Negative.

504
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,748
- Sandusky?
- Yeah.

505
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:38,552
- Ready to roll?
- When you're ready.

506
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:46,592
No sign of your son
or the girl, sir.

507
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:48,228
Damn it.

508
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,496
All right.

509
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,132
Let's make this
a starting point.

510
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,431
Begin a circle search,

511
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:55,068
keep widening the perimeter
till we find him.

512
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,737
And remember,

513
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,739
I do not want my son hurt.

514
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,072
Yes sir.

515
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:13,085
Come on, we've got
to make it across the bridge.

516
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,179
This can't be happening.

517
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

518
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,804
It's starting again.

519
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:13,880
The pain helps.

520
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,916
The pain makes
the hunger go away.

521
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,451
What are you doing?
Stop it!

522
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:18,885
Don't touch me!

523
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:21,121
Stay away from me.
Just leave me alone.

524
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,092
What's happening to you?

525
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,393
How could you eat that--

526
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:28,527
that man?

527
00:45:28,628 --> 00:45:30,864
- It's your fault.
- Me?

528
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:33,867
You made me this way.

529
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:38,338
You brought me back,
you should have left me dead.

530
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,141
Is that what you want?

531
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,244
Do you want to be dead?

532
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:46,313
All right, that's fine!

533
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:47,481
What was I thinking?

534
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,047
Look at you,
you're disgusting!

535
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:08,101
Fuck!

536
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:13,172
Julie.

537
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:17,777
Julie!

538
00:46:27,353 --> 00:46:29,088
Julie!

539
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,833
Julie!

540
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,947
Look, don't be stupid.

541
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,784
Julie, get off
the ledge, please.

542
00:46:58,885 --> 00:46:59,885
No.

543
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,456
Julie, damn it,
stop screwing around

544
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:03,789
and get back over here now.

545
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,925
Just go away.

546
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:08,527
- Julie.
- Go away.

547
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,800
I didn't mean what I said before.

548
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:18,105
I'm sorry.

549
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,574
All I want is for things
to be the way they used to be.

550
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,943
I like you the way
you were before.

551
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:28,581
The way you were.
The way you used to be.

552
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:34,121
But--

553
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:36,188
But I can't be.

554
00:47:36,255 --> 00:47:40,427
Curt, don't you see I can't?

555
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:44,597
No!

556
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:06,152
Julie!

557
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:09,489
Julie!

558
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:14,628
Where are you?!

559
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:19,032
Julie!

560
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,472
Julie!

561
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:41,887
Damn, look at this.

562
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:49,596
I've never seen so many pigs
turn out for a lousy little hit.

563
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:51,498
Maybe you killed that guy
in the store.

564
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:52,898
Hey, relax it with that shit.

565
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:54,101
I didn't kill nobody.

566
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:55,702
He was alive.

567
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:58,204
Santos.

568
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:00,539
There's something wrong
with Mogo, man.

569
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:02,376
What's the matter?

570
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:05,311
I don't know, man.

571
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:06,780
- Ew!
- It's his arm, man.

572
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:07,813
Look.

573
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:10,817
Oh, shit.

574
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:13,119
What the fuck happened, Mogo?

575
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,889
She bit me.

576
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,056
Who bit you?

577
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:18,925
That bitch in the store.

578
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:20,827
She gave you something.

579
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,929
She gave you something bad.

580
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:24,664
Well, what is it?

581
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:26,132
I don't know.

582
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,235
Gangrene, rabies...

583
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,768
maybe the bitch had rabies.

584
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:33,306
Santos, what are we gonna do?

585
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,875
What are we gonna do?

586
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:36,643
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

587
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:39,746
We're gonna go after the bitch,
and make her pay for this.

588
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:41,414
That's what we're gonna do.

589
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,150
Santos, there's only
one way out of that alley.

590
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:45,619
Through the sewer tunnel,

591
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:46,987
and out the 7th Street bridge.

592
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,056
Let's go to the river.

593
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:52,759
Let's go to the river, Santos.

594
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:55,161
Let's go to the river.

595
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:02,034
Where are you?!

596
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,639
Julie!

597
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,677
Julie!

598
00:50:15,114 --> 00:50:16,650
What the hell do you want?

599
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:20,253
I saw a river swallow
three men once,

600
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,623
one time back in New Orleans.

601
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:24,625
It was a night just like this.

602
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,260
Pitch black.

603
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,096
Julie!

604
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:32,231
They were floating along
just as nice as you want to.

605
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:34,034
Then they round the corner,

606
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:37,536
and she rose up like
a big old black viper,

607
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,139
and pulled them under,
just like that.

608
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:42,108
Swallowed them whole.

609
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:45,210
Never found one of them.

610
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:47,146
Julie!

611
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:49,016
I saw it.

612
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:51,652
I saw it all.

613
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,887
Just like I saw it here.

614
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:56,590
Julie!

615
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,960
You know,
from where I was...

616
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:02,795
...looked like she
jumped in on purpose.

617
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:05,132
Would you mind your
own goddamn business?

618
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:07,233
Seems like she don't
want to be found.

619
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:09,670
And I'm just
telling you what I saw.

620
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:12,838
Well, nobody asked you.

621
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,311
"Well, I saw it in the mirror."

622
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:20,179
"I saw it on
the bottom of my shoe."

623
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,619
Julie?

624
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,291
Julie.

625
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:36,829
Talk to me.
Honey, talk to me.

626
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:39,099
Leave her be.
She gone.

627
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,702
- She can't be.
- I'm telling you, kid.

628
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:43,737
They don't get
no deader than that.

629
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:47,273
You don't understand.
It's impossible.

630
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,409
She can't die.

631
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:50,744
Julie.

632
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:52,545
Julie, talk to me.
Wake up!

633
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,081
Julie.

634
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:00,454
Mary, mother of Christ.

635
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,021
Let go of me.

636
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:04,891
- Let me go.
- No, Julie.

637
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:13,567
Why are you doing this to me?

638
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,601
It's gonna be okay.

639
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,675
I don't know
what's happening to me.

640
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,610
I'm not alive.

641
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,346
I'm not dead.

642
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,514
I'm just--

643
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:34,121
I'm just so lonely.

644
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:36,590
Julie, listen to me,

645
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,759
if we stay together
we can beat this.

646
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:42,329
- No, I can't.
- Yes, we can.

647
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,664
Together we can.

648
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:45,831
You can't give up on us.

649
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:48,501
Julie, you're all I've got.

650
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,670
And I don't ever
want to live without you.

651
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:53,206
Ever.

652
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,043
Hey, there they are.

653
00:52:56,175 --> 00:52:57,376
Come on.

654
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:58,411
Oh, shit.

655
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:01,581
You fucking bitch,
your ass is grass.

656
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:02,882
What do they want?

657
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,286
Whatever it is,
it sure ain't good.

658
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,623
You're dead meat!
You motherfucking bitch!

659
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,056
We've got to get out of here.

660
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:13,427
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, follow me.

661
00:53:13,492 --> 00:53:16,195
"I saw the light..."

662
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,697
Come on.

663
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:19,297
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's her.

664
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:28,108
- I know how to get around.
- Come on!

665
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:40,320
Come on, son.
Where are you?

666
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,289
John, will you not beat
yourself up about this?

667
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:44,590
We're doing everything we can.

668
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,260
It just doesn't seem
to be enough, does it?

669
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,362
Sir, we found their escape route.

670
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:51,231
It's a storm drain that leads
from here to the viaduct,

671
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,132
under the river bridge.

672
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:53,766
All right, notify the
rest of the troops.

673
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,103
John, hold it.

674
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:59,472
This just arrived
from General Meade.

675
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:03,844
- Son of a bitch.
- What is it?

676
00:54:03,976 --> 00:54:05,746
You're officially being
relieved of your command.

677
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:08,248
I'm to take over science operations,
effective immediately.

678
00:54:08,382 --> 00:54:10,317
Sergeant!

679
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,351
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:12,853
As of now, I'm in control
of the situation.

681
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,085
I want it upgraded immediately...

682
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:15,655
...to total indiscriminate containment.

683
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:16,922
What?

684
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:19,626
I said there was to be no
discrimination during containment.

685
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,300
I have my son you're talking about.

686
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,063
The odds are your son is
probably contaminated already.

687
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:26,032
Well, there's still a chance.

688
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,567
A chance isn't good enough.

689
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:29,670
Reynolds, what are you doing?

690
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:31,538
I'm going after my son.

691
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:33,574
You're no longer part of this effort.

692
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:34,708
Come on.

693
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:10,309
What's the matter?

694
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,643
I don't know.

695
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:15,983
I get these cramps.
I feel so stiff.

696
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:29,429
Come on.

697
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:50,650
Come on.

698
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,297
Shut the door.

699
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:17,610
They'll never find you, down here.

700
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:18,911
What is this place?

701
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:20,547
It's a pump room.

702
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:22,715
I call it a home.

703
00:56:30,856 --> 00:56:34,360
Good lord, she is cold.

704
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:36,630
Here.

705
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:46,005
Thanks.

706
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:51,478
What kind of trouble
are you in, anyway?

707
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:54,947
Come on, kid!

708
00:56:55,047 --> 00:56:56,782
Level with me.

709
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:58,452
I may live with rats,

710
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:01,054
but I sure as hell
ain't one of them.

711
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,092
We were on our way to Seattle.

712
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:08,228
We got into
a mess with those guys,

713
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:11,398
there was an argument
and a guy was shot.

714
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,766
Did you do it?

715
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:17,471
No, they did
and they took off.

716
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,751
So...

717
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:34,387
what are you
gonna do in Seattle?

718
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,456
I don't know.

719
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,226
I guess maybe get
a job on something.

720
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,927
Maybe get a gig
in a band playing drums.

721
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:45,632
- You a musician?
- I don't know.

722
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:48,135
I've never been in a band,
but it's what I want to do.

723
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:52,472
I know it sounds stupid.

724
00:57:55,074 --> 00:57:56,876
It don't sound stupid to me.

725
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:02,849
It doesn't?

726
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,585
You don't think
it sounds crazy?

727
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:06,320
Hell no.

728
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:10,289
Sounds like you got
something inside you,

729
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:12,192
you just got to get out.

730
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:13,860
Like me,

731
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:16,063
me and my things.

732
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:18,498
I figure, if...

733
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:21,134
...people found out
what they had inside them,

734
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,036
and how to get it out,

735
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:27,541
there'd be a lot
more happy people.

736
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:31,510
So you really
think I could do it?

737
00:58:31,577 --> 00:58:33,880
Sure, why not?

738
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:39,219
Of course, what do I know?

739
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:44,523
You're talking to a guy
who lives in sewers.

740
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:49,929
You two stay here,

741
00:58:49,996 --> 00:58:52,266
and rest.

742
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:54,668
I'll keep a watch outside.

743
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,172
Hey...

744
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:03,577
I don't even know your name.

745
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,045
So?

746
00:59:06,146 --> 00:59:07,614
Well I wanted to say thanks.

747
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:10,317
Thanks for everything and...

748
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,619
I'm probably never gonna
have a chance to repay you.

749
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,262
Here.

750
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:27,668
- What's this?
- A Mandi Gras coin.

751
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,036
Next time you find
someone who needs help,

752
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,039
you just help them out,
and you give them that coin,

753
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:37,945
and tell them to do
the same to somebody else.

754
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,813
I figure as long as
that coin keeps circulating,

755
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:43,717
there will always
be somebody out there...

756
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:46,987
...doing something
good for somebody.

757
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:49,922
You got a deal.

758
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:54,994
You can call me Riverman.

759
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:00,266
Come on.

760
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,034
Uh, not in there.

761
01:00:02,135 --> 01:00:04,070
Hey, let's just go.

762
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,539
Jesus Christ.
Come on.

763
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:08,775
- Gross.
- Come on, this way.

764
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:14,347
Santos, I think we should
get Mogo to a hospital.

765
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:17,851
Once we find the bitch.

766
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:20,621
Santos, a rat.

767
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:25,925
Come on!

768
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,911
Julie.

769
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,981
What are we gonna do?

770
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:51,918
What's gonna happen to us?

771
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:53,753
You want to know
what's gonna happen to us?

772
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:57,824
We're gonna move to Seattle.

773
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,860
We're gonna get
a nice place on the water.

774
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:03,030
I'm gonna get a gig in a band.

775
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,599
And you can hang out all night
and party, and watch me play.

776
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:14,942
Do you really think we'll make it?

777
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:17,978
Of course I do.

778
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:38,030
Julie, what's the matter?

779
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,699
What's wrong?

780
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:43,302
I can't do this anymore.

781
01:01:43,402 --> 01:01:45,572
What?

782
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:46,806
I can't--

783
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,675
I can't keep pretending--
I mean--

784
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:53,880
I want it to be like it was before.

785
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:55,983
But...

786
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:58,050
...I don't feel the same.

787
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:02,588
I just--

788
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:04,458
I feel-- Oh God!

789
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,994
I feel so goddamn hungry!

790
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,795
Julie, come back to bed.

791
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:14,101
I can't stand being like this.

792
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:16,436
What's wrong?

793
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:39,693
What are you doing?

794
01:02:42,728 --> 01:02:46,233
Nothing. Nothing.

795
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,748
I'm sorry, Curt.

796
01:03:07,721 --> 01:03:09,690
I'm sorry.

797
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:14,494
I just get
a little confused sometimes.

798
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:39,619
Come on.

799
01:03:41,722 --> 01:03:44,090
Oh... God!

800
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:47,460
We're never gonna
find our way out of here.

801
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,527
- Shut up.
- Shit!

802
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:52,199
They've got to be
here somewhere.

803
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:56,202
We're never gonna
find our way out of here.

804
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:57,304
You shut up!

805
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:01,340
Look up the license on that car.

806
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:24,523
What the hell is that?

807
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:34,601
Wake up.

808
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:39,639
Where is she?

809
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:41,141
Huh?

810
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,311
Where is she?

811
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:53,085
Where is she?

812
01:05:53,186 --> 01:05:55,088
I don't know.

813
01:05:57,224 --> 01:05:58,791
Spit it out.

814
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:02,596
Where am I?

815
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:05,231
What's wrong with me?

816
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:08,768
Santos, I don't think
Mogo's gonna make it...

817
01:06:08,936 --> 01:06:10,536
...unless we get him
out of here now.

818
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,438
I know.

819
01:06:12,572 --> 01:06:14,840
But not until he tells me
where the bitch is.

820
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:19,346
Yes.

821
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:27,054
Leave him alone.

822
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:40,666
Leave him alone.

823
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:41,668
Felipe!

824
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:54,514
Okay, you little bastard...

825
01:06:59,786 --> 01:07:02,121
...we're gonna do this
the nice and easy way.

826
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,657
Call her.

827
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:04,791
Call her!

828
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:06,626
What did we do to you?

829
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,195
We didn't do anything.

830
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:16,335
Call her or I squeeze the trigger.

831
01:07:21,775 --> 01:07:23,277
Santos, look.

832
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:34,186
Oh my God.

833
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,847
Ew, God.

834
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:03,083
What is that?

835
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:11,324
Julie?

836
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:16,296
Felipe.

837
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,703
If he moves,
blow him away.

838
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,671
My pleasure.

839
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:43,154
So you want to join the party?

840
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:47,993
I like it.
I like it very much.

841
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:55,100
Kinky.

842
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,237
Nice touch.

843
01:08:58,572 --> 01:09:00,006
But you know what?

844
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,876
You don't look like
you got rabies to me.

845
01:09:06,645 --> 01:09:10,582
You look like my kind of bitch.

846
01:09:10,684 --> 01:09:11,917
Leave her alone.

847
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:14,555
Don't tempt me.

848
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:19,524
Felipe...

849
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:22,828
I do what you say.

850
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:34,774
Help me.
Don't let me die.

851
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,042
- Help me.
- Mogo.

852
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:57,296
Mogo.

853
01:09:57,363 --> 01:09:58,465
Felipe!

854
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,835
I think Mogo's dead.

855
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:10,143
Shit.

856
01:10:10,243 --> 01:10:11,411
Santos!

857
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:16,680
Santos!

858
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:34,734
Oh, God!

859
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,136
Oh, Santos!

860
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:47,412
Oh my God.
Julie.

861
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:50,515
What have you done?

862
01:10:58,323 --> 01:11:00,426
Kill her!
Kill her, Felipe.

863
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:03,095
Kill it!

864
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,328
You crazy bitch!

865
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,533
Julie stop it!

866
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,479
Christ!

867
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:56,649
Stop it!

868
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:58,719
No. No. No more.

869
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,886
What happened to you?

870
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,154
How could you?

871
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:05,390
I can't help it.

872
01:12:05,524 --> 01:12:06,859
The hunger. I--

873
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,268
Hey kid, get in here.

874
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,810
Not her.

875
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:25,944
Look, I'm not going anywhere
without Julie.

876
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:27,747
I said no!

877
01:12:27,814 --> 01:12:30,884
Come on, let's go.
Let us in!

878
01:12:30,984 --> 01:12:32,719
Get in here!

879
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:35,720
Close it!

880
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:37,689
Mary, mother of Christ!

881
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,859
The zombies.

882
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:46,966
Shit!
This isn't gonna hold them.

883
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:51,738
She dead, ain't she?

884
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:53,805
God damn it! Help us!

885
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:59,212
Get something
to hammer this with.

886
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,729
This way.

887
01:13:27,372 --> 01:13:29,243
Where are the nails?

888
01:13:30,676 --> 01:13:33,212
Curt, help me.

889
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:35,479
I'm losing myself, Curt.

890
01:13:37,484 --> 01:13:40,354
When it doesn't hurt,
I get hungry.

891
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:44,256
The pain isn't helping anymore.

892
01:13:49,328 --> 01:13:50,462
Hey!

893
01:13:52,698 --> 01:13:55,667
I'm getting hungry again.

894
01:13:58,104 --> 01:13:59,206
It's okay.

895
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:05,176
Curt, help me.

896
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:06,880
Are you gonna
tie me up, please?

897
01:14:07,014 --> 01:14:08,546
- What are you doing?
- Tie me up.

898
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:10,617
Don't you see
what's happening?

899
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,286
Just tie them.

900
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,220
I'm one of them.

901
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,059
Oh, shit.

902
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:26,466
They're getting through.

903
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:34,073
This door's not gonna hold them.

904
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:38,045
They got the door.

905
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:46,220
Oh, shit!

906
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,121
Is there any way out of here?

907
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:51,488
- There's a ladder.
- Where does it go?

908
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:52,926
Up to the street.

909
01:14:53,024 --> 01:14:54,595
We're not gonna make it,
we don't have time.

910
01:14:55,929 --> 01:14:57,029
I got an idea.

911
01:15:04,069 --> 01:15:06,773
Damn, it's not holding.

912
01:15:11,778 --> 01:15:13,779
You go, I'll stay
and hold them off.

913
01:15:13,912 --> 01:15:16,416
You've got a bullet in your leg,
I can get away faster.

914
01:15:16,515 --> 01:15:17,783
Take Julie and go.

915
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:20,453
Her? Are you crazy?

916
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,456
It's too late for her.

917
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,988
Listen to me,
God damn it!

918
01:15:24,055 --> 01:15:25,859
We're all getting out of here.
Do you hear me?

919
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:26,960
All of us.

920
01:15:27,094 --> 01:15:29,796
Take Julie and go.

921
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,162
Take Julie with you.

922
01:15:39,273 --> 01:15:40,774
God, help us.

923
01:16:46,206 --> 01:16:47,608
Julie?

924
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:50,176
Riverman?

925
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:04,457
Oh my God.

926
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:06,591
Julie, not him.

927
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,555
Help me.

928
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:38,625
Help me end this pain.

929
01:17:41,993 --> 01:17:43,930
What have I done?

930
01:17:49,202 --> 01:17:50,368
Colonel Reynolds, over here.

931
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,470
We've got four contaminated units.

932
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:34,979
What's behind?

933
01:18:35,046 --> 01:18:36,550
Curt!

934
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,818
Get away from her!

935
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,953
Get away from her, son.

936
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:50,029
No, Curt.

937
01:18:51,698 --> 01:18:53,800
Don't leave me.

938
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:55,469
Get out of the way, son.

939
01:18:57,337 --> 01:18:58,505
Get away from her!

940
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:39,779
The Colonel told me
that you were very helpful...

941
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:41,247
...during your debriefing.

942
01:19:41,345 --> 01:19:43,850
I just answered
a lot of questions, that's all.

943
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,453
When your mother died,

944
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,960
the hardest thing
I ever did was to let go.

945
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:57,764
So I just buried myself
in this insane job.

946
01:19:57,898 --> 01:19:59,198
And be cause of that,

947
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,069
I haven't always been there
when you've needed me.

948
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,143
Look, son, I--

949
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:17,015
I thought maybe we could
take a couple of weeks...

950
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:18,452
...before Oklahoma City.

951
01:20:20,752 --> 01:20:22,322
Just the two of us.

952
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,390
Spend some time together.

953
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:27,828
We have a lot to talk about.

954
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:34,701
Let's get out of here.

955
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:35,435
Dad...

956
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:39,139
What's gonna happen to Julie?

957
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:43,076
I don't know.

958
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,046
She's part
of Sinclair's project now.

959
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:57,122
John, Sinclair has requested that
your report on the Walker girl...

960
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,225
...be kept under wraps.

961
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:04,029
Colonel, the fact that
she was cognitive...

962
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:07,868
...proves that the living dead
aren't just animated flesh.

963
01:21:07,966 --> 01:21:09,935
It proves that
they have an inner life.

964
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:12,872
The objective
of this program is to create...

965
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,738
...bio-weapons from these units.

966
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,810
Let's not confuse the issue.

967
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:18,545
If you don't mind,
I have work to do.

968
01:21:20,113 --> 01:21:23,550
John, I have an order
to do as she says.

969
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,786
Destroy the report.

970
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,234
Julie?

971
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:08,622
You're Colonel Reynolds's son,
aren't you?

972
01:23:08,755 --> 01:23:10,657
Believe it or not,
you're looking...

973
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:12,960
...at the weapons system
of the future.

974
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,859
The what?

975
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,411
Lock it up! Lock it up!

976
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:14,453
That one in there
is a prototype.

977
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,555
This one's going next.

978
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:19,024
You mean Julie?

979
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:20,225
That's right.

980
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:22,261
They're all going to
end up like that.

981
01:24:22,362 --> 01:24:25,997
Bio-mechanical weapons
driven by meat batteries.

982
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:28,068
Never have to be fed
or recharged.

983
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:31,703
They just keep going
and going...

984
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:35,809
What are you doing?

985
01:24:39,613 --> 01:24:41,979
What the hell
is he doing here?

986
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:52,225
Julie, it's okay.

987
01:25:23,023 --> 01:25:24,725
Get the gun!

988
01:25:56,854 --> 01:26:00,225
I knew you'd never leave me.

989
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:04,264
Shoot!

990
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,729
Get down!

991
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:16,710
Shoot again!

992
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,877
Watch it!

993
01:27:38,692 --> 01:27:39,826
Help us!

994
01:27:41,694 --> 01:27:43,697
Help us!

995
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:45,162
Somebody let us out!

996
01:28:01,314 --> 01:28:03,082
Riverman.

997
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:07,520
Riverman, no.
It's me, Curt.

998
01:28:09,654 --> 01:28:11,256
Do you remember this?

999
01:28:11,323 --> 01:28:13,560
Come on, remember.

1000
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:15,060
It's me.
Help us, please.

1001
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:19,631
Let us out.
Get the door open.

1002
01:28:19,733 --> 01:28:22,368
Open the door for us.

1003
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:54,368
Lockdown commencing
in one minute 20...

1004
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:05,444
Lockdown commencing
in one minute 10 seconds.

1005
01:29:11,818 --> 01:29:15,020
Lockdown commencing
in one minute.

1006
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:35,042
Lockdown commencing
in 40 seconds.

1007
01:29:42,015 --> 01:29:44,984
Lockdown commencing
in 30 seconds.

1008
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:54,962
Lockdown commencing
in 20 seconds.

1009
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:01,868
Have you seen my son?

1010
01:30:01,935 --> 01:30:03,337
No. We gotta get out of here.

1011
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:06,404
We gotta get out.

1012
01:30:06,537 --> 01:30:08,475
Eight... Seven...

1013
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,444
Six... Five...

1014
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:12,511
Four... Three...

1015
01:30:12,578 --> 01:30:14,680
Two... Lockdown.

1016
01:30:52,019 --> 01:30:53,185
We got to go.

1017
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:01,795
Curt!

1018
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:03,697
Curt, hurry.

1019
01:31:03,764 --> 01:31:06,733
Come on, leave her
and get out of there.

1020
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,135
Dad, I can't.

1021
01:31:12,872 --> 01:31:14,104
You don't belong in there.

1022
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:16,542
You belong out here.
Come on, son, please.

1023
01:31:16,609 --> 01:31:18,444
Son, you got to let her go.

1024
01:31:18,578 --> 01:31:20,881
It's over.
She's dead.

1025
01:31:24,551 --> 01:31:28,322
I'm sorry, Dad.
It's too late for me.

1026
01:31:29,456 --> 01:31:31,291
No, Curt...

1027
01:31:31,425 --> 01:31:32,960
No!

1028
01:31:36,162 --> 01:31:37,430
John.
John, you're gonna have to leave here.

1029
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:39,198
They're sealing off
the whole building.

1030
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:41,501
- Curt!
- Damn it, let's go!

1031
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,515
We got to get out of here.

1032
01:31:57,618 --> 01:31:59,453
We are, Julie.

1033
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:02,720
We are.

1034
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:31,685
Where?

1035
01:32:31,818 --> 01:32:33,487
Where we belong.
