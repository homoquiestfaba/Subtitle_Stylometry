1
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,500
Adios, give me 10
 bucks for Louis here.

2
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,630
$10?

3
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,820
$10, what's wrong
 with that, $10?

4
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,380
That's a lot of freaking
 money for three cups of coffee.

5
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,450
What do you want from me?

6
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,790
The guy is from
 Boston, you know?

7
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,980
Hey, Louis, tell Tommy
 Cucci to hurry up.

8
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,890
We got a job.

9
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,730
Hey, and, Louis, tell him nice.

10
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,200
We don't want to
 piss off the prince.

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,660
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,810
So Tommy's old man is away?

13
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,210
-Yeah.
 -Where?

14
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,360
He's in Marion.

15
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,320
Jesus, how long?

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,520
Two 20s, consecutive.

17
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,790
So they wanted Mr.
 Tommy Cucci, Sr.?

18
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,140
Yeah, they wanted him bad.

19
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,680
The freaking guy does
 Jackie Brancato a favor,

20
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,420
then Jackie has him set up.

21
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,040
My people don't know Jackie.

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,330
You're not related.

23
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,940
Same last name is all, all
 my Brancatos were smart enough

24
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,230
to settle in Boston.

25
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,700
Your Brancatos?

26
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,580
What's the story with
 Tommy, ain't got no juice now

27
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,340
that the old man is away?

28
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,270
I don't know what he's got.

29
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,840
I know that we're sitting
 here waiting for him.

30
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,220
He ain't sitting in
 here waiting for us.

31
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,280
They make 'em?

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,180
No, not yet.

33
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,600
Well, are they going to?

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,310
What am I, a
 freaking librarian?

35
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm just asking.

36
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,610
Penucci said Lamb
 would give him a shot.

37
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,490
Don't call him Lamb.

38
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,190
Everybody in Boston
 calls him Lamb.

39
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah, well, you
 ain't in Boston.

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,510
Down here, we call
 him Mr. Joseph.

41
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,960
Mr. Joseph?

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Sounds like a
 freaking hair dresser.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,120
The only hair
 dressing he's gonna

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,970
do for you, Matty, is
 gonna put a new part

45
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,190
in that freaking rug of yours.

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,290
This ain't no rug.

47
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,520
Yeah, right, and I
 ain't freaking handsome.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,930
This ain't no rug.
 It's a weave.

49
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,630
It's a what?

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,750
A weave, they got these
 girls in Thailand that grow

51
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,960
their hair down to the ankles.

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,020
They sell it to the
 hair club for men guy,

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,140
and he attaches it to the head.

54
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,300
So it's plugs?

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,250
It's not plugs.

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,610
It's a freaking weave.

57
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

58
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,640
I've been reading
 the book you gave me.

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,740
Which one?

60
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,910
You know, the one
 about the painter.

61
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,730
Monet?

62
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,930
No, not that one, the-- the
 other guy, the one that painted

63
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,380
all those women in doors.

64
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,350
Vermer?

65
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,670
Vermeer, that's one of
 the ones Jackie loaned me.

66
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,000
They didn't know
 much about him.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,340
Who, Jackie?

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,900
He works at the museum.

69
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,980
Not him, the other
 guy, the painter,

70
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,620
Vermeer-- all those
 paintings he did,

71
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,120
nobody knows anything about him.

72
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,780
Yeah, the guy is a
 mystery, all right.

73
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,180
Yeah, you men like that.

74
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,700
What's that?

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,900
You know, being
 mysterious, right?

76
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Here he comes.

77
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,720
What the heck's he doing?
 Come on.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,330
We ain't got all
 freaking day here.

79
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,160
Hey, Jimmy the Pope,
 what in the heck's up?

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,820
Tommy Cucci, Matty Horse
 Brancato from Boston.

81
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,360
Hey, Boston, uh, Massachusetts,
 hey, I've been there.

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,430
I had to lay off some money
 one time for some animals down

83
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,250
in Southy.

84
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah, remember his name?

85
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,620
Nah, it was one
 of those schools,

86
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,500
one of those fag schools.

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,170
Are you talking about BU?

88
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,420
BU, BO, what the
 heck's the difference?

89
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,480
Boston sucks anyway, right?

90
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,940
So, Tommy, I'm sorry to hear
 about your old man, you know?

91
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,330
Oh, yeah, what are
 you sorry about?

92
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,690
I mean, what's it got
 to do with you, huh?

93
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,120
It ain't got nothing
 to do with me.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,100
Yeah, then why are you sorry?

95
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,250
Tommy, he says he's sorry.

96
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,180
It's a figure of
 speech, for Pete sakes.

97
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,110
Oh, yeah?

98
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,080
Well, so is freak you, Jimmy.

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,160
That's a figure of speech, too.

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Hey, you can drop that.

101
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,770
Hey, Tommy, you don't
 say that to a made guy,

102
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,240
even if he is from Boston.

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,430
That's right, you fool.

104
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,990
I don't give a
 freak who you are.

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,600
I didn't come down here
 to be freaking insulted.

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,260
What did you come
 down here for then,

107
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,040
huh, get yourself a better wig?

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Go screw yourself.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,380
I'll blow your
 mother-freaking head off.

110
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,740
Will you look at this
 big mess, will ya?

111
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
So what do we do
 now, Matty, huh?

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,920
Now come on, Matty Horse.

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,910
Me and you, we freaking
 break each others' bones,

114
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,540
but we're all
 right, right, Matty?

115
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,710
I don't give a freak.

116
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,240
You hear me?

117
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll blow your
 mother-freaking head off.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Matty, I gotta
 deliver this kid to Mr.

119
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,970
Joseph in a couple hours.

120
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,750
If that don't freaking
 happen, it's on my head.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,900
This kid has got to
 freaking apologize to me,

122
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,090
or this gun don't freaking move.

123
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,820
Now you let me
 take care of this,

124
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,860
and you'll get the
 freaking apology you want.

125
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,000
I promise you.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,690
Now put the freaking gun away.

127
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,080
Put the freaking gun away.

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,370
Put it away, Matty.

129
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,780
I said, put it away.

130
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,710
Get the hell out of my
 car, the both of youse.

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,540
Sorry about that, Matty, his
 freaking old man, you know.

132
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,140
Yeah, Jimmy, get out
 of the freaking car.

133
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,020
Hey, Matty, your hair,
 it looks pretty good.

134
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,680
I mean--

135
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,260
Jimmy, get your face
 out of my freaking car.

136
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,550
Macaroni is good,
 the sauce, I mean.

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,350
I was thinking, though,
 maybe, uh, maybe you

138
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,070
could add a little more salt.

139
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,850
I don't know.

140
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,860
You need salt. I'll
 get you some salt.

141
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,250
Yeah, maybe-- you know, no.

142
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,070
On second thought, no,
 no need, it's fine.

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Wine is good, though.

144
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,510
-What do you mean, though?
 -What?

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,670
You know, like, when
 you say, the wine

147
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,860
is good, though, it's
 like you're saying

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,240
something else isn't so good.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,250
Did I say that?

150
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah, you said it.

151
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,560
You said, the
 wine's good, though.

152
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,970
And I'm wondering, though, what?

153
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,940
Well, sometimes I like,
 um, you know, to have

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,110
a little ice cube in mine.

155
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,380
Ice cube in what?

156
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,930
In my wine, where did
 you think I wanted it?

157
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,630
I don't know.

158
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,130
If you want some ice,
 I'll get you some ice.

159
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,410
No, no, no, you're fine.

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,860
You know, I just wanted
 a little taste, anyways.

161
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,680
I don't want Father Scapali
 thinking I'm drinking, right?

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,640
Hey, you never told me
 what you thought of him.

163
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,600
I didn't?

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,820
Remember when you took me
 over there the other week?

165
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,650
You said, someday, I'm
 gonna tell you what I think

166
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,770
of that guy, but you never did.

167
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,780
What do I know about priests?

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,150
I haven't been down
 to church since I

169
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,510
made my first communion.

170
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,230
But you were baptized.

171
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,390
I guess.

172
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,820
It's nothing I remember.

173
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,510
Oh, no, you were.

174
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm sure.

175
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,340
How are you sure?

176
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, because, you know,
 you-- you're a good person.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
I am?

178
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,140
Yeah, I think you are.

179
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,170
You are to me.

180
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,200
You know, you help me
 with stuff and everything.

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,700
So you're saying you've
 got to be baptized

182
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,330
before you can be good?

183
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,770
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

184
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,380
That don't make much sense.

185
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,620
Why not?

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,400
Well, take for
 instance Steinberg.

187
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,410
Right, she used to come by every
 night to make sure you were OK.

188
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,270
You thought she
 was a good person.

189
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,080
Now you gotta figure
 she wasn't baptized.

190
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,190
The way I figure
 it, Jewish people

191
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,940
don't have to be baptized
 because Jesus was Jewish.

192
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,310
John the Baptist was
 Jewish, so I figure,

193
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,200
you know, they got baptized
 enough for the whole, you know,

194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
race.

195
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,410
That's nuts, Marilyn.

196
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,310
Well, maybe it's nuts to you.

197
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,650
That's the way I see it.

198
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,510
What about Mr. Hwang, the
 guy from the laundry store?

199
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,310
Now he's always helping
 you carry your laundry

200
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,300
upstairs and stuff.

201
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,400
Oh, by the way,
 did you remember

202
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,880
to pick up the laundry today?

203
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,820
I picked it up.

204
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,870
I put it away this afternoon.

205
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,030
OK, so what about Mr. Hwang?

206
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,850
He wasn't baptized,
 and he ain't Jewish.

207
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,010
But he's a nice man.

208
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,840
Mr. Hwang was not baptized,
 but he can still be a nice man.

209
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,620
He just can't be saved.

210
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,300
How can you say this stuff?

211
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
You asked me, so
 I'm telling you.

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,130
Mr. Hwang can come back next
 time as another person, see?

213
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,790
That's why the Asians
 believe in reincarnation,

214
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,230
because this is the best they
 got going this time around.

215
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,000
Does that Father
 Scapali fill your head

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,390
with all this nonsense?

217
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,300
No, Father Scapali is too
 damn happy for his own good.

218
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,270
He thinks everybody goes
 to heaven, no matter what.

219
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,360
No matter what?

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,060
No matter what.

221
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,180
What about a guy who
 robs and steals and stuff?

222
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,120
Goes to heaven, according
 to Father Scapali.

223
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,430
What about a guy who
 does even worse stuff?

224
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,600
Heaven, according
 to Father Scapali.

225
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,840
-So do you think so, too?
 -Me?

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,690
Of course not, I'm not crazy.

227
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,300
That's just Father Scapali's
 crazy take on everything,

228
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,520
and even he don't say it
 when the bishop is around.

229
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,610
-Who is the bishop?
 -The bishop?

230
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,550
He's Father Scapali's boss.

231
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,910
Who's the bishop's boss?

232
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,310
The cardinal.

233
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,230
And what does he think?

234
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh, he thinks what
 the pope thinks.

235
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,180
And what does the pope think?

236
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,470
He thinks what God thinks.

237
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,190
Yeah?

238
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,450
Yeah, what?

239
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,160
So what does God think?

240
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,740
Frankly, Vincent, I think that
 is something you're gonna have

241
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,930
to figure out for yourself.

242
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,040
It's good macaroni.

243
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,840
What time do you
 have to be at work?

244
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,780
Father Scapali likes us at
 the shelter before midnight,

245
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,720
but most women of the
 women are down before then.

246
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,180
But he likes someone
 at the phones.

247
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,570
I've got to meet this guy.

248
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,500
Who?

249
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,430
What guy?

250
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,660
Father what's-his-name, the
 everybody goes to heaven guy.

251
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,770
Yeah, well, he's
 there every night.

252
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,590
You could meet him.
 He wants to meet you anyway.

253
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,450
He said that?

254
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,230
When?

255
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,780
He said it.

256
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,330
He said it when you came
 to pick me up that time.

257
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,520
Remember?

258
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,160
He said, I'd like
 to meet that guy.

259
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,230
Hey, V.

260
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,590
-How you doing, Tommy?
 -I'm all right.

261
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,470
You know, what can I say?

262
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah, what can you say?

263
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,540
V, do you know this guy named
 Matty Brancato from Boston?

264
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,330
They call him Matty the Horse.

265
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,510
No, I mean, I heard
 his name is all.

266
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,700
What's the matter?

267
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,350
Is this guy a problem to you?

268
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,630
Yeah, Brancato,
 that's the problem.

269
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,120
Well, you say he's from Boston.

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,470
There's a lot of
 people from Boston.

271
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,750
Same name don't mean nothing.

272
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,490
Yeah.

273
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,520
Unless you're talking about
 you and your old man, of course.

274
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,950
Now that last name
 means something.

275
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,560
-Yeah.
 -How's he doing?

276
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,050
Oh, you know, he's got
 his health and everything,

277
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,540
but he can't stand
 being locked up.

278
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,740
You know?

279
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,220
I don't know what
 happened there.

280
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,540
I mean, yeah, Jackie
 Brancato set him up, but--

281
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,200
But what, V?

282
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,870
Tommy, nothing is easy.

283
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,840
Nothing is what it really is.

284
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,020
Do you know what I'm saying?

285
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,070
Yeah, listen.

286
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,370
I gotta go down to the club
 tonight to see Mr. Joseph.

287
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,070
Yeah, I figured.

288
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,210
When you get time for
 something, though,

289
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,670
just remember what I told you.

290
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,840
In this life we got here,
 nothing is what it seems to be.

291
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,650
-Yeah, nothing's nothing, right?
 -What do you think?

292
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,830
Are they gonna make you?

293
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,150
Yeah, I guess so.

294
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,210
Do you want that?

295
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,540
Yeah, of course, I want that.

296
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,310
Why wouldn't I want it?

297
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,690
Because maybe it ain't all
 what it's supposed to be.

298
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,120
Looks like it's done
 all right by you.

299
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,800
Tommy, it's like this.

300
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,840
Who is your best friend?

301
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,770
I ain't got no best friend.

302
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,860
All right, let's say--
 let's say you did, all right?

303
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,810
And let's say Mr.
 Joseph says, Tommy, I

304
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,850
want you to go out there
 and kill your best friend.

305
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,400
But I don't have a best friend.

306
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,610
You've got no choice.

307
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,460
I mean, if Mr. Joseph says,
 kill your best friend,

308
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,610
and you're not made,
 you can say no.

309
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,520
But if you're made,
 you got no choice.

310
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,630
They'll make you do it
 just to make a point.

311
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,590
What point is that?

312
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,680
That they can.

313
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,560
They own you, Tommy.

314
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,070
You're theirs.

315
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,950
Well, like I said, it
 ain't done you any harm, V.

316
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,690
I'm only saying is all.

317
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,970
Look, I've gotta
 get going, you know?

318
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,770
Tommy, tell your old man, OK?

319
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,390
What do you want
 me to tell him?

320
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,790
I was thinking of him, OK?

321
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,800
That's all.

322
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:15,180
Take care, V.

323
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,540
VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Tommy,
 Sr., used to say to me,

324
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,700
think of it this way, Vincent.

325
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,290
You're walking down the street
 and you turn to the right.

326
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,620
And whatever's
 waiting for you there,

327
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,320
that's your life, Vincent.

328
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,550
And there's no sense worrying
 about what would have been

329
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,140
or could have been if you'd
 taken the left because that's

330
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,960
not to your life.

331
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,860
That's just a lot of noise
 taking up room in your hand.

332
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,080
And now Tommy, Sr., don't
 turn anyway no more.

333
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,390
He's just sitting
 in a cell someplace.

334
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,590
And because he's sitting
 there, my life has taken a turn

335
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,540
I didn't want it to take.

336
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,780
Nobody fools with me,
 this guys says, nobody.

337
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,240
So I say to Jimmy,
 Jimmy, what about this?

338
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,050
And he says, the guy comes
 from Boston, somewhere.

339
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,470
His name was, um--

340
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,370
Freaking Manny the Horse,
 he wants to whack this kid.

341
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,190
He wants to freaking
 break his head,

342
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,020
and he don't give a damn,
 if that's what you mean.

343
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,190
This guy is serious.

344
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,410
I mean, he means it.

345
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,740
I said, you know, he don't
 give $0.02 about his father,

346
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,590
whether he's a wise
 guy, a made guy.

347
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,190
He's gonna freaking teach
 this kid some respect.

348
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,680
Can you believe this stuff?

349
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,530
You know, Tommy, he's
 gonna freaking whack him.

350
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,410
So I say to Jimmy, Jimmy, this
 is somebody who means business.

351
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,600
And he says, don't
 worry about it.

352
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,280
I've got everything
 under control.

353
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,440
I said, he don't give a
 damn who his father is.

354
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,910
He knows this guy is
 a made guy, and he's

355
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,940
still gonna freaking whack him.

356

Ready?

357
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,130
Let me tell you,
 V. Let me tell you.

358
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,620
I grew up in this, uh,
 neighborhood, right here.

359
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,260
My old man, he was
 a bowling ball.

360
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,480
My brother was a
 freaking animal.

361
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,140
And me, I'm the skinny kid.

362
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,000
And my mother says, where
 did we get you from?

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,570
Petey, hold up a second.

364
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,150
I gotta ask you.

365
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,380
I mean, maybe you can help
 me with something here.

366
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,030
Where did we get you
 from, as if she don't know,

367
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,480
like I'm gonna be able
 to freaking tell her

368
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,370
where did she get me from.

369
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,870
Where the hell did she
 think she got me from?

370
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,480
-Petey.
 -So I eat.

371
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,680
I freaking eat, and I don't
 have no natural appetite,

372
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,440
let me tell you.

373
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,630
But I figure, hey, I'm not gonna
 be no pussy freaking willow,

374
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,730
you know?

375
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,850
And one day, I'm
 reading this comic,

376
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,230
'cause I love the
 freaking comics.

377
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,210
And there's this one.

378
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,840
It's called Metal Men, right?

379
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,530
Petey, Petey, hey,
 I gotta talk to you.

380
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm reading this
 thing, and on the back,

381
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,100
there's this Charles
 Atlas ad for turn yourself

382
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,320
into one of these muscle guys.

383
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,280
So I figure, hey, this is it.

384
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,800
You know, I turn myself into
 one of these big freaks.

385
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
No bully is ever gonna
 fool with me, right,

386
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,100
because I am sick of
 getting my head kicked

387
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,380
every time I go to school.

388
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,890
Yeah, so, uh, I figured
 I'd send away for it.

389
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,060
I end up with these muscles
 making back split out

390
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,050
like a freaking cobra's head.

391
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,980
Do you know what I'm saying?

392
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,040
Petey, please, I
 want to talk to you.

393
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,880
So I ask my brother, John.
 I ask him.

394
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,520
I say, hey, John, loan me
 $3.95 so I can send away

395
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,190
for this Charles Atlas stuff.

396
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,550
My brother says, that Charles
 Atlas stuff is for fags, Petey.

397
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,940
That's for big freaking uptown
 Johnny Marine type fags.

398
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,290
And he starts
 slapping me around,

399
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,230
and he throws me
 against the wall.

400
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,380
And I fall, like, between the
 wall and where the bed is.

401
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,540
This freaking gun drops out
 from under his mattress.

402
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,670
So I pick up the gun, and
 I say, this ends here,

403
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,530
just like that, because
 now I got the power

404
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,720
to say what I want to say.

405
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,510
My brother says, put
 down the gun, Petey.

406
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,340
And I say, what gun?
 This gun here?

407
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,980
I mean, just like that,
 acting cool and ice, you know?

408
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,040
And I said, first thing,
 Johnny, you're gonna

409
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,350
stop telling me what to do.

410
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,540
I said, because I'm sick of you
 always telling me what to do.

411
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,810
And he's beginning to back
 off a bit because he's

412
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,620
never seen me like this.

413
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,840
I mean, not in his own
 freaking room or anything.

414
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,330
And I can feel it, V.
 I was standing there.

415
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,900
I'm holding that thing,
 playing with Johnny's head.

416
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,340
And I aimed the thing right
 for his freaking forehead,

417
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,160
right between his eyes.

418
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,910
So what did you do?

419
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,680
Did you shoot him?
 -I don't know.

420
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,060
The gun jammed, or it
 wasn't loaded, or something.

421
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,970
It don't matter.

422

426

 sleeping these days.

 I sleep an hour, two hours,

431
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,060

I think God was sitting around,
 getting wasted with his angels.

472

It was getting late, so he
 said, it's time to go home.

Only he can't go home
 because wherever he is,

he's already there, right?

475
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,370
So he tells his angels to
 screw 'cause he's tired.

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,210
So he gets pissed.

477

 he invents right there

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,390
He's the original Moby
 Dick, this freaking guy.

521
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,570
[ARGUING]

522
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,310
Do you know how
 to freaking read?

523
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,220
Shut up.

524
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,090
Connie, no more
 playing around now.

525
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,420
If I say we split
 the baby in two,

526
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,500
we split the freaking
 baby in two, end of story.

527
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,940
This is our thing now,
 and sometimes it takes

528
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,140
a baby to make a mother scream.

529
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,070
He means, make a mother's
 mother scream maybe.

530
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,630
What was that?

531
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,240
What are you guys
 saying over there?

532
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,550
How you doing, Mr. Joseph?

533
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,550
Go sit down, Tommy.

534
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,190
Sometimes my consolior, he
 likes to argue history with me.

535
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,470
Do you like history, Tommy?

536
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,480
Yeah, well, I read
 some in school,

537
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,120
you know, Germans, World
 War II, that kind of stuff.

538
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,320
I'm talking about
 real history, Tommy,

539
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,380
like Roman history,
 your history.

540
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,640
I'm a little too young to
 have a history, Mr. Joseph.

541
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,740
What do you mean, too young?

542
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,190
There's your family's history,
 your father, his family.

543
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,780
You know, Tommy,
 I've known every boss

544
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,360
of every family in New
 York since Lucky Lou John.

545
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,460
I even knew Capone,
 and I can say-- yeah,

546
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,550
I can say he was a thug.

547
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,900
He died in Florida
 of syphilis, right?

548
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,580
He died of being a thug.

549
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,580
And some of these new
 boys are no better

550
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,420
because they forget what this
 thing, our thing, is all about.

551
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,320
Well, what's it
 about, Mr. Joseph?

552
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,820
Your father knew, Tommy.

553
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,970
My father's not dead.

554
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,940
Don't interrupt me.

555
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,410
I said, your father knew.

556
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,230
He knew about respect.

557
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:55,150
He know about silence,
 and he knew about loyalty.

558
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,520
Your father was a man, Tommy.

559
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,250
He still is.

560
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,960
And if scumbag Jackie Brancato
 dragged him into his big mess

561
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,060
and set your father
 up, those Brancatos

562
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,180
in New York, Connecticut, Rhode
 Island, Boston, all of them,

563
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,270
no freaking good.

564
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,890
I'm going to take
 care of this trouble

565
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,670
you had with Matty Brancato.

566
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,500
I know he's just a
 pick from Boston,

567
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,890
but I got business with him now.

568
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,670
So you let me take care of it.

569
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,560
You already know
 about that, huh?

570
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,110
I'm the boss of this
 family, Tommy of course,

571
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,680
I know about that.

572
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,710
Well, my father told me that--

573
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,090
Your father is in a
 cell in Marion, Tommy.

574
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,050
Were you wondering whether
 an old man with oxygen

575
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,480
can be the boss?

576
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,960
My father still
 alive, Mr. Joseph.

577
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,420
You know, Tommy,
 I was made three

578
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,450
bosses ago by Don Vito hisself.

579
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,530
And it's because I respect
 your father's memory--

580
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,650
because he is dead, Tommy.

581
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,890
He's never gonna leave Marion.
 You know it.

582
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,610
I know it.
 -You don't know that.

583
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,000
Nobody knows that.

584
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,030
But because I
 respect history more,

585
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,530
I called you here tonight.

586
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,080
Did you know the
 freaking FBI tried

587
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,010
to bug this freaking apartment?

588
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,110
You know, they try to
 bug everything else.

589
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,480
And did you know
 they almost did it

590
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,690
because some
 mother-freaking rat talked?

591
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,400
What rat?

592
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,230
I'm talking about V Dianni.

593
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,060
V Dianni?

594
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,350
Mr. Joseph, V Dianni
 is a stand-up guy.

595
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,670
There's no way he's a rat.

596
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,220
Is that right?

597
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,040
Then maybe you ask your
 father in his cell in Marion

598
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,640
if no way V Dianni is a rat.

599
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
You go ask him
 while he sits there

600
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,460
for the rest of
 his freaking life

601
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,120
because of V Dianni the rat.

602
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,790
Are you saying that V
 ratted out my old man?

603
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,010
I'm saying this.

604
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,840
I know a man, and he's a smart
 man, very smart, very clever,

605
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,480
not a thug.

606
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,460
In fact, he wants to learn about
 things like culture and art,

607
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,620
so every Friday night
 he visits a museum

608
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,790
and his Russian drunk dogs tell
 him about this useless crap.

609
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,550
Well, tonight I want you
 to visit this museum.

610
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,370
A guard named Kylie
 will let you in.

611
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,650
Once inside, you're
 gonna find this man.

612
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,810
And then what, Mr. Joseph?

613
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,320
Well, the museum is a
 very old building, Tommy,

614
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,560
and it's got a rat problem.

615
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,600
I want you to get rid
 of the rat problem.

616
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,660
Anything you say, Mr. Joseph.

617
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,040
And about this Matty Brancato--

618
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,870
Hey, hey, you forget about
 this Matty Brancato thing

619
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,440
because I got business with him.

620
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,860
You forget about that, OK?

621
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,350
And he looks like he's
 gonna have a heart attack.

622
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,950
So I said, hey,
 Zandy, take it easy.

623
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,060
Take it easy.

624
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,890
Do you want to die on me?

625
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,980
What are you gonna do?

626
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,380
He says, hey, Sammy,
 how old is this girl?

627
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,550
I says, what are
 you worried about?

628
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,820
She's in good shape.

629
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,240
She looks great, and she
 does all this exotic dancing,

630
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,760
those things, eh, you know.

631
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,340
And, you know, Zandy ways
 280 pounds, 300 pounds.

632
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,740
I mean, they gotta
 weigh him on the scale.

633
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,060
That's it, Eddie,
 back and forth-like.

634
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,220
You gotta get your
 breathing right.

635
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,040
I breathe beautifully
 when I don't

636
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,780
smoke my mind with this BS.

637
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,730
I don't know about it.

638
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,350
You've been smoking
 them cancer sticks.

639
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,280
You gotta figure, you know,
 that with that cough and all,

640
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,480
you got the big C
 or something, huh?

641
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,840
What are you, a
 general surgeon?

642
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,530
We're doing you a favor, there.

643
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,650
Uh, we don't want
 to see you, you

644
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,700
know, uh, fall over and, uh--

645
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,880
Yeah, well-- oh,
 look who we got

646
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,170
here, Vincent Dianni himself.

647
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,030
V, did you take care of that
 problem at Saint Alfonso's?

648
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,690
What problem is that, Eddie?

649
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,780
You know what
 freaking problem, V.

650
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,940
Yeah, I just got back.

651
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,570
I took care of it.

652
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,050
Is that scumbag,
 Ianello still breathing?

653
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,540
Hmm-mm.

654
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,250
Cold?

655
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,310
Stone cold.

656
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,420
You're the best,
 V. You are the best.

657
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,920
There's one other thing I
 need you to do for me, V.

658
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,780
I was supposed to
 give it to Benno, but,

659
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,150
uh, take a look at it.

660
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,820
I think I pigeon
 kicked him in the head.

661
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,530
Tommy Cucci, he pissed
 off this guy from Boston,

662
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,710
some guy, Matty the Horse.

663
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,180
He's some freaking idiot.

664
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,570
But Mr. Joseph is
 doing business with him

665
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,820
and wants him to
 go back to Boston

666
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,920
happy because he's doing
 something else with him.

667
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,070
Matty the Horse Brancato?

668
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,420
You know him?

669
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,460
No, I, uh, I just
 heard his name.

670
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,810
That's all.

671
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,080
Well, forget him.

672
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,520
He's a big mook, OK?

673
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,100
But Mr. Joseph, uh, wants
 to give him this money, OK?

674
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,170
He wants to smooth his
 feathers, all right?

675
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,920
You take care of that.

676
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,440
You save Tommy a lot
 of embarrassment,

677
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,970
and you save Mr. Joseph
 a pain in the neck.

678
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,090
But I don't know this guy.

679
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,610
Know this guy?

680
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,840
He's a guy, like any
 other freaking guy.

681
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,620
OK, but I told you, Mr. Joseph
 wants him to go back to Boston

682
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,450
happy.

683
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,650
Do you understand?

684
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,010
He don't want no
 freaking problems

685
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,120
with these Boston animals.

686
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,830
So it's all in here?

687
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,910
Take care of it, Mr.
 V. Take care of it.

688
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,370
You're the best.

689
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,830
You're the freaking best.

690
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,920
If Mr. Joseph says you're
 the best, you're the best.

691
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Come on, Eddie.

692
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,850
We figure you only did

00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:32,610
And if a rat bastard dies
 and winds up in hell,

1043
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,200
then those prayers ain't
 gonna do him much good either.

1044
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,970
The good souls in
 heaven don't need them,

1045
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,680
and the lost souls in
 hell can't use them.

1046
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,620
So who in Christ's name
 are they praying for?

1047
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,810
Just go up.

1048
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,510
Go ahead.

1049
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,640
She'll give you something.

1050
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,660
Go ahead.

1051
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,950
How you doing, guy?

1052
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,020
What did you bring tonight?

1053
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,850
Lots of stuff.

1054
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,300
-Are you all right?
 -Yes.

1055
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,180
Good, good, you
 take care, all right.

1056
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,150
All right?

1057
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,110
OK, hi, sweetheart.

1058
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:08,990
What you doing?

1059
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,450
Oh, I'm so glad you came back.

1060
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,910
Take care, all right.

1061
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,490
Oh, Barney, are
 you gonna wheel me?

1062
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:22,890
How long you been
 standing there?

1063
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,270
A while.

1064
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,990
You're not from the
 cardinal's office, are you?

1065
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,380
No, sir.

1066
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,050
That's good 'cause
 if they ever found out

1067
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,740
that I was letting these
 poor folk in the church,

1068
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,360
they'd take my parish away.

1069
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,490
It's funny, huh?

1070
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,820
Milton Berle was funny.

1071
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,990
You tell me, what's
 so funny about this?

1072
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,010
I meant, you know--

1073
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,070
What?

1074
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,710
Churches were supposed to
 be built for people instead

1075
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,510
of the other way around.

1076
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,660
Is that what you're
 trying to say?

1077
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,360
Yeah, I think it is.

1078
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,190
God bless you then.

1079
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,570
You're closer to heaven than
 most of the cardinals in Rome.

1080
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,140
I don't think so, Father.

1081
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,470
Oh, you don't, do you?

1082
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,390
I'm afraid I--

1083
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:05,410
Don't be afraid.

1084
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,890
You ever read the good book?

1085
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:12,010
You'll see the first thing that
 God says is, don't be afraid.

1086
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,800
No kidding?

1087
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,910
Nice, huh, not to be afraid?

1088
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,220
I don't know what
 to feel anymore.

1089
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,950
We all lose our way.

1090
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:25,370
It's because somebody somewhere
 must have hurt you badly.

1091
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,470
No, no, nobody ever hurt me.

1092
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,550
It's the other way
 around, Father.

1093
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:36,260
The tragedy is that we
 always try to help people,

1094
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,900
and we end up hurting them.

1095
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,510
It must remind us
 that we're all human.

1096
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,090
Those people inside, did you
 ever wonder how many of them

1097
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,810
volunteered to be homeless?

1098
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,940
Well, can't they
 work or something?

1099
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,320
Yeah, they could work
 in the physical sense,

1100
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,550
but what you're missing is that
 everything flows from here.

1101
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,320
And then it makes sense here.

1102
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,660
But once this is wounded,
 life gets confusing.

1103
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,900
So that's why you do what you
 do, huh, like healing people?

1104
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,710
I can't heal a thing.

1105
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,740
All I try to do is
 treat those people

1106
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,180
with a little bit of
 dignity so that maybe

1107
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,520
some day they'll let the God
 within them heal themselves.

1108
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,990
What do you mean,
 the God within them?

1109
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,240
Well, that might be a
 good thing for both of us

1110
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,840
to think about.

1111
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,620
Marilyn told me you're
 the guy who believes

1112
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,180
everybody goes to heaven.

1113
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,610
She's always scolding
 me about that one.

1114
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,550
She's a fierce judge.

1115
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,990
She is, nah, not really.

1116
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,910
So is that what you believe?

1117
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,890
About going to heaven?

1118
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,930
Absolutely, every
 last one of us.

1119
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,610
But what about--

1120
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,320
What about what-- Liars,
 thieves, child molesters,

1121
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,700
murderers?
 -Yeah, what about all of them?

1122
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,640
Make room then
 because someday you're

1123
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,290
gonna be breaking bread with all
 of them when we're all healed.

1124
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:20,700
But how-- I mean,
 what about, you know--

1125
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,200
The last judgment and all that?

1126
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,320
Yeah, yeah, what about going
 to hell and all of that?

1127
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,700
Well, frankly, don't tell
 anybody I told you this.

1128
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,890
But it's all a lot of malarkey.

1129
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,260
I mean, think about it.

1130
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,710
What does God gain, giving
 us the freedom to screw up

1131
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,040
if only to damn us when we do?

1132
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,490
I mean, what kind of God would
 that be, setting traps for us

1133
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:49,410
like he's playing a video game?

1134
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:50,980
Yeah, but murder?

1135
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,260
Life isn't a test.

1136
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,510
It isn't a game.

1137
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,470
It isn't a school.

1138
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,240
The fact is it's more like
 what everybody says it isn't.

1139
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,550
What's that?

1140
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:08,610
Life's a dress rehearsal,
 so don't worry so much.

1141
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:13,640
There's only one target,
 and he's too big to miss.

1142
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,340
Are you saying
 I can't miss him?

1143
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,770
No, you can't.

1144
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:21,160
Nobody can.

1145
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,340
You're saying, no
 matter what I've done?

1146
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,830
We're a lot
 tougher on ourselves

1147
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:29,310
than God ever thought of Peter.

1148
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:35,020
I can't-- I can't believe that.

1149
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,920
Vincent, would you
 take a walk with me?

1150
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,740
Vincent, I know who
 you are, and I can only

1151
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,770
guess what you might have done.

1152
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,460
I also know that you're
 troubled tonight,

1153
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,150
feeling guilty, depressed,
 looking for help,

1154
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,960
and not finding it.

1155
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,260
But it doesn't
 end here, Vincent.

1156
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,840
You can't help being what you
 are here, inside, where God

1157
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,870
is, forever, no matter what.

1158
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,120
Are you sure you don't
 want to see Marilyn?

1159
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,580
No, I've got a
 thing to do, Father.

1160
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,840
She loves you, Vincent.

1161
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,920
Come back again and
 see me sometime.

1162
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,310
I can learn a lot from you.

1163
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:52,530
From me?

1164
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,370
MAN: Hey, Tommy, what's
 she telling you there, huh?

1165
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,010
What, do you need a wife?

1166
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,630
Hey, Tommy, don't
 listen to them.

1167
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:06,400
They're pigs, swine,
 animals, like most men.

1168
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,540
Here.

1169
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,350
-What is it?
 -Well--

1170
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,470
Hey, Tommy, did
 your old man go away

1171
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,770
because he was embarrassed by
 your taste in girls, or what,

1172
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,440
huh?
 He goes away.

1173
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,850
He can't take it.

1174
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,780
Hey, Tommy, concentrate
 on the cards with me.

1175
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,750
I'll take care of them later.

1176
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,500
Look.

1177
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,890
Come here.

1178
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,070
What does it mean?

1179
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,760
Very soon, you're gonna
 have to make a choice.

1180
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,670
Choice, what do you mean?

1181
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,520
-Hey, up yours, I paid $10.
 -Come on.

1182
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,360
Tell me what you mean.

1183
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,510
Your father.

1184
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,610
Hey, hey, hey, Tommy,
 hey, Jimmy the Pope

1185
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,900
tells me that your
 old man goes away.

1186
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,380
He went away 'cause he knows
 you don't want to do this life.

1187
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,460
You ain't got the guts
 for this freaking life.

1188
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,910
[LAUGHTER]

1189
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:51,560
Your father has gone away, so
 now they tell lies about him.

1190
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,330
Don't listen.

1191
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,580
You put wax in your ears.

1192
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,540
You can't go into the
 darkness because if you do,

1193
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,120
you're not gonna come out.

1194
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,140
And that is your choice.

1195
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,340
-Hey, there's V over there.
 -That's V?

1196
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,730
Where's V?
 That's V?

1197
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,430
Yeah.

1198
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,550
Hey, V, you freaking loser,
 where's my freaking money,

1199
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,660
you freaking loser?

1200
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,980
And you, you freaking
 faggot, your mother's

1201
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,000
up at home sucking eggs.

1202
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,770
Hey, fool--

1203
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,230
[GUNSHOT]

1204
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,680
Get your hands off of me.

1205
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,470
Come on.

1206
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:25,190
Stay away from me,
 you red bastards.

1207
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,110
Stay away.
 -Where did he hit you?

1208
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,070
It's nothing.
 It's all right.

1209
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,950
I'll shoot all you
 freaking New Yorkers.

1210
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,790
Torro, go get Eddie Baggs.

1211
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,990
I don't know I'm
 gonna do with this.

1212
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,700
Come on.
 Come and get me.

1213
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,520
Come and get me.

1214
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,230
You're gonna want to
 get this stitched up.

1215
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,360
Vincent, it's all right.

1216
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,290
Come on.
 Come on.

1217
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,340
You come and get me.
 Come on.

1218
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,440
Put it away,
 while you still got

1219
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,500
a chance of leaving New York.

1220
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,720
I'll freaking blow you away.

1221
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,110
Calm down.
 Step back.

1222
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,640
Step the freak back.
 -Come and get me, yeah?

1223
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,580
You got a cigarette on you?

1224
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,090
What do you want
 a cigarette for?

1225
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,590
Right now, you gotta
 breathe nothing but air.

1226
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:54,120
What, are you,
 like, my old man now?

1227

[ARGUING]

1228
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,700
Easy, Tommy, I'm just trying
 to make sure you're OK here.

1229
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,740
Come on.
 Come on.

1230
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,810
You want a freaking piece of me?

1231
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,810
Hey, hey, you big loser.

1232
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,840
Keep your hand on that.

1233
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,620
Keep the pressure on.

1234
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,480
I'll be back in a minute.

1235
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,970
You big shot, look at you.

1236
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:07,670
Who the hell are you?

1237
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,820
Just put the freaking
 thing away, Horse.

1238
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,260
All I want to do is give
 you this money from Lamb

1239
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,460
so I can get the
 hell out of here.

1240
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,680
You got my freaking money?

1241
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,840
Of course, I've got
 your freaking money.

1242
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,480
I mean, Jesus, if you
 had waited a minute,

1243
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,260
I would have brought it over.
 But you went nu--

1244
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,250
I don't know, V. Mr.
 Joseph said we were to take

1245
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,520
care of this guy tonight.

1246
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,280
That's what I did.

1247
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,160
Well, what he's
 saying, V, is that, uh,

1248
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,630
nothing was supposed
 to happen to Matty

1249
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:46,600
the Horse while he's in town.

1250
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,010
Him and Mr. Joseph have got
 some things going on, you know?

1251
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:53,210
Jimmy, you little freaking
 weasel, who's that over there?

1252
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,840
Come on.
 What are you talking about?

1253
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,570
Over there, Tommy Cucci,
 do you remember that name?

1254
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,500
Yeah, I remember that name.

1255
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,990
Open your freaking eyes, V.
 It's time to move on, all right?

1256
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,420
His old man is as good as dead.

1257
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:10,230
20 years in that stinking
 cell, 20 freaking years,

1258
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,270
how many of us guys are
 still gonna be on this corner

1259
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,680
20 freaking years from now?

1260
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,910
Shame on you, Jimmy.

1261
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,300
You betray his old man.

1262
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,870
You betray him.

1263
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:20,690
You betray me.

1264
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,280
Freak you!

1265
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,520
Hey, now, V, don't go
 spitting at Jimmy there.

1266
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,060
Well, what is it, huh?

1267
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,210
Nothing matters no more?

1268
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,600
Sucker, you screw
 your brother, huh?

1269
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,430
You screw your mother, huh?

1270
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,230
You screw me.

1271
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:41,290
Screw me.

1272
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,600
Screw you.

1273
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,740
Screw all of you,
 lying bads, all of you.

1274
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,230
No, Benno, no, no.

1275
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,170
Take care of this later.

1276
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,520
Come on, Tommy.
 Come on.

1277
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,220
Get up.

1278
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,740
Taxi.

1279
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:18,780
You couldn't bring him
 to an emergency room?

1280
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,830
I told you.

1281
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,560
You know what this is.

1282
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,390
Oh, I know what this is.

1283
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,290
-What it's about, you know.
 -Mm-hmm.

1284
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,690
Look, I'm gonna
 pay you for this.

1285
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:32,100
If you do this, you
 don't have to drive

1286
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,600
a cab for a couple of weeks.

1287
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,180
Maybe two weeks' wages would
 be a proper wage if this

1288
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,630
were a question of money.

1289
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,020
What about friendship?

1290
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,130
But friendship is a
 far more complex matter.

1291
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,040
Let's keep it a
 question of money, huh?

1292
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,650
Here, drink as much of
 this as you can hold down.

1293
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:17,130
In my country, they took anyone
 who had skills with their hands

1294
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,460
and taught us how
 to stitch wounds.

1295
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,040
My friend was a butcher.

1296
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,930
So one winter, they
 made him a surgeon.

1297
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:25,720
He did amputations.

1298
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:34,600
By the end of one year,
 it had driven him mad.

1299
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,600
You see, we had no anesthesia.

1300
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,360
The screaming, the misery,
 it was too much for him.

1301
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,900
One night, he left the
 camp to smoke a cigarette.

1302
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,600
A storm came up,
 and he disappeared.

1303
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,090
Later that spring, we found him.

1304
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,430
I was more fortunate.

1305
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,400
I had a mind for
 numbers and languages.

1306
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,370
My hands were never that good.

1307
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,160
Jesus, don't tell him that.

1308
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,010
Aw, this is nothing.

1309
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:13,870
I can use this flap of
 skin here to close it.

1310
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:17,270
In the '60s, when I
 moved to New York,

1311
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:22,270
there was a woman,
 Madam Kattia Bulgratsky.

1312
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:25,370
She helped young women
 who got pregnant.

1313
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:29,190
For a price, she would
 take care of their problem.

1314
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,810
In the '60s, huh?

1315
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,550
On Fourth Street, I had
 just arrived and lived

1316
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:36,440
downstairs with two others.

1317
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,520
We were crowded into one room.

1318
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,960
But Madam Kattia, she asked me
 if I would like to help her.

1319
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,580
She said she would pay
 me, and I was hungry.

1320
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,920
A young girl came to see
 Madam Kattia one night.

1321
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:04,480
She was Irish, auburn hair,
 fair skin, delicate features.

1322
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,950
This girl was very beautiful.

1323
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,840
So I stood there,
 staring at her,

1324
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,690
while Madam Kattia asked her
 to lie down on the table.

1325
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:22,100
Then Madam raised her
 skirt up over her knees

1326
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:22,800
and up her thighs.

1327
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,220
I had never seen such softness.

1328
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:35,090
Then the girl-- she couldn't
 have been more than 17--

1329
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:37,900
she started to cry.

1330
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:42,060
I know I'll burn in
 hell for this, she said.

1331
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,880
Then madam took her kerchief
 and passed it over a small vial

1332
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:50,160
of ether and put her to sleep.

1333
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:55,830
I watched as the sadness
 drained from her face,

1334
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:59,540
and I wondered what
 God could punish

1335
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,520
such an infinitely
 suffering creature.

1336
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:09,760
And then madam began the
 procedure, all the time trying

1337
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,290
to teach me what she was doing.

1338
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:17,480
And as long as I didn't look at
 the girl's face or the stains

1339
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,300
where her tears had
 dried, I could separate

1340
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,950
what was being done
 to her from her,

1341
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:27,670
as if it wasn't being
 done to her at all.

1342
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:32,970
Later that night, I sat at
 a small table in my room

1343
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,740
and tried to drink
 myself senseless.

1344
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,990
That's when life
 became a thing for me,

1345
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:46,250
something over which no man
 has jurisdiction, since no man

1346
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:50,360
can replace it once it's gone.

1347
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:59,330
And so I cried for the girl, for
 the child that she had carried,

1348
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:03,700
and like in my country,
 for all the children who

1349
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,930
starve to death,
 and all the soldiers

1350
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:16,960
who froze to death, for all
 of them, maybe even for you.

1351
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,330
You got a place
 to stay, to sleep?

1352
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:35,270
Yeah, I got a place.

1353
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,450
Nobody knows where it is.

1354
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,640
Nobody knows where it is?

1355
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,240
I miss my father.

1356
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,670
Yeah, you'd better go there.

1357
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:46,340
You think?

1358
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,540
Yeah, you need some sleep.

1359
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,710
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1360
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,110
Well, what about you?

1361
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:54,900
I got a place to stay, too.

1362
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,580
Hey, V, where are you gonna be?

1363
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,390
I mean, in case I
 need to talk to you.

1364
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,310
I'll call you, Tommy.

1365
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,100
We'll talk.

1366
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,220
Tomorrow?

1367
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah, Tommy, tomorrow.

1368
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:21,430
Take care of him
 for me, all right?

1369
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,440
Hey, V, listen.

1370
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,540
I really appreciate
 what you've done.

1371
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,590
I mean, other than
 my old man, I ain't

1372
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:31,930
never had a real friend before.

1373

[MUSIC PLAYING]

1374
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,660
VINCENT (VOICEOVER):
 Looking back,

1375
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:45,460
I could make a fair list
 of things I've never done.

1376
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,250
I never went to a school dance.

1377
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,310
I never bought a house.

1378
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,580
I never learned to drive.

1379
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,940
I never fell in love.

1380
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,980
Maybe if I'd gone to
 that school dance,

1381
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,980
all the other stuff would
 have fallen into place.

1382
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,240
How do things end
 up the way they do?

1383
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,190
The point is, they
 don't just end up.

1384
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:20,620
They start someplace,
 like maybe when you're

1385
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,600
a kid and somebody
 dies too soon,

1386
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,510
or somebody goes away forever.

1387
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:14,110
Tommy's father, the time
 we had from the beginning,

1388
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,640
hanging around the neighborhood,
 telling me how good looking I

1389
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,880
was.
 Hollywood, he called me.

1390
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,510
Jimmy the Pope wasn't
 even a thought then.

1391
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:26,570
Eddie Baggs with his cigarettes,
 trying to get me to smoke,

1392
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,550
but I wouldn't do it.

1393
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,450
Baggs, every day I
 gotta make sure I

1394
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:37,430
stay alive, so why do I want
 to kill myself with that stuff?

1395
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,810
But it's different
 when you're a kid.

1396
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:56,130
You think you're immortal,
 so you swagger, big swagger,

1397
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:58,660
like to convince yourself
 you're not afraid,

1398
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,270
afraid the sky is gonna
 fall, afraid the bottom

1399
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,370
is gonna drop out.

1400
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:15,400
The old man in his 40s comes
 down with that lung virus,

1401
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,180
coughed so hard he'd pass
 out, coughing up blood,

1402
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,080
coughing up his heart.

[COUGHING]

1404
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:01,840
My mother sent me to a junior
 office, so I go, scared.

1405
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:07,590
And trying not to be scared,
 I knock, and I go in.

1406
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:10,240
That bastard dullard
 sitting there,

1407
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,860
he must have weighed 300 pounds.

1408
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:14,570
He says-- after I tell
 him three times-- he says,

1409
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,980
so what's your old
 man's name, kid?

1410
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,620
Vincent Parmagano Dianni.

1411
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,900
VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I say,
 adding the middle name,

1412
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,290
thinking-- I don't know.

1413
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,460
Maybe it's gonna
 help or something.

1414
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,240
Dianni, huh?

1415
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,810
I don't know nobody
 named, uh, Dianni.

1416
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,570
You say your old man is A Mason?

1417
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,820
Yes, sir, he carved
 some of the saints

1418
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,380
on the cathedral in the Bronx.

1419
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,870
Hmm.

1420
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:47,910
VINCENT (VOICEOVER): But he was
 enjoying this, playing with me.

1421
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,320
Well, I'm looking at
 the role here, kid,

1422
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,540
and I gotta tell you.

1423
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,010
I don't see any
 Parmagano Dianni here.

1424
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:56,440
And I say, so what
 does that mean?

1425
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,990
What it means is
 maybe you should check

1426
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,660
to see what your old
 man does all day,

1427
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:03,490
'cause I don't have his
 Italian name on my roster here.

1428
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:04,480
He works all day.

1429
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,090
He comes home with
 dust all over him.

1430
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:09,580
Kid, when you're fooling around
 where you don't belong, what

1431
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,290
do you think it takes
 to blow a pound of dust

1432
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,190
all over yourself?

1433
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,910
Gee.

1434
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,240
VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I
 started to leave his office.

1435
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,030
My face burned.

1436
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:22,200
He called me back, telling
 me to wait a minute.

1437
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,130
He said, now I'm not saying we
 couldn't make room in the rolls

1438
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:28,250
for one more Italian stone guy.

1439
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,670
That is, of course,
 if you've got the cash

1440
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:33,160
ready to pay the dues, that is.

1441
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,230
And this is what everybody
 was afraid of, afraid

1442
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,020
of some bastard who'd come along
 and snap your lifeline just

1443
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:43,010
like that, just
 like killing a bug,

1444
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:46,780
all because people with names
 like Vincent Parmagano Dianni

1445
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,450
didn't get here first.

1446
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,090
I went home, and
 on the way home I

1447
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:55,200
passed the boys on the corner,
 sitting outside Samia's.

1448
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,690
They all had radios
 to their ears,

1449
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:57,590
listening to the ball game.

1450
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,500
Tommy's father came
 over to me and said,

1451
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,690
if your dad needs any help
 with this thing, let me know.

1452
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:14,690
That night, I go home,
 and the old man is worse.

1453
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,580
My mother is losing it.

01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,330
Somebody help us, please!

01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:23,260
Don't let him die.

Somebody help us.

1457
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,580
VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Nobody
 listened to her anymore

1458
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,030
because everybody
 in the neighborhood

1459
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,460
knew she'd gone a little crazy.

[SOBBING]

1461
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:37,110
So I'd run to my father's
 room, and I'd sit by his bed,

1462
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,530
holding this bowl
 ot catch his life

1463
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,140
as it came out of him,
 like it had to break

1464
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,610
away from what was left of him.

1465
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,270
And his eyes swam across his
 vision, looking but not seeing,

1466
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:50,360
until he coughed.

1467
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,880
Then the dust he'd
 inhaled for 25 years

1468
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,480
called him away, with
 a sound like a cry

1469
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,380
to be forgiven for having
 died so pathetic-like.

1470
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:06,840
Then he coughed once again,
 this time, the last time,

1471
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,420
without a sound, and fell back.

1472
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:14,070
I took his hand and
 fingers, thick in heart.

1473
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,860
I laid them across his
 chest and brushed back

1474
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:20,080
the strands of hair lying
 across his forehead.

1475
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:29,050
After the funeral,
 after the seagulls,

1476
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,980
which had come from
 nowhere and had flown

1477
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:35,180
over the brown casket,
 over my mother's crying,

1478
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,800
over the headstone and
 the tombs, over the saints

 returned to Sabia's and bought

01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,010
Well, if it ain't the
 little Italian boy,

 his old man's job.

 I got to do with his life?

 be here tomorrow, Mr. Dolon.

I'm gonna be here as long
 as I want to be here.

1498
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:35,740
And I stood there,
 and I said, what's

1499
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,600
my father's name, Mr. Dolon?

1500
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,960
What's my father's name?

01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,860

 couldn't answer because I was

aiming a gun at his forehead.

1503
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:50,410
And that was the sound
 of silence he made.

And I swear to God,
 for the life of me,

1505
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:58,870

 of somebody coughing.

 were better than all of 'em.

You showed me so much kindness.

1508
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,590
I remember that night
 when the music was playing

1509
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,160
and the lights were on.

1510
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,890
There was that storm
 off the Hudson.

1511
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,220
When I think about
 that, I just offer

1512
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:19,530
thanks for you and for life,
 and I want to hold you.

1513
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:22,450
I was so young that night.

1514
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:26,340
And then afterwards, we
 reached out our hands,

1515
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,790
and our shadows spread
 across the ceiling.

1516
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:31,610
But they never touched.

1517
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:34,810
Are you still too
 frightened to sleep?

1518
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:38,460
Maybe you're not too
 frightened anymore, huh?

1519
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:42,660
I said, Mother, do
 not disturb the sailor

01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,150
sleeping in the rented room.

1521
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:46,310
You'd never been a sailor.

1522
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:51,750
But I guess I said it more
 like a description maybe

1523
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,350
'cause you just always
 seemed like a guy

1524
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:57,880
from a far-off place.

1525

But that night, you
 took me in your arms,

1526
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,370
and you broke my
 soul with your touch.

1527
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,840
And I said, Mother,
 do not disturb

1528
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,320
the sailor sleeping
 in the rented room

1529
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,250
because he is tired.

1530
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,010
And now it's over, Vincent.

1531
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:21,220
It's over until forever
 or tonight, when

1532
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,560
you come back to me in spirit.

Only then will I eat
 again in silence,
