00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,233
[distorted lullaby plays]

2
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,135
[people arguing]

3
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:34,538
female narrator:
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

4
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:38,442
They also say that beauty
comes from within.

5
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,412
When I was a little girl,
I used to turn on the television loud

6
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,814
to block out the noise around me.

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,583
We didn't have cable, but...

8
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:49,382
the sound of static
was better than the screaming.

9
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,757
It all started with me being raised
by my single mother.

10
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,459
She always thought of herself

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,462
as this beautiful,
Haitian queen.

12
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,465
[speaking Haitian Creole:]

13
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,766
MAN:
I'm not gonna do this shit with you.

14
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,502
WOMAN:
What're you gonna do, huh?

15
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,770
You ain't nothin'
but a bitch of a man!

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,001
[screaming]

17
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,744
- I'm not afraid of you!
- You want to fight me like a man?

18
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,214
I'll treat your motherfuckin' ass
like I want.

19
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,381
[grunting]

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,646
Don't move!

21
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,387
Bitch, you lucky
I didn't break

22
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,323
your motherfucking jaw.

23
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,654
Stupid bitch.

24
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:31,191
Fuck you.

25
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,636
I'm sorry, baby.

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,440
Your mother is
a beautiful woman

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,309
but I hope to God
you don't grow up

28
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,510
to be like her.

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,809
You motherfucker!

30
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:01,454
female narrator: I guess when beauty
doesn't come from within...

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,429
...you can call that...

32
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,166
[sobbing]

33
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,202
...chaos.

34
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,900
[sobbing continues]

35
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,422
[crying]

36
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,757
My name is Grace

37
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,561
and this is my beautiful life.

38
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,527
[police siren wailing]

39
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,840
The problem is I never thought
I was beautiful,

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,344
nor did I ever
feel beautiful inside.

41
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,846
I used to ask God, "why did he
have to make me a girl

42
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,517
"to even have to care
about beauty?"

43
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,652
Now I just ask God,

44
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,184
"why should I care
about anything at all?"

45
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,228
[exhales]

46
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,448
Best friends forever! Dink!

47
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,980
[soft piano music]

48
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:17,290
[pounding on door]

49
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,389
You ready?

50
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,657
[chuckles]

51
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,626
You and that damn mouse.

52
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,691
That thing needs
to hurry up and die.

53
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,667
I know, I shouldn't
be talking about

54
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,799
your little friend like that.

55
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,405
Is that how
you're going to school?

56
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,681
Aren't you excited
about your first day

57
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,381
of your senior year?
[chuckles]

58
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,391
You need to move on
with your life, Grace.

59
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:24,591
We come into
this world alone...

60
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,695
and we leave alone.

61
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,536
Girl, do you hear me
talking to you?

62
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,671
Yes, I hear you.

63
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,673
Good.

64
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:39,539
I'm working late tonight.

65
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,642
And then I got a date,

66
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,484
so dinner's on you.

67
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,449
Bye.

68
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,558
[slow string music]

69
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,429
I was always told my name,
Grace, meant something.

70
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,031
That eventually my name
would remind me of who I am

71
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:05,865
and what I would need in order
to survive in this world.

72
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:13,440
But I never imagined
my senior year to be like this.

73
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:24,050
Alone.

74
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,956
[indistinct chatter]

75
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,437
[over radio]:
I go where I want to

76
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,805
Oh, oh

77
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,775
When I'm with you

78
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,811
I smile and I know

79
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,681
It'll be okay

80
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,617
'Cause I can fly away

81
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,554
Oh, oh, oh

82
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,456
Oh, oh, oh

83
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,654
Oh, oh, oh...

84
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,516
In this beautiful life,
I'm starting to think

85
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,818
that people take themselves
too serious.

86
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,921
It's like all they care about
is who they hang out with,

87
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,724
how they look
or who has the latest iPhone

88
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,793
or newest pair of Jordans.

89
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,661
It's all about...

90
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,129
being...

91
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,230
cool.

92
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,765
But inside...

93
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,835
- [blows whistle]
- I bet they feel like shit.

94
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,169
If people were to walk around

95
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,840
the way they actually
felt inside?

96
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,642
I'll bet we'd all just be

97
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,877
a bunch of dead zombies
walking this earth.

98
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,746
Welcome back, students!

99
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,881
Hopefully, everyone had
an amazing summer

100
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,617
spending time
with loved ones.

101
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,685
I want you all to think
seriously about college.

102
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,588
College education is the
surest way to a better life.

103
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,057
On a more serious note,
I'm sure that you're aware

104
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,793
that we experienced tragedy
over the summer

105
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,161
with one of our students.

106
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,897
May I remind you
that we have

107
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,999
a "zero tolerance
for bullying" policy.

108
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,069
Everyone, please respect
and support one another.

109
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,571
We're here to help.

110
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,706
Here's to an amazing first day

111
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,842
and a stellar coming year.

112
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,807
Go, Admirals!

113
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,868
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're seniors now?

114
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,137
This is so exciting!
I am so excited for prom.

115
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,040
Remember when we were ninth graders,
and they used to call us scrubs...

116
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,976
Grace:
Regardless of what

117
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,912
other people's opinions
are of others,

118
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,615
I could say I got to witness

119
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:08,686
what real beauty looks like
from the inside and out.

120
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,117
[indistinct speaking]

121
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,690
[sighs] I just wish
she would have known.

122
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,664
Welcome, seniors.

123
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,962
My name...

124
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,905
is Mr. Walsh.

125
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:31,308
I am your Honors English
teacher this year.

126
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:35,212
Before any of you determine
whether or not you like me

127
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,749
or anyone else in this class,
let's take a moment

128
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,981
to properly introduce
ourselves, shall we?

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,218
[scattered chatter]

130
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,857
Starting with you.

131
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,640
MAN:
Ms. Weathers?

132
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,050
Let's see here,
you and your daughter...

133
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,315
Ms. Weathers.

134
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,886
Did you understand that,
Ms. Weathers?

135
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,658
Yup. Makes sense.

136
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,865
I bet.

137
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,967
You know, I just, uh...

138
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,802
I just need a little help,
that's all.

139
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,370
[Lisa chuckles softly]

140
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,837
If I have to call Obama
myself... [laughs]

141
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,110
Tell you what.

142
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,780
Why don't you come back
next week like we discussed,

143
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,981
bring all the paperwork,

144
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,914
and, uh, we'll see
what we can work out.

145
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,884
Sounds real good.

146
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,763
You mind if I ask you
a question?

147
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,094
Uh, sure, go ahead.

148
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,034
How old are you?

149
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,403
[both laugh]

150
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,268
Old enough.

151
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,773
That's all that matters.

152
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,353
Take care.

153
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,791
Please allow me to introduce you
to Mr. Matthew Clifton,

154
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,259
our teacher's aide.

155
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,159
Now, please fill out
the information sheets.

156
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:38,201
And remember,
this is a very important year.

157
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,138
So please work hard.

158
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,472
I'm gonna need
your cooperation

159
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,842
and, of course,
the support of your parents.

160
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,377
So don't even think
about putting

161
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,213
any fake information down
for your parents.

162
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,750
I will find them.

163
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,785
Okay?

164
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,987
When you're completed
with the forms,

165
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,019
please pass them
up to the front.

166
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,762
Excuse me.

167
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,096
Hey, Grace!

168
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,132
What's up?
How are you?

169
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,998
How you doing?

170
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,472
What are you doing here?

171
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:19,076
Uh, yeah, I know
I look like a loser, huh?

172
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,343
No, um...

173
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,045
I didn't have enough money

174
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,113
to go to Emerson this year.

175
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,481
So I decided to stay here,

176
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,149
you know,
work at the school,

177
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,284
make some extra funds,
and, you know.

178
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,953
And, uh, save up
for next year.

179
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,919
You look good.

180
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,794
It was a long summer, huh?

181
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,936
One, two, three...

182
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,170
[blows raspberry]

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,339
[laughing]

184
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,008
I almost sharted on myself.

185
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:54,111
- Matt, stop. That's disgusting.
- [laughs]

186
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,213
Whatever, girl, you know you're
gonna miss me when I'm gone.

187
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,215
You gonna miss me
when I'm gone, too.

188
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,017
- No, we're not.
- [laughs]

189
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,285
That's a lie, actually.
I'm gonna miss those rides

190
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,021
home from school,
but that's about it.

191
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,123
Yeah well, as long
as you takin' care

192
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,827
of our little Gracie,
here, you're good.

193
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,424
Grace needs
to take care of me.

194
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,365
What do you mean by that?

195
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,366
[laughs]

196
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:20,166
You guys are stupid.

197
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,872
How you holding up?

198
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,349
It was good seeing you, Grace.

199
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,576
[no audible dialogue]

200
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,566
All right, Jason,
since you're a senior

201
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,235
and a transfer student,
I want to make sure you go

202
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,603
to the counseling center.

203
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,006
And over here
is the auditorium,

204
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,540
and then over there
is the cafeteria.

205
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,639
Mr. Walsh!

206
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,214
Let me talk to you.

207
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,583
- Yo. Who's that cutie?
- Man, that's Grace.

208
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,153
She won't be cheering
for us, boy.

209
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,287
What you mean?

210
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,419
She on the other team.

211
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,624
Other team?

212
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,640
That new boy
in school, Jason?

213
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,006
Super hot.

214
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,615
I love that song.

215
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,184
We used to sing that song
all the time.

216
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,319
[humming]

217
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,221
That was like old times.

218
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,024
Y'all used to skip lunch.

219
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,492
[both laugh]

220
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,261
Yeah.

221
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,230
That was like old times.

222
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,000
Thanks for the ride.

223
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,668
Yeah. Of course.

224
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,568
Yeah, you know,
Andrea would want it like that.

225
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,246
Matt, it'll never
be like old times.

226
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,381
Why would you say
that, Grace?

227
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,715
It's like, all summer
you ignore me.

228
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,285
And now, you know,
I come back

229
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,087
and you're cold to me
for no reason.

230
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,489
- Like, why are you--
- Matt. Matt. Just stop.

231
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,154
Please.

232
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,529
I'll talk to you later, Matt.

233
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,642
GRACE:
It's true.

234
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,477
People like to forget
the past

235
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,247
that has affected them
the most.

236
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,546
But I could never forget.

237
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,755
[laughs] It's okay, girl.
I know I'm beautiful.

238
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,225
Jesus told me so,
because that's my homeboy.

239
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,293
Holla. Okay?
[laughs]

240
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,794
But your mom? Oh, my gosh.

241
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,364
She's, like, the black version
of Marilyn Monroe,

242
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,296
and that's true beauty.

243
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,567
You ever wish you could look
like her when you grow older?

244
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,787
[sighs]

245
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,058
Okay.

246
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,666
[groans]

247
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,439
Here's your coffee.

248
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,275
You've got your cups
right there.

249
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,506
Hey. I'll be right with you.

250
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,483
Grace,
what are you doing here?

251
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,780
I told you I was working late.

252
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,394
Shit.

253
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,728
I asked them
for an extension.

254
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:43,095
- Damn it.
- I'm hungry.

255
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,469
Just go over there
and sit down.

256
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,635
I'll get you something
to eat. God.

257
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,611
Fuck you! Douche bag!

258
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,411
I know who you are.

259
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,614
It's Grace, right?

260
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,518
You were my sister's
best friend.

261
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,888
How'd you know?

262
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,794
She sent me
a bunch of letters

263
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,497
with pictures
of you guys in 'em.

264
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,797
She said you were
her "new sister."

265
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,202
How come you weren't
at the funeral?

266
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,542
I mean, if I had
a best friend that died,

267
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,475
I'd be at her funeral.

268
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,516
I'm sorry,
did I just

269
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,784
invite myself
to your dinner?

270
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,750
Oh, it's-- It's fine.

271
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,754
That was really sweet of you.

272
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,792
My grandmother said
you're a really sweet girl.

273
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,331
How's she doing?

274
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,373
Well, she stopped talking.

275
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,738
She's getting more ill.

276
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,979
But that's why I'm down here
to take care of her.

277
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,946
You know? It's the least
I could do.

278
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,186
I see you made a friend.

279
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,537
- Share, this is Lisa.
- She means her mother.

280
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,506
Oh, nice
to meet you, ma'am.

281
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,543
Nice to meet you, too,
but please call me Miss Lisa.

282
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,745
Miss Lisa.

283
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,849
I'm, um,
Andrea's big sister.

284
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,947
Andrea?

285
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:22,883
Rest her soul,
she was a lovely young lady.

286
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,662
Yeah, she was.

287
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,997
Grace, I'm getting off.

288
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,596
I'll meet you outside
in 15 minutes.

289
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,475
So we should probably
exchange numbers

290
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,377
and hang out, you know?

291
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,009
Just get to know each other.

292
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,688
- Butch, I need some help.
- What's up, baby?

293
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,556
I'm a little strapped
for cash.

294
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,924
What can you do for me?

295
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,059
Oh, what do you mean?
What kind of cash?

296
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,861
- [giggles]
- How much you need?

297
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,764
I need just a couple hundred.
Can you help a girl out?

298
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,933
"Just a couple of hundred."

299
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,736
You know I'm good for it.

300
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,672
- Come on.
- [laughs]

301
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,609
- Please?
- All right, baby doll.

302
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,945
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Butch.

303
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,080
- Take the whole thing.
- Really?

304
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,314
- Well, yeah.
- [laughs] Thank you.

305
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,931
All right.
I'm gonna make sure

306
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,764
that the lights are turned on
by the morning.

307
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,569
Girl, you can tough it out
for one ni-- Are you?

308
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,377
Don't be rolling
your eyes at me.

309
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,711
And you know,
if I don't come home,

310
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:52,678
that means Chad and I
had a good time!

311
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,016
[whistling]

312
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,691
I miss you, Lisa.

313
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,528
Is that right?

314
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,469
Damn.

315
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,666
You're so beautiful.

316
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,873
Let's get a hotel tonight.

317
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,384
Now, Chad, you know

318
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,152
I ain't no hooker.

319
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,054
Nor am I cheap.

320
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,623
[chuckles]

321
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,025
You know I love you, girl.

322
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,960
If you think
all these compliments

323
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,663
is gonna get you some ass,

324
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,629
you better open your wallet.

325
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,536
I mean, I'm just glad
you decided

326
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,904
to come see me tonight.

327
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,672
Well, any woman
who would pass up

328
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:54,840
on a seafood dinner
is a dummy.

329
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:04,550
Lisa.

330
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,819
Let's get back together.

331
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,693
Chad, you know that
ain't gonna happen.

332
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,894
Why not?

333
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,163
Because you ain't ready
for a relationship.

334
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,765
Yes, I am.

335
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:19,465
Chad, please.

336
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,504
You know I love you.

337
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,708
And the sex...

338
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:39,518
The sex is real good.

339
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,926
[phone ringing]

340
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,862
But I can't keep going
back and forth

341
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,764
with you and your bullshit.

342
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,567
- Bullshit?
- Yeah. Bullshit.

343
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,034
[phone continues ringing]

344
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,037
Why don't you answer it?

345
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,839
Because it's not important.

346
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:01,106
Tell your wife I said hi.
How are the kids?

347
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,713
I am in the process
of getting a divorce--

348
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,047
I'm not buying that.

349
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,883
- Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

350
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,551
- It's my damn mouth.
- We're trying to eat here.

351
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,786
Then you eat, bitch!

352
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,485
- Lisa, stop.
- Fuck you!

353
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:33,605
Grace?

354
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:38,109
Gra-- Grace?

355
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,884
What?

356
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,050
I can't sleep.

357
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:55,131
Don't ever trust a man.

358
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,796
Ever.

359
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:03,068
Your father was the first man
that taught me that.

360
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:16,548
[school bell rings]

361
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,598
I want you all to write
a poem about yourselves.

362
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,300
Everything about yourself
that's important,

363
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,835
write it down.

364
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,303
What if there's
nothing important?

365
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,306
Then write down what
"nothing important" feels like.

366
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,843
Listen, guys.
It's not that complicated.

367
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,245
It's just a poem.

368
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,111
- Okay?
- [school bell rings]

369
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:59,591
Grace, can I speak
to you?

370
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,937
So, I hear you're smart.

371
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,608
[scoffs]
Smart?

372
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,977
How do you figure that?

373
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,943
I have connections.

374
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,717
When you filled out
the information sheets,

375
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,251
you were the only one
who didn't fill out

376
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,987
information about
their parents.

377
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:28,691
That kind of stood out, so...

378
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,856
I did my own research.

379
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,930
Is that legal?

380
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,232
When it pertains
to your education, it is.

381
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:41,037
I see you got
a 1539 SAT score.

382
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,936
And I also hear
you want to be a writer.

383
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,077
That's pretty impressive.

384
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,047
What colleges
have you applied to?

385
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:55,213
Actually,
I'm not going to college.

386
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,751
And why is that?

387
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,894
So we have to go
to the same college.

388
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,428
Yes, we have to.

389
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,064
You're smarter than me,
so hopefully

390
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,431
we get into
the same college.

391
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,734
Don't say that.

392
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,770
Or if we don't get
into the same school,

393
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,439
we can stay behind
and be strippers.

394
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,975
[both laugh]

395
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:19,809
Imagine that.

396
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,178
Or we could just
live with my sister.

397
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,813
She would love that.

398
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:28,847
Either way, we're gonna
be together forever.

399
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:47,733
How about I've already
made my decision?

400
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,372
So, Grace?

401
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,909
You're really planning on not
going to college anymore?

402
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,877
I mean, that doesn't make
any sense.

403
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,879
Well, you're not.

404
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,315
Grace? Listen.

405
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,818
I'm really sorry
about your friend Andrea.

406
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,152
It must be really hard
for you not to have

407
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,087
your best friend
around anymore.

408
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:08,991
You guys were... really
connected at the hip.

409
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,093
- Aw!
- Mary, knock it off.

410
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:14,831
Matt? Get a life.

411
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,866
You're not even
supposed to be here.

412
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,234
Or in this conversation.

413
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,402
Yeah, dude.
Get your shit together.

414
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,105
Aren't you supposed
to be in college or something?

415
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,108
- Yeah, don't worry about me.
- I'm afraid I am.

416
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,944
Seems like someone here
is obsessed

417
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,408
with our little Miss Grace.

418
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,112
Like I was saying...

419
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,319
I know you think
I had something to do with it.

420
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,356
- But I didn't.
- Well, if you didn't

421
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,721
then why did you even
have to say that?

422
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,529
Because I know you think
I had something to do with it.

423
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,229
And she had nothing
to do with it.

424
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,270
Preach.

425
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,872
It's okay, Grace.

426
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,274
You'll find yourself
another girlfriend.

427
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:02,908
There are plenty of lesbians
at our school.

428
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,852
She's such a bitch.

429
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,427
Hey, Granny.

430
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,296
[wheezes]

431
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,940
Okay.

432
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,309
Let's see.

433
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,476
GRACE:
This beautiful life I live.

434
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:11,447
This beautiful life I live
with tears I cry from inside

435
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,546
and the misery
of my only reproducing pain.

436
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,332
Let me call you back.

437
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,077
Can I help you?

438
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,244
Hi, Miss Lisa.

439
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,181
I, uh--, I was coming
to pick up Grace

440
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,916
to hang out
for the night.

441
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,250
- On a school night?
- Well, not--

442
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,919
I wasn't gonna
keep her out late.

443
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,187
I just...

444
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,122
I've been really lonely,

445
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:58,456
- and so I was hoping--
- Grace.

446
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,960
Grace!

447
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,278
You two have fun.

448
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,015
- Okay.
- And be safe.

449
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,183
- Yes.
- Bye, Lisa.

450
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:25,016
- Sharon?
- Oh, it's Share.

451
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,156
You ain't no lesbian,
are you?

452
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:31,127
Oh, no. No.
I'm-- I'm far from that.

453
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,429
Good, 'cause Grace here

454
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:37,595
needs to meet some boys
and have some fun.

455
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,706
If you know what I mean.

456
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,939
Yeah.

457
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,411
Bye.

458
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,577
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

459
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,514
Oh. Keys.

460
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,121
[engine starts]

461
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:09,027
Yo, your mom was hilarious.

462
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,369
What language was that
she was speaking?

463
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,437
Uh, she's Haitian.

464
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,274
Oh, y'all Haitian?

465
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,143
- Yeah.
- Wow.

466
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,442
Wow, that's crazy.

467
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,680
How come you didn't call
your mom "Mom"?

468
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,754
'Cause-- I don't know.

469
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,721
She never really felt
like a mom.

470
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,428
Thank you
for hanging out with me.

471
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,597
I know it's kind of random,
me calling you.

472
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,266
But you know,
I really did need

473
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,235
someone to hang out with.

474
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,267
It-- It's okay.

475
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,372
Okay, so, let's get out
of the car.

476
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,691
Why'd you park
right over there?

477
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,360
I-- I don't want them
to see the car.

478
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,163
They have, like,
cameras and shit.

479
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,128
[indistinct chatter]

480
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,769
So I'm just hoping
that he's not lying,

481
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,771
'cause if he's lying,
I'm gonna be really pissed off.

482
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,340
It's not like
I can be mad if he's lying

483
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,607
because we're not
"together together,"

484
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,377
- But still--
- [phone ringing]

485
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,711
- Hello?
- What's that?

486
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,210
Hold up.

487
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,749
Get off your phone.

488
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,717
Well, I guess you win
that pot.

489
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,686
- Okay, I--
- Didn't I say to get off the phone?

490
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,056
What, you can't listen
or something?

491
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,323
They're gonna hear us out here.
It's gonna--

492
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,454
[door opening]

493
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:47,463
Hi, Billy.

494
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,098
Share, what are you
doing here?

495
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,699
I... [laughs]

496
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,735
So you weren't lying?

497
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,534
Hi.

498
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,508
Uh, what are you doing here?

499
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,744
I knew that you guys
were having a guys' night,

500
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,314
but I was in the area,
and so I just wanted to say hi.

501
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,782
Well, you--

502
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,718
you can't just show up
like this, all right?

503
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,420
You're just gonna
stand there?

504
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,621
I'm okay.

505
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,223
- Just sit down, Grace.
- Sit down.

506
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:17,326
What? I'm just trying to get
back to normal.

507
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,328
I've been really sad

508
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,827
and you make me
really happy.

509
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,404
Do you have any drugs?

510
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,139
Come sit down.

511
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,141
What's your name again?

512
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:33,575
- Grace.
- Grace.

513
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,411
- You smoke?
- Grace, huh?

514
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,413
Grace, that's a pretty name.

515
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,581
Yeah, how old are you?

516
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:44,186
- I'm 17.
- Nice.

517
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,254
- Yeah.
- Cool.

518
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,553
I'm Rod.

519
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,826
Lisa.

520
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:54,363
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's off-limits.

521
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:55,897
[murmuring]

522
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,433
You want a drink?

523
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,336
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Why not?

524
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,504
Because I'm not thirsty.

525
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,506
Oh.

526
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,173
Well, I am definitely
thirsty.

527
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:10,479
I said I'm thirsty.

528
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:14,183
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you. Appreciate that.

529
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,147
Oh.

530
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,522
Mr. Bartender,
bartending at the table.

531
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,759
Are you going to share that?

532
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,594
Well, I'm thinking
this is the real reason

533
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,464
- you came over here.
- No.

534
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:31,729
I came to see you.

535
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:38,540
Grace?

536
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,576
Oh, I'm-- I'm all right.

537
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:44,180
Yeah, I know. Drugs are bad.

538
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,382
[chuckling]

539
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,679
So am I.

540
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,850
Change.

541
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,732
[coughing]

542
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:07,203
You have to breathe it
in slow.

543
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,605
You're only gonna get
more high like that.

544
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,902
[laughing]

545
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,477
You're funny. It's okay.

546
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,646
It happened to me the first time
I did it with my sister.

547
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,578
[phone chimes]

548
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,782
[coughs]

549
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:31,456
- Who's that texting you?
- Just a friend.

550
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,877
- So, did you have fun?
- I mean, if you call

551
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,513
watching you and your boyfriend
make out "fun."

552
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,917
Gosh, he's not my boyfriend.
He's more like my drug.

553
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,583
For now.

554
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:03,292
You know, I can see why you
and my sister hung out.

555
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,723
You're really cool.

556
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,330
Thanks.

557
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,742
Five, six, seven, eight.

558
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,744
[chanting]
Work, work, work that cherry.

559
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,646
Work it to the beat.

560
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,682
Now pop, pop,
pop that cherry.

561
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,350
Make it feel sweet.

562
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,621
Now drop, drop that cherry.
Don't you want to eat, eat?

563
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,823
Now pop, pop,
pop that cherry.

564
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,625
Make it feel sweet.

565
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,627
Now drop,
drop that cherry.

566
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:42,598
Don't you want
to eat, eat, eat?

567
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,430
Don't you want to eat?

568
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,376
This ain't workin'. I don't
like it. Something's wrong.

569
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,412
- And it's you. It's her.
- What?

570
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,946
-What? -You're messing up.
You're not even committing.

571
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,683
- Fine. Okay. Okay!
- Fine? No. "Okay. Okay. Okay!"

572
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,652
- Commit, bitch. Commit.
- Okay.

573
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,053
This ain't no game.

574
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,723
Grace! Grace!

575
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,588
Grace, right?

576
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,396
Yeah, you.
[chuckles]

577
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,997
- [sighs] Shit.
- I didn't like it.

578
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,699
Don't be huffin' and puffin'.
It's her.

579
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,502
- How do you know my name?
- Um...

580
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,671
it's not hard
to find out someone's name

581
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,441
that you're interested in.

582
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,905
I'm Jason.

583
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,014
What is he doing
talking to her?

584
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,351
Not to be mean or anything,

585
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,619
but you kind of suck
out there.

586
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,621
Thanks.

587
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,625
I was just jokin'.
You're supposed to laugh.

588
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,792
Well, I guess
I'll-- I'll see you around.

589
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:55,937
Yo. Is that girl really weird
like everybody say she is?

590
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,740
- Who, Grace?
- Yeah.

591
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,711
Bro, you can't tell?
She's, like, really weird.

592
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,045
Weird? She's cute as hell.

593
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,047
Yo, you guys really need
to know the facts

594
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,649
before you start talking
about people.

595
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,651
Matt, I know
that's your friend and all,

596
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,453
but you know the truth.

597
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,655
Yo, Anthony, I'd be quiet
if I were you, all right?

598
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,991
Wait, wait,
what're y'all talkin' about?

599
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,560
Look, she was already weird.

600
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,463
But last summer,
her girlfriend killed herself,

601
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,698
and now she's weirder.

602
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,965
Yo, that wasn't
her girlfriend.

603
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,701
That was her best friend,
all right?

604
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,766
What you gonna do
about it?

605
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,903
I'm just saying
what everybody already knows.

606
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,879
Really?

607
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,881
You don't go here
anymore, Matt.

608
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:43,781
You're not a senior anymore.
Remember?

609
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,419
Yeah, I remember.

610
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,460
I'mma act
like I didn't see that.

611
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,629
Why don't you get out of here
and stop talkin' all that shit?

612
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:54,963
Why don't you get the fuck out
of here and stop talkin'

613
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,599
- all that shit.
- Wow.

614
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,697
Um...

615
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,803
Yeah.

616
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,540
They say you're really close
with Grace.

617
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,511
Is that stuff they say
about her, is it real?

618
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,946
If you want
to get to know her,

619
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,881
why don't you get to know her
for yourself

620
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,113
and stop listening
to these knuckleheads?

621
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:30,566
Hey, Jerry.
Hold on for a second.

622
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,501
Hey, ma'am, you can't smoke
in here.

623
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,965
Oh.
[chuckles]

624
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,707
Thank you.
Jerry? Hey, buddy.

625
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,709
Yeah, hold
that appointment for me.

626
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,579
Okay, thanks.

627
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:49,547
So am I, uh... am I gonna
get the food stamps?

628
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:54,523
Looks like
you are gonna qualify.

629
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,825
Yay.

630
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,895
Um, you're-- You're not
gonna get the max

631
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,563
because it's just you
and your daughter.

632
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,064
But you should be receiving
something

633
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,100
- really shortly in the mail.
- Okay.

634
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,270
So, I have some forms
I need you to sign.

635
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,739
Right here.
Go ahead and date it.

636
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:30,220
Wait, is that right?

637
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,860
Every digit.

638
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,065
All right,
I'mma call you.

639
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,803
Good to see you.

640
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,806
Take care.

641
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,694
GRACE:
In this beautiful life do we fight

642
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,897
the vultures that attempt
to kill beauty

643
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:12,029
or die as they prey
upon us?

644
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,802
[girl crying]

645
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:28,817
It's just not fair.
[sniffles]

646
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,682
What do you mean
it's not fair?

647
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,223
Everybody's always making fun
of me about everything.

648
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:38,827
About the way I look,
who I am.

649
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,996
I just feel
like I don't fit in.

650
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,732
Sometimes I wish
I could just disappear.

651
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,001
No. No. Andrea.

652
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,667
Don't-- Don't talk
like that.

653
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,141
[sniffles]
What's the point of being here

654
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:56,273
if no one sees me for me?

655
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,847
I see you for who you are.

656
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,886
I'm your best friend.

657
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:18,362
Grace, do you think
I'm beautiful?

658
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,036
It's okay.

659
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:24,869
You can be honest with me.

660
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:30,174
Yes, I do.
I think you're beautiful.

661
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:33,277
Do you?

662
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,271
- [door opens]
- Grace.

663
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,412
Hey, what're you doing?

664
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:08,416
Um, just finishing
some homework.

665
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:12,320
Well, looks like we may
be getting some food stamps.

666
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,222
You better thank
the man upstairs,

667
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,924
because otherwise
you'd have to go out

668
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,693
and get a job.

669
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:21,396
You know, once you turn 18
you're officially an adult

670
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,064
and I officially

671
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:26,363
don't have to take care
of you no more.

672
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,940
You know, I met
a-- I met a cutie.

673
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:37,107
He's a little young,
but we'll see.

674
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,443
Mmm.

675
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:43,384
How was last night?

676
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,986
Cool.

677
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,923
Did you have fun?

678
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:50,125
[scoffs]
Something like that.

679
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,994
And, uh, Sharon...

680
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,996
It's Share.

681
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,132
Share, Sharon.

682
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:57,966
She looks like
she's holding up

683
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,898
with her sister
being gone and all.

684
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,972
I guess.

685
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:08,005
I think it's good that you hang
around with a girl like that.

686
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,380
Her being older, she could be
a good example--

687
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,049
I don't need any examples.

688
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,152
Everybody needs examples.

689
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:21,156
If-- If something
is broken,

690
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,491
how do you know
how to fix it?

691
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:26,094
Exampled.

692
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:28,396
[laughing]
You understand?

693
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:33,097
You're not the only one
that's smart around here.

694
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,337
What are you writing?

695
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,369
- A book? About me?
- [phone rings]

696
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,945
Hello?

697
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,214
Yeah, no, I'm just...

698
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:50,218
I'm just doing
some schoolwork.

699
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,153
Yeah. Can I call you back?

700
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:57,926
- Thanks. Okay.
- Who was that?

701
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,061
Share. She wanted me

702
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,064
to come with her
to look for a job.

703
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,362
You should go.

704
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:10,300
I have homework.

705
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,173
It's Friday night.

706
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:14,142
You got all weekend
to do your homework.

707
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,212
Well, I want
to finish it now.

708
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,280
Girl, go have fun.

709
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,082
Do you know what I did
when I was a senior?

710
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,950
Girl, I don't even
wanna tell you.

711
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:30,320
All I'm saying is you should

- Shut the fuck up.

894
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:45,021
You're so different from
the other girls around here.

895
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:47,882
So, when you lost
your virginity,

896
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:50,980
did it hurt?

897
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,755
So what you call me
over here for?

898
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,987
ANDREA:
Not really.

899
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,063
Honestly,
I didn't even like it.

900
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:07,396
GRACE:
It didn't feel good at all?

901
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:10,133
No.

902
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,873
I wish it did.

903
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:17,173
Maybe you should try it.
See if you like it.

904
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,747
Maybe you should have sex
with Matt.

905
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:22,817
That's gross.
He's like my brother.

906
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,185
Matt would die
if you had sex with him.

907
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:28,188
He's, like, so obsessed
with you.

908
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:32,026
Okay, if I tell you something

909
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:34,494
you promise not
to tell anyone?

910
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,130
Promise.

911
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,999
You remember that boy
I told you about at school?

912
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,968
Yes.

913
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,770
You promise not
to tell anyone?

914
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,405
Because if this gets out,
I'm dead.

915
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:49,205
Okay. I promise.

916
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:00,054
[laughter]

917
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,056
Look, remember
what you used to tell me.

918
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,158
Just keep walking
with your head up high.

919
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:05,192
I mean,
none of them matter anyways.

920
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,027
They're all ugly
on the inside.

921

[laughing]

922
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:14,330
I see you're
walking differently, Grace.

923
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:20,103

on a beach?

It wasn't even like that.

You fucking lesbian.

[snickering]

934
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:52,206
- Boo-hoo, whore.
- She's so ugly.

935
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,474
We're not gonna save you,
and no one is.

936
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,376
Do you want to be
a vampire, girl?

937
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,078
Is that why
you dress that way?

938
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,213
You look so ugly when you cry.

939
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:00,981
- You nasty.
- Little stanky-ass ho.

940
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,349
You're such a lesbian.

941
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:04,051
You need
to fucking die, bitch.

942
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:05,119
Go away.

943
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:06,486
Nobody wants you here.

944
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,822
Nobody.

945
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:10,219
You're fucking in my space
right now.

946
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:22,498
Grace!

947
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:27,871
It's okay.

948
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,210
I mean, if I were you
I would just be happy

949
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,546
that Jason gave you
attention.

950
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,614
I'd be a ho for him, too.

951
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,046
Me, three.

How the fuck could you
do this to me?

954
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,583
How could you do this to me?
I'm ruined now!

955
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,185
Andrea, why do you care
what they say?

956
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,120
Because I promised her!

957
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,219
I care because
I promised Mary!

958
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:32,868
[screaming]

959
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,676
You're supposed
to be my best friend!

How could you do this
to me, Grace?

961
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:42,311
How c-- How could you?

ANDREA:
How could you?

964
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,551
How could you keep something
like this from me?

965
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,219
Because you're not being real
with me!

966
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,255
You're not being real with me!
You're not being real

967
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,023
- with yourself!
- What are you talking about?

968
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:25,092
- We're best friends!
- Do you want to be with me

969
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,223

[crying]

974
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,349
I didn't think so.

975
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,322
I don't know. It just...

976
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:32,192
It just happened.

977
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,194
What happened?

978
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:37,131
The fight or the sex?

979
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,433
The fight.

980
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:42,569
The sex. Both.

981
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,439
You know what, my dear,

982
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:49,772
that is what you call life.

983
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,080
I just...

984
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,215
It just happened.

985
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:59,086
I mean, how can you do that?

986
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,155
I want to kill him.

987
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:04,391
I told you about these guys.
I told you that.

01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,200
I'm sorry. I'm not--
I'm not laughing at you.

I'm-- I'm laughing with you.
I'm...

Come on.

992
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,844
You have to laugh
at stuff like this,

993
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,311
or else it's gonna--
it's gonna eat you up.

994
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,447
I don't know what to do.

995
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,554
You know what, Grace,
if I had let people judge me,

996
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,557
if I had judged myself for
everything that I did in Vegas,

997
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:40,160
I probably would've ended up
going crazy.

998
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,863
I probably would've done
the same thing that Andrea did.

999
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,866
Hey, in this life,

1000
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,535
you're alone.

1001

You have to fight
your own battles.

1002
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,540
And sometimes

1003
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,240
you just gotta
say, "Fuck it."

1004

Fuck it!

was it good?

And if they're,
like, pinky-small,

01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:39,519
just say,
"Oh, it's so big, Daddy."

just borrowing it.

Come on, let's dance.

Let's get ready to get
on the dance floor.

take you out sometime?

can keep my attention tonight.

any time you feel like it.

- for this right now.
- Grace, I'm ta...

01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,811
- Wait...
- What do you-- what you doing?

1070
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,113
- What are y'all doing?
- O-- Okay. Okay, okay.

1071
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,982
You trying to act
like a good mother

1072
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:57,851
'cause your little friend
is here, huh?

1073
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,520
You know what,
you're out of line!

1074
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,921
- Lisa, I'm gonna take off.
- No, that's okay.

1075
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,690
Don't go, don't go,
don't go.

1076
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,659
- Yeah, don't go, don't go.
- Don't go, don't go.

1077
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,961
All right, I'm out of here.

1078
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,364
You need to stop
drinking so much.

1079
01:12:10,394 --> 01:12:12,828
Yeah, whatever.

1080
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,804
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't fucking believe it.

1081
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,639
Got a girl who's crazy.

1082
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,375
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1083
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:22,676
What is wrong with you?

1084
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,744
[radio playing]

1085
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,443
[grunting]

1086
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,387
I'm tired of you!

1087
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,632
Go. You want to go?

1088
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,501
Go.

1089
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:50,466
Bye, Lisa.

1090
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:20,062
Yo, it's too late
to be out here.

1091
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:39,915
All right, let me know if you
need anything else, all right?

1092
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:45,888
You know, Grace,
I'm worried about you.

1093
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:56,632
About what?

1094
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:03,539
Matt, what do you
want from me?

1095
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:09,778
It seems like
you're obsessed with me.

1096
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:14,650
It's okay.

1097
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,242
Just admit it.

1098
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:45,648
Just come here, look.

1099
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,588
Stop being a creep.

1100
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,289
I'm-I'm just a guy
that cares, that's...

1101
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,922
- That's just...
- Don't touch me.

1102
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,000
Listen, Grace,
I kn-- I know

1103
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,499
about you and Andrea.

1104
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,873
I know, and I-- I'm not
judging about it.

1105
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:10,038
- But listen, you don't know--
- You don't know shit.

1106
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,643
Okay?

1107
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,853
All right.

1108
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:22,818
Maybe I don't.

1109
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:27,326
You know, listen, Matt.

1110
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,795
I appreciate you

1111
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:30,730
and everything you did
for me tonight,

1112
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,564
but I'm tired.

1113
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,968
Good night.

1114
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:45,812
You know, Grace,
I just didn't

1115
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:49,544
stay back in town
because I had the...

1116
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:55,584
Because I didn't have the money,
you know, to go to college.

1117
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,823
I also stayed back in town
to protect you.

1118
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:05,699
You're a very special girl,
you know?

1119
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:08,664
You mean a lot to me.

1120
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,745
Yo, where you going?

1121
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:22,882
I'm gonna give you a little
piece of advice, Matt.

1122
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,318
Start worrying
about your life.

1123
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:28,283
Not mine.

1124
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,744
Your friend's here.

1125
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:54,242
What are you doing here?

1126
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:57,884
I wanted to hang out.

1127
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,886
Mm.

1128
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,888
Well, there's
nothing to do here, so...

1129
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,890
If she wants to stay,
let her stay.

1130
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,388
We just chillin'.

1131
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:11,994
[chuckles]
Oh.

1132
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,802
JoJo, why don't you roll up
some of that kale

1133
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,370
for the princess?

1134
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,803
[deep breaths]

1135
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,491
You want me?

1136
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,457
Huh?

1137
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,172
What's wrong?

1138
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,912
It's Grace.

1139
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,814
She's been acting up.

1140
01:18:34,844 --> 01:18:37,050
I kicked her out of the house
last night

1141
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,085
and I haven't heard from her.

1142
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:41,850
She's gonna be okay, Lisa.

1143
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,424
I've been a horrible mother.

1144
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,027
I've been a horrible mother.

1145
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,863
No, you're not.

1146
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:53,762
You just have to have faith.

1147
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:15,417
[chuckles]
You are a wild one.

1148
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,224
What?

1149
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,794
I can't even remember
what happened.

1150
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:22,095
[chuckles]

1151
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:26,128
Where do you want me
to take you?

1152
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:16,444
[siren wailing]

1153
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:35,330
[taps]

1154
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:38,104
Hey, Grace, what's up?
This is Patrick.

1155
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:39,572
I had a good time with you
in the club the other night.

1156
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:43,309
Looking forward
to seeing you later. Peace.

1157
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,144
Thank you for dinner.

1158
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,280
You're welcome.

1159
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:50,249
So where do you want to go?

1160
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:53,081
You want to hang out longer?

1161
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,621
Um...

1162
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:58,291
Well, my friends are having
a party at the hotel

1163
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,259
right there
if you want to go.

1164
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:02,461
I mean, we could
stay here if you want.

1165
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:03,629
Oh.

1166
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,932
No, it's... it's totally fine.

1167
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:08,201
I just have school
in the morning.

1168
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:09,268
School?

1169
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:12,138
Uh, yeah, I'm in college.

1170
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:16,104
Oh, okay, cool.

1171
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:21,343
I just want to hang out longer
with you, that's all.

1172
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:26,281
[muffled chatter and music]

1173
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:51,544
- Okay, okay, stop.
- What's wrong?

1174
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:54,547
This is-- This isn't
a good idea.

1175
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:57,416
No? I thought you were down.

1176
01:21:57,446 --> 01:22:00,086
You're not down?

1177
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:01,720
Huh?

1178
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,556
Come on, I got you.

1179
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,058
I got you.

1180
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,922
- Okay.
- Okay.

1181
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:10,229
What are you do...

1182
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:13,395
Relax. I know what you want.

1183
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,036
Let me go.

1184
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:20,039
- Let m--
- Relax. Just go with it.

1185
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:22,337
Stop.

1186
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:30,545
- [gasping, crying]
- [indistinct talking]

1187
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,152
GRACE:
Get off me.

1188
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:35,650
[chattering]

1189
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:38,686
Let go of me.

1190
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:46,194
Fellas, she's right in time
for the party.

1191
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,502
GRACE:
Let go of me.

1192
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:51,566
Let go!

1193
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:23,336
[answering machine beeps]

1194
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,438
Share, it's Grace.

1195
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:27,640
Please call me back.

1196
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,808
Please.

1197
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,345
Grace, I know
I wasn't there for you.

1198
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:36,415
My grandmother died.
I'm sorry.

1199
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:41,620
I've just been
trying to figure it out.

1200
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,323
But I want to fix it.

1201
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:47,460
I don't think
we should do this.

1202
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:51,659
These guys are gonna pay
for what they did to you.

1203
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:58,800
[starts engine]

1204
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:03,405
Grace! Grace!

1205
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:07,542
Grace!

1206
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,765
MAN:
Yeah.

1207
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,601
- [knocking]
- Come on through this way.

1208
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:32,134
Hey, I'm gonna call you
right back. Hold on.

1209
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,379
- Oh, shit!
- Get the fuck back!

1210
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,415
Everybody shut the fuck up!

1211
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:43,549
You think you could rape
my little sister

1212
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,617
and get away with it?

1213
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,185
Where the fuck is Patrick at?

1214
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:48,816
Where is he?

1215
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:56,529
- [screaming]
- Oh! Hey! What the fuck?

1216
01:24:56,559 --> 01:25:00,162
- Get out. I said get out!
- Goddamn. Okay.

1217
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:02,435
Do you remember that girl?

1218
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:03,436
Huh?

1219
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,604
Did you rape her? Huh?

1220
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,406
Tell me right now,
'cause I can fix it.

1221
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,375
I'll fix-- I'll fucking
shoot them in the fucking face!

1222
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,843
Are those the guys
that raped you?

1223
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:15,310
Tell me right now!
Is that the guy who raped you?

1224
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:19,614
Are these the guys
that raped you?

1225
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:25,620
[gasping, sobbing]

1226
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:43,738
Evelyn, I don't know
where she went.

1227
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:49,511
I don't know what to do.

1228
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:55,388
Bring her home safe.

1229
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:58,186
[crying]

1230
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,913
[crying]:
Please bring her home.

1231
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:23,878
Mom?

1232
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,352
Grace...

1233
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:28,387
Grace!

1234
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,486
[sobbing]

1235
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:43,891
Anyway,
I wanted to give you this.

1236
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:46,365
What's this?

1237
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:49,864
Just don't open it
before I leave.

1238
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:55,474
There's nothing really here
for me anymore, so...

1239
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:57,872
Oh...

1240
01:27:59,642 --> 01:28:00,646
Okay.

1241
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:03,811
See you later.

1242
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,846
GRACE:
This beautiful life.

1243
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:37,512
This beautiful life
of mystery.

1244
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:41,949
This beautiful life
can also feel like misery.

1245
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:49,691
Sometimes it-- it just
doesn't make sense.

1246
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:54,867
Why are we on this never-ending
journey to find beauty,

1247
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:57,703
while beauty never
truly reveals itself?

1248
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,473
I once glimpsed beauty

1249
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:02,675
in a friend of mine.

1250
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:06,745
She was beauty,
but the world denied it.

1251
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:09,682
And this beautiful soul
that I denied,

1252
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:11,884
in taking her own life,

1253
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:15,087
took a part of me.

1254
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:19,558
My mother has been told
she's beautiful her whole life.

1255
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:21,594
If you're beautiful
with no soul,

1256
01:29:21,624 --> 01:29:22,628
are you even living?

1257
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:24,930
Am I just a walking soul

1258
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,832
trying to emulate beauty
like everyone else,

1259
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,634
only to have it destroyed

1260
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,603
by a man?

1261
01:29:30,633 --> 01:29:33,138
A man once destroyed me.

1262
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:36,609
But when it's
all said and done

1263
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,845
no one can break my spirit.

1264
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:42,948
This is my journey,
and I will find my way.

1265
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,551
Even if I fall short
of finding beauty,

1266
01:29:45,581 --> 01:29:49,922
this beautiful life I long
for will reveal itself,

1267
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:51,790
because it's out there

1268
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:55,957
waiting to be discovered.

1269
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:09,842
My name is Grace

1270
01:30:09,872 --> 01:30:12,774
and this is my beautiful life.

1271
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:21,583
Do you know
you're beautiful?

1272
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:28,523
* Today

1273
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:31,697
* I feel the same way

1274
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:35,062
* As an empty shell

1275
01:30:35,798 --> 01:30:38,966
* Today

1276
01:30:39,568 --> 01:30:40,773
* I feel

1277
01:30:40,803 --> 01:30:43,742
* As lonely as hell

1278
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,744
* In my head

1279
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,582
* And I'm so tired

1280
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:51,884
* Of feeling

1281
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:54,019
* This way

1282
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,889
* And when I look at you

1283
01:30:56,919 --> 01:31:00,759
* It makes me realize

1284
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:05,727
* I don't even know who I am

1285
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,667
* But maybe someday

1286
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:11,504
* Maybe someday I

1287
01:31:11,534 --> 01:31:15,069
* Will find me

1288
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:18,744
* So maybe someday

1289
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:21,614
* Maybe someday I

1290
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:25,212
* Will find you

1291
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:31,690
* But for now

1292
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,557
* I'm still so lost

1293
01:31:37,926 --> 01:31:41,734
* And I don't know

1294
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:45,567
* What's missing to me

1295
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:48,774
* But maybe someday

1296
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:51,844
* Maybe someday I

1297
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:56,077
* Will find me

1298
01:31:56,311 --> 01:31:58,784
* And maybe someday

1299
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:01,920
* Maybe someday I

1300
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:05,820
* Will find you

1301
01:32:06,589 --> 01:32:08,861
* And maybe someday

1302
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:11,830
* Maybe someday I

1303
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,199
* Will find you

1304
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,702
* I will find you

1305
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:19,037
* And maybe someday

1306
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:25,567
* I will find me,
I will find me *

1307
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:29,047
* I know

1308
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:31,884
* It will take some time

1309
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:33,586
* But I'm ready

1310
01:32:33,616 --> 01:32:34,887
* To do

1311
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,855
* What it takes

1312
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:39,625
* And I know

1313
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:42,227
* It won't be easy

1314
01:32:42,257 --> 01:32:44,930
* To find my way

1315
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,899
* Out here

1316
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:49,602
* And I know

1317
01:32:49,632 --> 01:32:51,970
* It will take some time

1318
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,940
* But I'm ready to do

1319
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:57,009
* What it takes

1320
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:59,177
* And I know

1321
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:02,380
* It won't be easy

1322
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:05,017
* To find my way

1323
01:33:05,047 --> 01:33:06,919
* Out here

1324
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:09,387
* But maybe someday

1325
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:12,390
* Maybe someday I

1326
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,891
* Will find me

1327
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:19,865
* And maybe someday

1328
01:33:19,895 --> 01:33:22,835
* Maybe someday I

1329
01:33:22,865 --> 01:33:26,734
* Will find you

1330
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,875
* And maybe someday

1331
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:32,878
* Maybe someday I

1332
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:34,880
* Will find you

1333
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:37,415
* I will find you

1334
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,952
* And maybe someday

1335
01:33:39,982 --> 01:33:46,287
* I will find me,
I will find me. *
