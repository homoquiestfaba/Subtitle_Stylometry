my latest reading, though.

You guys mess with
my equipment again?

Whatever.

With all due respect,
Captain,

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,782
how much longer is
this babysitting gonna last?

37
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,685
Well, as long as
you have problems

Lieutenant.

00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,822
Yes, Captain,

40

but surely you have better uses
for your best pilot trainee?

41
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,159
I still haven't decided if

42
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,462
you're my best trainee
or my worst.

43
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:54,198
I outmaneuvered everyone in
class every session, ma'am.

44
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,467
Sounds like she
is your best pilot.

45
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,568
Hmm.

47
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:03,542
Which is why Lieutenant Young
is going to pass probation

standard operating procedure,

49
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,080

50
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,782

Ah, see that you do.

52
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,621
Show me you can follow commands,

53
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:19,591
and then I'll put you back on
the wait list for Squad 1A,

54
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,326
I promise.

55
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,361

00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,259
Hard labor beats the brig.

180
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:37,361
Ma'am, you don't
owe me anything.

181
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:38,929
But if I go to prison,

182
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:41,131
that's a waste of my talent
and your training.

183
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,601
If you refer me to a labor
assignment in the penal system,

184
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:47,004
I promise you I will repay you!

185
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,740
If I request a labor program,

186
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:51,976
you're gonna be flying
an F-level tugboat

187
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,011
and doing community service.

188
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:56,680
Okay, so it's an MOLV-One ship?

189
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,918
Yes, the lowest class there is
and it's a dangerous assignment.

190
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,987
And, Astrid, you'll be working
crew with other criminals.

191
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:04,889
Wait. I can't fly alone?

192
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,826
[laughs]
No, not anymore.

193
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,631
Okay, I understand.

194
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:24,542
Major Hawkins,
this is Captain Chase

195
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,978
requesting a labor assignment.

196
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,879
<i>Go for Hawkins.</i>

197
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,581
Yes.

198
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,385
Former Lieutenant Young is
waiving her right to a hearing.

199
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,988
And is requesting
a hard labor assignment

200
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,891
commensurate to the charges.

201
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,459
<i>I'll have the hearing officer
draw up the paperwork.</i>

202
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:43,995
<i>She can start today, Captain.</i>

203
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:47,298
<i>There's a tug ship
scheduled at 1700.</i>

204
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,799
The freighter?

205
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,370
Okay.

206
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:54,905
You're in.

207
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,573
I think you might
change your mind about prison

208
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,908
when you meet the crew.

209
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:01,346
Ma'am, seriously,
I will repay you.

210
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,948
You are going to another
solar system

211
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:08,919
on a last-tier assignment,
dead last, desert planet.

212
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,389
Planet Dune?

213
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,024
It's a freighter lift
from the surface.

214
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,527
It's a six-crew members.

215
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:19,997
They reported mechanical
problems when they had takeoff.

216
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:21,533
And then we lost contact.

217
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,436
We're gonna send you in
to check and rescue.

218
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,338
Ma'am, seriously,
I'm in your debt.

219
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:29,473
Go get your new uniform.

220
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,812
Get your ship dock number
and report to me at 1630.

221
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:36,514
- Thank you so much.
- Go, go.

222
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,894
[snoring]

223
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:55,432
Astrid, meet your new crew.

224
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:56,668
What's up?

225
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,703
You must be Astrid.

226
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,938
Your reputation precedes you.

227
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,207
Like it's tattooed
on my forehead.

228
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:07,377
Trying to change that, though.

229
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,379
Sure. I'm ship's mechanic.

230
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,649
There's nothing
I can't fix...

231
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,284
unless it gets broken
by a reckless pilot.

232
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,620
Good thing we don't have one
of those around here then.

233
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,860
You disobeyed a flight directive
and lost your ship, right?

234
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:26,062
No, my engine went out when
I was saving someone's life.

235
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,533
That's why you're here giving
guided tours to cosmonauts.

236
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,968
Okay, let's get
something straight...

237
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,636
Cool your jets.

238
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,006
This is the only crew
you have now.

239
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,342
Hey, there.
I'm Ronnie, your navigator.

240
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,879
Nice to meet you.

241
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,980
I know you.

242
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,649
Oh, yeah. My face was all over
the interstellar coms.

243
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,019
Took 'em forever to catch me.

244
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,254
They said, "Prison or
Risky Probation Flights"?

245
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,724
So I said, "Give me Flights."

246
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,093
Hey, a great navigator
can get out of anywhere.

247
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:59,663
It's like a daredevil
rescue pilot, right?

248
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,365
Yeah, well, at least
you're free now.

249
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:05,302
I wouldn't say that.

250
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,371
I've got this lovely keepsake.

251
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:09,039
Can't wander too far from home.

252
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,844
Well, shall we?

253
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,412
Brad!

254
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:18,483
Sorry. What'd I miss?

255
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:19,783
Nothing at all.

256
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,620
I was just introducing
your pilot.

257
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,722
I'm Brad, tug line operator.

258
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,625
If it's stuck, I unstick it.

259
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,595
Everyone, this is Astrid Young,

260
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:33,697
former Lieutenant of the
Space Force Rescue Division

261
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,000
and one of our greatest assets.

262
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:39,837
Unfortunately, one of our
greatest liabilities also.

263
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:44,041
But, fortunately,
I believe in rehabilitation

264
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:46,176
and not in punishment.

265
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,546
So don't let me down.

266
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,916
Skis up at 1700.

267
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,893
Well, you heard her.
Let's load up.

268
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,137
That's our ship?

269
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,671
I thought I was being punished.

270
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,533
[sighs]

271
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,754
All right.
Crew up here.

272
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,692
[chattering]

273
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,727
Yo, Astrid!

274
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,163
Uh... Lieutenant.

275
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,097
Oh, that's how it's gonna be?

276
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,968
Okay... Lieutenant.

277
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,370
Gear's all stowed and
crew is buckled up.

278
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,305
Flight crew, prep for liftoff.

279
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,077
Don't look so worried.

280
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:30,615
We know what we're doing,
"Lieutenant Young".

281
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,018
<i>MOLV One, you are
clear for take off.</i>

282
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,986
<i>Be advised, we are
getting reports of</i>

283
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,591
<i>an asteroid debris field
near your route. Stay safe.</i>

284
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,791
Copy that.

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,567
Gear up.

286
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:51,970
Ahead one-quarter.

287
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:58,275
Course laid in.

288
00:17:58,342 --> 00:17:59,911
At full.

289
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,788
Nice takeoff, pilot.

290
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,925
No, seriously, they gave us the
most raggedy piece of garbage...

291
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah, it's not that bad.

292
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,062
It'll get us there.

293
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:19,896
We'll be lucky
if someone doesn't sneeze

294
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,365
and blow a
hole through the hull.

295
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,666
All right, Ronnie.

296
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,335
If you don't need me up here,

297
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,269
I'm gonna go on ahead and
mosey down to the engine room

298
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,672
and give it a once-over.

299
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,539
- Yeah, just make sure...
- Uh, make it quick.

300
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:32,242
I expect a full
debrief on return.

301
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,144
Will do, boss.

302
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,946
It's Lieutenant.

303
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,017
Lieutenant Boss.

304
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:41,720
Okay, are we gonna
have a problem here?

305
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,221
I get the feeling
we're gonna have a problem!

306
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,655
- Well, maybe.
- There's no problem right?

307
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,658
Happy crew, happy ship, right?

308
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,195
I don't think the guy
who steals ships

309
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,762
with his tow line
should tell the rest of us

310
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,762
- how to run our ship!
- I was broke.

311
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:54,330
I needed the money.

312
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,465
A lot of people go broke,
but they don't go on...

313
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:56,700
[alarm blares]

314
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,706
- Asteroids!
- Bring up the map!

315
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:08,945
This ship's tracking
lidar is crap!

316
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,713
Yeah. We're three
degrees off-course.

317
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,250
I can reroute us manually.

318
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,922
Damn it!
We have damage, starboard side!

319
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,191
Wait, why are we
in an asteroid field?

320
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,859
How'd that happen?
Astrid?

321
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,193
Yeah, I'm a little
busy right now!

322
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,362
I'm losing pressure!
Rebecca?

323
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,497
On it!

324
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:26,898
All right, pressure's leveling!

325
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,934
We have damage
on the starboard side.

326
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,248
More good news.
The landing gear is toast!

327
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,716
Oh, that's fine.

328
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,985
We can just use the landing
skis instead of the wheels.

329
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,220
Skis?

330
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,355
The surface is sandy.
We can glide on in.

331
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,629
Clear field.

332
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,230
Clear field? Our new pilot
here didn't even realize

333
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:02,866
we were approaching
an asteroid field.

334
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,501
The Lidar's faulty.

335
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,003
We were having troubles
with it on the last run, too.

336
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,404
Someone didn't fix it, Rebecca.

337
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,207
You know I haven't
had a chance...

338
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:11,875
Okay, Rebecca! It's nobody's
fault, all right?

339
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,211
We were three degrees
off-course!

340
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,546
Clearly, nothing works
well on this rig!

341
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:17,849
You all handled yourselves well.

342
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,817
Well, at least this time,
it wasn't your fault.

343
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,220
You better check yourself,
civilian!

344
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,355
We got a long road
to walk together!

345
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,193
What? You wanna go?
Hmm?

346
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,096
Well, at least
we're all in one piece, right?

347
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,232
It's good enough for me.

348
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,572
Assess the damage on the hull.
Find out what got knocked loose.

349
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:43,006
Brad, get this rig cleaned up.

350
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,783
What is her deal?

351
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,052
Rebecca doesn't like anybody.

352
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,753
Yeah, no.
I got that.

353
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,756
I seem to be special, though.

354
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,994
She is fifth-generation
Space Force.

355
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,630
Entire family is military,
by the book.

356
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,099
You come here,
Miss Poster Child

357
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,868
for "regulations
don't mean jack".

358
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:15,672
Just breeze in,
the gifted one.

359
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,575
Yeah, okay.
I got it.

360
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:18,942
How'd she wind up here?

361
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,278
I don't know.

362
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,847
I do know that she's pretty
ticked off that you just

363
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:25,549
got away with a little
slap on the wrist

364
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,084
for breaking military protocol.

365
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,519
What? This is a slap
on the wrist?

366
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,756
Yeah, compared to what
it could have been, yes.

367
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,358
You have friends in high places.

368
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:34,825
Well, not high enough.

369
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,961
Yeah. Watch me try and wreck
a ship and get away with it.

370
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,663
Fair enough.

371
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,500
You just need to keep your nose
clean for the next few days.

372
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,569
And then it's back
to being Lieutenant Hero.

373
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,940
It's not like that.

374
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,842
You could have fooled me.

375
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,308
What do I know?

376
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,144
Spent most of my time
in the brig.

377
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,647
Hey, can I ask what you did?

378
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,516
You can ask.

379
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,790
I'm gonna go check out the ship.

380
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:09,927
Something somewhere
is broken down, I guarantee it.

381
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,222
[exhales]

382
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:46,763
Beginning descent
to Planet Dune,

383
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,365
engaging orbital boosters.

384
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,902
Gravity assist is
slowing our trajectory.

385
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,135
Copy.

386
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,738
Okay, Rebecca, how's it looking?

387
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:56,908
Still getting a damage reading,
but the skis are intact.

388
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,708
Okay, Brad, stand by.

389
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,244
Anchor standing by!

390
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,279
All right, everyone,
hold what you got.

391
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,981
I'm gonna set us down as close
to this freighter as possible.

392
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:06,716
We come in, we come out.

393
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,185
Reminds me of my last job.

394
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,519
Isn't that how you
wound up on this one?

395
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,556
I can neither confirm
nor deny that.

396
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:19,730
The air's too obscured from
that smoke from the volcano.

397
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,432
I can't get a reading.

398
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:23,299
Atmosphere's bouncing
back the lidar.

399
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:26,170
All right. We'll have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

400
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,138
Clear the coverage
and set her down.

401
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:30,740
Easy. We don't
wanna wheelbarrow.

402
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,108
I know.

403
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:34,144
Increasing back
pressure and power.

404
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:40,550
The planetary profile says that
the atmosphere's totally clear.

405
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:44,187
Yeah. Since when has Space Force
been right about anything?

406
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,924
Caught your ass, didn't they?

407
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,364
I have visuals and reading!
500 feet!

408
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:57,501
Reconfiguring flap settings
from 30 to 40 degrees!

409
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:58,936
Coming in hard!

410
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:03,673
Landing gear skis down!

411
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,674
All right, Brad! Go!

412
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:05,976
On it!

413
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:08,712
Tow system is go!

414
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:10,381
Droppin' anchor!

415
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:20,124
[grunts]

416
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:28,699
Good job, everyone.

417
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:30,735
Let's find this freighter
and get outta here.

418
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,296
I thought it was supposed
to be winter here.

419
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,630
It is.

420
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,631
Hang on, guys.
It's too hot.

421
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,307
It is hot!

422
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,841
Yeah.

423
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:12,476
I think it's gonna blow soon.

424
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,682
Then we hurry.

425
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:19,883
[rumbling]

426
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,852
Careful!

427
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,321
I don't see the freighter.
It's supposed to be here.

428
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,923
We probably overshot
the landing.

429
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,658
Hang on.
There's a trail over here.

430
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:34,597
Straight through the sand,
like it was dragged.

431
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:37,567
No, a ship that big can't
be dragged without a tow line.

432
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:41,572
Stay sharp, guys.

433
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,256
I see it!
Over there!

434
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:04,962
Perfect...

435
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:06,530
We'll be skis up in an hour.

436
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,369
Hang on, guys.

437
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,336
Stop!

438
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,173
Yes, "Lieutenant"?

439
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,474
Something's not right.

440
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,177
What? I don't see
anything wrong.

441
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,815
There's no one outside.

442
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:26,717
They're supposed to be on
the lookout for us.

443
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,620
Well, they're probably inside,
away from this heat...

444
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:30,453
like we should be.

445
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,422
No. You don't understand.

446
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,624
When a rescue ship arrives,
they should fire a flare gun

447
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:37,060
or send a ground crew
to meet us.

448
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,561
There's no one
even waving us in.

449
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:40,230
It's a six-man crew, Lieutenant.

450
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:42,100
If there's people hurt,
there is no ground crew.

451
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,702
We have seen no one!
That is a bad sign!

452
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,270
Guys, we don't even
know why it's so far

453
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:48,637
from the landing zone.

454
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,040
Maybe some of your
Russian friends

455
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,107
showed up to lend a hand?

456
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,675
They're not my friends!

457
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,611
And I'm the only one
violating treaties lately!

458
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,214
Well, it's just them
on the planet, right?

459
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,882
So what could have happened?

460
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,884
We're gonna find out.

461
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,384
We gotta be ready for anything.

462
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:03,921
So stick close, work fast.

463
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:05,490
You got it, boss.

464
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:10,860
IMC Five, this is MOLV One,
your rescue ship.

465
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,330
Come in. Over.

466
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,503
IMC Five, this is MOLV One,
do you copy?

467
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:23,240
Not good.

468
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,043
Okay, let's just see
what we're dealing with.

469
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,346
We'll check on the crew and
we'll move the tug ship closer.

470
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:30,614
Brad? Rebecca?

471
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:32,348
You guys get a tow line going.

472
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:34,251
Ronnie and I will
move into position.

473
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:38,355
We gotta hurry.

474
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:40,156
Oxygen's dropping
faster than I'd like.

475
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,826
It's only minus 10% of
what's normal on earth.

476
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:45,796
It's like a mid-altitude
hike, easy-peasy.

477
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,565
There's an active volcano
less than 15 miles away.

478
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,500
And we do know what we're doing.

479
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,036
We've been working together
before you showed up...

480
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,304
Okay, if we keep
dragging our feet,

481
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,704
we're gonna keep losing oxygen.

482
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,972
I'm just saying,
maybe we should go back

483
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,773
and get the spare oxygen...

484
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,610
Okay, listen, listen, okay?
We gotta stick together on this!

485
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:05,215
We might have an answer
once I fire off this flare.

486
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:12,388
You gotta be kidding me.

487
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,323
It's a family heirloom!

488
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:15,893
That better be water in there.

489
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:21,932
What is that? Gasoline?

490
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,433
Okay. It's moonshine,

491
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,435
but it was a gift from
my mom before she died!

492
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:28,105
Really?
Mama's moonshine?

493
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:29,573
Yeah.

494
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,142
My great-great-grandmother
was a shine runner

495
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,378
back in Prohibition. So what?

496
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:37,047
That's nice.
Were you drunk flying us here?

497
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,949
No, I wasn't drunk!

498
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:41,284
But you were drinking, right?

499
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:42,954
I had a drink, okay?

500
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,524
What?

501
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,225
I knew when I read the dossier

502
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,461
you must have been hammered
when you wrecked your ship!

503
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,430
Okay, I wasn't hammered,
all right?

504
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,365
I had just saved a ship's crew

505
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,934
and I saw debris
flowing from their craft

506
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,569
heading toward the I.S.S.

507
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,338
So, yeah, I disobeyed orders

508
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:03,673
and I deflected it and
I burned out my engine.

509
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,612
And then I had a drink,
one drink, to calm down after!

510
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,846
Did you need to calm down
after the asteroids?

511
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:13,349
No, I didn't.
Thanks for your concern.

512
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:14,918
This says otherwise.

513
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:18,755
Guys, I don't even need that!

514
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,957
Oh, good!

515
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,157
Then you won't mind if
I pour this out.

516
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:22,359
No, go right ahead!

517
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:26,696
Go! Run! Run!

518
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,519
A cave, come on!

519
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:03,866
Well, what now, Lieutenant?

520
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,403
Guess we know what happened
to the freighter crew.

521
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,537
No, we don't know anything.

522
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:10,274
There could still
be survivors out there.

523
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,774
We need to get off this planet.

524
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,310
No. We need to find
the survivors!

525
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,778
Then we go.

526
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:16,880
Well, we can't
go back out there.

527
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:18,747
Looks like we'll be
in here for a while.

528
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,818
What if it can burrow under
the rock and get in here?

529
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:23,487
Yeah, that's a good point.

530
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:25,956
There could be worms inside.

531
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:27,023
We just don't know.

532
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,327
Does anyone have
any weapons on them?

533
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:35,332
It's not much,
but it's better than nothing.

534
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,801
Against that worm?

535
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,737
You know, if it could
have come over the rocks,

536
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,406
it would have followed us in.

537
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,509
So we should be safe in here,
for now at least.

538
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:50,781
Okay, I say we go deeper in and
maybe there's another way out.

539
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:54,384
What if we find something
else in here, something worse?

540
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm having a
real problem with worse.

541
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,788
Something that had
to outrun the worm

542
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,391
and it got stuck here
and it's hungry too?

543
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,426
You have a point.

544
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,726
[growling]

545
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:05,195
I think it can
probably still detect us

546
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,596
'cause we're so close
to the entrance.

547
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,163
- We should move.
- Ronnie's right.

548
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,799
It could be trying to find
another way in as we speak.

549
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,100
Let's go find another way out!

550
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,134
Go, go, go.

551
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,038
- Okay.
- All right.

552
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:21,944
Hey...

553
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,146
What was that?

554
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,882
- Was that a person?
- Is somebody there?

555
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,517
I'm not sure.

556
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,852
- Watch your six.
- You got it.

557
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,387
Can you hear me?

558
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:32,423
[coughing]

559
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:47,136
[coughing]

560
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,605
Careful.

561
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:52,942
Brad, you see anything?

562
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,749
Who's that?

563
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,250
Help!

564
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,719
I'm here! Help!

565
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:03,854
Come on!

566
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:04,822
Help!

567
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,158
Hey, you okay?

568
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,225
Do you have water?

569
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:12,061
Water, water, water, water!

570
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:15,865
Are you hurt?

571
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,669
I think I broke my leg.

572
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:21,638
The worm was chasing me.

573
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:23,373
I fell into this rock.

574
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,142
Yeah. We had a few words
with him too.

575
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,512
What uniform is that?

576
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,948
It's, uh... Public Services.

577
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,651
We're with the tug ship crew.

578
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,254
That smarts.

579
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,956
Yeah? Kills the germs.

580
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:46,896
Look, I don't think it's broken,

581
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:49,899
but be careful
putting weight on it.

582
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,736
Where's the rest of your crew?

583
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,371
I don't know.

584
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,839
We scattered.

585
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,808
My girl, Marilyn,
and the rest ran to the rocks

586
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,846
in the east and I made it here.

587
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,146
[rumbling]

588
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,384
The worm's directly beneath us!

589
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:09,886
Oh!

590
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,255
We gotta get off this rock!

591
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,956
Your leg's really gonna hurt
when we do this.

592
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:16,159
I don't care.
Just get me out of here!

593
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:21,365
It's pushing the rocks aside!

594
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:24,366
Um, I'll jump across.
You hand him to me.

595
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,536
Go!

596
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:30,840
It's trying to get
through the rocks!

597
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:32,976
Harley, step out and reach
for Astrid on the other side.

598
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,778
I got you here.

599
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:37,647
[grunts]

600
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,254
Let's go!

601
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,701
You guys, we can't stay here.

602
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,404
Okay, you ready?

603
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:04,407
Wait, wait. Look.

604
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,542
No, no, no, no, we gotta
go back out the way we came.

605
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:09,880
No, there's a small tunnel
over that I crawled in through.

606
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,815
with some light.
There's probably an exit.

607
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:13,650
Well, do you know how
to get there?

608
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:15,119
- Yes, I...
- Shh!

609
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,559
Okay. Here we go.

610
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:29,033
It's there.

611
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,069
Okay.

612
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,643
Okay, I think we're good.

613
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,281
[clattering]

614
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:45,615
- [gasps]
- Shh!

615
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,952
Run!

616
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,791
Wait, wait, wait.

617
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:56,060
I need a minute to rest.

618
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,293
We're not stopping, are we?

619
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,394
We almost died back there.

620
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,862
Shh! Do you want to live?

621
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:02,566
- You?
- Yes.

622
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,635
Then stay quiet and calm.

623
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,604
We're gonna have
a tough time finding everyone

624
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,739
and getting off this planet.

625
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,608
How many do you think
made it from your crew?

626
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,143
I was the only one
who made it to the cave,

627
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,043
probably three more.

628
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,444
Okay, do you have any weapons?

629
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:16,513
No. We're a mining rig.

630
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,980
Well, what's the plan?

631
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,882
We get to the freighter
and get out of here.

632
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:22,619
The Corrections Department
gave us explicit orders!

633
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,722
What about his crew?
We can't just leave them here.

634
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:25,989
No, no, no.
We'll rescue the crew.

635
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,657
We were sent
to rescue the freighter.

636
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:29,125
That includes the crew.

637
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:30,425
It's too risky
without backup, Astrid!

638
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:32,161
You need to think clearly.

639
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:35,365
I'm not leaving these people
stranded on a ridge to die!

640
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,936
Isn't this what got you in
trouble in the first place?

641
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:41,605
Disobeying orders to play hero?

642
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,740
As I said,
I am not disobeying orders.

643
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:44,942
We are bringing
home the freighter.

644
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,542
That means the crew, too!

645
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:48,244
We are a rescue team!

646
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:49,746
End of discussion!

647
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,917
Oxygen levels are
down five percent.

648
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,353
- That's not good!
- Same. Dropping.

649
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,755
It's the volcano.

650
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,021
There are vents
on the side that's

651
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,389
releasing carbon dioxide
and toxic fumes.

652
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:02,157
Okay, okay.
This cave is a death trap.

653
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,393
We got to get out of here,
come on. Let's go.

654
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,295
Our friend is back!

655
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,808
There's the freighter!

656
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,612
Oh, thank God!

657
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:22,846
Okay, Ronnie? Rebecca?

658
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,513
You guys get it
ready for launch.

659
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:26,816
Brad and I will go to the ridge
and look for survivors.

660
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:27,951
Okay. And the worm?

661
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,652
It can't chase both of us.

662
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,421
Just run like hell.

663
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,389
Uh, ladies?

664
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,793
He's okay.
He's just passed out.

665
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,963
We can't travel
with dead weight!

666
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:44,835
Okay, Brad.
You stay here with Harley

667
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,568
and I'll come back with
the tug for you.

668
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:48,704
- I'll stay.
- All right.

669
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,740
- Time to go, ladies.
- Yeah.

670
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:10,559
We're gonna have
to make a run for it.

671
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,695
What about the worm, Lieutenant?

672
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:14,898
It's more important that you
guys get to the freighter.

673
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,600
I'll keep him busy.

674
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,101
I'll go first.

675
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:19,436
Wait...

676
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:29,880
She's insane.

677
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:36,219
Let's go.

678
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,822
All right.

679
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,833
[panting]

680
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,481
Hello?

681
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,049
Anyone?

682
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,053
This is rescue!

683
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:16,259
Hello?

684
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:19,263
Oh, God.

685
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:22,431
Coming.

686
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:23,532
Are you okay?

687
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,235
Water...

688
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,503
I got you.

689
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:34,443
Whoa, slow slips!
Easy does it.

690
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,282
I'm Astrid.

691
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:40,884
Marilyn.

692
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:43,554
You injured?

693
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:45,989
No.

694
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:49,960
Just... Thirsty and hungry.

695
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,127
Here.

696
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:54,264
I'm so glad you're here.

697
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:01,237
- Here. Try this.
- Thanks.

698
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,342
Is there anyone else with you?

699
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,346
No.

700
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,416
They tried to make
it to the freighter.

701
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:18,755
But it... the worm...

702
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:19,990
it was waiting for them.

703
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,559
I'm sorry.

704
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,230
Look, we can't stay here.
We gotta get to my tug.

705
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:29,565
- Can you travel?
- No.

706
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,967
No, we can't.
They're too fast.

707
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,202
Whoa, hang on, they?

708
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:35,037
There's more than one worm?

709
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,974
Four that I've seen.

710
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,643
Four...

711
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:43,613
[beeps]

712
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,315
Ronnie, Rebecca and
Brad, this is Astrid. Come in.

713
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,754
MOLV One!
This is Astrid!

714
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,623
There are at least
four worms out there, guys!

715
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:55,257
I repeat, multiple worms!

716
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:56,559
Over!

717
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,295
[panting]

718
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,333
I think we're in the clear.

719
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,536
- I don't hear it.
- I hope Astrid made it.

720
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,137
[radio static]

721
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:10,340
<i>...More than one...</i>

722
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,541
More than one?

723
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:17,547
Go! Go! Go!
We're almost to the freighter!

724
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:27,390
Ronnie, repeat that
transmission!

725
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:31,061
Okay, look.

726
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:33,395
Tell me everything you know
about these worms.

727
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:36,566
I've been using
a telemetric scanner.

728
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:38,367
The worms...

729
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:42,939
they feed on trace
amounts of iron in the sand.

730
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,574
Okay, okay.
Then we arrived?

731
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:45,942
Yes.

732
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,711
They can smell the iron
in our blood.

733
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,512
But there's iron in the ships!

734
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,183
Right, but not
in the form they can use.

735
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:58,320
Okay, okay, all right.
What else?

736
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,257
There's one big one
and three smaller ones.

737
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:02,959
I think they're babies.

738
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,327
They follow the big one
around at times.

739
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:09,398
Go on. Look, any information
can help us.

740
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:10,766
The big one...

741
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:14,903
he... he grabbed the freighter.

742
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,338
He attacked the freighter.

743
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,474
And he just dragged
it across the desert.

744
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,711
I mean, we didn't
stand a chance.

745
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:28,318
Brad, this is Astrid!
Maintain your position.

746
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,721
I repeat, stay in the cave!

747
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,068
Here. Try this.

748
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,438
Come on, take this.

749
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:51,107
- What is that?
- It'll take the edge off.

750
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,880
[coughs]

751
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:01,750
Wow, that burns like...

752
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,887
Like rocket fuel? Yeah.

753
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,254
It's actual moonshine.

754
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,289
My grandma made it.

755
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:08,958
Go ahead, have a swig.

756
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:11,028
You, uh... you could use it.

757
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:19,000
What is this doing on a ship?

758
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:20,870
Isn't this contraband?

759
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,505
More or less.

760
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,476
It's all I have left
of my parents, though.

761
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:32,514
Your parents
made homemade booze?

762
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:35,550
Kind of a family legacy all
the way back to prohibition.

763
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:37,186
Hell, your great-great
grandfather

764
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:38,487
probably even had our stuff.

765
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:48,565
Oh, that's bad.

766
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:52,402
It's an acquired taste.

767
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:54,670
I'm sorry.
I think I drank the last of it.

768
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,206
Not exactly.

769
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:02,811
Should I be concerned?

770
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,179
No.

771
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:05,714
I told you,
it's a family legacy.

772
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:11,420
It's the last batch
they made before...

773
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:20,362
My mom sent this to me

774
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:24,067
as a present when I graduated
from flight school.

775
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,302
Last thing she ever sent me.

776
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:34,309
Anyway, I didn't want it to
be confiscated, so I hid it.

777
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:36,445
Maybe I should just
hang on to it.

778
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,217
I'm good.

779
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:48,358
We gotta go.

780
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,391
No, we can't!

781
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,760
The worms... we can't.

782
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,306
Ronnie? Rebecca?

783
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,840
Have you reached the freighter?
Over.

784
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:07,177
[static]

785
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,313
We can't get
any signal up here.

786
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,382
I need to get to higher ground.

787
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,119
No...

788
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:18,855
There.

789
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,690
We can run to that taller rock
and I'll radio from there.

790
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:24,193
Marilyn, come on!
We can't stay here, okay?

791
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,831
We're running out of water
and the air's getting thinner!

792
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:29,465
Marilyn, we gotta go.

793
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:31,100
Marilyn, we gotta get
to higher ground

794
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,335
so I can radio the crew, okay?

795
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:35,538
I got two in your
freighter standing by.

796
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:36,806
I got one more in a cave
over those rocks

797
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,673
with a survivor
from your team.

798
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,277
They're all waiting on us
to get off of this planet.

799
00:44:41,342 --> 00:44:43,480
Another survivor? Who?

800
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:45,815
Harley...

801
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:49,719
Harley? He's okay?
He didn't die?

802
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,554
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
He's a tough guy.

803
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:57,259
Okay?

804
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:18,715
Here.

805
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:24,954
Left foot up.

806
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,469
You good?

807
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:48,711
Hang on, listen.

808
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,383
I don't hear the worms.

809
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,490
This could be our best chance.

810
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:03,927
You ready?

811
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:07,731
Let's go.

812
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:12,735
- Ah!
- What?

813
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:16,773
I got you!

814
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:20,710
[roaring]

815
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:31,788
What about this one?

816
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:43,965
[panting]

817
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:46,869
I'm not dying like that.
Not like that.

818
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,005
Almost makes me want
to get back in the brig.

819
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,839
Seriously?

820
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:52,075
Oh, yeah.
Hell of a lot safer.

821
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:56,878
Okay, you need to get
this engine up and running.

822
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:58,447
We don't even know
what's wrong with it.

823
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,517
That's your job.

824
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:11,693
It's right below us!

825
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,529
It's following us.
Keep moving!

826
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:23,572
Everything looks the same.
Where are we?

827
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,306
- Headed towards the engine room.
- Great.

828
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:26,809
If you can't fire up the ship,

829
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:30,379
I say we cut our losses
and run for the tug ship.

830
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:32,981
No. We stay and
fix the freighter.

831
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,353
Did you feel that?
I say we just leave it!

832
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:39,587
No! I want this ship!

833
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:41,391
What do you mean,
you want this ship?

834
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,695
I'm with IMC.

835
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,429
I don't care who you work for.

836
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:48,798
Besides, I thought
you were an ex-con.

837
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:50,365
That's why I'm here.

838
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:53,335
This thing is worth $300 billion

839
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:56,338
and my cut is $100 million,
all right?

840
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,375
If you help, I'll give you 20%.

841
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,010
You in?

842
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:05,014
Look, it can't hurt us in here.

843
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:07,650
I say we save the people
and the freighter.

844
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,952
I'm not interested
in the people. I want the money.

845
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:12,921
Well, we can save
the crew on the rocks, too.

846
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,791
Be my guest!

847
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,462
Fine, but if it comes
down to a choice,

848
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:20,896
I'm ditching the freighter!

849
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,833
Sure. The crew outside
would love some company!

850
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:42,818
Huh.

851
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,554
What do you mean, "huh"?
Let's go.

852
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,954
Well, I got partial power back,

853
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:48,690
but the diagnostic says
the intake ports

854
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:50,927
need to be cleared
from underneath the ship.

855
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:51,961
If not...

856
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:53,695
If not, the ship won't start.

857
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:55,965
They're under the ship,
aren't they?

858
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,535
If we clear them from
inside the ductwork,

859
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,671
you won't be exposed
to the outside.

860
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,572
No, when I was in
the brig I mapped out

861
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,574
the entire ventilation
system...

862
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,309
Wait, wait. Why?

863
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,744
I had a lot of time
on my hands,

864
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:10,747
But if I get inside the vents,

865
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:12,515
it's gonna put me
five feet above the sand.

866
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:14,149
I don't wanna be
that close to the sand.

867
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:15,518
So what do we do?

868
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,784
Just give up and
run to the tug ship?

869
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:18,119
No.

870
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,454
I can try to clear
them using the exhaust system

871
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:20,889
in the HVAC room.

872
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,358
Okay, yeah.
That'll work!

873
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,027
- Radio me once it's done.
- Okay.

874
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,518
[roars]

875
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:04,867
Rebecca!
The worm is in the ship!

876
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:07,003
Repeat!
Worm is in the ship!

877
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:15,244
<i>Ronnie!
Get out of there!</i>

878
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:17,847
<i>The heater's on, I can't
shut it off!</i>

879
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,783
I know!

880
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:22,285
Hit max power on
the heat exhaust!

881
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,186
<i>You'll be burned alive!</i>

882
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:27,857
Do it!

883
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,895
[screeches]

884
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,938
<i>Ronnie, come in!</i>

885
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:46,608
Damn it, Ronnie! Come in!
This is Rebecca! Come in!

886
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,182
Just had to be a primary switch.

887
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,321
Can't start the engine
without the primary switch.

888
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:04,293
Ronnie, come in!
Anyone! I need backup!

889
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,101
Okay.

890
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,941
I'm gonna have to go outside.

891
00:51:35,123 --> 00:51:36,792
No wonder it wouldn't start.

892
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:40,362
The landing severed
the external power line.

893
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:42,664
[sighs]

894
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:06,655
Ah!

895
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:14,129
[screams]

896
00:52:21,603 --> 00:52:25,375
Rebecca, nice work!

897
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:28,476
Two down.

898
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,013
- Two?
- I got one, too.

899
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:35,518
Yeah, but we just
doubled our repair time.

900
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,018
How many worms are there?

901
00:52:37,085 --> 00:52:39,388
I don't know.
I only saw the one.

902
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,891
For the record, I'm impressed.

903
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:46,661
I just did what
needed to be done.

904
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,397
Exactly right.

905
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:51,432
That's why I'm gonna
give you a cut.

906
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,335
You're a good team player.

907
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:58,173
First time anyone's ever
said that about me.

908
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,177
All right.

909
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:02,677
Let's get the rig running
and get outta here.

910
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,780
What about the others?

911
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,882
What about them?

912
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,550
They make it back here, great.

913
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:10,052
If not...

914
00:53:10,918 --> 00:53:12,121
Are we clear on this?

915
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,893
Yeah.

916
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:20,329
All right. Check the
conduits in that panel.

917
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,331
We got a lot of work
ahead of us.

918
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,146
This should be good.

919
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:41,250
You okay?

920
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:42,818
Yeah.

921
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,586
I think I twisted it.

922
00:53:44,652 --> 00:53:47,489
I didn't notice the pain then,
but it's killing me now.

923
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:49,759
All right.

924
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:52,929
Get your boot off.

925
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:57,833
All right.

926
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,075
Okay?

927
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:10,046
All right.

928
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:14,215
This should keep
the swelling down.

929
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:15,384
Okay.

930
00:54:23,492 --> 00:54:25,394
All right, the tug should
be just right over there.

931
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:29,364
I'm gonna piggyback
my signal off its antenna,

932
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:31,500
radio home base.

933
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:34,603
My captain should be
able to send help.

934
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,840
Is that the same captain that
sent you to this death planet?

935
00:54:37,905 --> 00:54:40,143
She didn't know.
Neither did you.

936
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,118
Mayday, Space Force!

937
00:54:49,184 --> 00:54:51,487
This is MOLV One pilot,
Astrid Young.

938
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,521
Do you copy?

939
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,657
[static]

940
00:54:55,724 --> 00:55:01,063
Space Force, this is MOLV One.
Mayday! Do you read me?

941
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,198
<i>Copy, MOLV One, This is
Space Force. We read you.</i>

942
00:55:03,264 --> 00:55:05,734
We need immediate backup rescue
and fire power.

943
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,735
We are not alone here!

944
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:10,138
[static]

945
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,474
Space Force, do you copy?
We need help!

946
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:15,943
<i>We read you, Lieutenant.</i>

947
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,646
Chase... uh, Captain!

948
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:19,981
<i>This is a secure line.</i>

949
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:23,117
Define the full nature
of the emergency.

950
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:25,320
Is this a Russian incursion?

951
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,256
Russians? What...

952
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:29,324
<i>You just indicated there
was a hostile force</i>

953
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:31,393
and requested backup
and fire power.

954
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,130
No, ma'am, it's not Russians!
It's worms, giant worms!

955
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,664
We need rescue now!

956
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,201
We don't have the capability
to fight them!

957
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:40,568
<i>I'm sorry,
but I'm not authorized</i>

958
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:42,471
to send a retrieval ship.

959
00:55:42,536 --> 00:55:45,273
Not authorized?

960
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,144
Are we not worth rescuing?
Am I getting that right?

961
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,347
Lower echelon status
means less support.

962
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,084
You knew that was a part
of the probation deal.

963
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,119
Yeah, but I would think
that goes out the window

964
00:55:57,186 --> 00:56:00,689
when we start dealing with
giant man-eating worms, Chase!

965
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:01,956
<i>Danger detail, Astrid.</i>

966
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:03,224
You requested it.

967
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,094
Your job is to
get the freighter.

968
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:07,328
If I didn't think you could do
it, I wouldn't have sent you.

969
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:08,964
The freighter...

970
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,599
ma'am, you are not gonna get a
freighter if my crew is dead!

971
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:13,668
Not to mention
the civilian survivors!

972
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:16,372
Why don't you tell me the Space
Force's response is to that?

973
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,543
Bring everybody back.
That's the job.

974
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,846
Chase!

975
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,347
Chase!

976
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:27,916
God...

977
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,992
Okay.

978
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:43,164
Come on.

979
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:45,268
They're not coming.

980
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:47,336
Then we're on our own.

981
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:50,606
Let's get off this planet.

982
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:12,927
Major, pilot Young
has reported

983
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:15,163
that they are under
attack by worms.

984
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,965
The worms were supposed
to be dormant now.

985
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,534
And?

986
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,304
And I'd like to request
a retrieval team.

987
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:23,972
Denied.

988
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,509
Sir, I'm aware that
retrieval squads

989
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:29,243
are not usually called
in for probation crews.

990
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:30,612
But under the circumstances...

991
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,347
They're no different.

992
00:57:32,414 --> 00:57:34,350
We'll recover the freighter
when the worms are dormant.

993
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:36,585
The crew's expendable.

994
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,018
Dismissed.

995
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:40,055
- Sir...
- Dismissed, Captain!

996
00:57:50,932 --> 00:57:53,835
Astrid? Ronnie? Rebecca?

997
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:55,604
Anybody? Come in! Over.

998
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,373
[static]

999
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,742
MOLV One, come in!
Can anybody hear me?

1000
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,611
[static]

1001
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:07,483
Okay, buddy.
We can't stay here much longer.

1002
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:09,719
We gotta move.

1003
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,820
How long was I out for?

1004
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:14,990
Not long, maybe an hour.

1005
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,027
Wish it had been longer.

1006
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,594
I was dreaming about
my Hawaiian honeymoon

1007
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:22,764
with my girl, Marilyn.
We were planning it for a while.

1008
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:23,766
For the pain.

1009
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:30,706
The air feels thicker.

1010
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:35,710
Oxygen levels are down.
CO2 is up.

1011
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:38,246
We need to try to get
to the freighter on our own.

1012
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:40,048
It's closer than the tug.

1013
00:58:40,114 --> 00:58:42,684
I can't do anything
with this bum leg.

1014
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:45,920
Here.

1015
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:47,123
Tie this around your waist.

1016
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:51,559
I can drop you down and
support you from up here.

1017
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:54,963
What about the worm?

1018
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,698
I haven't seen it in a while.

1019
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:59,201
Besides, we can't stay here.
The air is getting toxic.

1020
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,211
Oh, by the way, it's gonna hurt
a little bit on the way down.

1021
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:13,114
So do your best to keep
as quiet as you can.

1022
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,891
Okay. Slow?

1023
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:23,358
- Uh-huh.
- Go.

1024
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:28,329
Brad, there's a worm!
Pull me up!

1025
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:33,067
Brad, there's a worm. Brad!
Pull me up!

1026
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,971
[grunting]

1027
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:37,038
Brad!

1028
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,541
I got it! I got it!

1029
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:43,445
Got it!

1030
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:51,620
Maybe we can try again
in a little bit.

1031
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:54,389
No, we can't.
The worm knows we're here.

1032
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:57,892
It's just gonna wait us out.

1033
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,426
We're gonna die here.

1034
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:01,329
There's got to
be another way.

1035
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,831
We need to find another
way outta here.

1036
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:04,800
[hissing]

1037
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:09,171
The volcano's getting
ready to blow!

1038
01:00:09,237 --> 01:00:10,806
We have to get out of here!

1039
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:12,673
Those gases are toxic!

1040
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,675
Sulfur...

1041
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,878
I...

1042
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:18,413
[coughs]

1043
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,048
I can't breath!
We have to get outta here, Brad!

1044
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:22,485
Come on.

1045
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:29,423
What are you doing?

1046
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,358
If you fire that thing,
it's gonna cave in!

1047
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:33,494
I know.
That's exactly what I wanna do!

1048
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,864
I'm gonna create an air vent.

1049
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:37,266
Cover your head.

1050
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,573
[grunts]

1051
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:46,740
Look out!

1052
01:00:46,807 --> 01:00:48,610
[shouts]

1053
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:55,617
Well, there's that.

1054
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:57,186
Change of plans.

1055
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:01,956
We're going out
through the ceiling.

1056
01:01:02,023 --> 01:01:03,259
I can't climb.

1057
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,826
Well, you're gonna have to.

1058
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:24,112
All right.

1059
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:26,381
Hop on!
Hold tight!

1060
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:27,615
We're going up!

1061
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:45,233
I got an idea!

1062
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:49,038
[blows whistle]

1063
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:51,706
Hey! Over here!

1064
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:58,246
It's coming!
It's coming!

1065
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:08,623
[grunts]

1066
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:25,574
Come on!

1067
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:27,376
What? No!

1068
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:29,344
I'll stay right here,
thank you very much!

1069
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:30,878
Harley, the only way
we're gonna get back

1070
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,847
to the freighter is if
the worm takes us!

1071
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:37,150
I can control it with the hook!

1072
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:38,753
[grunts]

1073
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:43,858
See, I'm in control!

1074
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,396
Now skootch on down here
and get onboard!

1075
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:48,864
We don't have all day!

1076
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,012
Hold on to me!

1077
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:30,438
[grunts]

1078
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:37,079
Rebecca! Worm!

1079
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:39,714
Ah!

1080
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,148
No!

1081
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:44,152
No! Ah!

1082
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:45,753
[screaming]

1083
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:07,942
I'm so sorry.

1084
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,110
She was gonna get
us out of here.

1085
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:12,647
She was the only one
who knew how to fix the rig.

1086
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:15,349
It'll be okay.

1087
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:16,552
How is it gonna be okay?

1088
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:18,987
We're stuck here.

1089
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,159
Astrid's gonna come back

1090
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:26,095
and we're gonna figure out
how to get to the tug.

1091
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:29,465
This is not over.

1092
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:50,050
Yeah, I don't see any
movement around the tug.

1093
01:04:50,117 --> 01:04:51,452
Think we'll make it.

1094
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,855
How far is it?

1095
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:55,389
Not far.

1096
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:56,757
We'll have to make a run for it,

1097
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:58,492
but we gotta get out
of the sun anyway.

1098
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,027
I know.

1099
01:05:00,094 --> 01:05:04,132
Another day out here
in this sun and no water...

1100
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:08,003
Here.
Lean on me, all right?

1101
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,004
I'll guide you down.

1102
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:12,340
Watch where you put your foot!

1103
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:13,742
You okay?

1104
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:20,815
This would have been
my last mission.

1105
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:23,585
Yep.

1106
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:27,554
Harley and I were
supposed to get married

1107
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:29,290
when this one was done.

1108
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,862
He was ready to go home,
take up a teaching position.

1109
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:37,932
But I needed this one last run.

1110
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,503
He only came to be with me.

1111
01:05:41,568 --> 01:05:45,373
So... it's my fault
that we're here!

1112
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,642
You couldn't have known
this was gonna happen.

1113
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:51,111
You weren't told.
None of us was.

1114
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:54,983
Still...
Still, if it weren't for me,

1115
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:59,054
we would be on a beach
somewhere sipping Mai Tais!

1116
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:03,558
You got plenty of
beach out there.

1117
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:10,599
I guess this place is kind of
beautiful in its desolation.

1118
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:13,735
I think you been
in the sun too long.

1119
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:18,873
I guess it is their world,
after all.

1120
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,842
World full of worms.
Wonderful.

1121
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:26,047
Technically, I would put them
in the Hirudinea family.

1122
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,418
You know, leeches.

1123
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:32,921
Blood-sucking worms with teeth.

1124
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:35,523
Fantastic.
Giant worms that eat blood.

1125
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:41,697
You think your ship was
the one that woke 'em up?

1126
01:06:43,264 --> 01:06:46,902
Possibly, but I suspect
another cause.

1127
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,209
Yeah, we gotta pick up the pace.

1128
01:06:56,777 --> 01:06:58,812
We can't stay on
this rock.

1129
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,481
Is there anything else
you can tell me about

1130
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,184
these worms' detection method?

1131
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,219
I mean, sound?
Movement?

1132
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:05,420
Can they see us?

1133
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:07,221
Based on my observations,

1134
01:07:07,288 --> 01:07:10,190
they can sense ferrous
compounds, oxides and such.

1135
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:11,592
They seem to be
attracted to them.

1136
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:13,862
Yeah, they like rust.

1137
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,499
Simplistic, but yes,
as well as human hemoglobin.

1138
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:20,101
They also have some sort
of sensory system in their skin

1139
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:22,471
that allows them to
detect soundwaves

1140
01:07:22,536 --> 01:07:25,305
and ground vibrations.

1141
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:27,309
They can track us.

1142
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,810
Yeah.

1143
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:30,545
We gotta get off this rock.

1144
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:32,247
And we have to be
aggressive about it.

1145
01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:36,518
Do we have weapons?

1146
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,753
Not exactly.

1147
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,255
Maybe we can come up
with something.

1148
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:46,393
What you got in your backpack?

1149
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,929
Most of my equipment isn't
gonna be all that useful.

1150
01:07:48,996 --> 01:07:50,797
It's for collecting samples.

1151
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:52,366
Well, anything could help.

1152
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:54,503
What you got?

1153
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,239
Plastic petri dishes,
sample vials,

1154
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:00,275
Ph strips, funnels,

1155
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:05,914
test tubes, cork,
this glass bottle.

1156
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,148
- The sample vials?
- Yeah.

1157
01:08:08,215 --> 01:08:09,784
And this...

1158
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,322
Got anything flammable in there?

1159
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:15,824
This bio stain...

1160
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,893
and this fixative.

1161
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,994
Why?

1162
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,831
I'm gonna make a bomb...
or 10.

1163
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,670
[mumbling]

1164
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:11,379
So, that gets us
a total of 10.

1165
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:12,881
I hope it's enough.

1166
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:14,382
If you wanna hurt them,
aim for their mouths.

1167
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:17,418
Their hides are too tough.

1168
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:19,252
Honestly, I don't
wanna get close enough

1169
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:20,387
to hit their mouths.

1170
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:21,521
Just gonna be a distraction.

1171
01:09:21,588 --> 01:09:23,425
Gotcha.

1172
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,591
You ready?

1173
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:27,094
No, but let's do this anyway.

1174
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,871
We're gonna make it!

1175
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:46,681
I think you're just
making it angry.

1176
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:50,116
Just buying us time!

1177
01:09:50,184 --> 01:09:51,186
Go!

1178
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:59,261
- Oh, it's the mother!
- Run!

1179
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:15,609
She's too big!

1180
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:17,612
She'll tear this ship
open like a tuna can!

1181
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,314
I know.
I'll get us airborne.

1182
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,449
We'll get the others,
we'll get off this planet!

1183
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:22,917
[crash]

1184
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:26,654
Mayday! Mayday!
To all rescue crew of MOLV One!

1185
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,322
Over!

1186
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:33,261
We're on our way!

1187
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,297
Mayday! Mayday!
Lieutenant Young to Base.

1188
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:36,932
We need immediate rescue!

1189
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:42,237
Captain Chase, come in!
We need immediate rescue now!

1190
01:10:44,171 --> 01:10:45,439
Hold on.

1191
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,751
We're losing fuel.

1192
01:10:56,818 --> 01:10:58,520
Can we make it
to the freighter?

1193
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:01,923
No. We're losing it too quick.
I gotta set her back down.

1194
01:11:01,988 --> 01:11:03,390
I got a plan, though.

1195
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:09,796
What is all that stuff?

1196
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:11,364
It's an abandon-ship
survival kit

1197
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:13,167
just in case my plan
doesn't work.

1198
01:11:13,234 --> 01:11:14,568
Plan? What plan?

1199
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:16,271
You'll see.

1200
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:41,662
This was your plan?

1201
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:43,597
The ship will explode!

1202
01:11:43,664 --> 01:11:45,399
That is the plan. Jump!

1203
01:12:15,529 --> 01:12:16,764
What was that?

1204
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,599
Our ride home.

1205
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,235
We're stranded.

1206
01:12:20,301 --> 01:12:21,803
Your crew?

1207
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:23,737
And my team?

1208
01:12:23,804 --> 01:12:25,105
Marilyn?

1209
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,476
Not Astrid.

1210
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:29,911
She's tougher than that.

1211
01:12:31,345 --> 01:12:33,515
Come on, Astrid, don't be dead.

1212
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:38,886
[coughing]

1213
01:12:41,088 --> 01:12:43,390
The air's getting thinner.

1214
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:47,896
The fire, the explosion,
it's eating up all the oxygen.

1215
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:49,797
Here.

1216
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:50,931
What about you?

1217
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:52,634
I'm okay.
Just take it!

1218
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,502
- No, I can't take your last bit.
- Just take it, Marilyn!

1219
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,371
Let me feel like
I'm doing my job!

1220
01:13:00,306 --> 01:13:01,876
<i>Space Force rescue unit 4A,</i>

1221
01:13:01,943 --> 01:13:03,478
<i>you are not clear
for departure.</i>

1222
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,648
<i>Cut engines and
return to base.</i>

1223
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,516
That's a noncompliance, base.

1224
01:13:08,582 --> 01:13:12,586
One of our own is stranded,
and I'm going in as backup.

1225
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,055
Over.

1226
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:15,690
<i>Captain Chase,
this is Major Hawkins.</i>

1227
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:18,960
You are in direct violation
of Protocol Number 127...

1228
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:26,167
Wow, that is so weird
being on the other side

1229
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:27,601
of that conversation.

1230
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,551
It didn't even work!

1231
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,489
What have I done?

1232
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:50,591
Oh, my God, I shouldn't
even be here!

1233
01:13:52,893 --> 01:13:54,395
I shouldn't even be here!

1234
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:59,065
God, why can't
I just follow orders?

1235
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:01,001
Just do what
people expect of me?

1236
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:04,605
That's not what good people do.

1237
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,139
Oh, yeah?

1238
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,209
You think good people leave
their crew for dead

1239
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:10,344
just to go off
and play super hero?

1240
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,279
No.

1241
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:14,448
No, Rebecca was right!
I'm a reckless pilot!

1242
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,052
Now they're all
paying the price!

1243
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:24,024
Look, Harley and I wouldn't even
be here if it wasn't for you!

1244
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:27,027
And if I'm not mistaken,
there's an entire crew out there

1245
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:29,029
that is waiting
for someone

1246
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:30,998
to get them off of
this planet.

1247
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,470
Maybe even someone
a little reckless.

1248
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,282
Okay, you're right.

1249
01:14:58,926 --> 01:15:00,361
We're gonna suffocate

1250
01:15:00,426 --> 01:15:02,029
and you're worried about
a couple of boo-boos?

1251
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,167
Oh, my God!

1252
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,838
I know it hurts,
you big baby.

1253
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:11,072
Not that. Look!

1254
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,907
It's... It's Marilyn!

1255
01:15:13,974 --> 01:15:15,143
Marilyn!

1256
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,015
Where's the team?

1257
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,585
I'm sorry, Harley.

1258
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:27,554
I'm glad they're back,

1259
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:30,157
but that tug was our
ride out of here.

1260
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,059
We've got nothing.

1261
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:35,997
Even if we fight off the worms,
we're gonna run out of air.

1262
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:38,365
Whoa!

1263
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,896
It's a Space Force
Rescue Ship!

1264
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:11,432
Hey! We're over here!

1265
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,203
MOLV One team!

1266
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,438
This is Captain Chase
with Space Force!

1267
01:16:17,505 --> 01:16:20,675
Prepare for extraction
and rescue!

1268
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,449
Looks like someone
broke the rules!

1269
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,355
Hey, where's Rebecca?

1270
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:45,867
Okay, come on!

1271
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:52,006
Everybody hold on!

1272
01:16:52,072 --> 01:16:53,608
Buckle up!

1273
01:16:57,144 --> 01:16:58,512
We gotta move.

1274
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,286
Look out!

1275
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:15,363
We lost one of our thrusters.

1276
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,631
I can't get any higher.

1277
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:20,501
We need something to take
this thing out permanently!

1278
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:22,869
We've got missiles!
Use them!

1279
01:17:22,936 --> 01:17:24,204
I did.

1280
01:17:24,271 --> 01:17:25,840
This is a rescue ship,
not a fighter.

1281
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,307
We're empty.

1282
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,309
But we're not entirely
out of options.

1283
01:17:29,376 --> 01:17:31,746
Brad, open that red case
on the floor.

1284
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,485
I was hoping for a bazooka.

1285
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:40,387
I didn't have time to steal one.

1286
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:42,657
It's a timed fusion grenade.

1287
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:45,059
It'll blow a hole in
the side of that worm.

1288
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,226
So how do I deploy it?

1289
01:17:46,293 --> 01:17:47,994
It's a time delay.

1290
01:17:48,061 --> 01:17:49,730
Set the timer and throw it.

1291
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:52,500
Get us in the air!
I'll deploy it!

1292
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:55,735
If I get us up in the air,
we are just leaving.

1293
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:57,305
I like that plan better.

1294
01:17:57,371 --> 01:17:58,873
Everybody please hold on.

1295
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,813
Go, go, go, go!

1296
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,282
Working on it!

1297
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:10,250
We're still too low!

1298
01:18:10,317 --> 01:18:12,319
Brad, give me that!

1299
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,430
Bon appetit!

1300
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,202
It's pulling us down!

1301
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:34,475
5-0 seconds and counting!

1302
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:36,244
Very much aware, Lieutenant.

1303
01:18:42,882 --> 01:18:44,050
Ah!

1304
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:45,486
Chase!

1305
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:52,760
We need maximum thrust!

1306
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:54,694
Astrid, no!
The ship's about to break apart!

1307
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:57,597
The bomb is gonna detonate!
Do it!

1308
01:18:57,664 --> 01:18:59,533
Pushing thrusters to 100%!

1309
01:19:04,037 --> 01:19:05,705
It's not enough!

1310
01:19:05,773 --> 01:19:07,542
Astrid, it's clamping down
and breaking the ship apart!

1311
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:08,842
That's all we've got!

1312
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:10,310
No, we can get more.

1313
01:19:10,377 --> 01:19:11,679
The thrusters are maxed out!

1314
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:14,213
Yeah, but I'm gonna
super-charge it!

1315
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,682
Get the controls!

1316
01:20:00,594 --> 01:20:02,762
We're headed straight
for a volcano!

1317
01:20:02,829 --> 01:20:03,930
Pull up!

1318
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:08,469
Astrid, Chase is still out.

1319
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:13,507
She's not breathing.

1320
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:17,011
Come on, Captain,
Stay with me.

1321
01:20:19,145 --> 01:20:20,913
Come on, Captain! We been
fighting the worms all day!

1322
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,649
You can handle
a bump on the head!

1323
01:20:24,952 --> 01:20:26,387
Come on, Chase.

1324
01:20:26,453 --> 01:20:28,088
You broke the rules
to save us.

1325
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:30,692
Now I just need you to wake up
so I can say I told you so!

1326
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:40,233
At least let me
to say I'm sorry!

1327
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,636
[gasps]

1328
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,478
I never gave up on you.

1329
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:52,980
I know.

1330
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:54,548
Oh, what...

1331
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:56,818
Hang onto something.
It's gonna get rough.

1332
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:03,123
The volcano is about to erupt!
Altitude 100,000 feet!

1333
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,430
- Maximum thrusters?
- Max thrusters.

1334
01:21:16,737 --> 01:21:17,872
Hold on.

1335
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:30,118
We're clear.

1336
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:43,664
Space Force,
this is pilot Astrid Young.

1337
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,599
We are clear of Planet Dune,

1338
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:48,235
looking for
homeward escort to Earth.

1339
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:50,337
<i>Pilot Young, this is
Space Force command.</i>

1340
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:51,972
<i>You are cleared for escort.</i>

1341
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:55,809
Ship manifest, we have
lost one member of our crew,

1342
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,578
five members of the freighter,

1343
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:01,582
the tug ship and the freighter.

1344
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:05,385
<i>Pilot Young, this is
Major Hawkins.</i>

1345
01:22:05,452 --> 01:22:09,222
<i>We're glad to hear there are
survivors from the freighter.</i>

1346
01:22:09,288 --> 01:22:10,425
<i>Your probation is complete.</i>

1347
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:12,592
Thank you, sir.

1348
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:14,961
<i>Congratulations, Lieutenant.</i>

1349
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:16,931
<i>I'm pleased to inform
you you're being reinstated</i>

1350
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:17,965
<i>to Rescue Team.</i>

1351
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,432
<i>We're happy to have you back.</i>

1352
01:22:19,498 --> 01:22:23,069
Yeah, I'm happy to be back, sir.

1353
01:22:23,136 --> 01:22:24,637
I thought...

1354
01:22:24,704 --> 01:22:26,606
Because of the cosmonaut,
I thought I was in trouble.

1355
01:22:26,673 --> 01:22:28,274
<i>Quite the opposite.</i>

1356
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:30,277
<i>Vasily Petrakov isn't
just any Russian.</i>

1357
01:22:30,344 --> 01:22:33,213
<i>He's a national hero who
designed new solar panels</i>

1358
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,381
<i>that improve power grids 200%.</i>

1359
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:37,617
<i>They weren't going to share
that tech with us,</i>

1360
01:22:37,684 --> 01:22:40,621
<i>but thanks to you
diplomatic relations</i>

1361
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:42,657
<i>with Russia are ongoing.</i>

1362
01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:44,056
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

1363
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:46,859
Yeah, Major, sir.

1364
01:22:46,926 --> 01:22:50,797
You did the right thing.
We're a better division for it.

1365
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,902
Thank you, sir.

1366
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:04,177
I'm gonna need a crew
when we get home.

1367
01:23:04,244 --> 01:23:07,314
You in?

1368
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:08,716
It'd be an honor.

1369
01:23:12,252 --> 01:23:13,219
Brad?

1370
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:14,655
You know it.

1371
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:16,157
I don't wanna be working
tug ships forever.

1372
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:18,993
Captain Chase?

1373
01:23:19,926 --> 01:23:21,828
I'll put in a request.

1374
01:23:21,895 --> 01:23:24,131
I think it'll be approved.

1375
01:23:24,197 --> 01:23:25,666
All right.

1376
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:27,502
Now let's get home
and save some lives.

1377
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,016
Can we at least
take a shower first?

1378
01:23:46,756 --> 01:23:51,756
