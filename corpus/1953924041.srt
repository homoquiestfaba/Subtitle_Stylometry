1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,538
You fuckin son-of-a-bitch!

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,636
You're not even human!

3
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:11,643
Who made Ji-young and
Eun-joo bitter enemies?

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,838
You fuckin son of a bitch!

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,240
Stop them!

6
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,552
How dare you try to
sneak off by yourself!?

7
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,144
It is my fault and that's why
I cant' bear to stay here anymore!

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,156
It's your fault they're both dead!

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,055
Just what do you think
you're doing?

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:37,126
Kyung-min, what's wrong?!

11
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,533
You all right?

12
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,040
Look at here.

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,140
- Kyung-min!
- Breathe slowly, slowly.

14
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,846
Slowly, slowly.

15
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,555
What's wrong! Kyung-min!

16
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,628
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Ko Kyung-min!

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,133
Thoracotomy.

18
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:15,732
It isn't a hack job,
this was a bona fide surgery.

19
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:19,539
The breast bone and pectoral muscles
were cut without hesitation.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,639
This is the work of a pro.

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:27,049
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

22
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,335
Do you think it's true
what Kyung-min said?

23
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,034
That this is all because I messed
with the cadaver?

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,343
That's what caused people to die
and Kyung-min to go crazy?

25
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:12,125
Ki-bum, I want to hear
what you have to say.

26
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,235
<i>The driver who was missed
is founded in couple of days.</i>

27
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:27,541
Ki-bum, you told me to
follow my heart, right?

28
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,050
<i>The heart influences
the movement of the body.</i>

29
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,746
<i>The heart is influenced by
outside waves.</i>

30
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,256
<i>When a person's state of mind
and body are weakened,</i>

31
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,360
<i>and the brain waves encounter
certain types of waves,</i>

32
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,929
a person can commit
the most heinous act...

33
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,622
What do you mean?

34
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,029
I've seen this happen before.

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,536
And these people have one thing
in common. They don't remember anything

36
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,039
and they all claim that
someone's trying to choke them.

37
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,939
They usually try to hurt themselves
and others.

38
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:01,138
Are you saying only Eun-joo's prints
were found on the scalpel

39
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:07,653
because an evil spirit had possessed her
and forced her to do that to herself?

40
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,050
Well,

41
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,656
whoever did it.

42
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,422
We may find ourselves alone
in the autopsy classroom

43
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,021
like Eun-joo and Ji-young.

44
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,429
Hey you!

45
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,536
You looking at me?

46
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,639
- I've been there like three times!
- Stop, Myung-ja.

47
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:30,836
I just came out of the grave, fuck!

48
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:34,846
I dare you! Assholes!

49
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,540
But we can'tjust let this go, right?

50
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,050
We can't take this just lying down.

51
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,451
Professor Han.

52
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,317
Do you ever regret it?

53
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,723
You're asking me this now?

54
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:58,027
I said this before, truth passes us by.
But faith preceeds us.

55
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:02,836
That faith is starting to suffocate
us all.

56
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,239
Two students have already died

57
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,142
and they were both sutured together
as if Yoon-ho did it himself.

58
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:15,051
But it's nothing compared to what
you did to me back then.

59
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,051
Just what are you trying to say?

60
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,524
Guess you'll just have to
wait and see.

61
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,352
The heart is missing.

62
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,049
Who could have done this?
And why?

63
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,253
You think it was some organ
smuggling attempt?

64
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,319
Lift her hand.

65
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,941
What are you doing here?

66
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,141
So you think the spirit of
this dead woman has killed two students

67
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,448
because she's out for revenge?

68
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,122
There's no proof yet but the cadaver is
definitely the key in this case.

69
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,126
There's no record of her at all and

70
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,124
all the victims have
the same scar as her...

71
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,133
Her name is Yoo-kyung SUH,
26 years old.

72
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,336
She signed over her organs before death.
We have her paperwork

73
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,132
and her family's consent
so that's why we have her cadaver.

74
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:24,242
The reason
there's no record of her is that

75
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,944
I turned over the originals to the police.

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,855
I understand your concern and fear.

77
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,357
But acting like a bunch of
superstitious fools is not becoming of

78
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,722
future medical doctors.

79
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,423
Do not become a disgrace to our
profession and our school.

80
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,527
But we've all been having
the same nightmares.

81
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,131
If we are bound to help those
in pain then what if the spirit

82
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,637
in our dreams needs.

83
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,638
So that's why you're a necrophilia.

84
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,037
What?

85
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,738
Weren't you treated in highschool
for showing unnatural attachment

86
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,444
for corpses and were diagnosed

87
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,045
with high possibility of
developing necrophilia?

88
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,756
That, that was...

89
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:10,330
The police are on this, you kids
need to get back to your books.

90
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,931
Now get out of here.

91
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:17,335
Sun-hwa! Sun-hwa!
It's not true!

92
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,536
I told you.
My father owned a funeral home

93
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,338
and I became used to seeing him work.
My mom didn't like that

94
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,539
and that's why she sent me to
therapy.

95
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,944
Ki-bum,

96
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:39,158
I don't think I know you anymore.

97
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,443
<i>We may one day find ourselves alone
in the autopsy classroom.</i>

98
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,233
Sun-hwa!

99
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,138
Sun-hwa, are you OK? Sun-hwa?
Wake up! Wake up Sun-hwa!

100
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,741
You all right?

101
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:52,639
Wow, you're pretty strong.
I'm pretty heavy.

102
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,940
I've been working out for a day
like this.

103
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,447
- Ki-bum.
- Huh?

104
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:03,545
Mentally disturbed is similar to
being possessed, right?

105
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,057
I'm not crazy!
Are you drunk?

106
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,929
I'm not drunk...

107
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,426
- Ki-bum.
- Huh?

108
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:17,735
I'm saying this for the first time,

109
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,436
but my father's like that too.

110
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,837
Like what?

111
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:28,642
My father's in the mental ward too.

112
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,745
I see.

113
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,651
But he was a great father.

114
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:39,248
So sweet and caring. Like you.

115
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,924
What happened to being sick of it.

116
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:47,923
But he's a serious case now.

117
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:56,432
'Cause you know what,
he killed my mom.

118
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:06,551
And I almost died in his hands too.

119
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:15,219
My father, the sweetest man,
still doesn't know what he's done.

120
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:29,335
That's why I keep having dreams of
being choked by him.

121
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:42,445
I keep thinking
that all these deaths have to do with him.

122
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,921
I'm so scared... I...

123
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,222
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I promise you.

124
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,927
Nothing's going to happen to you.

125
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,537
Trust me, OK?

126
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,339
- Ki-bum.
- Huh?

127
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,045
Let me down.

128
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,758
I'm sleepy.

129
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,836
Ki-bum,

130
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,638
Have you been up all night?

131
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,340
Did you sleep ok?

132
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,120
Do you recognize him?

133
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:04,128
We have to find him.
He's probably dead though.

134
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,037
Sun-hwa, what's the 'cut' order?

135
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,446
Is that her last known address?

136
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,646
Where is that?

137
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,851
Like you don't know.

138
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:31,230
- What do you mean?
- It's a red light district.

139
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,524
What?

140
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,126
Hey, print this out for me.

141
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,635
Hey, Ki-bum.

142
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,639
I'm with my friend, Hyung-jin.

143
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,934
Listen to this!

144
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,238
The Technician, that slime ball
lied to us.

145
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,347
Yoo-kyung Suh, my ass.

146
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,244
Her name is Yoo-mi Jung.

147
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:56,044
And you know what?
She died 20 years ago.

148
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:07,322
She was admitted here
20 years ago.

149
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,628
How do you remember her?

150
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,738
Where did you get this photo?

151
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,238
It's our class's cadaver.

152
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,935
What? Your cadaver?

153
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,342
Do you know who this is?

154
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,447
That's Yoon-ho Suh.

155
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,953
Yoon-ho was the most talented doctor
of us all but he didn't get

156
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:35,721
the recognition he deserved
because of people's misconceptions.

157
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,922
I think because of that, he took
a special interest in this woman

158
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,930
who was a deaf mute.

159
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,229
<i>He told me several times that
he was going to leave with her.</i>

160
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,435
<i>So when he disappeared,
I figured that he'd left with her.</i>

161
00:16:55,381 --> 00:17:00,444
Yoo-mi couldn't even express herself.

162
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,352
I dreamt about her.

163
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,152
I'm so sad.

164
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,722
I need to be free.
I need help.

165
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:17,225
The Technician's probably the one
that removed her heart in the first place.

166
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,134
There's something wrong about him.

167
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:24,937
I know he's been threatening my dad.

168
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,446
You mean Professor Han?

169
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,139
Let's go search his office.

170
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,156
There's nothing.

171
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,725
What do these vengeful spirits
want from us?

172
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,423
We've cut open a body
that harbors an angry spirit.

173
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,233
Did it work?

174
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,436
These are hearts...

175
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,045
What has he been doing?

176
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,238
Artificial heart.

177
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,734
Look at this shit.

178
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,033
What's this?

179
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,742
She was here?

180
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:20,515
That asshole turned her over to us
to get rid of the corpse.

181
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:29,230
I will consider the health and
well-being of patients as my first priority.

182
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:34,736
I will practice medicine
conscientiously and with dignity.

183
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,244
And even under duress,

184
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,438
I will not use my knowledge
in an unethical manner.

185
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,640
You all right?

186
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:52,649
We're not immune from this.

187
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:57,729
We may someday become as ruthless
and cold-blooded as this.

188
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,927
Sun-hwa, you want to go find her?

189
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,032
Do you think anyone will remember
back that far?

190
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,439
Our lives depend on this,
we have to find out.

191
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,139
You all right?

192
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,347
I won't go that easily! Fuck!

193
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:46,143
She lived here 20 years ago.
Do you recognize her?

194
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,337
Here...

195
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:53,246
Why do I look that old?

196
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:58,050
By the way,
what happened to her 20 years ago?

197
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,337
Hey little sis,
what are you doing here?

198
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,939
No, nothing...

199
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,243
Not bad but could use more make-up.

200
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,644
Hey you!

201
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,949
- Ki-bum, no!
- Why you!

202
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,449
Hey!

203
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,122
Sun-hwa!

204
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,624
- Sun-hwa!
- Sun-hwa!

205
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,138
Sun-hwa!

206
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,536
Sun-hwa!

207
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,345
You gonna pay for that water you
lousy bitch?

208
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,346
Try having some customers that
runneth over! You lousy bitch!

209
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,431
Sun-hwa!

210
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,636
Sun-hwa!

211
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,144
All the men in this neighborhood are
her daddies.

212
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,746
Who knows which one?

213
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,419
She thought this was the world and
gave out to whoever,

214
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,926
whenever...

215
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:24,330
<i>Then one day, she resisted
a real jerk-off and he stabbed her.</i>

216
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,829
Hello? Yes, it's Ki-bum.

217
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,234
Sun-hwa is somewhere else.

218
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:06,539
Yes. What? How?
Okay, yes.

219
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,747
- What? What happened?
- Kyung-min's disappeared.

220
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:11,941
What?

221
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:16,748
Sun-hwa's father had a seizure and
while they were tending to him,

222
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,447
he vanished.

223
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,921
Fuck.

224
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,618
Sun-hwa's still in danger.

225
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,324
Where the hell is she?

226
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,932
Penny for your thoughts.

227
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,137
My dear friend!

228
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,240
What's up?
Got some good news?

229
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,541
Meeting with an old friend is
good indeed.

230
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,743
You, me and Yoon-ho,
we were tight.

231
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,251
Let's drink for old times' sake.

232
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,126
<i>She was so quiet and couldn't talk,</i>

233
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,422
<i>so I don't know
what got into her That day.</i>

234
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:03,533
<i>She was like an angry animal,
fighting all the while she was bleeding.</i>

235
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,534
<i>The good-for-nothing
bums here got scared and left her</i>

236
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,041
<i>for dead at the hospital.</i>

237
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,550
<i>That was her first time out
in the real world.</i>

238
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,523
- Grab her arms, we need to move her!
- Yes.

239
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,427
- Miss, Miss!
- She's bleeding too much.

240
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,227
Get the E.R. Ready!

241
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,325
I know what you're going through.

242
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,325
You must have thought this through,
butjust give it another minute.

243
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:13,529
Everyone in this hospital is going through
a tough time.

244
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:14,537
Calm down!

245
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,040
We can't let you die here.

246
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:19,637
Doctor!

247
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:45,834
<i>If what we'd heard was right,
she was better off there than here.</i>

248
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,936
<i>Doctors are there to treat
those who hurt.</i>

249
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,246
- Was someone here?
- The Chief.

250
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,443
We had a drink
since you were late.

251
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,646
But he left at exactly 11 PM.

252
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,623
Wants to spend time with the Missus.

253
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,621
Really?

254
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,722
It's been 20 years, right?

255
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,333
Since you and the Chief got
so much attention for inventing

256
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,936
the first artificial heart.

257
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:23,633
What brought this up?

258
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,040
Why, do you regret anything?

259
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,048
No, not at all.

260
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,650
They were the most meaningful times
as a doctor.

261
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:41,026
It takes balls to commit murder
in the name of faith.

262
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,627
Just what have you heard?

263
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,527
The Chief said so.

264
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,529
He said
the nightmares opened his eyes.

265
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,934
Nightmare? What nightmare?

266
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,934
This is reality, not a dream!

267
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:01,240
We did inflate the facts,
you know that.

268
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,838
You made me believe you'd support me!
Now you sneak behind my back...

269
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:09,148
The other side joined hands with
the engineers and had superficial success.

270
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,051
In a backward country like ours,
it's enough to make those

271
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,249
bureaucrats stand up
and make a fuss.

272
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,029
We don't have much time, right?

273
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,936
Bone saw.

274
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,846
What are you doing?

275
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,654
Give me that!

276
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,022
- No!
- Let go now!

277
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,220
- No!
- Now!

278
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,332
Are you all crazy?

279
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,230
- Yoo-mi!
- This is none of your business.

280
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,432
Bone saw.

281
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,337
Bring the artificial heart.

282
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,947
What, what's wrong?

283
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,646
So were you both successful?

284
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,345
The patient died but we found
a crucial flaw in that surgery.

285
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:58,047
That wasn't surgery.
It was an experiment.

286
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:03,018
More than a thousand lives were
saved because of her.

287
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:07,029
She was suicidal to begin with
and she was a prostitute!

288
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:18,740
One day, Yoon-ho showed me
his shriveled leg.

289
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,741
A disease from heaven
he can bear with as fate.

290
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,647
But a disease from another person is
hard to overcome and harder to cure.

291
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,451
My work is to help them.

292
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:38,320
They may be dead...
but there's work to be done.

293
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,730
This also involves your sister.

294
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,844
She's already dead,
this has nothing to do with her.

295
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,147
I know it will be hard on Sun-hwa
when she finds out the truth.

296
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,447
But it's better than dying for the sins
you both committed.

297
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,556
I'm not talking about the surgery!

298
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,127
Think! Doesn't Sun-hwa remind you
of someone? So smart, so sharp?

299
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:24,135
Yes, don't worry too much.

300
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,739
He hasn't shown up at his house.
Damn!

301
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:32,339
What's he up to?
What's he trying to do?

302
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,452
Kyung-min's a good guy!

303
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,646
It's not a matter of good or bad!

304
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,020
Did you ever notice anything?

305
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:46,131
Nothing before the outburst.

306
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,332
- But why did he do that?
- Do what?

307
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,738
Why did he have a relapse?

308
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,442
You think the Technician's possessed?

309
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,542
That's right. The way they were killed.
TThink about the sutures.

310
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,148
He's not the Technician for nothing.

311
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:16,025
He was the first one to encounter
the spirit of that woman!

312
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:41,446
We made history together, right?

313
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,855
You...

314
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,425
We worked so hard, right?

315
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,719
Professor Han!

316
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,729
I think faith is a tool that
supports the truth.

317
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:59,236
Is the truth what you were after
when you abandoned me to

318
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,532
join the engineers?

319
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,436
It was because of what we did.

320
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,545
We committed an abominable crime.

321
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:10,243
We'll see about that...

322
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:15,745
Letting the truth out now
doesn't erase the curse.

323
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,049
If you really have a conscience,

324
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,125
then you should will yourself
to die like the others did.

325
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,538
That asshole Han will pay for this.

326
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,345
I don't know about this.

327
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,546
What do you mean?
We're going to the classroom.

328
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,824
- You think Sun-hwa will be there?
- Of course.

329
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,719
And Kyung-min may show up too.

330
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,624
Fuck, what was the order again?

331
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,530
But last time, it happened
in her room.

332
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,737
You're starting to look like
a cadaver to me.

333
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,036
You think you look any better,
ass wipe?

334
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,441
You ready to rock and roll?

335
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,347
Fuck ya. Let's split up.
I'm going to the dorms this time!

336
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,227
Sun-hwa!

337
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:49,730
Sun-hwa! Sun-hwa! Are you OK?
Sun-hwa Min!

338
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,739
It's you...

339
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:01,945
It's me, Ki-bum! You'll be okay.
You'll be fine.

340
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:07,816
Do you trust me?

341
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,023
Yes, I trust you. I believe you.
So please get up!

342
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:24,234
No! Sun-hwa!
Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!

343
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:28,142
Get up! Sun-hwa!

344
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,547
Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!
Get up! Sun-hwa!

345
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:40,247
Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!
Get up! Sun-hwa!

346
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:42,044
It's over... It's over now.

347
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,524
<i>I didn't do it! It wasn't me!</i>

348
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,123
Ji-young wanted to
get out of there!

349
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,025
Vagus! Solius!

350
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,531
She was there all alone!

351
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,536
Deltoid! Plantaris Tendon!

352
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,538
You're alone too!

353
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,541
Sub-clauvis! Hyper-cena!

354
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:34,020
No, no, no!

355
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,923
I know who you're with!

356
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:43,924
Ventricle! Thorachotomy!

357
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:50,030
We're all gonna die right?
All five of us!

358
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,739
One! Two!

359
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:57,839
Three! Four!

360
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,450
Five!

361
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,947
Thorachotomy!

362
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,520
You did it!

363
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:15,226
You killed them!

364
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,020
Father!

365
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,028
Sun-hwa. Sun-hwa, please!

366
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:06,632
<i>And these people have one thing in
common. They don't remember anything</i>

367
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,338
<i>and they all claim that someone's
trying to choke them.</i>

368
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:16,249
<i>That's why I keep having dreams of
being choked by him.</i>

369
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,319
No, my father couldn't have.
He wouldn't have... That's not him.

370
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,330
My father is a good doctor.

371
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:44,640
Kyung-min, my father...

372
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:19,235
Date, October 27, 1985.
Sunday, 5pm.

373
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:24,540
Surgery, insertion of pace-maker
in the left ventricle

374
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,644
and prevention of blood clot.

375
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:28,336
Sun-hwa.

376
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:33,949
Patient name, Yoo-mi Jung.

377
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:40,249
Surgeons on call,
Ji-woo Han and Sang-hun Park.

378
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,619
I know that.

379
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,526
It wasn't easy for me either.

380
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:55,536
I always carried the burden of
what I did.

381
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:01,343
We never anticipated the outcome.
No one did.

382
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:10,050
But it's over now.
We can get over this,

383
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,115
right?

384
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,319
You'll be fine.

385
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:27,329
Everything will be okay.
Give me the papers.

386
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:39,944
Sun-hwa, do you know who I am?

387
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,947
- I'm your...
- There's two things you don't know.

388
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,826
First,

389
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:55,128
doctors are supposed to help people.

390
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:57,432
Second,

391
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,028
I am here precisely
because I am your daughter.

392
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,335
Sun-hwa.

393
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,844
You should have never had me.

394
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:18,545
I don't need a father!

395
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:21,945
<i>Why are you so good to me?</i>

396
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:27,417
<i>Because I want to.
It makes me happy.</i>

397
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:34,924
<i>You're a good person.
But I'm not good for you.</i>

398
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:40,333
<i>I don't want to make you unhappy.</i>

399
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:46,134
<i>Happiness is not easy to find.</i>

400
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:53,244
<i>It's not a goal but it is what it is.
And it isn't easy to achieve.</i>

401
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:58,948
<i>But I have it when I'm with you.</i>

402
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:06,526
<i>I have no right to love you.</i>

403
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:14,533
<i>Look at me.</i>

404
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:19,538
<i>Look at my leg.</i>

405
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:42,625
<i>I had a nightmare
last night.</i>

406
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:49,629
My heart hurts.

407
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:59,540
I need your help.

408
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,550
Ki-bum.

409
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:42,119
I'm sorry for not accepting you before.

410
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:52,330
I guess I didn't know how I felt.

411
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,044
But...

412
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:54,229
<i>But I've been waiting for this moment
to pick up the scalpel again.</i>
