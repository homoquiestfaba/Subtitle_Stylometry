3
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,480
Kathy, we're going to be late.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,180
KATHY: You want me to look
 good for you, don't you?

5
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,850
Please wear something sexy.

6
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,140
KATHY: What was that?

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,660
I said we were supposed
 to be there by 6:00.

8
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,810
KATHY: All ready.

9
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,490
Let's go.

10
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,770
Well?

11
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,670
Well, what?

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,350
How does it look?

13
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,910
How does what look?

14
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,480
The dress, silly.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,690
I just got it today.

16
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,340
JIM: Oh, great.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,110
It looks great.

18
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,810
KATHY: It better.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,520
It cost me $200.

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,620
What?

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,790
For that thing?

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,410
Well, it's-- it's handmade.

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,210
By Amish handmaidens?

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,400
No, it was made in Utah.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,900
JIM: Well, that explains it.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,360
They spent $200 on
 all that fabric.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,140
What's that supposed to mean?

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,280
You could make five
 dresses out of all that.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,820
It leaves everything
 to the imagination.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,810
What?

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,790
It's not attractive?

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,990
It's fine.

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,430
Come on, dear, we got to go.

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,300
No, wait.

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,370
You don't find me
 attractive in this dress?

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,140
JIM: I think that you're
 the most beautiful woman

37
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,210
on the face of this planet.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,930
Really?

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,200
Really.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,600
But if I was Adam and you
 were Eve in that dress,

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,150
the apple would be very safe.

42
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,920
But the old lady at the
 boutique said it was pretty.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,620
Bingo.

44
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,150
JIM: Oh, did you see Bill?

45
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,470
The guy has no tact.

46
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,120
When he started talking
 about the Joneses,

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,380
I just about died laughing.

48
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,470
And then Susie, she
 really made a scene, huh?

49
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,730
What's wrong?

50
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,680
Are you OK?

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,610
What do you think
 about Melissa?

52
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, she's nice.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,160
I spoke to her a lot tonight.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,920
Oh really?

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,620
About what.

56
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,960
You think she's pretty.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,820
Sure, everyone does.

58
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,050
But it doesn't mean anything.

59
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,130
Well, she flaunted it enough.

60
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,620
JIM: She didn't flaunt at all.

61
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,540
She was dressed very sexy.

62
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,100
Well, then take her
 to the next party.

63
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,820
What's wrong with you?

64
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,270
What you talking about?

65
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,130
Nothing, just forget it.

66
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,360
Come on, what is it?

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,310
Well, everybody was
 coming up and telling

68
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,240
her how great she looked.

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,170
So?

70
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,080
I was standing
 right next to her.

71
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh, well.

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,950
She dresses very sexy.

73
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,350
It gets a lot of attention.

74
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,070
Oh, so if I wore my
 underwear instead of a dress,

75
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,340
I'd be noticed, too?

76
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,230
It wasn't underwear.

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,150
Was just a very nice outfit.

78
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,550
You should try it sometime.

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,400
SANDY: So, how was
 the party last night?

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,150
KATHY: OK, I guess.

81
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,930
OK?

82
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,100
Thought it was supposed to be
 the social event of the year.

83
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,390
Sandy, do I dress sexy?

84
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,090
What?

85
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,160
What kind of question is that?

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,140
Be honest.

87
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,460
Of course not.

88
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,230
What?

89
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,390
Well, you wanted
 me to be honest.

90
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,830
I don't dress sexy ever?

91
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,730
Hm.

92
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,430
Let's see.

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,050
All right.

94
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,550
Maybe.

95
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,580
Not.

96
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,120
Let's just face it,
 you're very conservative.

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,060
No, I'm not.

98
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,430
Oh, what's this?

99
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,250
Oh, I think there's
 hope for you yet.

100
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,920
That's not mine.

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,620
Oops.

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,290
There must be a mistake.

103
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,790
Maybe he got it
 for you as a gift.

104
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,760
I don't have
 anything like this.

105
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,860
Then whose could it be?

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,970
There must be a good
 explanation for this.

107
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,670
Right.

108
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,740
Like maybe you got it mixed up
 at the laundromat or something.

109
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,720
I do my laundry here.

110
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,390
Oh.

111
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,080
Right.

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,390
Well, maybe Jim's
 a cross-dresser.

113
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,370
Oh, OK.

114
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,080
Gee.

115
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,780
Look at the time.

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,750
I have to do some laundry.

117
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,450
See you.

118
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,110
Why don't you just tell her?

119
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,670
Get it over with.

120
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,560
In time.

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,460
I got to be careful about it.

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,160
I wouldn't.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,380
I'd just lay it on the line.

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,980
I got some years
 invested in Kathy, Carl.

125
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,080
I don't want to blow it.

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,330
I wouldn't put up with it.

127
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,550
You wouldn't put
 up with anything.

128
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,500
That's why you're still single.

129
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,020
I'm just saying there's
 plenty of fish, that's all.

130
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,670
Hey, guys.

131
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,970
Jim, we still getting
 together tonight?

132
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,210
Tonight?

133
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,880
What's going on tonight?

134
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,510
Oh, nothing.

135
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,240
Just some extra work project.

136
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Yeah, I'll take
 care of that tonight.

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,820
OK.

138
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,850
Get what done?

139
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,580
Do Melissa?

140
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,990
It's not what you think, man.

141
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,580
Or you hope it's what I think.

142
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,450
She's helping
 me out with Kathy.

143
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,410
How is that helping you out?

144
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,560
I mean for your libido, I mean.

145
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,520
It isn't like that.

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,850
Hey, man, your
 secret's safe with me.

147
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,550
For $20.

148
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,900
RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE): You
 sent for a temp secretary.

149
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,270
Come on in.

150
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,990
Mr. Marriott.

151
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,810
I presume you're experienced
 in these kind of matters?

152
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,470
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,420
OK, then have a seat
 at the receptions desk

154
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,540
and all calls to
 be screened first.

155
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,420
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,120
All right.

157
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,650
Anything else, it'll come later.

158
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,350
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,670
How was practice
 going for a tournament?

160
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,210
It's her last hand.

161
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,170
Why don't you just sit
 here watch my moves.

162
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,920
Yep, last hand.

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,850
Two to two.

164
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,840
Well, in that case, then
 let's play a man's game.

165
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,730
Five card stud, winner
 takes all, you and me.

166
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,840
Pitch them, pretty boy.

167
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,670
You don't have the card.

168
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,830
Oh, really?

169
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,430
Then let's up the
 stakes on that.

170
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,290
With what, our clothes?

171
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,030
Nope.

172
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,750
Mike's clothes.

173
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,230
Yep.

174
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,560
Good morning Mr. Marelli.

175
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,960
Morning.

176
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,680
Oh, uh, call Mr.
 Wellington and tell him

177
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,910
that the plans with
 Radell has been

178
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,820
pushed back till Wednesday.

179
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,490
Lunch plans?

180
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,910
What?

181
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,490
Do want to arrange a
 meeting for lunch plans

182
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,640
with the Syntex industry reps?

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,070
Oh, wow, forgot
 all about that.

184
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,930
Uh, make reservations
 at Bistro West.

185
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,700
They'd like that place.

186
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,620
They're at 12:45,
 Mr. Marriott.

187
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,760
What is?

188
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,570
Your reservations.

189
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,140
I've already made them for you.

190
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,130
Oh, wow, great.

191
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,220
How did you know
 I like that place?

192
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,750
Oh, well, for
 the past six months

193
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,970
your schedule has shown
 12 different meetings

194
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,370
with various clients, three
 with Syntex Industries,

195
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,120
all at Bistro Best.

196
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,260
And all at?

197
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,480
12:45.

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,210
Wow.

199
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,940
Great, thanks.

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,840
You win, you get to
 change places with Mike.

201
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,340
And if you win?

202
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,880
You drop out of
 the tournament.

203
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,360
You're bluffing.

204
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
Oh, really?

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Then call my bluff.

206
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,680
I fold.

207
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,660
Thought so.

208
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,630
So what did you have?

209
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,910
Ace of hearts.

210
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,460
I had a straight.

211
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,720
I win.

212
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,470
And so does Mike.

213
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,320
Have fun, you two.

214
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,030
I'll see you at the tournament.

215
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,340
OK, yeah, good.

216
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,880
So we'll get those
 contracts in tomorrow, OK?

217
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,580
Good.

218
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,370
Could you bring in those
 papers I was working--

219
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,830
Here's the merger papers
 you're about to ask for.

220
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,160
Wow, thank you.

221
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
You know, I have a name.

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,270
Congratulations.

223
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,520
You have a name.

224
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,680
It's Carol.

225
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,440
Carol.

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,140
Yeah.

227
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,570
I knew that.

228
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,860
Then why haven't you
 said it since I started?

229
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,350
I guess I really
 didn't feel the need.

230
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,050
Why not?

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,710
You know, Carol, if you'd
 like the trend to continue,

232
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm sure we can arrange that.

233
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,850
[LAUGHTER]

234
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,260
That's not the normal
 reaction I get when

235
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,000
I threaten to fire someone.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,630
You won't fire me.

237
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,290
And what makes sure of that?

238
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,620
CAROL: Because I'm
 better than the rest.

239
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,340
This could be fun.

240
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,960
MIKE: Pick a mask.

241
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,860
Choose one.

242
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,830
What's this?

243
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,150
MIKE: Cannibal juice.

244
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,290
Invented it myself.

245
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,670
It has about 15
 ingredients in it.

246
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,470
Like what?

247
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,670
I don't know.

248
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,980
I change it every time.

249
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,000
Wow.

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,450
MIKE: That's a natural reflex.

251
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,440
Most people spit out
 the first mouthful.

252
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,910
They said I have
 to put my mask on.

253
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,120
I found my partner.

254
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,400
Partner?

255
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,360
Are you ready?

256
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,140
For what?

257
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,120
For this.

258
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,950
Have fun, ladies.

259
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:31,940
Hey, you.

260
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,820
Hey, how's the temp
 assignment going for you?

261
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,810
Something's up about this
 girlfriend of Jack Marriott's.

262
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,220
She doesn't seem quite right.

263
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,930
What's Marriott do, anyway?

264
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,940
He's big player, he
 buys, sells companies.

265
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,050
They take a struggling
 company, buy it, fix it up,

266
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,330
and then they sell it
 to bigger corporations.

267
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,950
So he's like a used
 company salesman?

268
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,740
So, how long has the
 girl been in the picture?

269
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,640
Six months.

270
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,920
And I don't think she's
 around for his charm.

271
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,450
Is she a gold digger?

272
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,460
I don't think so, she
 comes from big money.

273
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,610
Well, then, let's find out.

274
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,060
What are you looking for?

275
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,150
Well, I'm just
 going through records.

276
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,270
I'm looking up the
 financial news.

277
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,320
Anything pertaining to
 recent Marriott dealings.

278
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,530
Do you think she
 could be a mole?

279
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,230
Yeah.

280
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,890
But how to convince Jeff?

281
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,870
Bring out the heavy artillery.

282
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,560
Don't be surprised if
 I get fired very soon.

283
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,150
Well, isn't that
 what we specialize in?

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,990
No, I mean I didn't--

285
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,540
I understand.

286
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,080
No, I don't do this.

287
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,410
Do what?

288
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,380
This.

289
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,360
Yes you do.

290
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,880
Jim.

291
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,930
Oh, Jim.

292
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,940
What?

293
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,260
Rough night at the office?

294
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,860
Rough.

295
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,350
I hardly even heard
 you come in last night.

296
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,510
New project?

297
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,430
Project.

298
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,760
I found something
 in the laundry.

299
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,260
Oh, did you?

300
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,030
And it isn't mine.

301
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,010
Laundry?

302
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, and the tags
 are still on it.

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
How did they get
 in the laundry?

304
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,410
So you do know about this.

305
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,810
You weren't
 supposed to see that.

306
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,480
You are holding
 a secret from me.

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,310
It isn't what you think.

308
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,280
Oh, it isn't?

309
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,530
And what do I think?

310
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,520
I think I know
 what you're thinking.

311
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,010
And it isn't what you
 should be thinking.

312
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,370
I think so.

313
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,740
I think that we've used
 the word think too much.

314
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,610
Who is she?

315
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm not sleeping with anyone.

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,990
I never said you were.

317
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,270
But you were thinking it.

318
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,060
I'm sure there's a perfect
 explanation for this.

319
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,530
Yes, there is.

320
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,740
And?

321
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,030
I bought it.

322
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,030
Oh my god.

323
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,990
Jim, are you a cross-dresser?

324
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,820
What?

325
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,740
Of course not.

326
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,410
Thank god, it is
 just another woman.

327
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,090
It isn't.

328
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,640
Then why'd you buy it?

329
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,040
I bought it for you.

330
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,760
OK?

331
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,930
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,520
Why didn't you give it to me?

333
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,390
The receipt said 30 days ago.

334
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,350
Receipt?

335
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,870
How'd you find the receipt?

336
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,520
The store keeps a copy.

337
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,290
You went to the store?

338
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,530
I thought you were
 a cross-dresser.

339
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,390
What makes you think that?

340
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,800
Sandy.

341
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh, brother.

342
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,990
Well, of course.

343
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,250
She coming over today?

344
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,980
No, I sent her to your office.

345
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,680
What?

346
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,380
My office?

347
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,170
Why?

348
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,280
To look for your
 stash of girly clothes

349
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,100
that you were wearing.

350
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,310
Jeffery, is that you?

351
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,530
JEFFERY: I'm sorry, I only
 do sessions by appointment.

352
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,800
There's another studio down
 the way, if you some help.

353
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,500
It's me.

354
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,530
JEFFERY: Brit?

355
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,300
Is that you?

356
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,220
You look very grown up.

357
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,350
You look just
 like I remember you.

358
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,410
BRIT: Great, 12 years
 old with ponytails.

359
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,470
No, you look--
 you look beautiful.

360
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,170
Thank you.

361
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,920
That's very kind.

362
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,940
Look, I thought about
 it and thought about it,

363
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,820
but I didn't give it to you.

364
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,180
KATHY: Why?

365
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,950
I didn't want you
 to get mad at me.

366
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,230
Where are you going?

367
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,240
The office.

368
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,700
It's Saturday.

369
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,640
I have to go hide the stash
 of bras that I wear all day.

370
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,070
Gentlemen.

371
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,460
Excuse me.

372
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,470
Gentlemen and ladies.

373
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,850
Seems you have me in a
 bit of a bad situation.

374
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,480
I'd reckon that'd be so, Dirk.

375
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,850
Like Pa always said,
 when the milk ran dry,

376
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,520
time to move to another cow.

377
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,610
Right.

378
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,060
Well, seems I have no choice.

379
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,760
I think I can squeeze this cow
 just a little bit more, Tex.

380
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,950
He's bluffing, Mike.

381
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,870
Tex.

382
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,520
The name's Tex, Benny.

383
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,330
Right.

384
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,250
Look, there's no way you
 got the card in the hole.

385
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,430
Maybe.

386
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,200
Mike-- I mean Tex--

387
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,050
here has two of the aces in
 the deck, and I got one here.

388
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,830
And I got two of the sixes you'd
 need to make a straight flush.

389
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,250
Then see my bet and
 go home a wealthy man.

390
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,440
My pa always said,
 it's better to go home

391
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,550
with a dollar than nothing.

392
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,320
So, that just
 leaves you and me.

393
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,610
Well, tough guy.

394
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,340
Or girl.

You in or out?

396
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,690
Well, we know Mike--

397
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,880
I mean Tex, here,
 didn't have your card.

398
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,410
And neither do
 you, otherwise you'd

399
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,970
be putting your chips in
 right about now, wouldn't you?

400
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,670
Right.

401
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,920
Damn.

402
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,200
I got to know.

403
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,090
You got to pay to see my hand.

404
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,180
MIKE: You know, my
 pa always said--

405
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,940
Mike.

406
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,580
Mike.

407
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,280
Sorry.

408
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,410
It's a three.

409
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,540
I figured you were
 bluffing, but I wasn't sure.

410
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,630
Oh, I'm glad it worked.

411
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,570
You're totally ready
 for the tournament.

412
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,270
You think?

413
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,970
Really?

414
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh, yeah.

415
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,110
I thought you had it.

416
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,450
Now you couldn't read any
 emotion off my face, could you?

417
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,150
None.

418
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,640
I had no idea.

419
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,140
When is the tournament?

420
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,720
This weekend.

421
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,520
Well, maybe I should sign up.

422
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,920
What?

423
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,010
Well, Tex, you'd better just
 give me the entrance fee now

424
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,240
and save yourself the trip.

425
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,820
I can play cards.

426
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,780
Sure you can.

427
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,930
You just can't win at cards.

428
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,760
I win sometimes.

429
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,350
Yeah, well, we let you
 so you keep coming back.

430
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,140
All right?

431
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,550
You read like an open book, Tex.

432
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,440
I do?

433
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,550
OK, Mike, whenever you
 have more than a pair,

434
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,910
you start shaking your leg.

435
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,280
Yeah, and when it's
 a really good hand,

436
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,170
your left eye kinda twitches.

437
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,050
And if you're bluffing,
 your nostrils flare.

438
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,860
And when it's
 three of a kind you--

439
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,840
MIKE: All right.

440
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,590
All right.

441
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,250
I get the point.

442
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,980
Couple more games
 like this, and I'll be

443
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,690
owning stock in your company.

444
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,310
Sorry, Mike.

445
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,090
That's OK.

446
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,920
I lose so he can
 keep you around.

447
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,990
Well, he has a few other
 qualities besides your money

448
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,790
he wins.

449
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,930
I think that's a
 polite good night.

450
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,770
I couldn't get in,
 you need like a password

451
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,380
or something on the weekend.

452
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,430
Jim and I got into a
 fight about it this morning.

453
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,190
He knows that you know?

454
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,690
He's not a cross-dresser,
 if that's what you think.

455
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,300
Oh, he's in denial, eh?

456
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,620
He's not in denial.

457
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,860
So he came out completely?

458
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,660
No, he bought it for me.

459
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,560
He was just too embarrassed
 to give it to me.

460
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,330
Oh.

461
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,870
I need you to help
 me do something.

It hurt like hell.

475
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,990
I was three sheets to
 the wind, and it still

476
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,070
felt like they were yanking
 my tongue out of me.

477
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,430
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,840
Never mind, I
 don't want to know.

 on at the office?

It's not really the job,
 per se, it's more the boss.

 to be a tough nut to crack.

 figure this one out.

 mole in the company.

By the looks of her skirt,
 I'd say very deeply rooted.

502
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,180
Well, there's only one way
 to flush out a mole like that.
