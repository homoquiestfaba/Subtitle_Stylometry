1
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
555-01-36.

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,438
If you check in, I'm heading for
the airport early. Meet me for coffee.

3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,232
They're gonna mark you tardy.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,919
I've got court today.

5
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,470
You working late?

6
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,509
I can if you are.

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,830
Thought I'd take you to The Palm.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,719
I wanna get my dad
one of those weather radios.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,277
The nothing-but-weather ones.
Now that he's on the water.

10
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,474
Get him a book.
Let him dope it out. He'd like that.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,552
You'd like that.

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,874
He doesn't think the weatherman
will lie to him.

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,469
He wants to know
if a hurricane's coming.

14
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,278
What's wrong with The Palm?

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,951
It's Friday night. It'll be crowded.

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,397
You like it crowded.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,598
Okay, let's go to The Palm.

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,590
If you're just killing time...

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,874
Help!

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,718
Did he talk about God?

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,271
Ask him if God said anything bad.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,239
If we get him to say
God speaks to him, then--

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,709
That thing's cordless.

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,439
What else did he say?

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,510
Oh, baloney.

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,437
She's on the phone.
She'll be right down.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
What's he know about
the democratic process?

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,388
I gotta go.

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,839
Got any cash?

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,830
Sure.

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,798
I need about a half a million.

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,149
Harold Cornelius is gonna run
against me as a write-in.

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,310
He's a nutcase.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,989
With a chain of drugstores
and a lot of money.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,919
- Where are you going?
- New York.

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,392
New Hampshire won't stand for him
buying a seat in Congress.

37
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,550
He's Elmer Fudd.

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,989
Yeah, sure.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,754
Jessie's birthday's Wednesday.
I said we'd both be home.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,439
Sure.

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,670
Attention.

42
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,469
Convective Sigma 3 Echo in effect
for Washington-Baltimore area.

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,150
A line of thunderstorms
approximately 60 miles wide...

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,030
...moving from 260 degrees at 15 knots
with tops to flight level 350.

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,397
Wind gusts to 60 knots and possible
cloud-to-cloud lightning.

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,989
Visibility occasionally one mile...

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,678
I said I wouldn't take PAC money.

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,593
- That's when we didn't need it.
- What do I say now?

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,474
Do you swear to tell the truth?

50
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,749
I do.

51
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,631
Name and occupation for the jury.

52
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,673
William Van Den Broeck.
Sergeant in Internal Affairs...

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,229
...of the District of Columbia
Police Department.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,431
And what's your job, sergeant?

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,071
Internal Affairs investigates incidents
or allegations of misconduct...

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,558
... involving sworn officers and
employees of the District of Columbia.

57
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,878
Miami boarding at gate 33.

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,111
He thinks we'll let him
get away with that?

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,833
Depose Henry.

60
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,633
Sure.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,433
I'll see you.

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,950
Sergeant...

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,269
...Van Den Broeck...

64
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,030
...you had to take a test
to make sergeant, didn't you?

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,668
It was a written exam.

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,070
If I put into evidence
records showing...

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,590
...56 officers took
the test same time as you...

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,150
...and you did better than 54 of them,
would that be about right?

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,871
- We could look it up.
- The point is...

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,473
...you're a smart guy.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,359
Number two on the written,
11 years a sergeant.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,192
How come you're not a lieutenant?

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,839
Where are we going with this?

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,189
Is it because you're white?

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,396
She cannot do that! Your Honour!

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,233
From 1 1 News,
this is a special report.

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,029
May I help you?

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,069
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.

79
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,154
Is there a radio just for weather?
It's for my father-in-law in Florida.

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,391
I got a couple back here.
I'll show you.

81
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,239
A normal crew is two pilots
and three attendants.

82
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,631
The aircraft involved was a 7 3 7...

83
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,429
... which normally is configured
for seats for 96 to 1 38 passengers.

84
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,671
- Where's this?
- Down in the bay.

85
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,430
National Safety Board officials
were en route to the site...

86
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,391
--over Chesapeake Bay,
20 miles south...

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,314
... of the city limits,
where Southern Airlines flight...

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,711
...43 7 to Miami went down
about an hour ago...

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,188
... with 1 03 passengers...

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,038
Anything happening?

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,478
School cops took a nine
out of this girl's locker.

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,150
Same gun got logged into evidence
six weeks ago. Drive-by weapon.

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,112
--8000 feet when it veered off-course
and began a steep descent--

94
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,669
The only thing he isn't short on
is cash.

95
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,474
He'll buy a million dollars
worth of TV time...

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,439
...and hide behind the best advertising
money can buy.

97
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,679
I can beat him if I can get
on television myself.

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,479
The issue here is whether someone
totally unsuited for public office...

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,672
...can buy his way into
the United States Congress.

100
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,433
I hope your answer's no.

101
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
I said "buy" too many times, right?

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,710
Let's eat.

103
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,279
You got no lunchroom here?

104
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,839
Here's what we got.

105
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,150
We got a gun that was used
in a homicide. Killed someone.

106
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,638
It got stolen out of the property room.
Maybe some cop sold it right out.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,719
Then we got you
in possession of that gun.

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,998
We ain't got no lunchroom.

109
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,834
Some school fool say he found
some gun in my locker.

110
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,992
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.
I ain't possessing nothing.

111
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,630
How did it get in your locker, Shyla?

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,720
Don't use my Christian name
like we'll be friends.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,191
It's my impression you weren't
in the market for corporate support.

114
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,998
I hate making these calls.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,800
I thought I wouldn't have to.
But now I need the money.

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,918
We had good relations with your dad.

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,709
He understood the communications
business. We appreciated that.

118
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,109
Who was doing your media?

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,199
I guess I was.

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,079
Never needed much till Cornelius
came out of left field.

121
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,309
Make that right field.

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,039
What do you think of Carl Broman?

123
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,597
--offshore breeze and clearing.
Low tonight in the mid-70s.

124
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
Juvenile's got her brother
for knocking over gas stations.

125
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,233
I guess she's holding for him...

126
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,878
...but she won't talk to us.

127
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,388
We can get her detention.

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,198
Oh, yeah? How?

129
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,237
I'll lose her paperwork.

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,830
You'd do that?
Hold her without a charge?

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,357
For a week. If she wants
to go home, maybe we get a name.

132
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,392
Dutch, line three.

133
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,629
Van Den Broeck.

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,156
Clayton? And George Beaufort?

135
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,671
Well, Friday's payday, I guess.

136
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,798
Stick with him till we catch up.

137
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,873
I want this son of a bitch.
Alcee, we're on the roll.

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,510
Janice...

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,150
I didn't do anything.
We were just talking.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,830
Don't even think that way.
Shit like that makes people hate cops.

141
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,070
Grab a radio.

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,110
Cassie?

143
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,159
You got a car for me?

144
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,269
Not the pimpmobile.
It's surveillance, not narcotics.

145
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,510
This is it.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,278
Your wife called.
She said things came up at work.

147
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,670
She can't eat with you
and you should call.

148
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,037
You can see the tail
is sticking out of the water.

149
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,390
You can hear choppers above me.

150
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,109
News choppers are getting
a better look.

151
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,753
Search and rescue operations--

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,834
--about an hour ago, with a reported
1 03 passengers onboard...

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,993
That aeroplane, a 12-year-old 737...

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,359
There's Clayton.

155
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,231
What the hell's he doing?

156
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,478
- What's this clown doing?
- I don't know.

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,279
And where's George?

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,873
- Wait a minute.
- Get Elton and Tommy back here quick.

159
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,070
Tommy, we need you guys back here.
Something's going down.

160
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,789
Clayton?

161
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,190
How you doing? What's going on?

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,157
Where's George, your partner?

163
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,870
In the basement.

164
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,548
The basement?

165
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,039
What's he doing in there?

166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,239
A guy named Marvin is pouring booze
without a license.

167
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,398
We're getting ready to write him.
He comes up with a shotgun.

168
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,993
He says he wants money.

169
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,514
He tells me to get it.

170
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,909
He's got George.

171
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,830
Somebody's holding
George Beaufort hostage.

172
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,518
Can he send us an ear?

173
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,239
What's the plan, officer?

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,309
We could call police.

175
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,871
Is that what you're
getting ready to do?

176
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,350
Call the police?
There's a lot here already.

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,400
He's got a gun on George.
We gotta do something.

178
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,636
See, we're Internal Affairs.

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,231
You got a policeman that screws up.

180
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,438
You got a policeman
that abuses his position, steals.

181
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,039
That's us.

182
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,072
What do you think is going on?

183
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,151
You think we just happened by?

184
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,829
We've been on you all day. All week.

185
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,037
We've been on you all month.

186
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,549
You know what I think?

187
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,269
Somebody got sick
and tired of paying you off.

188
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,869
You wanna corroborate that,
gives us a reason...

189
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,350
...to drag George's ass
out of the basement.

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,398
Or we'll talk to the guy
with the gun, hear his version.

191
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,990
You're asking me to turn George in?

192
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,510
Just push me and push me...

193
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,589
Marvin?

194
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,708
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.

195
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,590
Hello, asshole. You're under arrest.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,231
Who is the real Kay Chandler?
What's she stand for?

197
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,629
Do you know?

198
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,229
What's she doing in Congress anyway?

199
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,958
Harold Cornelius for Congress.

200
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,998
Shirley Magnuson did it.

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,470
- Pretty good.
- You think so?

202
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,197
She knows you're running
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.

203
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,273
Poor guy's dead, and when he wasn't,
he got a lot of votes.

204
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,034
So all she does is ask
a couple of questions.

205
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,511
The subtext is "She only
got elected because of her daddy."

206
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,308
She didn't earn it.
This is America. That ain't fair.

207
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,949
I'm not running
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,077
What will you run as? Nice person?

209
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,509
I have my own record.

210
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,878
City attorney?
"National committeewoman"?

211
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,628
A record's when somebody
remembers what you did.

212
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,150
I beat Harvey Galin five to three.

213
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,390
My, my.

214
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,199
Five to three.

215
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,120
How'd those three vote Democratic
in a district that hadn't...

216
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,790
...voted for a Democrat since
Roosevelt? They're sending a message.

217
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,878
This won't be a nice election.

218
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,470
Folks talking about
the amber waves of grain.

219
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,918
It's about the man's money
against the woman's name.

220
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,390
Can't beat you on your record.
You have none.

221
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,039
He won't beat you on the issues.

222
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,072
On the issues, I'll kick his ass.

223
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,510
The question is,
can you beat Shirley Magnuson?

224
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,950
I'm not running against
Shirley Magnuson.

225
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,117
What you don't want in the papers...

226
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,920
...what you haven't told your husband,
she'll find it.

227
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,670
Shirley's wasting her time.

228
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,150
How's your marriage?

229
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,432
Swell. How's yours?

230
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,718
If I was running for office,
I'd be in trouble.

231
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,157
You fool around, Mrs. Chandler?
A little slap and tickle?

232
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,912
Any special friends?

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,310
Not at the moment,
but I'll keep you posted.

234
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,918
What's the worst thing
you've done?

235
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,230
You need a life, Mr. Broman.

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,798
For a moment, I thought we wouldn't
have any fun at all.

237
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,870
I didn't take a dime from you,
you bastard.

238
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,839
Marvin...

239
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,113
We don't come up soon,
they'll come and get us.

240
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,828
What you think they'd do about me?

241
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,759
You'll pay a fine for pouring liquor
without a license...

242
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,190
...but I need you to testify
against George.

243
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,271
You got some leverage.

244
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,278
Wanna make your situation worse?

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,510
Just keep thinking
what you're thinking.

246
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,830
You pay a little fine,
plead to disorderly.

247
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,998
But you gotta promise
you'll show up against George.

248
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,036
I gotta have that shotgun.

249
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,629
Now.

250
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,590
Good man. Go on up.

251
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,271
Alcee, Marvin's coming up.

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,478
Get him downtown.
Take real good care of him, okay?

253
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,038
Were you really gonna shoot him?

254
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,189
He had that shotgun
pointed right at me.

255
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,591
What would you do about me?

256
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,231
I figured he'd shoot you.

257
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,790
And I'd shoot him, get myself a medal.

258
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,319
You'd be dead, of course.

259
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,513
You got a right
to remain silent, officer.

260
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,990
Use it.

261
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,439
--95 passengers and crew members
are now feared lost.

262
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,353
Navy divers were expected
to work throughout the night.

263
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,079
Will Thomas, are you there?

264
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,273
They already have a crane trying
to hoist the plane out of the water.

265
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,953
We've got divers.

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,550
Where's Peyton?

267
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,229
Working late.

268
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,834
You gonna eat?
We've got bay scallops.

269
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,632
See if I can find her.

270
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,110
--the plane struck the surface
at an angle...

271
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,353
...and bounced at least one time before
plowing into the water nose first.

272
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,229
I'm at Billy's. I'll call you at home.

273
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,398
If we don't catch up, I'll eat here.
He's got scallops.

274
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,868
Love you. Bye.

275
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,631
It's the Van Den Broecks.
Leave a message. We'll call you back.

276
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,272
To play back your messages, press one.

277
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,078
Hi, I'm at the airport.

278
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,630
I send a catalogue to Miami without me,
and it's falling apart.:

279
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,992
A new stylist, locations don't work,
bugs biting the girls...

280
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,071
...and you don't wanna know what else.

281
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,029
Therefore, I'm on the plane
to kill critters and counsel careers.

282
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,830
I'll try to get back tomorrow,
but it may not be till Sunday.

283
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
God knows where I'll sleep.
They're in the Keys.

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,030
I'll call you when I can.

285
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,191
I had fun this morning.

286
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,839
I love you.

287
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,190
You find her?

288
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,034
No. That plane was going to Miami,
wasn't it?

289
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,038
Give me some quarters.

290
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,432
I once got laid in Miami.

291
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,759
My name's Van Den Broeck.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,150
I'm a police officer,
if that makes any difference.

293
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,830
I know you get a lot of crazies
when something like this happens.

294
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,071
I think it's possible my wife
may have been on your plane.

295
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,390
Peyton Van Den Broeck.

296
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,879
Great. Boy. She must be on another
flight. Boy, that'll wake you up.

297
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,151
What are the other flights to Miami?

298
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,670
Check the 1 : 1 5,
but it doesn't make sense.

299
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,831
She left for the airport after 9.

300
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,079
Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.

301
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,670
She went to Miami today.
I need to know what plane she was on.

302
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,480
I can be with you in just one moment.

303
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,234
We don't have this in a six,
but I can order it.

304
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,554
I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.

305
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,268
She went to Miami.
I need to know what plane she was on.

306
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,317
- You're the policeman?
- Right.

307
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,838
Mary Claire Clark books the travel,
but she goes home at 5:30.

308
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,633
Can you reach her at home?

309
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,957
Oh, my God! The plane that crashed.

310
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,513
She was going to Miami,
but they don't have her listed.

311
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,240
How do we get ahold
of Mary Claire Clark?

312
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,590
Do we have to shout?

313
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,952
Peyton went to Miami.
She might be on the plane that crashed.

314
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,589
We have to find out
what flight she was on.

315
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,919
Does anyone know what
Mary Claire Clark was doing tonight?

316
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,878
Call the switchboard.
Get her number.

317
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,388
The airline won't tell you?

318
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,677
She's not listed,
but she's not listed on any flight.

319
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,358
I know she was going.
She left messages at work and home.

320
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,591
They can't give out home numbers.

321
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,273
This is Molly Roll. Who's this?

322
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,838
I need your help. I'm the supervisor
in Designer Wear...

323
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,079
...and you'll confirm that when you
call me back at extension 293, okay?

324
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,318
I need the home telephone number
of Mary Claire Clark.

325
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,871
She's the department secretary.

326
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,873
We are managing an emergency.
Do you understand?

327
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,149
Thank you.

328
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,190
You must be Dutch. I'm Molly.

329
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,113
What was she doing in Miami?

330
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,471
It sounded like some kind of crisis.

331
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,070
You're shooting a catalogue in the Keys
that was falling apart?

332
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,471
What would we be shooting in the Keys?

333
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,637
Did she say which catalogue?

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,750
Molly Roll.

335
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,989
Thank you.

336
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,512
Sarah, would you get her for me?

337
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,029
I'll get my boss.

338
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,719
What catalogue are we shooting?

339
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,670
I didn't know we were doing a catalogue.

340
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,676
Susan, are you working?

341
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,033
- Peyton didn't know she was going.
- There's no answer.

342
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,592
Somebody must've called her.

343
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,718
Would she call Mary Claire
for a reservation or would she...

344
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,109
...use a travel agent?

345
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,311
This is Mr. Driker, vice president
of Designer Wear. He's our boss.

346
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,239
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Sure.

347
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,119
Molly says Peyton may be
on the plane that crashed.

348
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,078
- Is Peyton on that plane?
- We don't know.

349
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,709
- Either way, she's toast.
- Can you zip it?

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,549
We don't have a catalogue shooting
in Florida or anywhere else.

351
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,229
The next catalogue's not till Christmas.

352
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,357
Maybe it's not a catalogue.

353
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,353
Something with models.
The girls were bit by bugs.

354
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,431
No, there's nothing like that.

355
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,311
If Peyton's travelling,
I don't think it's for the store.

356
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,639
I know when people are out of town.
I approve it, and we're stingy on travel.

357
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,951
Are you saying she lied to me?

358
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,750
I'm saying I don't know where she is.

359
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,471
I'm thinking of something I can do.
I'd like to be helpful.

360
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,556
There was this judge who had...

361
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,078
...two whole entire families, kids,
dogs, everything. A judge.

362
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,430
We think we know. We don't know.

363
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,830
Nobody knows. You just don't know.

364
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,439
Oh, my God.

365
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,597
Maybe she travelled as someone's wife.
If anyone knows what his name is...

366
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,432
...I could check that way.

367
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,832
I don't know. Honestly.

368
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,429
Beats me. She seemed...

369
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,190
I mean, she never looked
like she was looking.

370
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,470
Like girls look
if they're looking, okay?

371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,872
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

372
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,873
...I think I know Peyton
as well as anyone here.

373
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,389
I've got no idea.

374
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,513
Are you surprised?

375
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,270
The important thing is we don't know
if she was on the plane.

376
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,079
I think she was on the plane.

377
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,509
Jessie, tell me the truth.
Are kids drinking at these parties?

378
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,519
I invented some of the excuses
you're giving me.

379
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,070
I've been 15. You've never been 35.

380
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,039
Okay, okay, 37.

381
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,717
I'll see for myself Wednesday.

382
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,039
5'6."

383
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,239
1 20.

384
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,388
Blue eyes.

385
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,271
A wedding band, just plain.

386
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,510
A diamond ring, emerald-cut,
about a carat.

387
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,631
I'm telling you, she was on your plane.
If I'm wrong, great!

388
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,229
If I'm right, you know
who to call, okay?

389
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,473
Got some empty boxes?

390
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,631
Ask the guy out back.

391
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,710
Excuse me.

392
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,473
Are you Mr. Van Den Broeck?

393
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,030
I'm David Dotson. This is
Phyllis Bonaparte. Southern Airlines.

394
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,629
- Do you have a minute to talk to us?
- Sure.

395
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,950
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

396
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,229
...we don't show your wife as anybody's
passenger on any flight to Miami.

397
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,478
Hi, I'm at the airport.

398
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,638
I send a catalogue to Miami without me,
and it's falling apart.:

399
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,390
A new stylist, locations don't work,
bugs biting the girls...

400
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,710
...and you don't wanna know what else.

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,230
Therefore, I'm on the plane to kill--

402
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,269
No one named Van Den Broeck reserved
or bought a ticket to Miami.

403
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,274
There is no catalogue shoot.
She works for Saks.

404
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,158
They don't know where she is.

405
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,710
I think she was gonna spend the weekend
in Miami with another guy.

406
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,757
If she was, would she tell
the truth about her destination?

407
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,351
Trick is not to lie more than you
have to. Got a passenger list?

408
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,273
I can't let you see it.

409
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,630
I figure he bought the tickets
"Mr. and Mrs."

410
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,957
I think he's married. Be interesting
when you call his house.

411
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,677
- I'm not allowed--
- Let him see the list.

412
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,034
- I need that back.
- They'll give you another one.

413
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,193
A Royal Regency Hotel is
near where the plane went down.

414
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,271
We have rooms there
for family members.

415
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,957
Why don't you drive down with us?
You'll have to identify--

416
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,393
To make the identification.

417
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,994
Sit around with the next of kin?
I got a lot of things to do.

418
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,319
I don't think you should be
alone right now.

419
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,636
I was alone before you got here.

420
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,231
Everybody, listen up. Listen up.

421
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,471
A guy thinks his wife was on 43 7...

422
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,029
...travelling with a man
on Mr.-and-Mrs. tickets.

423
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,550
He's a cop, so as far as we know,
he's not nuts.

424
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,752
Who the wife's boyfriend is,
he hasn't got a clue.

425
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,913
We got nine M-and-Ms. Another two pair
sitting together, same last name.

426
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,236
Married, cousins, who knows?
Be careful.

427
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,036
Don't assume a deceased Mrs.
is for real.

428
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,359
We don't wanna be the ones telling
some widow her husband died happy.

429
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,832
And we don't wanna tell kids that Mom's
gone when Mom's asleep in Bethesda.

430
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,078
What does your sex life have to do
with saving social security?

431
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,230
Tell me that.

432
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,199
According to
Shirley Magnuson, everything.

433
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,390
What is the worst thing
you've ever done?

434
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,149
If I've already done it,
it'll be a dull life.

435
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,432
You're gonna be a big disappointment
to old Shirley.

436
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,238
You think Cullen's the last man
you'll ever sleep with?

437
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,990
College was best.
All that stuff going on.

438
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,631
"When's he gonna call?
When's he gonna kiss me?"

439
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,390
At night, when I bring it back...

440
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,230
...I get that ache all over again.

441
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,914
I'll tell Richard to host
the fundraiser. Come over.

442
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,991
Both of you.
We'll make a guest list.

443
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,639
He's in New York.

444
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,791
What are you doing here on Saturday?

445
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,510
George and Clayton made bond.

446
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,150
You know this ain't the best case
we ever made.

447
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,237
We got Clayton's statement.
Did you read him his rights?

448
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,671
He'll say I didn't.

449
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,399
We got Marvin.

450
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,832
Something wrong with you?

451
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,273
What's wrong, Dutch?

452
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,673
Dick? Sorry.

453
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,554
Three A and B,
Mr. and Mrs. Cullen Chandler.

454
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,630
No one's called.

455
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,629
There's an unlisted number for
a Cullen Chandler at the Metropolitan.

456
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,434
Doorman says Mrs. Chandler
is a congresswoman.

457
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,558
And he saw her today.
She was going jogging.

458
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,469
When I was small,
I knew my father was in politics.

459
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,473
I didn't know what that was,
or why he went to Washington.

460
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,830
Let's make it "dad." "My dad."

461
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,317
Instead of "father."
Warms it up a little.

462
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,039
"Dad." All right.

463
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,556
Kay Chandler, take three.

464
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,753
Hello. I'm Kay Chandler
and I'm running for Congress.

465
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,560
When I was small,
I knew my dad was in politics--

466
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,552
Maybe it should be "kid."

467
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,791
"When I was a kid"...

468
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,190
"When I was just a kid."
How about that?

469
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,313
"When I was a kid."

470
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,350
Help you?

471
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,352
We need to speak to Mrs. Chandler.

472
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,114
- We're taping.
- It's all right. What is it?

473
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,432
Mrs. Chandler, I'm Dick Montoya.
This is Phyllis Bonaparte.

474
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,311
We're with Southern Airlines.

475
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,912
Is there somewhere we can talk?

476
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,033
Well, about what?

477
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,470
I'm very sorry to have to tell you.

478
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,398
Your husband was on our flight...

479
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,312
...to Miami yesterday.

480
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,870
What?

481
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,519
The one that--

482
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,991
No, no, no. Cullen's in New York.

483
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,158
I wish that were so, ma'am.

484
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,197
You do fly to New York, don't you?

485
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,273
Not from Washington, no, ma'am. No.

486
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,038
The identification is correct.

487
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,549
I'm awfully sorry.

488
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,439
He said he was going to New York.
Why would he go to Miami?

489
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,470
The identification is correct.
We have his wallet.

490
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,719
I'm very sorry.

491
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,071
If something happened to him
it'll lead the news tonight.

492
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,829
Where's your daughter?

493
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,870
We have a daughter. She's 1 5.

494
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,152
We won't release the casualty list
till all families are notified.

495
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,073
But we need your help
identifying your husband.

496
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,389
Where is he?

497
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,231
Patuxent Naval Air Station.

498
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,313
- I have to get home.
- I understand. Let us help.

499
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,277
Call Dick Taradisian at the White House.
Tell him what the deal is.

500
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,751
Ask him if he can get a plane
to meet us at Patuxent.

501
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,510
If the Air Force can't do it,
call GM or anybody with a jet.

502
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,916
He did say Miami.

503
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,710
Usually it's New York,
but this time he said Miami.

504
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,198
Mr. Van Den Broeck,
we have a car for you.

505
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,318
Ma, what are you doing home?

506
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,519
Where's Dad?

507
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,873
"Thou anointest my head with oil.

508
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,433
My cup runneth over.

509
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,430
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me...

510
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,359
...all the days of my life...

511
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,239
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

512
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,629
Let us pray.

513
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,751
Almighty God, Father of mercies
and giver of all comfort...

514
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,710
I met this guy because he was
smart enough to get out of the rain.

515
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,598
I was too.

516
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,277
So we waited under the arch
in the Law quad till it was over.

517
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,233
And then he asked me...

518
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,471
...if I knew where the bookstore was.

519
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,713
And I said...

520
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,709
...I happened to be going there myself,
which was a lie, of course.

521
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,109
We had so many great days.

522
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,117
Just not enough years.

523
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,751
But we had his love.

524
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,709
Maybe I'll call you.

525
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,750
Let's go.

526
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,230
Excuse me.

527
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,870
Excuse me.

528
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,671
Are you Mary Claire Clark?

529
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,239
Yes. I am so sorry.

530
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,118
The name Cullen Chandler
mean anything?

531
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,069
No.

532
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,393
If I'd called my wife that morning,
what would you have said?

533
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,791
That she called in and said
she was taking the day off.

534
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,070
But you wouldn't have gotten me.
She sent me to Tyson's Corners...

535
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,958
...and said I could go home.

536
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,992
So I'd have gotten her voice mail?

537
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,310
Thank you.

538
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,118
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

539
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,272
...I have some of her...

540
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,514
...personal things.
I could drop them off--

541
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,869
I'll take them now.

542
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,674
I know.

543
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,229
I gotta get out of here.
I'll take Jess.

544
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,433
Kay, it's gonna look like--

545
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,069
I don't care.
Just get us back to Washington.

546
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,028
I can't see these people.

547
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,150
It's like going--

548
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,069
Don't make a mistake now.
Everybody's watching.

549
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,031
Just one more day.

550
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,270
How can I find out if a guy
was on a flight to Miami in May?

551
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,357
My name is Bill Van Den Broeck.

552
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,750
- They said you're a policeman.
- I am.

553
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,557
But I'm not working right now.

554
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,431
Then what is this about?

555
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,678
My wife was on that plane
that your husband was on.

556
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,678
I'm sorry.

557
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,832
- I wonder if I could have a few minutes.
- I just got home.

558
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,877
This isn't a good time for me.

559
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,673
For me either.

560
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,317
So you're visiting survivors.

561
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,918
You're the only one.

562
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,158
I'd ask you to sit--

563
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,316
I don't understand.

564
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,437
My daughter's due back any minute.

565
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,713
Do you have kids?

566
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,430
Jessica. She's 1 5.

567
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,750
Is there something
you wanna know, Mr...?

568
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,672
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

569
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,718
It's Van Den Broeck.

570
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,312
I just thought that...

571
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,712
I'm so sorry.

572
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,349
It's really...

573
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,711
It's unspeakable.

574
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,312
Unspeakable.

575
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,517
But you seem okay.

576
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,519
Do I?

577
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,318
Paper said your husband was a lawyer
in New Hampshire.

578
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,511
He has an office here.

579
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,870
Most of his work was here.

580
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,709
I'm in Congress.

581
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,314
Yeah, I know.

582
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,470
So why was he going to Miami?

583
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,789
Business.

584
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,111
He had business there.

585
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,358
Are you investigating something?

586
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,069
They were sitting together on the plane.

587
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,469
Your husband.

588
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,719
My wife.

589
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,950
Do you know that?

590
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,558
Three A and B.

591
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,949
First class.

592
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,110
First class isn't what it used to be.
It's not worth the money.

593
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,879
Is there anything else?

594
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,319
You mad at me?

595
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,119
I don't know you, lieutenant.
Why would I be mad?

596
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,189
I'm a sergeant.

597
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,870
What are you? A sophisticator?

598
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,718
That's my daughter.

599
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,630
Sorry. An airline guy left
Dad's things downstairs...

600
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,070
...so I brought them up.

601
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,398
This is my daughter, Jessica.

602
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,150
This is Sergeant--

603
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,949
Van Den Broeck. They call me Dutch.
It's easier.

604
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,430
He lost his wife on the plane.

605
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,950
I'm sorry.

606
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,071
Never been to New Hampshire.
You go to school there or here?

607
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,632
I go to Andover. It's a prep school.

608
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,990
I won't take any more of your time.

609
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,869
- I'm sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

610
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,599
Nice to meet you.

611
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,072
I need an hour.
It's not a lot to ask.

612
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,072
Don't come around here again.

613
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,673
They must've cleaned them.

614
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,713
It must--

615
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,391
I'm sure it's for your birthday.

616
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,514
Dad said he was gonna
get you something great.

617
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,870
Expensive.

618
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,677
He knew I'd say no.

619
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,551
I know you're worried about me...

620
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,711
...but I still want you to run.

621
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,719
I'll be fine.

622
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,637
I don't want us to sit around here
all day and be depressed.

623
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,951
I'm gonna go back to school tomorrow.

624
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,357
All my friends are there.
And it's only 40 miles.

625
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,520
I can come home on weekends if I want.

626
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,516
Somebody popped Marvin.

627
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,672
Jesus Christ!

628
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,669
Shit!

629
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,838
George Beaufort did this.

630
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,311
What else did you
find in here? Anything?

631
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,389
Is this a bad time?

632
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,549
I don't need to go
through all that garbage.

633
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,352
My case'll get kicked because
somebody killed my only witness.

634
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,108
- You get in there and do it!
- Easy, easy.

635
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,470
The last pickup was a week ago.

636
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,119
It hasn't been that long.

637
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,719
It sure smells long.

638
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,151
Sheila, what are you doing here?

639
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,511
That ain't even my name.

640
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,353
Let's talk to people.
Take that side. I'll take this side.

641
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,749
It's Homicide's.

642
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,270
- We're off it.
- The hell we are.

643
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,948
- I will not allow you to--
- I have no choice. I need your help.

644
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,794
Before you told me my husband
was screwing your wife...

645
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,110
...did it occur to you that
that might be hurtful?

646
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,469
You knew already.

647
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,431
Suppose I didn't.

648
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,032
How did you know?

649
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,071
He told me he was going to New York.

650
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,069
He's on the wrong plane,
so it must be another woman?

651
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,670
Well, it could've been amnesia.

652
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,349
My wife was in Miami
in February and in May.

653
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,359
- Do you think your husband was?
- What difference does it make?

654
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,556
It's over. It's entirely over.

655
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,951
They're through with each other!
We are through with them!

656
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,117
We can't even get a divorce!

657
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,589
You can do that.

658
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,353
I have a child.

659
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,279
I try and go back...

660
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,314
...in my head.

661
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,758
What's the last thing
you remember...

662
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,594
...about you and your husband
that you know is true?

663
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,158
I gotta find out how far back
I have to go to do that.

664
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,396
This is where they were gonna stay.

665
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,109
I've got work to do.

666
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,318
Don't you wanna know how it started?

667
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,312
How long it was going on?

668
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,272
You don't wanna know their plans?
You don't wanna know anything?

669
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,230
What she thought
when she thought about me.

670
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,112
I'd like to know that.

671
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,433
I thought you might like to know
what she looked like.

672
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,310
You leave me alone.

673
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,113
I mean it.

674
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,269
Thirty.

675
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,830
Take a number and have a seat.

676
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,589
Alice Beaufort? George Beaufort's wife?

677
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,429
Is he all right?

678
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,159
He's fine.

679
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,950
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.
I'd like to ask a few questions.

680
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,549
He was with me.

681
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,950
What time was that?

682
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,398
Any time you're talking about.

683
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,350
Thirty-one.

684
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,319
You've got an envelope.

685
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,830
February was swimsuits
and May was fall fashion.

686
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,593
And you saw those catalogues?

687
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,429
I saw the catalogues. I told you twice.
I'll get them for you.

688
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,478
How do we know she shot them in Miami?
What if--?

689
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,948
There were palm trees.

690
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,350
There was a beach
and a very big ocean.

691
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,072
If she doesn't run, she's crazy.

692
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,630
It's a sympathy bounce, but she's
up 1 4 points since the funeral.

693
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,309
I think she'll stay in,
but she'll need some time.

694
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,552
She's this brave widow with this kid.
They're eating it up.

695
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,710
You're hard.

696
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,759
She knows. I know she knows.

697
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,758
Maybe he was buying a boat.

698
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,792
Maybe it was drugs
or government work.

699
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,429
Why are you so determined
it's another woman?

700
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,150
Why are you protecting him?
If you know who it is, I swear--

701
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,278
You think I lied the first five times,
but now I'll cave?

702
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,551
Why is this so important to you?

703
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,393
I caught Sam with a woman once.

704
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,758
I spilled a milkshake on my skirt,
so I ran home from lunch.

705
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,031
I heard them in the shower.

706
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,629
And at first, I thought
it was the radio.

707
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,669
But what she was saying
you don't hear on the radio.

708
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,197
I ran.

709
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,316
I couldn't go back to work.

710
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,350
For hours, literally...

711
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,111
...I didn't remember...

712
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,034
...that I was involved
with someone else.

713
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,910
I had been for months.

714
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,158
And I liked my life with Sam.
Things were fine.

715
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,709
What'd you do?

716
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,396
I kept my mouth shut.

717
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,718
And I never went home again
without calling first.

718
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,040
To say that involvement...

719
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,670
...and I don't mean casual sex,
I mean romance.

720
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,749
To say that that whole part
of life...

721
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,150
...half the fun of life has to end...

722
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,309
If you told me that had to be over...

723
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,117
...I'd feel old.

724
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,910
If you had known about Peyton...

725
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,518
...would you tell me?

726
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,433
Now, I mean.

727
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,709
No.

728
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,991
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

729
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,029
Get me another one.

730
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,313
Broman's over there dreaming up
ways to remind you of my loss.

731
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,511
A detective came by
the office today...

732
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,711
...asking about Cullen.

733
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,273
I wasn't there. Barry said he asked
how much Cullen travelled.

734
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,631
He seemed particularly
interested in Miami.

735
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,388
Asked who our Miami clients were.

736
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,914
Said he was going there tomorrow.

737
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,839
Is this anything I should know about?

738
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,871
I have no idea.

739
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,713
I'm sorry. It's too soon.

740
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,518
- I'm sorry.
- I wanna go home.

741
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,712
- Wait for Wendy.
- I'll get a cab. Tell Wendy I'm sorry.

742
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,670
Leave a message. I'll call you back.

743
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,031
Mr. Van Den Broeck? Hi.

744
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,430
I'm so sorry about Peyton.

745
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,479
Come. Have a coffee.

746
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,830
February, we shoot in the studios...

747
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,430
...May, the Keys,
to get away from tourists.

748
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,030
Why come to Miami twice in a row?
Why not go somewhere else?

749
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,669
I would like to think
it was my work...

750
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,871
...but I suspect so she can
walk the city and sketch.

751
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,071
She loved the streets, the markets...

752
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,470
...the Latin music.

753
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,028
Was there a man?

754
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,470
I don't think there is a man, no.

755
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,548
What did she do after work?

756
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,628
More walking.

757
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,429
But sometimes the clubs,
for music and to watch the dancing.

758
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,319
You know who she went with?

759
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,752
If I can say...

760
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,189
If you wanna be with a woman,
these shoots are not so good for that.

761
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,311
Did you ever sleep with Peyton?

762
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,910
Your situation is very difficult.

763
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,277
I excuse the question.

764
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,672
Could I talk to somebody
in your security department?

765
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,679
It looks like she did.

766
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,549
Can we talk someplace?

767
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,071
Stoli, please, on the rocks.

768
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,677
I'm from a little town
in a little state.

769
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,832
Unfortunately, I'm in Congress.

770
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,992
So when you interview people,
it's easy to start talk.

771
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,391
They might stumble on the truth.
You can't possibly want that.

772
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,712
- You're the only one I wanna talk to.
- I don't know anything!

773
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,474
What do you wanna know?

774
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,629
- How long it went on.
- So we know how stupid to feel?

775
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,832
How they met, their plans.

776
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,229
I can't help you.

777
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,789
At least you tried.

778
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,678
You trying to be funny?

779
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,189
No. Not anymore.

780
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,829
Don't you fuck with me!

781
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,870
If you don't like that word,
don't use it.

782
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,509
Do you know what happens when a member
of Congress accuses you of harassment?

783
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,751
We'd get our names in the newspapers.

784
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,399
That's close to blackmail.

785
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,470
I'm not a lawyer.

786
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,309
I'm not some investigation.
You can't rummage through my life.

787
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,279
Who's next on your list?
My neighbours, staff, friends?

788
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,909
- Then talk to me.
- So you can paw through my marriage?

789
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,749
Make me confess to something?
My life is mine to judge, not yours.

790
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,513
You're not the only one involved.

791
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,671
Look, if they find out about your wife,
it's gossip.

792
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,272
If they find out about my husband,
it's in the papers.

793
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,518
I have a daughter who adores
her father, who doesn't know.

794
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,074
What do I tell her?

795
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,473
I don't know.

796
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,073
Come on.

797
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,873
I wanna show you something.

798
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,678
Nice, huh?

799
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,870
I figure they would've
had drinks here.

800
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,470
Wanna see their room?

801
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,670
- They never got here.
- Not this time.

802
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,118
She stayed here February 1 9th.
Also May 1 4th, on business.

803
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,910
If he was with her,
he didn't register.

804
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,231
Did your husband like Latin stuff?
Music, dancing?

805
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,270
Why?

806
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,678
The concierge booked them a table
at a place called La Roca.

807
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,799
Cullen liked classical music.

808
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,079
You sure?

809
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,510
What?

810
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,477
Do you know what I do for a living?

811
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,830
I get paid to notice stuff.

812
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,634
I get paid to know who's lying.

813
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,913
I didn't have a clue.

814
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,479
I missed it.

815
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,956
I thought we were happy.

816
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,079
Not giddy...

817
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,199
...not ecstatic.

818
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,711
We weren't unhappy.

819
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,639
I wasn't.

820
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,032
I was pretty happy.

821
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,749
I don't wanna be here.

822
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,871
I don't wanna be here.

823
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,438
That's Kay Chandler.

824
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,117
Peter Suchet. East Concord.
Voted for your dad.

825
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,358
Do you mind?
Honey, take another picture.

826
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,752
- They took our picture.
- You know them?

827
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,429
They're from Concord.
They took our picture.

828
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,428
I bury my husband
and go nightclubbing in Miami.

829
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,870
- Stay here.
- Where are you going?

830
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,149
To get the film.

831
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,149
God, no! You can't just mug some guy.
It'll just make things worse.

832
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,199
You are a cop.

833
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,630
Is that gonna be trouble for you?

834
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,352
What'd we look like?

835
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,673
Looked like--

836
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,830
You had your hand on my shoulder.

837
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,790
You don't care who knows, do you?

838
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,118
About her and him, I mean.

839
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,394
I care.

840
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,672
They know anyway.

841
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,794
Sooner or later,
everybody knows everything.

842
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,070
What time is it? My plane's at 9:30.

843
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,879
A little after 8.

844
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,151
Sure you don't wanna stay over?

845
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,110
Yes.

846
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,077
Maybe we should split up.

847
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,478
We should've stayed.

848
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,477
I'm in restricted parking.

849
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,719
I took the metro.

850
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,473
It's not running now.

851
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,150
I'll get a cab.

852
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,839
Where do you live?

853
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,710
- Northwest. It's out of your way.
- Want me to drop you or not?

854
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,074
You know where we're going.

855
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,630
Why?

856
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,519
Stayed? Why? Why?

857
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,677
Because they were going to?

858
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,274
Easy!

859
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,911
Goddamn it. Stop it!

860
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,229
Stop it now.

861
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,873
Well, that was fun.

862
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,069
Don't.

863
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,199
Just drive.

864
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,990
Unbelievable.

865
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,478
- You want to come in, or--?
- Don't be ridiculous.

866
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,589
Pick up the phone,
you son of a bitch.

867
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,718
You like scaring women?

868
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,673
You come around my wife
one more time and--

869
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,879
No, no. You come and try to scare me,
asshole. Chickenshit.

870
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,548
1 0.:52 p.m. End of messages.

871
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,116
Last number called.: 555-44 21.

872
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,669
Press one to connect.

873
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,719
Parkway Lanes.

874
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,718
Is George Beaufort still there?

875
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,432
Dutch, hold on, man.

876
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:00,950
Take it outside!

877
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,070
Take it outside!

878
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,070
Son of a bitch! Get off me!
Get off me!

879
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,190
Back off.

880
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,630
Son of a bitch!

881
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,750
Come on!

882
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,353
Somebody call the police.

883
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,670
I have your badge now, baby.

884
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,393
You'd better get a lawyer.

885
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,077
George killed that man.

886
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,039
Goddamn it.

887
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,158
You can't go around
beating up suspects.

888
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,829
You're suspended.
There will be a trial board.

889
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,469
You assaulted a man.
You can lose your job.

890
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,517
What if somebody swore they saw
George at that dumpster?

891
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,159
How tough would that be?

892
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,312
I was thinking.
If you went to see the shrink...

893
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,437
Wouldn't cost nothing.
Talk about Peyton. It could help.

894
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,073
I don't need to talk about Peyton.

895
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,108
I could tell them you got stressed out
on the job. It wouldn't be a lie.

896
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,669
Honk if you're screwing him.
Save a plane ticket.

897
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,239
Where'd you get that?

898
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,319
Shirley Magnuson.

899
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,672
Says she thinks it's phony.
Says I'm setting her up.

900
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,750
Setting her up?

901
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,112
I take the picture,
get it slipped to her. She uses it.

902
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,477
I provide a perfectly
innocent explanation.

903
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,077
- Her candidate's a mudslinger.
- My God, you people.

904
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,873
Pretty good idea.

905
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,949
I wish I'd had it.

906
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,591
If you have to explain that picture,
can you do it?

907
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,469
Yes.

908
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,789
- Where's your bracelet?
- It's around.

909
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,308
You didn't lose it?

910
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,879
It's around.

911
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,309
What's the matter?

912
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,753
It's not my bracelet.

913
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,510
What?

914
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,633
Dad didn't have any clients
in Miami, did he?

915
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,229
He was with that cop's wife, huh?

916
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,078
What was going on?

917
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,273
Something.

918
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,112
I'm not sure what.

919
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,108
Were they serious?

920
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,912
That'd be my guess.

921
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,911
Do a lot of people know?

922
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,670
Leave a message. I'll call you back.

923
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,469
It's me.

924
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,309
Remember? From restricted parking?

925
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,471
So you picked Peyton.

926
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,151
And Cullen picked Peyton.

927
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,154
That's two-zip against the home team.

928
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,672
"Have we been introduced?"...

929
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,590
...she says, straightening her clothes.

930
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,029
I thought I should introduce myself
and fill you in on my plans.

931
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,912
I'm packing it in.

932
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,039
No. That sounds like suicide.

933
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,839
All I mean is, like you said,
sooner or later...

934
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,429
...everybody knows everything...

935
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,710
...and this'll be in the papers...

936
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,871
...and I can't handle that.

937
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,110
I can't let Jessica be mowed down...

938
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,589
...by gossip she had
nothing to do with.

939
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,757
But if I'm not in Congress,
if I'm out...

940
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,677
...it's not news anymore.

941
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,989
She's safe.

942
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,509
You know?

943
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,153
You do know, don't you?

944
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,151
You're the only one who does.

945
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,872
And I miss that.

946
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,270
Do me a favour.

947
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,709
Erase this.

948
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,071
God, I'm glad you're not there.

949
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,988
She's getting a lot of points
for showing up.

950
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,798
How are you guys doing?

951
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,312
Excuse me for just a minute.

952
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,473
My contribution.

953
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,629
If you quit, they win.

954
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,591
And the crash got us all.

955
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,472
Don't let them do that.

956
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,191
I'm not the only one involved.

957
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,870
She should know her mom's no quitter.

958
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,833
Wanna say how impressed I am
that you're staying in.

959
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,912
I have to say a few things.

960
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,479
The name of this group is
"Friends of Kay Chandler."

961
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,029
I'm sorry about that phone call.

962
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,117
We're not getting much sleep.

963
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,988
- I'm afraid of what's playing.
- Me too.

964
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,518
Might give it a try.
Turn in around 3.

965
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,228
Cullen would be proud of you.
I know you know.

966
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,717
I don't know how many times
I've introduced Kay Chandler.

967
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,272
Miss a lot between 3 and 5.

968
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,593
Australian football.

969
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,798
May I present your friend...

970
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,549
...your congresswoman...

971
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,399
Don't go away.

972
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,791
...your next representative for
the 2nd district of New Hampshire...

973
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,111
...Kay Spencer-Chandler!

974
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,470
Thank you.

975
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,117
Thank you, Richard. Thank you, all.

976
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,678
It's good to be home.

977
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,230
I wanted to say just a word.

978
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,638
Just a few words.

979
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,870
You're all being very nice to me.

980
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,516
I don't wanna disappoint you.

981
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,233
But I just don't wanna talk
politics tonight.

982
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,073
I'm just glad to be home.

983
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,151
Richard and Wendy, thank you so much.

984
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,470
Thanks, all of you, for your friendship,
for your support...

985
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,471
...for showing up here tonight.

986
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,189
Thanks.

987
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,119
I mean it.

988
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,552
Don't leave without me getting
a chance to talk to you.

989
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,358
We love you, Kay!

990
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,718
Be back first thing.

991
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,269
- Do you have the number?
- You told me 1 5 times already.

992
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,350
Sorry.

993
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,111
I wish I could get out of the party.

994
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,389
No way, missy.

995
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,989
Some of these are $1 000 folks.

996
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,072
I just wish I didn't have to go.

997
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,039
It was good of you to come.

998
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,832
It was our party. Kind of had to.

999
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,877
I appreciate it, that's all.

1000
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,709
Thank you.

1001
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,230
You get a ticket?

1002
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,749
It's a road map.

1003
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,910
Maybe someone thought
it fell out of my car.

1004
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,110
Listen, Kay.

1005
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,873
Time to commit.

1006
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,678
All the way in or not.

1007
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,069
If you're not running, we need to return
that fundraiser money quick.

1008
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,272
Maybe I'll take a day.
Do some thinking.

1009
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,719
I'll be around.

1010
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,359
I wondered if you'd come.

1011
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,517
Guy like you, girl like me.
What reason could there be not to?

1012
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,754
Sorry I'm late. I had to change
a few times and pack. I thought...

1013
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,910
...if I packed light, it'd look
like I knew what I was doing.

1014
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,829
But I didn't know what I was doing,
so I didn't know what to pack.

1015
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,758
Where are we exactly?

1016
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,909
Chesapeake Bay's
a couple miles that way.

1017
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,233
I won't make small talk. I don't want
there to be any junk between us.

1018
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,919
No littering.

1019
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,277
There's so many reasons
I might be doing this.

1020
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,472
I kept thinking,
I'll go one more mile...

1021
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,479
...then I'll turn around and...

1022
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,430
I was thinking about your mouth.

1023
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,871
Nobody knows who I am anymore.

1024
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,229
Nobody knows how easily I can do this.

1025
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,678
I know who you are.

1026
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,431
I have to know something.

1027
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,878
Are you a Democrat?

1028
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,678
What if I am?

1029
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,310
We talk.

1030
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,312
I give you books to read.

1031
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,280
I like it when there's
just the two of us.

1032
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,473
Are you hungry?

1033
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,473
I'm hungry.

1034
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,788
No TV?

1035
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,788
Is there a phone?

1036
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,708
Not so far.

1037
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,473
What's that like?

1038
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,629
Quiet.

1039
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,277
What is this? Do you know?

1040
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,073
Heineken.

1041
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,272
The start of something?

1042
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,592
That's what I thought.

1043
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,710
I want to know who is this woman
who's wearing my clothes...

1044
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,678
...and using my body?

1045
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,278
Is she permanent?

1046
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,276
Or is she only around when you are?

1047
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,158
Let's hide out here for a few years
and run for the border.

1048
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,869
I always thought
when I had my time in...

1049
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,678
...I'd like to live down here.

1050
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,357
Start a little security service.

1051
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,439
The raccoons are knocking over
the garbage cans?

1052
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,271
A lot of Washington, Baltimore people
have places here.

1053
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,158
They think they'll get robbed.

1054
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,912
You had plans.

1055
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,269
I don't think we had any plans.

1056
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,678
I always wanted a boat.

1057
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,479
One you could sleep on.

1058
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,878
We've got a boat.
Defence Rests. Get it?

1059
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,993
I've got a boat.

1060
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,394
I'll give it to you.

1061
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,110
I don't trust this
any more than you do.

1062
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,277
You're the only thing that's real.

1063
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,152
Let me ask you something tough.

1064
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,991
Are you sorry the plane went down?

1065
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,719
What are you doing?

1066
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,753
Just think about it.

1067
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,270
You can have it all back
the way it was.

1068
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,472
But you gotta take it all.

1069
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,478
He's lying.

1070
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,868
He's screwing another woman.
They laugh at how easy we are to fool.

1071
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,678
Stop. Don't do that.

1072
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,477
I'm done with them.

1073
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,831
Done with them.

1074
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,271
- The thing is...
- Stop.

1075
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,029
Come on.

1076
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,439
Let's go home.

1077
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,112
You know those kits that tell you
when you're pregnant?

1078
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,914
They should have one that tells you
when you're sane.

1079
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,994
I think they had a place they'd meet.
An apartment just makes sense.

1080
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,998
How could it make sense?

1081
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,711
No driving, no motels.

1082
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,310
If they did, they did.
They're on their own.

1083
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,476
This was in her desk at work.

1084
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,072
Is that why you drew the map?

1085
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,233
- Is that why you came to Concord?
- I didn't want you to quit.

1086
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,436
- People have keys.
- Did you see one like this?

1087
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,278
In his luggage maybe?

1088
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,676
So they had a place.

1089
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,319
They're not there anymore.

1090
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,033
And I don't care.

1091
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,032
I just don't care.

1092
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,512
Maybe you didn't lose that much.

1093
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,230
Or you're lying to yourself.

1094
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,871
The sun's going down.

1095
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,469
It's time to go.

1096
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,913
When will you be back?

1097
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,797
Roof's got a leak and I got some time.

1098
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,199
I thought I'd make it worse.

1099
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,829
Maybe we'll never get clear of how
we met. Maybe we'll never be alone.

1100
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,233
But I don't want us to lose
this chance because...

1101
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,549
...if it's just gonna be about them,
if it'll always be four of us--

1102
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,952
You be careful driving home.

1103
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,674
Thanks for driving
all the way to Concord.

1104
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,031
And for the contribution.

1105
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,069
And I don't even live
in your district.

1106
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,712
You have one message.

1107
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,911
It's me, Wendy.
Where've you been?

1108
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:53,119
I have $50, 000 from your friends
and neighbours, and nobody to give it to.

1109
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,472
What do you wanna do?
Lunch tomorrow? Give me a call.

1110
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,428
Come on, Alcee.

1111
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,318
Just get me a picture of him.

1112
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,073
Headshot's okay.

1113
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,830
Give me the photo from his I.D.

1114
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,392
I'll call you when I get back.

1115
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,719
I want Jessica out there, smiling like
Chelsea and keeping her mouth shut.

1116
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,190
Her job is good kid. No opinions.

1117
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,319
She can wear jeans.
No short shorts, no bra tops.

1118
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,033
No Jessica.

1119
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,759
She's in school.

1120
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,748
School? We're trying
to win an election here.

1121
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,390
No Jessica. I don't want her--

1122
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:04,032
I think I may be losing
what it takes to lie.

1123
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,078
- This may become a problem.
- Let's take a break.

1124
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,673
- I don't like this.
- Just asking.

1125
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,151
We're telling the whole southeast side
an officer's a murder suspect.

1126
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,870
You think George won't hear about this?
You're not supposed to be working.

1127
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,513
That's why you're here.

1128
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,478
Shyla? You in there?

1129
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,879
Anybody home?

1130
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,832
We need to talk. Can we come in?

1131
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,229
No, you can't come in.

1132
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,710
You wanna come out?

1133
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,953
Folks see me talk to you,
get my ass in trouble.

1134
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,589
Goddamn it, Dutch!

1135
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,108
Come on, man! Come on!

1136
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,270
- You got no right in here!
- I won't hurt you.

1137
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,114
Let's go. You got no warrant.
She said "no."

1138
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,669
If my brother faced 1 5 months
in detention...

1139
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,633
...it wouldn't hurt to look at
one picture. You seen this man?

1140
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,558
That's Big George.
I see him all over.

1141
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,597
Did you see him
when we found the body?

1142
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,910
You didn't maybe see him dump
that man in the dumpster?

1143
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,713
Take another look.
How's your brother?

1144
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,029
Any chance he'll get out?

1145
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,319
Okay, that's it! You didn't see him.
Sorry to have disturbed you.

1146
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,120
I want you out right now!
Out now!

1147
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,438
What's the matter with you?

1148
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,069
Look, Dutch, I'm sorry about your wife.

1149
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,311
You want George to come after you?

1150
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,670
Is that it? So you can shoot him?

1151
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,478
You got tired of working cheap?

1152
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,873
You know he's guilty.
Why are you protecting him?

1153
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,279
Is he paying you now?

1154
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,079
Oh, man.

1155
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,869
Here.

1156
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,119
I feel like a bagman.

1157
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,868
There's cash in there, so be careful.

1158
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,270
Well, guess what?

1159
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,279
Cullen was having an affair.

1160
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,676
Tru says Ahi tuna's
incredible here.

1161
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,519
That's why he went to Miami.

1162
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,389
How long?

1163
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,473
What's the difference?

1164
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:27,872
You think being deaf, dumb and blind
is a liability for a congresswoman?

1165
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,240
I think he kept an apartment
I don't know about.

1166
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:39,077
- Would you like to hear our specials?
- Give us a minute.

1167
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,958
And I thought maybe...

1168
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,078
...Cullen had told Richard...

1169
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,079
...and Richard had said something.

1170
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,951
Come on. It's only adultery.

1171
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,553
Nobody gives a damn
except the people it happens to.

1172
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,279
It's not happening to--

1173
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,072
My God.

1174
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,560
Please give me a chance to explain.

1175
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,429
Shut up.

1176
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,672
Kay, it didn't mean...

1177
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,794
I was gonna tell you.

1178
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,679
Where is it?

1179
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,589
It's been over a year.
I haven't been there--

1180
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,989
Where is it?

1181
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,908
The Colton Building on Rhode Island.

1182
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,239
It was just stupid.

1183
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,233
I'm not hungry.
If you could get the check, please.

1184
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,038
Stop, please, Kay.

1185
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,079
Just listen to me, okay, because...

1186
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,391
...if we don't see you,
Richard'll know.

1187
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,991
I can't keep seeing you so your husband
won't know you've been screwing mine.

1188
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,230
Kay, please.

1189
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,878
I need to tell you...

1190
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,033
...how rotten I feel.

1191
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,272
Let me go, punkin.

1192
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,152
Hello. It's me.

1193
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,429
Bad time?

1194
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,239
How's the roof?

1195
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,749
Lousy.

1196
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,194
Something wrong?

1197
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,514
Wanna get something to eat?

1198
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,639
Sure. I'm not that hungry,
but I wanna see you.

1199
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,759
Everything all right?

1200
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,078
Weren't you ever tempted
to cheat on Peyton?

1201
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,199
Tempted? Yeah.

1202
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,630
Sure.

1203
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,388
Why didn't you?

1204
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,839
Maybe I did.

1205
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,439
I don't think so.

1206
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,633
I wonder how they got their
laundry done, if they had a place.

1207
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,714
You think this...

1208
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,672
...everything that happened...

1209
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,679
You think it's...

1210
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,872
...made you different?

1211
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,229
Different how?

1212
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,073
More suspicious.

1213
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,829
Maybe.

1214
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,518
But here I am.

1215
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,953
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

1216
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,590
I knew we should've gone
to McDonald's.

1217
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,758
I have to try to get elected.

1218
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,837
I lost a friend today...

1219
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,317
...being suspicious.

1220
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,079
What if you don't get elected?

1221
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,038
Country goes to hell...

1222
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,078
...and I go home.

1223
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,799
For keeps.

1224
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,630
But you're gonna beat this guy, right?

1225
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,673
When I get back...

1226
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,949
I'll be here.

1227
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,278
I'll nail his ass.

1228
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,709
Here you go, Clara.

1229
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,319
Back Friday.

1230
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,828
Wait up a second.

1231
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,197
You got some dry cleaning.

1232
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:55,950
Sorry.

1233
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,991
Saks Fifth Avenue.
Employees' entrance.

1234
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,229
I'll get him.

1235
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,190
Sorry, Dutch.

1236
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,668
Ladies' room.

1237
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:30,830
Mary Claire.

1238
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,318
You wouldn't believe
all the keys I've got.

1239
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,830
I got a key to the Vic Tanny's
in Rochester.

1240
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,118
I've got keys to the ones
in Westchester.

1241
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,237
I don't think there was an apartment.

1242
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,677
She was always here.
There wasn't time.

1243
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,229
No, wait.

1244
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,358
You know, she gave me
a phone number once.

1245
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,830
She was on her way to a meeting--

1246
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,679
Just a minute.

1247
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,070
This is it.

1248
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,872
In the bottom, in pencil.

1249
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,072
Go right ahead.

1250
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,511
Can I have the 911 supervisor?

1251
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:23,989
Sergeant Van Den Broeck.

1252
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,319
D.C. Internal Affairs, 9114.

1253
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:30,109
I need an address
for a telephone number.

1254
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,869
How long did you know?

1255
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,949
Did you know when you came to Miami?

1256
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,029
How could you think--?

1257
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,952
When you came to my cabin,
did you know?

1258
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,273
I found out yesterday.

1259
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,872
So you knew last night.

1260
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,799
When were you gonna tell me?

1261
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,034
I thought...

1262
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,953
I thought maybe...

1263
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,831
...years from now...

1264
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,792
...when it's behind us.

1265
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,199
What did you find?

1266
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,549
Nothing.

1267
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,119
Dutch, you weren't...

1268
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,350
We had a pact.

1269
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,319
Then why are you here?

1270
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,591
I wanna finish it. I want it over.

1271
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,071
That your purse? What'd you find?

1272
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,679
What did you find?

1273
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,231
There's nothing here.

1274
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,113
Oh, Christ.

1275
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,470
I can smell her perfume.

1276
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,273
Stop it, Dutch.

1277
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,039
There's nothing here.

1278
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:48,069
There's gotta be something left...

1279
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,239
...some sign of--

1280
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,230
Stop it!

1281
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,479
You'll never find
what you're looking for. Never.

1282
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,078
You wanna know why.

1283
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,430
And there is no why.

1284
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:19,990
Don't.

1285
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:34,068
If you check in, I'm heading for
the airport early. Meet me for coffee.

1286
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,111
Hi, it's me. I'm running late.

1287
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:41,750
There was something I needed to do.

1288
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:46,749
Go without me. I'll get the next
plane and meet you at the hotel.

1289
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,430
What are we doing? Do you know?

1290
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,271
We made love that morning.

1291
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,237
That's why she was late.

1292
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,189
Get an ambulance!

1293
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,788
I'm okay.

1294
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,270
Get out of the car! Get out!

1295
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,713
Help!

1296
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,952
Kay Chandler, congresswoman.

1297
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,471
Police report said her husband got it on
with Van Den Broeck's wife.

1298
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,030
He kept a love shack in the building.

1299
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,309
You all right?

1300
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:07,509
The press is out there
and they know you're here.

1301
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,712
They could get hungry
and go somewhere for a hamburger.

1302
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,638
How we gonna handle this?

1303
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:17,673
"Handle it" is when you got a client
who'll tell you what's going on.

1304
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:22,190
They'll wanna know just how well
the congresswoman knows the cop.

1305
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,396
- How will we handle this?
- I don't know.

1306
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,839
If we can get back to New Hampshire
and let this age a day...

1307
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,630
We'll leave through the basement.

1308
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,079
He's right, Kay.

1309
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,479
What time is it?

1310
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,230
- It's almost midnight.
- Somebody stole my watch.

1311
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,679
Where's Alcee?

1312
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,671
He said he'd come by tomorrow.

1313
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,270
I was trying to catch up with you.

1314
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,072
What were you going to say?

1315
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:40,274
I don't know what I was gonna say.
I just...

1316
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,158
I just didn't want you to leave.
Not like that, anyway.

1317
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:48,397
Welcome back. Hungry?

1318
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,789
Where's my watch?

1319
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,433
They need you in X-ray.

1320
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,874
Listen...

1321
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:05,070
...I probably never would've told you
about the place either.

1322
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,559
All I wanted...

1323
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,712
What I want, really...

1324
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:17,270
...is just to find some way...

1325
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,269
...to let her go...

1326
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,919
...and move on.

1327
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,631
I don't know how you do that.

1328
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,519
Neither do I.

1329
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,438
It's not a crime, Dutch.

1330
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,158
You loved your wife.

1331
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,879
And you still do.

1332
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,954
All set. Let me see
if I can find some orderlies.

1333
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,872
Will you hang around?

1334
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:03,554
I can't.

1335
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,428
You're supposed to be nice.
I've been shot.

1336
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,870
We did okay, Dutch.

1337
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,751
We did the best we could...

1338
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,357
...under the circumstances.

1339
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:28,959
We ready, sergeant?

1340
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,674
It's time for you to go. Me too.

1341
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,079
Will that be all right?

1342
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,989
So long, Kay.

1343
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,749
Here she comes.

1344
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,991
Can you tell us what you were doing...?

1345
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:05,793
What's the sergeant's condition?

1346
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:08,952
I've gotta catch a plane,
but if you can make it short...

1347
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:13,359
We're told your husband had an affair
with Van Den Broeck's wife.

1348
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,913
They had an apartment, and that's
where you were. Is that correct?

1349
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:23,839
Yes, it is.

1350
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,393
Characterize your relationship
with the sergeant.

1351
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:34,872
The sergeant's wife was killed on the
plane that went down with my husband.

1352
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:39,072
I met the sergeant
a few days after that day.

1353
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:44,631
He was a friend when I needed a friend.
I hope he feels the same way.

1354
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,479
So you're just friends?

1355
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:48,912
Just friends.

1356
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,877
We are surely friends.

1357
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,034
We've seen each other
through something...

1358
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:59,718
We're more than friends.
We're survivors.

1359
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,274
You'll have to excuse me.
I have to get home.

1360
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,472
Can you tell us more
about the sergeant's condition?

1361
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,074
- See you Friday, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

1362
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:10,479
Bye, Mrs. Chandler.

1363
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:11,829
Merry Christmas.

1364
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:14,588
Merry Christmas. Do I know you?

1365
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,434
I'm Tad Baker.
I work for Mr. Cornelius.

1366
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,073
You said we could...

1367
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,878
Yeah, sure. Make yourselves at home.

1368
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:06,749
Hello, Kay.

1369
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:08,229
Hi, sergeant.

1370
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,709
Lieutenant.

1371
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:13,597
They made me a lieutenant.
All I had to do was get shot.

1372
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,633
Can I get you something?
Stoli on the rocks.

1373
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,109
I haven't had one of those in a while.

1374
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:23,473
I got a plane.
I don't have time.

1375
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,397
What's with those New Hampshire voters?
Are they crazy?

1376
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:30,070
They could tell
I didn't want the job.

1377
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,870
Or I wanted it. I just didn't
wanna do what you have to do to get it.

1378
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,189
So you're out of work.

1379
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,593
Guess I am.

1380
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,598
Are you as well as you look?

1381
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,558
Leg's a little stiff.

1382
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:52,030
But I think I'm gonna be okay.

1383
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:53,869
You?

1384
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:58,993
How's football in Australia?

1385
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,477
I tune in once in a while.

1386
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,472
Not like before.

1387
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,033
I was a real fan.

1388
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,078
I gotta tell you,
I thought I might run into you here.

1389
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:16,469
Where are you going?

1390
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,273
That's the thing. Nowhere.

1391
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:23,870
I called your office,
and they said that you were...

1392
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,077
...headed home, so...

1393
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,638
My flight's overbooked and I--

1394
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,190
Go later.

1395
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,512
Take another plane.

1396
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:52,518
It's my Christmas present,
running into you.

1397
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,748
What'd you get me?

1398
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,273
How about...

1399
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,189
...I call you up sometime
in New Hampshire?

1400
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,873
And say what?

1401
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,273
Say...

1402
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,313
..."You wanna go to a movie?"

1403
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,473
What do you say?

1404
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:37,551
Wouldn't that be something?

1405
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,000
