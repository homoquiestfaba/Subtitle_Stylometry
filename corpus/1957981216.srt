1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,722
<i>It started</i>
<i>with the light.</i>

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,826
<i>And from the light came...</i>

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,895
<i>the darkness.</i>

4
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:29,898
<i>The gods on Earth</i>
<i>had children...</i>

5
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,833
<i>and the children</i>
<i>wanted the light</i>

6
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,368
<i>to shine on themselves,</i>

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,404
<i>and them alone.</i>

8
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,309
<i>Humanity drowned</i>

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,179
<i>to the ego of the gods.</i>

10
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,415
<i>A truce was made</i>
<i>to preserve humanity.</i>

11
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,921
<i>Godhood was to remain a myth...</i>

12
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:55,255
<i>...and their existence</i>
<i>hidden from humanity.</i>

13
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,660
<i>This was the law set</i>
<i>by the gods...</i>

14
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,762
<i>...for men.</i>

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,765
<i>But the question never asked:</i>

16
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:10,103
<i>...was there anything else</i>
<i>between gods and men?</i>

17
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,015
She will never forgive you.

18
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,532
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

19
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,076
Ah!

20
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,696
Just a reminder,
if you kill her,

21
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,099
us being here
is a waste of time.

22
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,970
The night is young.

23
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,682
My sister is very...

24
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,218
possessive

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,620
with the unique number
of our existence.

26
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,989
Please... Please...
You can take anything.

27
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,926
No, no, no, little butterfly.
To be called a thief...

28
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,362
is an insult that I wear
as a badge of pride

29
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,232
but my sister...

30
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,634
She sees the beauty in violence.

31
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,205
War to her is the best
means of communication.

32
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,713
I wouldn't call her
a thief if I were you.

33
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:41,883
Okay...

34
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,242
What is happening to me?

35
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:46,113
Running away,
leaving your guests behind...

36
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,716
That was so rude.

37
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,857
Please, please,
what do you want?

38
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,091
What are you?

39
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,229
I'm... I'm Mina Bihary.
I-I'm a teacher.

40
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,631
I-I-I volunteer
at an animal shelter.

41
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,466
-I teach self-defense
to abused--
-What are you?

42
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,468
I don't understand
what you mean.

43
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,589
<i>♪ I once was a bird</i>
<i>Who flew down the Nile ♪</i>

44
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,625
No, no, please! Please.

45
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,392

00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,431

00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,569

51
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,741
Please don't! Please.

52
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,645
Give me back my hand. Please.
No... Please!

53
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,187
She's human.

54
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,064
You didn't take control.
She gave it to you.

55
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,001
Her thoughts,
memories, feelings are... pure.

56
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,104
Because she made it so.

57
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,307
I was inside
her head, everything
in there is authentic.

58
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,576
Let's just kill her.

59
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,645
She dies, we know she's human.

60
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:28,616
She lives,
then we deal with what she is.

61
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:34,555
Please... No, please,
I'm not who you think I am.

62
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,091
Okay?
I'm... My name is Mina Bihary,

63
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,627
I was born and raised
by my mother in Joxton City.

64
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,662
I... I went to UMES.

65
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,298
I'm a Music Teacher
at Joxton Middle School.

66
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,234
What a sad life.

67
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,737
Let's let her live.

68
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:55,643
Your hunger for knowledge,
it's unholy.

69
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,913
I am not the only one here.

70
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,481
We're both looking
for the same answers.

71
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,386
-Are we?
-Let's let her live.

72
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,588
We won't regret it.

73
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,857
Thank you.

74
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,961
Let me tell you a story.

75
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:32,880
Daniel Oxborne wakes up
every day at 4:49 am...

76
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,017
just a few seconds
before his alarm rings.

77
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,654
Who... What is this?
Where are we?

78
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,791
Never interrupt the narrator.

79
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:52,033
<i>He's a simple,</i>
<i>yet complicated man...</i>

80
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:57,204
<i>living in an ordinary,</i>
<i>yet extraordinary history.</i>

81
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:00,007
<i>Existing just to live</i>
<i>a life he can't afford,</i>

82
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,977
<i>then procreate, and die.</i>

83
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,349
<i>His weight, and troubles,</i>
<i>and cares, he keeps to himself.</i>

84
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,752
<i>He grabs his lunch,</i>
<i>never looks at his wife,</i>

85
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,822
<i>gives her a peck on the cheek,</i>
<i>then walks out the door.</i>

86
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:19,627
<i>Just like he's done 827 times</i>
<i>before in their marriage.</i>

87
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,500
-Daniel.
-Ariel.

88
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,246
<i>But this moment...</i>

89
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,017
<i>this particular</i>
<i>second in time...</i>

90
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,955
he stopped.

91
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,327
- He can't see us.
- True.

92
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:58,799
-Why did he stop?
-Why did he stop...

93
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:06,941
I understand the selfish
and selfless nature of humanity,

94
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,646
their cruelty
and their kindness,

95
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,184
their greed
and their generosity.

96
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,690
But this particular moment
in his humanity...

97
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,062
I don't understand.

98
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,032
<i>He stopped just because.</i>

99
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,337
Just because.

100
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,903
What's wrong?

101
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,751
Xena, for goodness sake,
tell me what's going on.

102
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,087
I don't love you anymore.

103
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,627
Seriously,
what's this all about?

104
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,864
You're not listening to me.
You never listen.

105
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,268
I don't love you anymore.

106
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,958
I don't understand.

107
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,096
What'd I do?

108
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,673
The moment I saw you,
I could have sworn
the Earth stood still.

109
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,613
From then till now,
I've never loved you less.

110
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,518
I know I've failed at showing
you how much I care about you.

111
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:32,920
I've put work...

112
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,023
this house, and all
the other crap in our lives
ahead of the both of us.

113
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,532
We can get through this.

114
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,171
Xena, please. Say something.

115
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,143
I woke up next to you.

116
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:02,783
I saw you sleeping peacefully
with a smile on your face.

117
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,287
And then I realized...

118
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,558
I was disgusted
with the look of you...

119
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,698
the smell of you...
the feel of you...

120
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,466
even the thought of you.

121
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,906
I closed my eyes and I said
I loved you a hundred times.

122
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,744
And every time,
I could not make the words true.

123
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,553
You're a good man.

124
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,723
But you are not good for me.

125
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,165
Seventeen years.

126
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,772
You just want to flush
seventeen years away.

127
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,608
We're not
in high school anymore.

128
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,714
The girl you loved then
doesn't exist.

129
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,621
It doesn't make any sense.
It's just postpartum stress.

130
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,791
Postpartum happens
after the child is born.

131
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,960
This has been brewing for years.

132
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,202
It's over, Daniel.

133
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,877
Xena, think about the baby.

134
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,079
I am.

135
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:54,995
Is she mine?

136
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,566
Oh, classy Daniel!

137
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,604
I'm a cheating whore,
just because I don't want
to be married to you anymore?

138
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,110
Is she mine?

139
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:12,946
Get out!

140
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,755
For seventeen years
we've been trying
to have a child...

141
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,025
and look at you,
all of a sudden pregnant.

142
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,829
I would like you
to leave the house.

143
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,369
I need you to leave now!

144
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,556
What are you doing? Daniel!

145
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,959
Daniel...

146
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:03,096
Daniel! I said, I want you to--

147
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,518
Is she mine?

148
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,220
You have a gun.

149
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,058
When did you get a gun?

150
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,868
Is she mine?

151
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,941
I was faithful!

152
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,048
Your life is the only life
I want with mine.

153
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,853
Damn you!

154
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,727
Where do you want me
to shoot you?

155
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,600
Wait...

156
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:14,969
The baby.

157
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:19,139
Think about the baby.

158
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:23,778
-She isn't mine!
-Please, Daniel. Please.

159
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,481
-I should shoot the bastard.
-No, no, no! Please!

160
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,117
She's yours, she's yours.
Please, don't shoot
your daughter.

161
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:35,322
-You're lying to me!
-No I'm not, Daniel!

162
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,825
I'm not! I'm not!

163
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:40,227
You're the only man
I've ever been with!

164
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,776
I...

165
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,445
I don't understand
what's happening.

166
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,851
I love you too much.

167
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,975
What happened?

168
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,988
Did you kill him?

169
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,241
I'm at 443 Park Heights,
my brother-in-law just--

170
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,878
Your water broke.

171
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,248
And my sister's water
just broke.

172
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,052
I can't hold it back!

173
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:14,154
-What's the contraction rate?
-Contractions?

174
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,657
The baby's coming now!

175
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,592
She said the baby's coming now.

176
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,796
A delay? Well, tell them
not to take the freeway!

177
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,702
She wants to talk to you.

178
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,772
He took a gun
and blew his brains out!

179
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,707
Get someone here now!

180
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:34,942
Okay...

181
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,441
Okay...

182
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,410
Come on. Up.

183
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,051
Wait, wait.

184
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,658
Okay.

185
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,129
Come on. Breathe.

186
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:32,265
Breathe, Xena, breathe.
We can do this.

187
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,802
That son-of-a-bitch
blew his brains out!

188
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,707
Don't look at him, look at me.

189
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:42,977
This is about your child.

190
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,814
Keep pushing. Eyes on me.
I can see it crowning.

191
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,252
The bastard!
This is what he wanted.

192
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:56,256
The baby's coming. Keep pushing!

193
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:02,029
Almost there. One last push.

194
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,933
He was suffocating me.

195
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,504
He took everything away from me.

196
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,939
Keep pushing, the baby's coming.

197
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:21,716
I had to keep holding
back to save his ego.

198
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,253
Almost there. Keep pushing!

199
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,795
I needed to breathe!

200
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,077
Why isn't she crying?

201
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,714
Why isn't she crying?

202
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:58,586
Give me my baby.

203
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,355
Give me my baby.

204
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,160
Give me my baby!

205
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,436
I'm so sorry.

206
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,911
Why am I here?

207
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,379
Wait for it.

208
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:35,089
<i>♪ I once was a bird</i>
<i>Who flew down the Nile ♪</i>

209
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:43,631
<i>♪ Around and around</i>
<i>I searched for my smile ♪</i>

210
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:52,405
<i>♪ Through the hills so high</i>
<i>And the valley so low ♪</i>

211
00:22:54,842 --> 00:23:00,214
<i>♪ I searched and I searched</i>
<i>For my forgotten soul ♪</i>

212
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,217
You sing that song.

213
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,430
I know why you brought me here.

214
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,536
And why is that?

215
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,839
To see the beauty
of life.

216
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:29,810
To understand how and why
we should appreciate humanity.

217
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,924
I brought you here,
because you are that child.

218
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,528
Mina.

219
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,699
You will live your life
to its fullest.

220
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,439
What the...
Who the hell are you people?

221
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,314
-You're serious?
-I always make an entrance.

222
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:43,084
You're trying to impress her?
A human?

223
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:46,954
I always wanted to see the look
on their face when I did that.

224
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:50,324
Well, let's hope you haven't
impressed her to death.

225
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,446
- Cheers.
- Help! Help me! Help me!

226
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,281
Please! Please, help me!

227
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,884
I need help!
Please! Can you help me?

228
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,654
They're all sheep.

229
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,190
We say the same lie long enough
and it becomes real.

230
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:26,560
Our guy is too far gone;
no one sane is going
to vote for him.

231
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,563
We got him elected once,
we can do it again.

232
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,299
All we've got is fear.
We can't use hope or empathy.

233
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,002
Can't you see me? Hello!

234
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:37,171
We need to build on that fear.

235
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:40,174
Let them see that
their country is seeping
out of their fingertips.

236
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,177
What we need is a reason
for the colored people
to stay home.

237
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,579
Crazy, isn't it?

238
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:48,082
One minute
"colored" is offensive,
the next, it's alright.

239
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:51,585
No, no, no.
The politically correct
term is "people of color."

240
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,456
Seriously,
we can't lose this election.

241
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,827
Doing everything
we can. We have a few
"me too-ers" on payroll.

242
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,496
-They'd come out for our guy.
-Uh, little too on the nose,

243
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,732
but they would come out
against the other guy.

244
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,634
We need more.

245
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,804
We're running out of options.

246
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:14,041
If we lose
this goddamn election,
we're in handcuffs.

247
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,709
Why can't they see me?

248
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,745
Death of an immediate
family member.

249
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,448
Nah, he loves
his family too much.
Never'd go for it.

250
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,383
But I like where your head's at.

251
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,785
Assassination attempt.
It doesn't have to hit him.

252
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,589
No, it needs to hit him.

253
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,959
A graze on the shoulder?
We put it on the radical left.

254
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,198
Argh!

255
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:42,169
Everyone hates
those bastards.

256
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:00,154
Why have you been
following me all week?

257
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,124
All week?

258
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,960
How...

259
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,597
<i>I saw you three days ago.</i>

260
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,264
<i>You saw me?</i>

261
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,666
You knew who
she was three days ago?

262
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,168
I don't know what she is.

263
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,137
But you were
watching her.

264
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,404
I was.

265
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,040
I tell you everything!

266
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,977
There is more to this story.

267
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,913
There is always more
to every story.

268
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,517
If she was able to see me,
she is no human.

269
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,718
She isn't going anywhere.

270
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:35,689
You aren't here for me,
you are here for father.

271
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:40,427
I am just a messenger.

272
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:45,266
Well, then, messenger...

273
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,202
you will relay
every message to me.

274
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,375
You want to do
this in front of her?

275
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:57,244
She is going to die anyways.

276
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,316
She is not human.

277
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,886
As I said, whatever she is...

278
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,522
she will die.

279
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,059
You came to me,
I didn't come to you.

280
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:14,295
I owe you no knowledge.

281
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:19,200
I will not ask again.
You will tell me everything.

282
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,404
I am not confirming
that I am here on
father's behalf.

283
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:27,374
But remember,
he is a very powerful man.

284
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,476
I don't care.

285
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,045
And if I choose
to keep it to myself?

286
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,049
You will feel my wrath.

287
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,324
Wait!

288
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:01,610
I yield.

289
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,046
After all...

290
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,384
who am I to go against
the great Athena?

291
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:17,358
I'm here because of the truce.

292
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,128
The truce.

293
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:25,799
Athena, the goddess of war.
How is that possible?

294
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,769
I mean, you're-- You look...

295
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,675
Black?

296
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,910
No, I-I wasn't--
I mean, it's not what--

297
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:40,814
Would it make more
sense if I looked like this?

298
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,418
In her defense, Athena was
created by the Greeks.

299
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,987
It wouldn't hurt to have
Mediterranean skin,
or even their accent.

300
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,223
Last I checked,

301
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:50,592
Hermes the Mediterranean

302
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,259
wasn't red-haired, green-eyes

303
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,794
with an American accent.

304
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:56,163
If Charlton Heston
can play Moses...

305
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,133
I can be a ginger American.

306
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,405
Come to think of it,
have you ever seen a movie
with a Black Adam or Eve?

307
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:06,574
Huh.

308
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,880
The ancient Greeks did recognize
differences in physical traits.

309
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:15,684
But the non-Greeks...

310
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,055
They were the barbarians.

311
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:27,194
A Greek in that time
was whoever adopted the culture.

312
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,598
We digress.

313
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,671
Tell me about the truce.

314
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,474
Everything we do

315
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,777
has to be logically justifiable

316
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:45,312
to prevent humans
from knowing we exist.

317
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:46,715
What does it have
to do with her?

318
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,516
It has everything
to do with her.

319
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:52,620
The truce, as we know it,
only applies to beings
like you and I.

320
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,223
But there is another truce...

321
00:30:57,726 --> 00:31:00,361
...one that extends
to people like her.

322
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,797
Exceptions to our being.

323
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,901
Exceptional beings.

324
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,204
I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

325
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:16,310
In that truce, Joxton City
is open ground to everything...

326
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,815
...every creature, every being.

327
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:25,620
And she is...
one of those beings.

328
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,957
I don't know for sure.

329
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,226
All I know...

330
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,663
is that she's never been
outside Joxton City.

331
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,399
And her birth was...

332
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,570
exceptional.

333
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:52,346
What makes you so special?
- She saw me.

334
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:55,315
And you saw her
with the Old Man.

335
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,091
Tell me about the other truce.

336
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:07,294
I just told you
everything I know.

337
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:10,598
And I'm supposed
to believe you've told me
everything father told you?

338
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:17,505
-Father... told me none of this.
-Well, how do you know?

339
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,343
Leto's bastard.

340
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,713
Apollo.

341
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,072
Oh, so sorry.

342
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:01,583
Hey, Toni.

343
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,619
Vinnie says Apollo wants
a Dirty Sanchez.

344
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:08,255
-Say... Say what?
-A Dirty Sanchez?

345
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,557
Ugh.

346
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:13,260
Lord have mercy.

347
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,964
Annamae, darling,
Vinnie is screwing with you.

348
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:19,299
He said to remind you,
it smells really good
and tastes even better.

349
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,568
Ugh.

350
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,571
Here, give this
to Barry downstairs.

351
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,278
There's a spill
in the hallway.

352
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,383
I'm so sorry.

353
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,154
Sultanzade,
you misunderstood me.

354
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,458
This is not a negotiation,
it was a declaration.

355
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:48,228
Mr. Apollo does not
compromise art for anybody.

356
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:51,866
Quality is what it is.
He can't draw blood from stone.

357
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,735
The Haseki has no talent.

358
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,771
Let me ask.

359
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,974
The Sultanzade
is willing to up his offer

360
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,010
for the time being
for the Haseki.

361
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,645
Are you agreeable to that?

362
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,584
Mr. Apollo will use
the Haseki's skills
in that capacity,

363
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,351
but you will need
to make him happy.

364
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,420
Much happier than your offer.

365
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:41,616
You hedonistic,
incestuous horndog.

366
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,451
-Thank you.
-It wasn't a compliment.

367
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:46,153
Oh, I don't care.

368
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,924
How is that virginity
thing working out for you?

369
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:55,429
Do you know why I find you
the most fascinating creature,
ever?

370
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,031
I've come to collect.

371
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:58,098
You're the only one of us who
believes

372
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,466
she can defeat father.

373
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,837
-I never said that.
-But you believe it.

374
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,339
Hm.

375
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,776
<i>The Storm</i>
<i>on the Sea of Galilee.</i>

376
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,012
I want my Rembrandt back.

377
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:16,483
You do know that painting
depicts Jesus calming a storm?

378
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:21,154
I believe you called him an...
"inconsequential poet."

379
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,323
At the time.

380
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:27,762
But with thirty percent
of the human population
following his words,

381
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:32,533
it's obvious I was wrong
and you were right.

382
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:38,539
-My painting.
-You don't care
about the painting.

383
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,843
What do you really want?

384
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,880
What do you have to give?

385
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:52,152
I say humans
and you see puny pawns.

386
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:55,657
But I see a better
version of us.

387
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,931
Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.

388
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:07,367
There is no better
version than a god.

389
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,169
Gods.

390
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:20,180
The first time I talked
to you was 4,800 years ago,

391
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,283
watching Noah drunk
in his fields.

392
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:28,723
At the time, we were enamored
with the scientific genius
of Noah's Ark.

393
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:36,731
Could we fathom the internet,
cellphones, computers,
jets, driverless cars?

394
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:41,569
The answer is no,
we couldn't imagine it.

395
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,707
Something as simple
as their music,

396
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:50,410
their arts,
we are not capable of it.

397
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,583
Get together
all the so-called gods you know,

398
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:58,586
and see if you
can replicate a Rembrandt.

399
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:05,258
We need the humans to adapt,
to change, to survive.

400
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:14,569
-Athena...
-You call this
a better version of me?

401
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,738
Athena, let him go!

402
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,207
Is he not a god?

403
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,341
Is he not capable of protecting
himself

404
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:24,178
from an outdated
version of his existence?

405
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,847
Let him go!

406
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,850
Oh, you like
this human, do you?

407
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:31,119
What makes him so special?

408
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:34,522
Has he written something that
has never been written before?

409
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:37,759
Or maybe he sings like an angel.

410
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,195
You came here for a reason.
If anything happens to him--

411
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:42,663
You'll what?

412
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:47,802
All I have to do is apply
but a pinch of pressure,

413
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:52,907
and your beautiful, young lover
will die like rotten flesh,

414
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,009
and not live like a god.

415
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,747
The painting is in the closet.

416
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,315
We are way past foreplay.

417
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,620
I see the thief has stolen
knowledge from me.

418
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:09,891
- How did he find out?
- He has his ways.

419
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:13,528
<i>Tabula rasa.</i>

420
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,396
Let him go.

421
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,670
Oh, he's fine.

422
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:28,543
Remember the pyramids,
when men were men.

423
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,547
Now, they can barely
carry their own weight.

424
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:35,683
You come into my home...

425
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:38,753
...disrespect me,

426
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,355
and you manhandle my guests!

427
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,695
What are you
going to do about it?

428
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,331
Attempt to punch me
to a bloody pulp?

429
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:54,602
Battle me from dusk till dawn?

430
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,537
Stamp your seniority on me?

431
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,707
No.

432
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,043
I'll report you to father.

433
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:08,516
-I thought we were passed that.
-No, we're not.

434
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,318
You disrespected my home.

435
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,221
You disrespected me!

436
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,455
Hm.

437
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:23,998
Animals in a zoo are fed,
treated when sick,

438
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,067
and given excellent
accommodation.

439
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,238
Animals in the wild
hunt to feed,

440
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:34,775
rely on time
to heal, and fight for safe
places to lay their heads.

441
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,879
Get to your point.

442
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:42,216
You are a god who knows nothing,
and I will throw you
into the wild.

443
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,922
I will give you the location
of The Man of the Spear,

444
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,557
the one older than you and I.

445
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:55,263
-He is real?
-He is very real
and he dies tonight.

446
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:59,233
-He died in the flood.
-No, he didn't.

447
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,669
And how can I trust
what you say?

448
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:05,339
You know where I live.
He is in the desert.

449
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:09,844
Thank you.

450
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,816
This is not an act of
generosity.

451
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:20,688
This is a curse and a burden
I have now shared with you.

452
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:26,794
Now leave.

453
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,747
And how does Apollo
know so much?

454
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,448
It's his gift.

455
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,385
This goes beyond his gift.

456
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:53,888
He knows things.

457
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:58,159
Things you and I will
never be privy to.

458
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,427
Like the truce?

459
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,228
Even the day the old man dies.

460
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,297
And that's just a smidgen
of what he knows.

461
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,500
I wanted to beat
the information out of him.

462
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:13,107
-Why didn't you?
-Gods don't die.

463
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,076
But we feel pain.

464
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,045
He threatened to tell father.

465
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,082
Hm. Uh-hm.

466
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,596
What are we gonna do with you?

467
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:41,202
Oh, fuck.

468
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:57,618
Oh, great. We've been summoned.

469
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:02,223
What in high eternity
are the both of you doing?

470
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:05,726
This... is...
not what it looks like?

471
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,895
It's exactly what it looks like.

472
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:11,065
-I'm here on father's behest.
-Are you?

473
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:13,667
Is this the part
where we get a spanking?

474
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,137
Know your place, Athena.

475
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,340
And where's my place, Poseidon?

476
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:23,611
Legs spread apart like
all the earthly women
you pour your seed in.

477
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:26,547
You think I'm here for me.

478
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,885
There are so many lines
of no return
you are about to cross.

479
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:34,422
But we haven't crossed them.
We are within the truce.

480
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,257
For now.

481
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,093
You might find this hard
to believe, Athena, but...

482
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,695
you're very
important to all of us.

483
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:46,367
And the world we created
is the world they see.

484
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,235
But now this world
has a life of its own,

485
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:51,772
with laws, even
beyond our reasoning.

486
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:57,178
-It's just one human being.
-An exceptional being.

487
00:42:57,211 --> 00:43:01,782
If I can find out,
your father certainly will.

488
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:04,519
Even worse, Hera.

489
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,954
Take her back.

490
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,457
There's still another truce,
and I plan--

491
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,758
Athena!

492
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,361
My words are law!

493
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,267
You know, there's a balance
between gods and men.

494
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,369
The life we live

495
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:24,738
and the life humans simply wave
away.

496
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:30,177
Let it go. Take her back. Now.

497
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:45,292
We're not letting it go, are we?

498
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,261
-Hell no.
-What the...

499
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,762
She has grit.

500
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:50,831
-We have two choices.
-I like choices.

501
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,334
Kill her to see
if she is a god...

502
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:55,970
or bend her until she breaks.

503
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,441
-We bend her.
-On my knees I swear
to you with everything holy,

504
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:01,976
I'm not the one
you're looking for.

505
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,079
Please tell me
she is worshipping us?

506
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,549
No. She is begging.

507
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:12,319
Are you sure
she's the one you saw?

508
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,256
You die tonight.

509
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,093
Nah-yee-tay.

510
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,931
I am Athena, old man.

511
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:03,404
You are Athena.
And Athena is Nah-yee-tay.

512
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,610
You're not what I expected.

513
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,779
You were expecting
Morgan Freeman?

514
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,817
Yes.

515
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,591
Where have you been?

516
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:24,858
And how did you survive
all these...

517
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,595
thousands of years?

518
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:28,762
You're...

519
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,165
human.

520
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,236
I stopped growing.

521
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:42,910
When Hades comes,
I won't have time
to play with words.

522
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:46,447
So, speak clearly, Nah-yee-tay.

523
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:49,850
And what should I be asking you?

524
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:52,453
You are over 4,000 years old.

525
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:58,192
Your wisdom should supersede
your pride, your anger...

526
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,761
I didn't come
here to be insulted.

527
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,196
...your rage.

528
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:08,936
You are a myth created
by desperate humans

529
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,205
who want to believe in something
other than the truth.

530
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:12,940
So what is the truth?

531
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:24,051
The Elder gods created
this godforsaken world...

532
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:27,988
and we have to baby-sit
our human pets.

533
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:33,794
Then, why not show them
who you truly are?

534
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:34,895
Humans...

535
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,134
...are insects.

536
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,303
<i>- They can't understand the true</i>
<i>meaning</i>

537
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,905
<i>of the world around them.</i>

538
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:48,208
<i>Fabricated emotions,</i>
<i>suffering...</i>

539
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:53,414
<i>hatred, the need to follow</i>
<i>or be followed...</i>

540
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:59,953
That's the kind of language
they need...

541
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,623
to survive.

542
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:05,059
How do I fall
within your genesis?

543
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:11,365
-I don't know.
-Am I a god?

544
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:17,871
You were born after the flood,

545
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:22,242
and I... existed before it.

546
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:24,044
I wasn't born.

547
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:27,014
I was created.

548
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:36,190
I am trying to be very patient
with you, human.

549
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,794
But you are really
tugging on my tolerance.

550
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:43,565
Why are you here?

551
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,234
I want answers!

552
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,038
What is the question?

553
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:55,042
I am a god.
I am supposed to know it all.

554
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,112
But...

555
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,449
I'm beginning to feel...

556
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:09,323
human.

557
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:11,258
Is that such a bad thing?

558
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:15,329
I am the god of war!

559
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:20,401
-Well...
-I pushed Yaa Asantewaa,

560
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:22,670
whispered in Napoleon's ear,

561
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:26,974
led Genghis, raised Alaric,
and guided Cassius!

562
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,316
Now I find myself...

563
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:42,089
going to...

564
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,726
to a human shrink.

565
00:49:00,073 --> 00:49:02,443
The only reason I told you that,

566
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,146
is because you're dying soon.

567
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,353
I always wanted
to go see a shrink.

568
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:16,891
I don't know what I would say.

569
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:22,162
Now... there are some lousy ones

570
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:24,131
and some good ones.

571
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:29,537
It took me a couple of decades,
but... I found one.

572
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:33,808
Obviously, I couldn't tell them
who I really was.

573
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:36,778
Oh, that would be
divinely inappropriate.

574
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:39,046
I just let it all out there.

575
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:43,083
And what was the diagnosis?

576
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,993
Daddy issues.

577
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,835
You know...

578
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,674
in all my thousands of years...

579
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,445
I've only met the man 38 times.

580
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:18,018
I think of killing him.

581
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:24,391
I think of killing him a lot.

582
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:28,963
But...

583
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:30,364
I'm no match for him.

584
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,035
And even if
I could defeat him...

585
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,105
we're immortal.

586
00:50:40,575 --> 00:50:43,978
And... what about your mother?

587
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,154
I told you, I was created.

588
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,394
I have no mother.

589
00:51:08,101 --> 00:51:10,038
Why now?

590
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,839
Why leave now?

591
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:22,149
Sons of gods... sons of men.

592
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,820
It is the same cycle.

593
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:32,125
Humanity is destined
to repeat itself.

594
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:37,164
The cycle just keeps
repeating itself.

595
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:44,906
And how have you
stayed alive for so long?

596
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:46,373
Alive...

597
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:56,651
I watched everyone I cared
about...

598
00:51:56,684 --> 00:52:00,487
die over and over...

599
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,561
and over... again.

600
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:13,200
I have lived long enough for
humanity.

601
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:20,140
It is time...

602
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:24,979
for the end.

603
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:42,063
What am I?

604
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:46,768
You...

605
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:48,936
are not one of them...

606
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:57,444
...and you are not one of us.

607
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:04,786
Then... what am I?

608
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:13,928
What?

609
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:19,534
Look into her eyes!

610
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:33,213
Methuselah!

611
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:46,561
It was you.

612
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:51,833
-Me?
-You were with me
the night Methuselah died.

613
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,300
How did you get there?

614
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:07,949
Every time I think
I'm starting to understand
humans,

615
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:09,817
they go crazy on me.

616
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,520
One minute it's day,
one minute it's night,

617
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,454
and flying in the air...

618
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:26,100
You have to admire her tenacity.

619
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:30,337
Which one of us
is going after her?

620
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:32,940
Rock, paper, scissors?

621
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,178
Okay.

622
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:43,450
- <i>911,</i> <i>what's your emergency?
</i> -My name is Mina Bihary.

623
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:46,419
-I've been kidnapped
by two hypnotists.
<i>-Are they with you right now?</i>

624
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,388
- No! I'm in my car!
- I just escaped!

625
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:50,091
Don't mind me. Keep talking.

626
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:52,627
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

627
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,395
It's extremely rude
to leave someone waiting
on the phone.

628
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:57,532
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

629
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:02,670
I'm tired of being
the good son all the time.

630
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:05,273
Everyone gets away with
everything except for me.

631
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,974
Please... Please...

632
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,643
What is happening to me?

633
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:10,044
This skin.

634
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:13,413
This human skin.

635
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,482
I change it, and I change it,
and I change it,

636
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:17,450
and I change it,
and I change it...

637
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:20,221
and if I don't, Father is
always there to remind me.

638
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:24,859
But Apollo...
keeps the same skin for decades,

639
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:28,029
and everyone has a perfectly
justifiable reason why he can.

640
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:30,698
"Apollo is the only one
who understands man."

641
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:32,633
"Apollo can adapt with man."

642
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:33,868
"Apollo is the only one who
knows how to guide us

643
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,102
into the changing future."

644
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,205
Damn him! Damn all of them!

645
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:39,040
I've been alive
for over four millennia!

646
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:40,975
I don't need anything to exist!

647
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:42,543
Please, let me go.

648
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:47,849
-You're driving
to the police station, right?
-Yeah.

649
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:51,085
Then keep driving
and stop begging.
It's bad for your complexion.

650
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:58,726
I know you're thinking,
"What's all the fuss about?"

651
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:04,265
For beings like us,
there isn't much
we haven't seen.

652
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,237
Plagues, dictators...

653
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,974
floods, tectonics, evolution...

654
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:18,613
So when we see something
we don't understand,
it makes us nervous.

655
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:24,085
It makes us very nervous.

656
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:26,087
Please, I'm not
who you're looking for.

657
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:31,424
Your skin, your blood,
your heartbeat, it's all human.

658
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,596
But that doesn't make you human.

659
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:38,566
We all have our gifts.

660
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,601
We can teleport, change skin...

661
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:43,403
We cannot die.

662
00:56:45,106 --> 00:56:46,774
Only Hades is omnipotent.

663
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:50,244
For the good of life,
the elder gods locked
his body away,

664
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:51,979
though his soul does roam.

665
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,083
That's my story.

666
00:56:56,117 --> 00:56:58,019
That's me.
Now it's your turn.

667
00:56:58,052 --> 00:56:59,553
What are you?

668
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:01,856
I don't know
what you want me to say.

669
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:06,594
There was a time when we walked
the Earth as the gods we were.

670
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:09,697
Mortals worshiped us,
built temples to us,

671
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,133
bowed to the air we left behind.

672
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,202
Then came the truce.

673
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,139
We had to disappear.

674
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:21,309
We were replaced by...

675
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:22,877
celebrities.

676
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,948
Please, just tell me
what to say and I'll say it.

677
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:31,419
I will dig into every pore
of you, pierce every ventricle,

678
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:34,622
examine every vein and artery,
and I will not abate the pain

679
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:37,992
until you tell me what you are.

680
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:46,434
I'm not who you
expect me to be.

681
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:53,975
Well, Roxanne, some people
have to see to believe.

682
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:57,678
When they see, they easily
forget they didn't believe.

683
00:57:57,712 --> 00:58:00,114
-Yet they didn't believe it.
-Help me! Please, help me!
Help me!

684
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:02,083
Trying to kill me!
Please!

685
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:04,986
Some crazy people
around here. Geez.

686
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:16,163
-Let's go, Rosie.
-Finally.

687
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:18,699
Hello.

688
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:20,500
Ow!

689
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,470
-Are you okay?
-Is that your gun?

690
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:25,773
-Or you're just happy to see me?
-Let's go.

691
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:28,809
-Hey, Officer Hot Chocolate...
-You know that's not my name.

692
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:33,314
One hour with me and you'll be
on crutches till next week.

693
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:34,849
Right. My lucky night.

694
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:50,898
"I am not
who you expect me to be."

695
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,369
She's been saying
the same thing all day.

696
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:57,438
But it's the exact same words.

697
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,142
Exact words to what?

698
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:09,784
Do you envy their mortality?

699
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:12,420
What?

700
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:15,723
Don't you ever wonder
where they go when they die?

701
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,195
Hades takes them
to the underworld
where they're reincarnated.

702
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:22,930
Do you not question that?

703
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:25,599
What is happening here?

704
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,435
I have never been
to the underworld.

705
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:29,103
You have never been
to the underworld.

706
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:30,838
Why do we believe
this underworld is real?

707
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:33,841
Because the elder gods
told us so.

708
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:41,115
Doesn't that also give argument
to human religion?

709
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:44,185
They too believe in a deity
they've never seen.

710
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:48,322
You have got to reverse
your mind from your thoughts,
little brother.

711
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:06,207
We came into a world
that already existed,

712
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:09,810
fine-tuned
for the existence of life.

713
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,282
The world was here because
the elder gods made it so.

714
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:19,153
We've never made nor witnessed
the making of humans,

715
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:22,524
but they exist because
the elder gods told us so.

716
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:27,128
Apollo was right.

717
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,132
We don't rule humans.

718
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:34,235
-They rule us.
-Hermes...

719
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:37,972
That whole oracle thing
he pulls is just a trick.

720
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,074
A gimmick.

721
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:46,447
Unlike us, he has no shame,
meandering with the humans.

722
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,682
Call it whatever you like,
he knows things.

723
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:52,319
Things you and I
are hiding from each other,
even as we speak.

724
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:02,329
Methuselah called me
Nah-yee-tay.

725
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:05,534
And I don't know why.

726
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,068
You mean Neith.

727
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,672
Neith, Nah-yee-tay...

728
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:15,009
What's the connection?

729
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,411
You.

730
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:19,847
Neith is the Egyptian
goddess of war.

731
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,016
The Greeks created Athena
based on Neith.

732
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,419
The Greeks created me?

733
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,855
You know what I mean.

734
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,356
They created
the concept of us

735
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,258
based on what we whispered
in their ears.

736
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:34,629
Yeah, but he said
Nah-yee-tay...

737
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,864
Not Neith.

738
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:41,468
It's older Africa.
Genesis Africa.

739
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:44,038
Yeah, but why would a human,
older than me,

740
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:49,143
tell me that I am Neith
and not Athena?

741
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:51,412
Does it matter?

742
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:54,815
It does.

743
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:59,220
We all whispered
in Homer's ear to write us

744
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,255
the way we wanted
to be written.

745
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:06,160
I had no part
in the creation of Neith...

746
01:02:07,294 --> 01:02:11,432
and suddenly, I'm a character
I didn't know existed.

747
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,401
I also saw him.

748
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,406
Methuselah?

749
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:24,345
Hades.

750
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:32,820
Come on, Sam.

751
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:36,725
Stay awake, Samantha.
Come on.

752
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,926
Come on, stay with me, babe.

753
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:40,662
Stay with me, my love.

754
01:02:41,495 --> 01:02:42,796
Come on!

755
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,235
Come on!

756
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,538
Don't go to sleep, Sam.
Don't go to sleep!

757
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:53,307
Open your eyes, Sam.
Open your eyes.

758
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,744
Please, please,
open your eyes.

759
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,044
Come on!

760
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,550
Come on, please, come on.
Please, open your eyes.

761
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:05,819
Help!
Somebody please help me!

762
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:11,125
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be right back.

763
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:14,428
Please...
I'll be right back.

764
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:18,299
Help! Please, help!

765
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,439
You're not alone.

766
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:05,547
This will be over soon.

767
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:12,319
I am not
who you expect me to be.

768
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:13,621
What?

769
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:23,197
Are you Hades?

770
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,201
He won't talk to you.

771
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:29,870
I don't understand.

772
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:32,574
There is a lot
you will never understand.

773
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,174
What's happening?

774
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,043
Why are you still here?

775
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:38,078
Death came too soon.

776
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,180
I didn't say goodbye
to Darren...

777
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:42,149
I have to say goodbye
to Darren.

778
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:48,088
You're still alive.

779
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:51,125
I am not
who you expect me to be.

780
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,067
What are you?

781
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:02,771
I am death.

782
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:06,907
I am the hereafter.

783
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,977
Help is coming. Hold on.
Stay with me, babe.

784
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:12,847
Help's coming.
I'm here, I'm here.

785
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:15,115
I'm here.
I'm here, my love.

786
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:18,419
Samantha, please!
Please wake up!

787
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:21,054
Please, baby,
please wake up, please...

788
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:30,598
My man.

789
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:33,033
It's gonna be okay.

790
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,803
Oh, oh. Help is coming.

791
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:36,103
Help is coming.

792
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:38,472
Everything is gonna be okay.

793
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,876
I loved you more
than the life I lived.

794
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,547
You-You live.
You're still alive.

795
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,816
There is no time, my love.

796
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,784
Everything is gonna be okay.

797
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:52,554
You will fight this,
you will beat this.

798
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,658
Tell Mina Bihary,
she will never forgive you.

799
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,360
-Who?
-I came to say goodbye.

800
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,833
It's a glorious place
where I'm going to.

801
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:09,637
- What?
- I'm already dead.

802
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:13,173
No, my love.

803
01:06:13,942 --> 01:06:15,710
My man.

804
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,581
Samantha!

805
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:27,589
Samantha...

806
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:39,601
He had wings.

807
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,004
Yeah, I saw them.

808
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:49,511
You didn't tell me
Hades had wings.

809
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:52,680
Apollo told me this
would screw with my head.

810
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:55,482
I was trying to save
you my dilemma.

811
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:57,284
Already too late.

812
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:00,487
He tricked me into
going into that forest.

813
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:02,322
He knew Hades would be there.
He knew I would see him.

814
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:06,528
-He knows things.
-One thing at a time.

815
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:14,368
I'm getting tired of being
played like a tambourine.

816
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:16,571
Well, then, let's just kill her.

817
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:20,307
Find out what she is,
and then we deal with Apollo.

818
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,578
Let's first make an entrance.

819
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:33,788
Revelations 17:10.
There's... seven kings!

820
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:39,928
Five are! One is!
And the one is coming!

821
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:42,462
Rocky, c'mon, man!

822
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:51,906
The... The king is coming!
The seventh king is coming!

823
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,742
The seventh...
The seventh king is coming!

824
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,578
Yeah, he's coming. Let's go...

825
01:07:57,612 --> 01:08:00,347
-Hey.
-Hey! Give that king my number.

826
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,016
Sure.
Match made in heaven.

827
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:08,388
Scarlett, you're not gonna
believe what happened
with bee wax guy.

828
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,123
-Bee wax guy?
-Mmm-hmm.

829
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:13,427
-Is that the stinky one?
-No, the bow-legged one.

830
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,129
Bow-legged one?
Oh! What did he do this time?

831
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:18,465
Dude says he loves me,
and to show me his love,

832
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:20,300
he wants to pay me
with a gift card.

833
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:23,605
Oh, a gift card! Nothing
says "love" like a gift card.

834
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:25,272
It gets worse.

835
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:27,407
Tell me it was something useful.
Something...

836
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:31,211
Victoria's Secret, Hustler,
something useful.

837
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:32,547
Barnes and Noble.

838
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:36,316
-No, he didn't!
-Yeah. He did.

839
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,721
I told that john,
"If I need a gift card
from Barnes and 'Nobles,'

840
01:08:39,754 --> 01:08:42,557
would I be standing
at 3:00 a.m. on 3rd Street,

841
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,626
freezing my butt off?"

842
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:46,761
Barnes and Noble
is disgustingly sick.

843
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:48,763
-Yup.
-That is sick.

844
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:50,297
Yup.

845
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,232
-It makes me wanna kill a man.
-Yeah.

846
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:54,368
I almost called his wife.

847
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:58,472
Chastity! What... You...

848
01:08:58,506 --> 01:09:00,108
What about Crooked Larry?

849
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,475
-Twisted Benny?
-Eh.

850
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:03,143
-Robby Rob?
-Hm.

851
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:04,912
What's the last time
you saw them?

852
01:09:04,946 --> 01:09:08,348
No. Divorce is bad for business.

853
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:11,586
We need our men married.
It's better for our economy.

854
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:13,621
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:15,990
- Ooh!
- Officer Mahoney!

856
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:19,493
- You shake that sexy butt, baby.
-  -Shake it, shake it, shake it

857
01:09:30,404 --> 01:09:32,339
The officers scanned
the area outside.

858
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,542
There was no one
fitting the description.

859
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:36,978
But wherever they are,
we'll find them.

860
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:40,948
These are not ordinary people.
They made me see things.

861
01:09:40,982 --> 01:09:42,984
They made me believe things.

862
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:45,385
They made me... do things.

863
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:47,555
We are the Joxton PD,
Miss Bihary.

864
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:51,693
We've seen it all. You are safe.
We will protect you.

865
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:56,196
-You people need to be prepared.
-Miss Bihary, you are safe.

866
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:58,666
I swore an oath with the badge,
you have my word.

867
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,135
Nothing will happen to you.

868
01:10:01,169 --> 01:10:03,503
They're probably on
the run right now as we speak.

869
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:05,472
They know better than
to mess with Joxton PD.

870
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,914
Ms. Bihary?

871
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,050
Get your hands
out of your pockets!

872
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,186
I said, take your hands
out of your pockets

873
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:20,054
and put them behind your head.

874
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,433
What are you?

875
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:39,239
What...

876
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:43,410
are you?

877
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:49,517
You said you would protect me!
You gave me your word!

878
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:53,554
- What are you?
- You swore an oath! Ah!

879
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:55,422
What are you?

880
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:57,925
I'm... I'm Mina Bihary.
Please believe me! I...

881
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:05,298
-I'm running out of patience.
-One more minute.

882
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:08,136
What are you?

883
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:17,277
Enough of this. Kill her.

884
01:11:52,947 --> 01:11:55,683
Are they all that bad
or is she that good?

885
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:59,720
None of the two.
She is acting bad.

886
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:07,195
No more appetizers.

887
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:41,329
We might be 37,000 feet
above sea level,

888
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:44,565
but showing your divinity
to a human...

889
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:46,200
...is a big no-no.

890
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:50,503
And who might you be?

891
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:52,206
I'm Mina Bihary.

892
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,308
I'm a Music teacher
at Joxton Middle School.

893
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:55,877
Of course you are.

894
01:12:59,614 --> 01:13:02,516
Okay, Mina
from Joxton Middle School,

895
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,552
what are you doing on my jet?

896
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:08,055
I don't know.

897
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:13,594
Okay, the two of you
need to start talking, or I'm
throwing her out the window.

898
01:13:34,447 --> 01:13:38,286
It's always so exciting
to see you, brother.

899
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,921
Seeing the hatred in your eyes

900
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:42,890
makes me admire
your banal nature.

901
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:46,227
You're a vile creature.

902
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,431
The thief calls me vile.
You stalking, lifeless pervert.

903
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:53,367
You're a joke.

904
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:56,170
Nothing but a shining object
everyone will soon forget.

905
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:59,573
It's been four thousand years,
and I am still...

906
01:13:59,607 --> 01:14:02,810
the belle of the ball,
shining bright as ever.

907
01:14:02,843 --> 01:14:06,213
It must hurt
to see the best version of you.

908
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:08,382
No more games, Apollo.

909
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:12,086
On the contrary, dear sister.
The games have just begun.

910
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:14,789
You will tell us everything.

911
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:18,993
Or what?

912
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:21,562
You'll threaten to kill
one of my lovers?

913
01:14:22,363 --> 01:14:25,666
Oh wait,
...we're all alone.

914
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,569
No lover to hold my head
underwater with.

915
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:31,839
So if you're gonna come at me,
you'll have to do it...

916
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:33,941
the "Athena way."

917
01:14:33,975 --> 01:14:36,310
So you can run back to daddy?

918
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:39,380
Against her? Absolutely.

919
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:44,452
But for you, I will hold
the tango between you and I,

920
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,320
all through the glare
of the moonlight.

921
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:50,992
We are done playing your games.

922
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:53,027
What is she?

923
01:14:56,897 --> 01:14:58,399
Who is she?

924
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:02,536
I'm Mina Bihary.
I'm a Music teacher
at Joxton Middle School.

925
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,905
I heard you the first time.

926
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:07,575
Who is she?

927
01:15:12,413 --> 01:15:15,383
How did you know I would
see Hades when the girl died?

928
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:20,221
And how did you know
when Methuselah would die?

929
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:24,492
My dear, sweet,
truculent sister,

930
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:26,994
you are asking and asking,
and not answering.

931
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:30,131
You're the oracle,
you know everything.

932
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:32,433
We shouldn't
have to tell you anything.

933
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:35,536
Apparently,
I don't know all that I should.

934
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:37,805
But I know more than
you will ever know.

935
01:15:37,838 --> 01:15:40,941
- Please, please...
- I really do hate you.

936
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:46,580
That mattered to me
four millennia ago.

937
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:49,350
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

938
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,620
-What is she doing?
-Praying.

939
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:56,924
Shut up!

940
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:03,264
Is it that time
of the month, Athena?

941
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:06,934
You knew Methuselah was alive
all these thousands of years!

942
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:11,906
You led Hermes and I
to see Hades!

943
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:15,309
You wanted us to see Hades!

944
01:16:16,277 --> 01:16:19,580
He had bloody wings!
Wings, Apollo!

945
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,685
Like a freaking angel.

946
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:28,022
I worship human talent.

947
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:30,958
Their ability to adapt,
create and survive.

948
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:34,962
But they do have
stupid cultural norms.

949
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:36,597
Like monogamy?

950
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:42,002
And even more appalling,
their desperate need to believe.

951
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:47,908
Believing in something
that no one on Earth has
seen, smelled, felt or heard.

952
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:49,477
Same could be said of father.

953
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:52,012
-Father talks back.
-Not to all of us.

954
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,950
Jealousy is unbecoming of a god.

955
01:16:56,851 --> 01:16:58,986
We need answers, Apollo.

956
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,823
What do you have to give,
for those answers?

957
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:06,794
What do you want?

958
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>The first time</i>
<i>you took on this skin,</i>

959
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,635
<i>on the streets of Lagos...</i>

960
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,405
<i>You were following me?</i>

961
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:20,774
What part of
"you're the most fascinating
creature on the planet"

962
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:22,076
did you miss?

963
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,677
I always follow you.

964
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:29,817
The thing you saw...
Why did you go to her?

965
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:36,157
She knew who I was.

966
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,759
<i>How did you know?</i>

967
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:41,662
This is way above
your celestial level.

968
01:17:41,695 --> 01:17:43,898
Just shut up
and let the adults talk.

969
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:48,002
One of these days,

970
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:51,872
I will watch you die
beneath my feet.

971
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:55,442
Sure, do the Lord's prayer.

972
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,078
Miracles do happen.

973
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,248
There was no fear in her eyes.

974
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:07,622
And even when I didn't
want anyone to see me,

975
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:10,224
she could still see me.

976
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:13,761
She could still see me.

977
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:17,298
She wasn't human.

978
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:22,069
-What did you say to her?
-I asked her...

979
01:18:23,605 --> 01:18:25,406
"When does life begin?"

980
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,208
Why did you ask that?

981
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:30,110
I thought I needed to know.

982
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:34,114
And what did she say?

983
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,686
<i>When we die.</i>

984
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:39,220
When we die?

985
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,255
And the girl?

986
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:43,791
She disappeared.

987
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:51,065
I've answered your questions.

988
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:55,236
I guess it's only
fair to hold up
my side of the bargain.

989
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,073
Like the both of you,

990
01:18:59,106 --> 01:19:01,108
I'd never seen Hades before.

991
01:19:02,142 --> 01:19:04,345
But I'd heard stories
from the elders.

992
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:09,618
Someone OD'd at a party
and I saw Hades.

993
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:13,053
I'd been around death before,

994
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:15,956
but Hades wanted me to see him.

995
01:19:18,627 --> 01:19:20,995
And ever since then,
he's been...

996
01:19:23,097 --> 01:19:26,534
He's been copulating
with my head recently.

997
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:32,139
Some days, I see nothing.

998
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,475
Other days,

999
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:39,614
he shows me the upcoming
deaths of fifty million people.

1000
01:19:41,015 --> 01:19:43,284
That's why you let me
steal that secret.

1001
01:19:44,018 --> 01:19:46,820
Exactly, brother.
You stole knowledge from me

1002
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:49,758
and she put her foot
on the neck of my guest,

1003
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:52,993
so I shared the burden
of looking death in the eye.

1004
01:19:54,663 --> 01:19:56,063
And the girl...

1005
01:19:57,766 --> 01:19:59,199
<i>what is she?</i>

1006
01:20:01,935 --> 01:20:04,471
When you showed
up here unannounced,

1007
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:06,173
I had no idea who she was.

1008
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:10,512
But you can't be that dense
to not know who she is by now.

1009
01:20:13,515 --> 01:20:16,817
I'm embarrassed
to share the same
bloodlines with you two.

1010
01:20:22,724 --> 01:20:25,593
Mortal actions
never deceive the gods.

1011
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:31,031
She is the little girl.

1012
01:20:36,036 --> 01:20:38,038
I... I don't know what
he's talking about.

1013
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:39,940
I'm Mina Bihary from--

1014
01:20:55,557 --> 01:20:57,525
Please, please, please.

1015
01:20:57,559 --> 01:21:00,094
You see, Mina Bihary,

1016
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:03,230
if you were human,
you'd be dead by now.

1017
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:30,124
-Tell me who you are!
-Athena!

1018
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:36,731
-Maybe she is just human.
-She is still alive!

1019
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:39,801
She might just be... different.

1020
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:43,838
Did you not hear
anything Apollo just said?

1021
01:21:43,872 --> 01:21:46,340
Exactly! Apollo.

1022
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:48,610
I don't trust a word
that comes out of his mouth.

1023
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:53,113
No, baby brother.
She needs to confess or die.

1024
01:21:53,147 --> 01:21:54,516
Look at her.

1025
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:58,820
She's bleeding.
She's not one of us.

1026
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:02,423
We need her alive.

1027
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:05,527
We need to study her.
We need to understand
what she is.

1028
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,664
No! If you do not agree
with what comes next,

1029
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:13,701
I suggest you leave.

1030
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:27,214
Finally. Some alone time.

1031
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:28,482
Please...

1032
01:22:45,934 --> 01:22:47,669
Who are you?

1033
01:22:51,205 --> 01:22:53,140
You have not looked me
in the eyes.

1034
01:22:54,007 --> 01:22:55,543
<i>Not even once.</i>

1035
01:22:57,311 --> 01:22:58,847
<i>Every step.</i>

1036
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:01,516
<i>Every move.</i>

1037
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:04,985
<i>Every choice.</i>

1038
01:23:05,018 --> 01:23:07,655
<i>Every moment,</i>
<i>you've been in control.</i>

1039
01:23:09,858 --> 01:23:11,158
Look at me!

1040
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:20,400
Please...

1041
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:27,007
<i>You...</i>
<i>are not one of them...</i>

1042
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:40,020
Nah-yee-tay.

1043
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,225
<i>...and you are not one of us.</i>

1044
01:23:57,772 --> 01:23:59,239
Athena.

1045
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:02,276
What did you see?

1046
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:05,078
I saw the night...

1047
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:07,715
I saw the sky... I...

1048
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:09,984
I saw the eyes...

1049
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:13,655
I felt the Earth...

1050
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:18,325
I felt the birth...
I... felt the life.

1051
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:23,865
The end is talking
to the beginning. I...

1052
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:26,601
-What does it mean?
-I don't know!

1053
01:24:28,036 --> 01:24:32,006
I don't want to know.
I want to live in the zoo.

1054
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,543
I want to eat the apple.
I want to remain the god I am.

1055
01:24:35,577 --> 01:24:37,077
Pull yourself together!

1056
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:40,280
You are Athena,
the Goddess of War!

1057
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:43,685
You fear nothing.

1058
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:51,693
Athena, Nah-yee-tay,
Minerva, Neith, Anat...

1059
01:24:51,726 --> 01:24:53,027
None of it matters!

1060
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:56,496
None of this...

1061
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:58,533
matters.

1062
01:25:05,673 --> 01:25:07,508
Don't go back to her.

1063
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:14,682
Please, baby brother,
let's walk away.

1064
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:22,590
-I have to know.
-Why? Why do you have to know?

1065
01:25:22,624 --> 01:25:24,358
Because we're gods!

1066
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:27,528
We are the deities
at the top of the pyramid.

1067
01:25:27,562 --> 01:25:29,664
Knowledge is everything.

1068
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,666
If we don't know, what are we?

1069
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:33,935
We are still
at the top of the pyramid.

1070
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:36,370
We don't have
to know what she is.

1071
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,907
Knowledge is everything!

1072
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:43,343
I have to know.

1073
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,651
Let it go,
little brother.

1074
01:26:04,632 --> 01:26:05,900
I have to go.

1075
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:19,113
I have to know.

1076
01:26:28,089 --> 01:26:31,893
Well, well, well, butterfly.
You freshen up nicely.

1077
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,395
You noticed.

1078
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:38,132
It's impressive.

1079
01:26:40,568 --> 01:26:42,335
Did you honestly think

1080
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:45,472
you were the only ones
capable of teleportation?

1081
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:49,476
In the next decade,

1082
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:54,048
human beings will do it as
easily as they use their apps.

1083
01:27:09,097 --> 01:27:11,799
I take it this isn't going to be
as easy as I thought.

1084
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,636
You keep asking me what I am.

1085
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:20,842
Here I am. Ask me again.

1086
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:40,161
Now my turn.

1087
01:27:49,469 --> 01:27:52,807
You keep asking me what I am,

1088
01:27:53,808 --> 01:27:57,779
instead of asking what you are.

1089
01:28:00,248 --> 01:28:03,283
I know what I am.

1090
01:28:04,685 --> 01:28:05,987
Do you?

1091
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,356
You were born on Earth.

1092
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:12,026
Your mother was mortal.

1093
01:28:12,994 --> 01:28:17,464
You are younger than
the planet you claim god over.

1094
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:22,302
You feed and live
with the humans.

1095
01:28:22,335 --> 01:28:23,971
What are you saying?

1096
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:27,175
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

1097
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:31,212
You are a being.

1098
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:35,716
Just a human being.

1099
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:39,187
Hm.

1100
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:45,560
Oh!

1101
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,962
Wait, wait, wait... Wait.

1102
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:29,030
You can't kill me, I'm immortal.

1103
01:30:29,764 --> 01:30:33,534
Hades' body is falling
down a bottomless pit,

1104
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:36,704
and its soul voraciously
sucks the dead.

1105
01:30:37,638 --> 01:30:42,610
Don't you think death won't have
been a more merciful ending?

1106
01:30:46,414 --> 01:30:49,383
Ask me what I am.

1107
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:57,992
Ask me what I am!

1108
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,828
What are you?

1109
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:05,132
I am the one
older than the light.

1110
01:31:05,933 --> 01:31:08,135
I am the great flood.

1111
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:12,472
I am the one who took
over the body of the child.

1112
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:15,576
I am the one who witnessed
the birth

1113
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:19,113
<i>and death</i>
<i>of the oldest human.</i>

1114
01:31:19,146 --> 01:31:23,150
<i>I am the one before</i>
<i>the darkness and the light.</i>

1115
01:31:23,184 --> 01:31:28,289
<i>I am the celestial</i>
<i>being whom your</i>
<i>elder gods will bow to.</i>

1116
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:30,658
I am the mother of the sun.

1117
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:32,960
I am of the god of the sky.

1118
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:35,429
I am Mehet-Weret!

1119
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:41,969
I am your god,
and you dare disrespect me!

1120
01:31:42,003 --> 01:31:45,439
I will cast you to a fate
worse than Hades.

1121
01:31:46,307 --> 01:31:49,777
Tell Mina Bihary,
she will never forgive you.

1122
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:52,380
She will never forgive you.

1123
01:31:54,849 --> 01:31:58,252
Your daughter
will never forgive you.

1124
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:20,141
<i>I left</i>
<i>Nah-yee-tay too long,</i>

1125
01:32:20,174 --> 01:32:25,646
<i>because of a stupid truce</i>
<i>designed not to start a war</i>
<i>that must happen.</i>

1126
01:32:28,716 --> 01:32:32,353
I find it very spectacular

1127
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:36,123
that you think I am controlled
by the emotions for my daughter.

1128
01:32:39,293 --> 01:32:41,228
Don't embarrass yourself.

1129
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:49,737
Thirty years I lived
in this body,
just to take every opportunity

1130
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:52,406
to be near my daughter
when I could.

1131
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:02,917
What is love...

1132
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,285
as she sees it?

1133
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:06,821
Love is...

1134
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,862
Love is sacrifice.

1135
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:18,799
Love is family.

1136
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:22,103
Love is motherhood.

1137
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,172
Love...

1138
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:31,979
Love is human.

1139
01:33:33,948 --> 01:33:35,483
Not the being.

1140
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:41,789
I will let you go.

1141
01:33:44,593 --> 01:33:49,463
But your loyalty
now belongs to me.

1142

1158
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:27,615
