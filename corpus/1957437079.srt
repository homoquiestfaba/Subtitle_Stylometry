two beautiful words,

wouldn't use

Those other girls
still bothering you?

It's mostly
just this one girl, Florence.

66
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,631
- She calls me "Food Stamp."
- [Maggie] Why?

67
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,155
Maybe because I'm on
scholarship, or I'm small,

68
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,809
or because we just
moved here from upstate.

69
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,551
- I don't know.
- Well, you're different

70
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,335

at school.

71
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,858
That's good.

You know,
people who are unique,

they're the ones
that change the world.

74
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,081
Great!
I'll tell Florence that.

75
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,822
Just let me call her mother.

76
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,041
We can have them over here,
and we can all talk about it.

77
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,869
My gosh,
were you ever a child?

78
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,088
No.

79
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,916
Um, but I was bullied, too.

80
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,701
You know, you just have to
learn to stand up for yourself.

81
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,268
Well, I guess I'm just
not as brave as you.

82
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,226
I don't want to stand out.

83
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,576
I'm gonna go change

84
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,751
and then I'll collect
some more cans

85
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,405
for the charity drive.

86
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,277
Oh, did you talk to your boss
about the Chicago thing?

87
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:22,757
Okay, so, apparently,

88
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,715
the case has been
moved forward two weeks,

89
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,674

00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,545
Mom!

91
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,939

I'm just gonna be gone a couple of days.

Well, who's gonna
stay with me?

94
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,073
I'll get a lovely sitter.
Yeah?

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,859
Just not Uncle Casey.

Uncle Casey?

are vegetables?

you got going on in here?

Oh, this is
just a temporary thing.

Hmm.

00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,364
Your meter's expired.

110
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,061
Actually, no,
the meter is broken.

111
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,758
Actually, no, it's working.

112
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,152
It just had this bag
over the top of it.

113
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,459

It is so disheartening.

I'll get rid of that.
Do you want to give me that?

116
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,683
Just to... Okay.

117
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:21,598
No, I want to give you this.

118
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,166
Can we do this later?
I am so late. Okay.

119
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,342
Give it to someone else!
Pay it forward.

Mm, it's 4:15.

Hey, do you wanna see a trick?

00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,732
Sure.

152
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,821
Okay, a deck of cards.

153
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,651
Ooh.

154
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,218

Do you have any cans for me?

158

You can have this one,

No, no! Moment.

Magic school. Good luck.

Hey. You know, when I get really good
at magic, you know what I'm gonna do?

165
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,285
Make her disappear?

166
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,983
No, I'm gonna cut her in half.

Does Packard know you're collecting
canisters in his edifice?

Get the cans for Emily!

179
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,102
Hey, you do it! I'm busy.

180
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,712
- I'm doing the tofu!
- Eh!

181
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:46,368
Emily, come check it out.
We got regular, seasoned...

182
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,849
What's there to know?
It's the white stuff in the water.

183
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,068
- Here you go, Emily.
- [speaking Spanish]

184
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,983
<i>Mira, mira...</i>
[in English] Two years ago,

185
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,943
genius here cuts his hand off
with a meat slicer.

186
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,380
Now he's a tofu-eating vegan.
[chuckles softly]

187
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,338
It was a sign.

188
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,949
[laughing]

189
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,821
[vendor groans]

190
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,388
- Doggone it.
- [barks]

191
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,737
- Ah! Get out of here!
- [whimpering]

192
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,610
- [honking]
- [barks]

193
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,570
[barking]

194
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,011
[indistinct chattering]

195
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,497
[grunts]

196
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,675
[pigeons cooing]

197
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,547
[panting]

198
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,338
[snarling]

199
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,645
[grunting]

200
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,864
[barking]

201
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,220
[whimsical music playing]

202
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,613
There you are.

203
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,094
Come on.

204
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,880
Now, just because you're lost,

205
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:07,144
it doesn't mean that you're
any less of a treasure.

206
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,885
- You understand?
- [barking]

207
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,235
Oh, standing up for yourself,
are you?

208
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,323
[dog yelps]

209
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,716
Yes, yes, I know.

210
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,196
You're a dog.

211
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,893
Ah!

212
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,026
Hello.

213
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,377
Now, let's introduce you
to all the others, shall we?

214
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,595
[whimpers]

215
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,077
Hope they don't mistake you
for a lobster.

216
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,688
[door closes]

217
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,648
The whole block is bonkers.

218
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,393
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

219
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,961
- You know I said I was gonna get a sitter.
- [door opens]

220
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,136
[Casey] Yo, yo, yo!

221
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,267
What up, fam?

222
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,660
- [door closes]
- You promised.

223
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,359
- How's my favorite sister?
- Hey.

224
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,798
And my favorite little niece?

225
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,409
Money is gonna be
in this drawer here.

226
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,107
And emergency numbers

227
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,022
here.

228
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,676
"911"?

229
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,591
Give me some credit.

230
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,377
Till the super fixes it,
please don't use the dishwasher.

231
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,902
Emily has to be at school
by 7:45.

232
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,905
In the morning?
What are they, farmers?

233
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,429
Ooh, Mom won't be back
till Monday.

234
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,474
So, what are we doing?

235
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,608
"Get a little crew together?
Hit up the club?"

236
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,001
Isn't that what you
young people say?

237
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,177
We don't say that. Ever.

238
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,222
- "Get lit?"
- Please stop.

239
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,791
[Maggie] All set to go.

240
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,793
Now, Casey,
I'm really counting on you.

241
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,577
Are you sure
you can handle this?

242
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,710
[in British accent] You're
bloody well right I can.

243
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,582
[in American accent] You see,
if I hadn't moved here when I was two,

244
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,454
I would've grown up
with a British accent also.

245
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,239
[in British accent] Bollocks.
Rubbish. Collywobbles.

246
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,241
Are you finished?

247
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,634
Dumbledore.

248
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,505
[Maggie sighs]

249
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,246
- I love you.
- Love you.

250
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,032
Look, Mags, I got this, okay?

251
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,468
Got the keys?

252
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,820
- You've been here two minutes!
- I may have lost those.

253
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:01,563
Um, okay, this is
my only other set.

254
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,218
- Okay.
- Do not lose those.

255
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,742
- I love you guys.
- Love you.

256
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,483
[in British accent] Cheerio!

257
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,703
Shocking.

258
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,140
[Casey] Ah.

259
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:15,969
[door closes]

260
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,886
So, how's everything going in,

261
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,583
I'm gonna say fourth grade?

262
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,541
- Sixth.
- [Casey chuckles]

263
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,934
Joking.

264
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,544
Where's your sense of humor?

265
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,678
I lost it. On the subway.

266
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,898
I lost you one time.

267
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,205
Okay, twice
if you count Atlantic City.

268
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,120
But I won you back!

269
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,820
Hey! I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

270
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,039
We're gonna do something
super cool this weekend.

271
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,433
Money is absolutely no object.

272
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,131
As long as there's enough
of it in that drawer.

273
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,354
[Casey] How are there so many
people up at this hour?

274
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,486
Hey, you want to get a coffee?

275
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,619
I'm twelve. I'm not allowed
to drink coffee.

276
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,795
- Red Bull?
- Really?

277
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,841
Whew! Being a kid sucks.

278
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,757
[whimsical music playing]

279
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,978
Oh, my gosh. Look,
there's an animal rescue tent!

280
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,328
- Can we go in? Please?
- [sighs]

281
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:14,418
My instinct is, "Sure",
so we probably shouldn't?

282
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,770
But how could I say no
to that little face

283
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,730
with those cheeks
and the, ah, missing tooth?

284
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,340
I just want to dust you
in sugar...

285
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,515
- Okay, okay, enough.
- Okay, okay.

286
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,734
Come on!

287
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,215
[upbeat music playing]

288
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,964
Wow. So beautiful.

289
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,704
- Hi!
- Hi.

290
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,663
- Hi.
- [blows raspberry]

291
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,144
Well, you're kind of creepy.

292
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,885
- [screeches]
- Ah! Sorry!

293
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,017
[screeches]

294
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,671
[ethereal music playing]

295
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,110
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

296
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,460
- Hi.
- [cat purrs]

297
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,940
[Emily chuckles]

298
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,812
Oh, my goodness.

299
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,817
Whoa! Uncle Casey,
there's a sloth!

300
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,951
[Casey] Oh. Hey.
My spirit animal.

301
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,911
- [Emily] Whoa.
- [Casey] Don't touch that.

302
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,391
[Emily] Aw.

303
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,004
- [hisses]
- [gasps]

304
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,615
Why would you put that there?

305
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,183
- Shoo. Go away.
- [Emily] Look at you!

306
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,360
Splendid backpack!

307
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,623
- It matches.
- Cool.

308
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,538
Well, you are obviously
a young lady

309
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,670
- of immaculate taste.
- Thank you.

310
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,630
Bridwell's the name,
and welcome to my

311
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,459
Tentus Animalus Rescuus.

312
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,462
Is that Latin
for "Animal Rescue Tent"?

313
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,073
No, it's just regular words
with "us" on the end.

314
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,857
Makes me sound smartus.

315
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,686
So, what sort of animals
are you looking for?

316
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,213
A temperamental tortoise?
A stand-up chameleon?

317
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,824
Maybe something small,
cheap and stuffed?

318
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,391
I want them all.

319
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,959
Ah, yeah, we're not really
looking for a pet.

320
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,570
Perfect! Follow me.

321
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,747
The thing about animals is
that the best time to find them

322
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,705
is when you're not looking
for them.

323
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,273
Huh, does this tent
seem bigger on the inside?

324
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,798
That's ridiculous!
It's smaller on the outside.

325
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,191
[horse neighs]

326
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,238
Is that a baby giraffe?

327
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,762
[Bridwell]
Or a long-necked hyena.

328
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,678
I can't be sure
till I tell it a joke.

329
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,594
[whispers] Giraffes have
no sense of humor.

330
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,031
Here we are. [sighs]

331
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,773
This is it.

332
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,775
- There's no animals in here.
- That's right.

333
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,690
You said you weren't
looking for a pet.

334
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,083
And we're not.

335
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,780
So you won't be interested
in him.

336
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,129
Who?

337
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,316
[soft music playing]

338
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,404
[whimpers]

339
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,102
[Emily] My goodness.

340
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,800
You're just the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

341
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,584
Look at you.

342
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,021
Aw.

343
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,849
I got you.

344
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,895
Oh, he's so cute.

345
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,071
And... And so tiny.

346
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,465
And so red.

347
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,988
I love that he's red.

348
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,598
[chuckles]

349
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,340
How did he get that way?

350
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,604
I don't know. I found him in
the park trying to be a pigeon.

351
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:24,608
I think he's lost his family,
so he's a little confused.

352
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,175
[Emily] Poor guy.

353
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,308
- I'll be your family.
- No, you will not.

354
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,831
Please, Uncle Casey?

355
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,920
He's so tiny,
he wouldn't bother anyone.

356
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,835
Mr. Bridwell, how big
is he gonna get?

357
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:37,186
- Well, that depends, doesn't it?
- On what?

358
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,971
On how much you love him.

359
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,888
Okay. Adorable. Put him back.

360
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,934
Please, just look
at this little tiny face.

361
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,676
I'm sorry. I'm new,
responsible Casey now,

362
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,243
and letting you get a little

363
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,723
radioactive micro-dog
is not responsible.

364
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,464
So give him back.

365
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,205
No, I'm not gonna
fall for that again.

366
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,773
- Give me the dog.
- [dog whimpers]

367
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,602
Be careful.

368
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,565
Well, thank you very much for giving me
the opportunity to crush my niece's dreams.

369
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,351
I always wondered what it
felt like to be the bad guy.

370
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,830
My pleasure.

371
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:16,617
[dog whimpers]

372
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh, by the way,

373
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,881
do you know what sound

374
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,883
porcupines make
when they kiss?

375
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,061
- "Ouch!"
- [laughing]

376
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,369
Ah! Hyena.

377
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,372
Okay, come on.

378
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,201
Let's get you to school.
No word of this to anyone.

381
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,342
OMG, did you bring
your garbage to school?

382
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,040
No, this is the recycling.

383
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,565
For the fund raiser?
Isn't that today?

384
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,784
Yeah, but nobody
actually does it.

385
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,569
The school just wants the money.

386
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,919
- My mom wrote a check.
- Mine, too.

387
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,442
Classic Food Stamp.

388
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,272
[sighs]

389
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,232
Hey! Don't listen to her.

390
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,712
She's just cranky because a
house fell on her wicked sister.

391
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,366
[chuckles]

392
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,107
I think it's awesome
you actually did the work.

393
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,022
Really makes you stand out
around here.

394
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,198
It was one of the last things
I was hoping to do,

395
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,895
but thank you.

396
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,941
- It's Owen, right?
- [loudly] You know my name?

397
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,249
- Did I say that out loud?
- [chuckles]

398
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,164
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

399
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,469
I collected cans, too.

400
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,602
Really? Where are they?

401
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:32,345
My dad threw them away.
Said I looked like an Asian Oliver Twist.

Can we get a cleanup

[laughing]

408
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:00,111

We'll get this cleaned up.

How did you get in there?

You were in my bag all day?

- I didn't! I found him in my backpack.

I specifically said no to the dog
and you completely ignored me.

they say something that they don't mean.

Please, Uncle Casey,
can't he just stay for one night?

479
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,232
No! Absolutely not.
I promised your mom.

And then, first thing
in the morning,

486
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,510
he is going back to that weird old
man that we met in the animal tent.

487
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,730
Mm, saying that out loud
makes us going in there

seem like such
a poor choice.

489
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,864
Why? I don't understand.
Why can't I just keep him?

490

Wait, wait. I'm going to wake up.
It's all in my head.

How did this happen?
How are you so huge?

I mean, it's crazy,
but it's great.

521
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,213
I did wish
for you to be big,

522
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,084
but I didn't mean
big on the outside.

523

00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,188
Clifford, no,
that's my mom's pillow!

531
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:06,537
Clifford, drop it.

532
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,888
Come on, be a good boy
and drop it.

533
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,063
Give it back!

534
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,065
- [Emily yelps]
- [Clifford whines]

535
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:17,897
[sneezes]

536
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,115
Ew!

537
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,031
[groans]

538
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,598
Bless you.

539
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,948
- Oh, no! My computer!
- [clatters]

540
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,734
- Don't wag your tail. Sit, boy, sit.
- [Clifford whines]

541
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,651
Clifford!

542
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,914
Clifford, just

543
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,611
be quiet, stay here, okay?

544
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:40,006
Shh. I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh, shh, shh.

545
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,666
Casey! Casey! Casey!

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,668
- The meter's broken.
- Casey!

547
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:52,932
[Casey groans] It's 7:30. Huh!
We're gonna be late for school.

548
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,934
- Casey.
- I'm up, I'm up, I'm up!

549
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,500
Um, about the dog...

550
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,502
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

551
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,157
And I don't want to be the no guy.
That's just not who I am.

552
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:04,508
So if you really want to keep that weird
little thing, then it's fine with me.

553
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,338
- So I can keep him?
- You just got to tell your mom I knew nothing about it, okay?

554
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,298
You snuck it back here, you hid it from me.
I had no idea it was here.

555
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,169
- I don't know if she's gonna believe that.
- She is.

556
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,781
The thing is tiny.
It's completely plausible that I would...

557
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:20,176
[screaming]

558
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,917
Run!

559
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,919
Come on.
We got to get out of here!

560
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,356
- There's a monster in the apartment!
- Casey, this is the dog...

561
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,619
Uncles and children first!

562
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,579
Stay back! Stay back.

563
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,059
...from the tent.

564
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,802
But last night it was...

565
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,630
- Yeah, I think something happened to him.
- You think?

566
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,720
He's the same dog
he was last night,

567
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:42,851
he's just a little bit bigger.

568
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,070
"A little bit bigger."

569
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,202
It is the size
of a hippopotamus.

570
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,857
Listen, he's not gonna hurt you, okay?
He's harmless.

571
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,512
He's the same dog
he was last night.

572
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,731
Stay.

573
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,473
[cell phone ringing]

574
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,128
Oh, God. It's your mom.

575
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,477
What am I gonna say?

576
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,828
I don't know.
Uh. Just act natural.

577
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:06,179
- Act natural.
- [whimpers]

578
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,834
Shoo. Stay still.

579
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:11,358
[grunts] What is happening?

580
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:12,576
[ringing continues]

581
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,927
Okay.

582
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,929
Remember. Natural.

583
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:19,714
Hey, girl.

584
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,021
- It's Maggie.
- I know, girl.

585
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,023
Why do you keep
calling me "girl"?

586
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,026
What? That's just a thing that
I say when I'm super chill.

587
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,028
[thumping]

588
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,291
I just wanted to call to make sure
you were on the way to school.

589
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:33,510
- We're walking to the subway now.
- [Emily] Clifford, no!

590
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,599
- Not gonna lose her this time.
- [Maggie] <i>That's not funny.</i>

591
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,254
You're right, that incident is not
something we should joke about.

592
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,430
- Clifford, no! Whoa!
- But we are being so safe right now.

593
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,563
- [clattering]
- What is that noise?

594
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:43,956
Nothing.

595
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,522
But we're at our stop.
Uh, bye, girl!

596
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,394
- [softly] Get up.
- Okay, bye.

597
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,352
Okay. You, sit.

598
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,701
No, don't say that!

599
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:51,920
[clattering]

600
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,707
Somehow I thought
you'd be better in a crisis.

601
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,233
We are finding
that Bridwell guy immediately.

602
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,538
Why?

603
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,323
So we can get rid of that.

604
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,325
But you just said
I could keep him.

605
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,153
Yeah, that was
before he 'roided up.

606
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,719
Oh, come on.

607
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,156
How is there nothing
on this guy?

608
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,984
He doesn't even show up
on Google.

609
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,247
"Bridwell's Animal Rescue"...
nothing!

610
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,902
You can't give people pets that go
nuclear and then not be on the Internet.

611
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,818
That is so irresponsible.
Even by my standards.

612
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,645
- [Clifford whines]
- Oh!

613
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,952
- That means he likes you.
- Oh, great.

614
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,824
[knock on door]

615
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,565
- Who is it?
- Packard.

616
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,830
Oh, no, it's our psycho super. We can't have
pets in the building... we'll get evicted!

617
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,049
[Packard] I'm here
to fix the dishwasher.

618
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,268
- Coming in!
- One second!

619
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,531
Not on my watch. Hide the dog.

620
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:38,967
[Emily] Hey, hey.

621
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,229
[dramatic music playing]

622
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,276
[Casey] I can handle this.

623
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,191
Oh! Maybe I should do
my English accent.

624
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,193
No!

625
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,586
[in British accent] Hello.
You must be Mr. Packard.

626
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:51,806
Who are you?

627
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,938
[in American accent]
Uh, Casey.

628
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,765
Um, Maggie's sister. Brother.

629
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,680
- Um, this is not a great time.
- It's now or never.

630
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,030
Never?

631
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,728
[door closes]

632
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,078
Well, what the heck
is going on in here?

633
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,864
Oh, we were just doing
a little <i>feng shui.</i>

634
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,388
It's Chinese
for "moving things."

635
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,912
The dishwasher's right there.

636
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,132
Yeah, but the water cutoff
is in the bedroom closet.

637
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,785
- Don't... Don't go in here.
- No.

638
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,048
Why not?

639
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,746
- It's private.
- It's haunted.

640
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,792
There's a lot of girl stuff in there
that I wouldn't want you to see.

641
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,316
Yeah.

642
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,927
- I can do it, though.
- Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Casey.

643
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,581
Just get in there and give it
a little... [clicks tongue]

644
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,062
- You know, he's family.
- [Casey] Yeah.

645
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,455
So, the, um...

646
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,458
So, the dishwasher!

647
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:38,897
So, it makes, like,
this weird crackling noise when it drains.

648
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,638
[panting]

649
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,292
Shh.

650
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,079
- No, no, no. Stop!
- [thumping]

651
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:48,689
[thumping]

652
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,605
[grunting]

653
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,433
[groaning]

654
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,044
Everything's under control!
Just shutting off the valve.

655
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,612
[screams] Whoa!

656
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,441
Must be these old pipes, huh?

657
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,139
What the heck is going on
in there?

658
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,099
[loudly] So you are going
into my room now!

659
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,101
[panting] Okay.

660
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,798
[panting]

661
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,105
[sniffs] I smell dog.

662
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,584
Dog?

663
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,195
No, um...

664
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,938
That is just me.
I don't believe in deodorant.

665
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,723
Why mask our natural essence?
In fact, we should smell each other.

666
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,246
- Bring it in.
- Mmm, no. No!

667
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,639
Okay.

668
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,381
[whispers] What are you doing?

669
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,221
[Clifford whimpers softly]

670
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:44,832
[coughs]

671
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,053
[bottle rolling]

672
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,537
Yeah, I think I found
the problem.

673
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:59,455
I got to order a part.
And I will have to return.

674
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,892
Well, thank you very much
for coming.

675
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,156
You are a super super.

676
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,638
Ow.

677
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,772
- [Emily] Bye!
- Bye now!

678
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:12,903
[Emily] Thank you!

679
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,079
[sighs]

680
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,998
This is the craziest thing
I have ever seen,

681
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,956
and I've been to Burning Man.

682
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,613
If we can't find Bridwell,
how are we gonna return him?

683
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,615
[Emily] Good boy, Clifford.

684
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,705
Wait, return him?

685
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,359
We can't abandon him.
We're all he's got.

686
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,143
We just need to make him
small again.

687
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,884
He needs to see a vet.

688
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,278
- A vet?
- [Emily] Yeah.

689
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,844
We don't know
what's going on with him.

690
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,803
- What if he's really sick?
- [groans]

691
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,371
What if he's still growing?

692
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,982
[distorted voice] What if he
grows to be a hundred feet tall?

693
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,592
[distorted panting]

694
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,510
Okay. We'll take him to a vet.

695
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,992
But after that, we are finding
Bridwell and we are giving him back...

696
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,211
Whoa!

697
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,430
- [chuckles]
- [Casey sighs]

698
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,085
...his giant dog.

699
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:07,871
Come on.

700
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,960
[light music playing]

701
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,962
- [Clifford panting]
- Nice job with the belts.

702
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,443
Lucky your mom went through the
Madonna phase in the '80s, huh?

703
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,010
[Emily] Madonna?

704
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,360
Uh, shouldn't we try
to hide him or something?

705
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,668
Nah. It's New York.
No one'll even notice.

706
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:25,933
No, no. I don't care if it's Johnny
Appleseed, don't touch my petunias.

707
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:27,891
[Clifford grunts]

708
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,200
- [Emily] You live here?
- Haven't you ever seen a mobile home before?

709
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,202
- Not like this one.
- [sighs]

710
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,292
My girlfriend and I broke up,
and what with my college loans, I...

711
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,338
- Mmm-hmm.
- Look, this is a valid,

712
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,035
financially responsible
life choice

713
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,646
which your mother does not
need to know about. Okay?

714
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,908
[Clifford whines]

715
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,780
Oh, you're judging me as well.

716
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:48,956
- In.
- Come on, boy.

717
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,569
- Just down the front here.
- [clattering]

718
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,442
No, oh! Or stick your big
fat butt right on my bed.

719
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,573
No! Clifford.

720
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,880
[groans]

721
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,926
[Emily] Clifford, don't slobber on his
financially responsible life choice.

722
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,580
[Clifford barks]

723
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,626
Emily!

724
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,237
Owen. What are you doing here?

725
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,327
I thought you were sick,
so I was gonna bring you your homework.

726
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,894
And I also skipped P.E.

727
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,765
Which I'm suddenly realizing
makes me look

728
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,811
a lot more desperate
than I anticipated.

729
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,553
- So you're not sick.
- No, we're going to the vet.

730
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,555
Don't you need an animal
for that?

731
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,297
[Clifford grunts]

732
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,168
[slobbers]

733
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,257
[people murmuring
in background]

734
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,476
Dogzilla!

735
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,955
- [Casey] No!
- [girl] Is that a dog?

736
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
[Casey] It's okay!

737
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,786
Nothing to see here, folks, just a big
red puppy. Nothing to be afraid of.

738
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,049
- [whines]
- In.

739
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:42,531
We're trying to keep this quiet until
we can get him small again. So...

740
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,360
- Shh.
- This is so cool. You guys got to let me come.

741
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:48,189
This is the kind of education
you can't get in a classroom.

742
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,017
I've seen TED talks
about this.

743
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,150
Sorry, pal. I got enough on my
plate keeping one kid alive.

744
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,629
There is no way...

745
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:54,848
[Owen screams]

746
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,591
Okay, I guess
he's coming with.

747
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,333
[upbeat pop music playing]

748
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,378
- Don't you dare.
- [barks]

749
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,598
Clifford, no. No fetch.

750
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:06,903
No fetch!

751
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,557
[barking]

752
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,604
[Emily] Clifford!

753
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,259
[man] Huh? Oh, no. No, no, no!

754
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,477
Bad doggy!

755
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,087
[screams]

756
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,480
[groaning]

757
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,657
[people screaming]

758
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,182
- [man] That's a good boy!
- [Emily] Clifford, no!

759
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:25,487
[panting]

760
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,054
[man] Bad dog.

761
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,360
[shouting]

762
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,100
Oh!

763
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,625
[man grunting]

764
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,717
How has he
not popped that yet?

765
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:41,634
- [body ball pops]
- Ah. There we are.

766
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,332
Clifford, put him down.

767
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,116
Drop the ball.

768
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,468
- Drop the ball!
- Clifford, drop it.

769
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,166
- Unbelievable.
- Good boy.

770
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,647
No, bad boy. Very bad boy.

771
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,562
[man 2] He's cute.
Right over here.

772
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:58,172
- [indistinct chatter]
- [laughs]

773
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,742
- [Clifford whimpers]
- [Owen] What is he doing?

774
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,787
- What is he doing?
- [Clifford sniffing]

775
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,441
Uh-oh.

776
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,270
[Owen groans]

777
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,316
- Awesome.
- Not awesome.

778
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,709
- [splashes]
- [Emily] Oh!

779
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,233
[Owen grunts]

780
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,670
Oh, I hope I'm not around
for number two.

781
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,759
[Colette] Yesterday's
TV interview

782
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,413
was brilliant, Mr. Tieran.
[Tieran] Thank you.

783
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,415
I mean, I don't want to have
high expectations,

784
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,112
but I'm excited
about what I'm gonna see.

785
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,507
Uh, well, unfortunately,
Mr. Tieran, we haven't seen

786
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,683
exactly the kind of
genetically induced growth

787
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,032
we were hoping for.

788
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,251
[gasps]

789
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,645
- [Tieran] That's a two-headed goat.
- [bleating]

790
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,300
We're trying to feed the world and
you're creating more mouths to feed?

791
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,434
- I guess you could look at it that way.
- Oh, I am.

792
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,957
[goat bleating]

793
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,525
And it's looking back at me
with four eyes.

794
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,831
That's a little unsettling.

795
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,137
What's our goal?

796
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,444
- Well, to feed the world.
- Stop talking.

797
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:57,187
Our goal is to grow giant food
through genetic engi...

798
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,625
[clucking]

799
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:00,930
[groans]

800
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,194
How much money have we spent?

801
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,283
Is it...

802
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:06,588
$400 million.

803
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,112
- That is so much money, huh?
- I know!

804
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,942
- Surely you have something to show for it. Right?
- Well...

805
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,901
- So far, sir, not...
- I heard a "so far."

806
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,251
- Did you hear "so far"?
- I heard "so far".

807
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:21,386
And what that tells me
is we have not failed.

808
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,127
We just have not succeeded
so far!

809
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,347
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

810
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,828
Not you.
I was talking to them.

811
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:33,746
So with that $400 million,
what have we produced?

812
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,705
Larger chickens,
cows that poop chocolate, what?

813
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,274
- Why don't I just show you?
- Oh! That is what I like to hear, okay?

814
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:43,364
Well, this sheep at least
has one head. That's a bonus.

815
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,411
And what do we have here?
Thicker wool that shears itself?

816
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,238
Fur that smells
like Santa Claus? What?

817
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:49,892
Uh, not exactly.

818
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,808
- We included her because she's m...
- Why, Albert?

819
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:53,983
- She's m...
- She's what?

820
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:55,594
She's...

821
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,422
mean.

822
00:38:58,988 --> 00:38:59,946
She's mean?

823
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,687
She's nasty.

824
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:03,384
Well, now you're just
lying to me.

825
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:06,953
- No.
- You're telling me that this gentle, sweet...

826
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,781
- [sheep growls]
- [screams]

827
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,609
- Neat, huh? Kinda cool?
- [thumping]

828
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,045
That's not cool. Stop it!

829
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,438
[growling]

830
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,004
This is my childhood!

831
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:16,179
[Colette] Mr. Tieran?

832
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:18,660
Colette. Yes.

833
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:20,662
From the look on your face,

834
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,838
I'm assuming you have
more good news.

835
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,362
- [sighs]
- You need to see this.

836
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:25,798
That can't be real.

837
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,495
[Colette] It's all over
the Internet.

838
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,672
There's a ten-foot dog
in upper Manhattan.

839
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, my...

840
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,675
- I smell your hair.
- Sorry.

841
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,287
[Tieran] Whatever made this dog
grow could make our food grow.

842
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,202
And then save Lyfegro.

843
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,378
[chuckles]

844
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,729
Please find him. Yes!

845
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,386
[dog whimpers]

846
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:52,955
[Clifford slobbering]

847
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,052
[Emily] Is he all right?

848
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,577
Eh, yeah, um, eh, well...

849
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,666
He's, uh... um, well...

850
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,319
Whoo!

851
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,060
Are you gonna examine him?

852
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:14,542
Yes. I am.
Because I'm a veterinarian!

853
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:17,327
That's what I do,
I examine... animals.

854
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,895
- I'm gonna take a look inside your mouth, buddy.
- [snarls]

855
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,636
Oh, easy.
You want to maybe tell him?

856
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,857
- Oh, yeah. Clifford.
- That's not gonna...

857
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:26,424
[Emily] Good boy.

858
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,251
Oh, maybe have a little
more faith in the kiddies.

859
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,514
Good job there, buddy.

860
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,211
All right, let me take
a look there.

861
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,517
[groans]

862
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,346
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Yeah!

863
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,958
Yes, they're large teeth
on a big red dog.

864
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:43,049
Is that a medical opinion?
It sounded very scientific.

865
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,878
All right, yeah, so,
why don't we get you on the scale, bud?

866
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,183
- But slowly!
- [crackles]

867
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,881
- [kids] Oh!
- [Clifford whines]

868
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,536
It's just the platinum edition
of the X-9000.

869
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,363
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- [vet] No problem.

870
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,887
I'm just gonna write...

871
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,064
- "heavy."
- [Clifford whines]

872
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,110
All right.

873
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,376
Yeah, why don't you
take his temperature?

874
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,988
What? Why? I...

875
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,859
- You know him a little better.
- Uh...

876
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,124
- Where?
- You know.

877
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,649
No, I don't "know"
because I'm not a vet.

878
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,435
Well, in the animal
temperature-taking place?

879
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,307
- Which is...
- Rhymes with "nut-hole."

880
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,787
[Clifford grunts]

881
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,791
[whimpers]

882
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:33,273
- No way.
- You don't wanna... Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

883
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,057
Don't even worry
about that, Clifford.

884
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,842
- Why don't I just listen to his heart?
- Yes!

885
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,192
- That! Yes.
- Let's do that. Let's do that.

886
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:42,587
I'm gonna listen to your heart
now, buddy. [blowing]

887
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,371
[softly] All right,
here we go.

888
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,243
- [heart beating rapidly]
- Oh.

889
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:50,508
Yeah! Clifford, Clifford,
Clifford, Clifford...

890
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:51,770
[both clear throat]

891
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,293
Oh, sorry.

892
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,338
Well, I mean, I got to say,

893
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,299
besides being big and red,
this dog is healthy as,

894
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:02,694
- well, healthy as a horse.
- So you don't know what made him grow like this?

895
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:03,782
[vet] I'm sorry, I don't.

896
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,523
Live near a toxic waste dump?

897
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,176
On top of a burial ground?

898
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,743
- I saw this movie...
- Okay, I think we're done here.

899
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,179
All right.

900
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,791
Crazy idea: How about
we leave Clifford here

901
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,270
with this professional

902
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,838
until, I don't know,
your mom comes home?

903
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:19,537
And if he hasn't shrunken back to a normal
size, then you can figure it out without me.

904
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,190
- Casey!
- That is cold.

905
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:22,409
[Clifford snarls]

906
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,499
Why don't I
finish up the examination?

907
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,935
You guys can just go
wait in the other room.

908
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,981
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

909
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,200
[snarls]

910
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,813
[vet] All right, let's do
the easy part now

911
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,858
and get you
out of here, Clifford.

912
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:39,644
That's one big handsome fella
you got there.

913
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:40,906
[Casey] Why, thank you.

914
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,082
Sign here.

915
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:45,780
- Very good, very good.
- [sneezes]

916
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,782
Yeah, who wants a treat, huh?
You want a treat?

917
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,218
There you go, buddy.

918
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,873
- Yeah. Good job. Okay.
- [whimpers]

919
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:53,309
No, no,
you'll get another treat

920
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,615
- in a little while.
- [sniffing]

921
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,835
Another treat
in a little while.

922
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,924
- You'll get it in a little...
- [Clifford whines]

923
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,316
[indistinct yelling]

924
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:01,883
[thumps]

925
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,407
[Lucille] Thank you.

926
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,800
You know, I've got to say,

927
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,541
I've never seen a dog
that big before.

928
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,282
He was tiny last night.

929
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:10,979
[whimsical music playing]

930
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:13,286
Really?

931
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,158
- You didn't happen to get him from Bridwell, did you?
- How'd you know?

932
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,771
Sweetheart, I have been working in
this office for more than 20 years.

933
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,643
Whenever anyone brings
a unique animal in,

934
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,471
it always seems to come
from Bridwell.

935
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,778
This one guy
couldn't speak a word

936
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,041
until Bridwell gave him
a parakeet.

937
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,522
That bird kept repeating
positive affirmations daily.

938
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,176
Now the guy
can't stop talking!

939
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,962
- [vet exclaims]
- Another woman, she couldn't walk.

940
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,441
She couldn't even move!

941
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,313
Bridwell gave her
a spider monkey.

942
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:41,575
- Every night...
- Lucille, help!

943
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,055
[Lucille] ...it massages
her feet,

944
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,666
and since then,
she's taken up tap dancing.

945
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,626
- Wow, this guy's like a wizard!
- Do you think he could make Clifford small again?

946
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,932
Are you kidding?
That's nothing for a man like Bridwell.

947
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,673
The guy
could perform miracles!

948
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,675
- How do we find him?
- You don't.

949
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,112
He's more of the
there-when-you-need-him type of guy.

950
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:00,028
What do you do,
say his name three times and rub a lamp?

951
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:01,508
[chuckles] So cute.

952
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,641
Have you got any information
on your computer?

953
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,947
- What kind of dumb question is that?
- Dumb question?

954
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:07,645
He just suggested
rubbing a lamp.

955
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:09,603
That's it!
I know how to find him.

956
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:12,650
Bridwell was at our school yesterday.
He set up his tent there.

957
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,653
So that must mean he had to fill
out paperwork with his info on it.

958
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:18,394
- So the information is on the school's computer.
- Exactly!

959
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,009
We hit the school fast,
get the info on Bridwell, and we bounce.

960
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,314
I'll get Clifford
something to eat.

961
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:26,925
Is it safe to leave
the keys up there?

962
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,491
Who's gonna
want to steal this?

963
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,276
Sometimes you pray
for a miracle

964
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,843
to save your company
from ruin,

965
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,584
and then you actually get it!
[chuckling]

966
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,412
But we don't
have him yet, sir.

967
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:39,372
Oh, come on, it's hard to hide
a ten-foot red dog, Colette.

968
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,287
And what is this?

969
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,376
- It's an I.D. chip.
- It's an I.D. chip.

970
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,422
And when this little guy finds its
way into our new large friend...

971
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:48,773
[chuckles]

972
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,559
...the dog becomes
Lyfegro's property.

973
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,257
And red becomes
my new favorite color.

974
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,564
Mr. Tieran.

975
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,479
- What?
- [technician] Sir?

976
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,002
- Yeah.
- [technician] Take a look at this.

977
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:03,135
This girl appears with the dog

978
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:06,573
- in 67% of the images that we've examined.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

979
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:11,186
Now, I've traced the crest on her
uniform to an elite private school.

980
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,971
Ugh! That's a litter
of terrible.

981
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:16,365
- And...
- Oh. All right.

982
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:20,456
"Emily Elizabeth Howard."

983
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,675
Bingo!

984
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:22,981
[upbeat music playing]

985
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:29,030
[Casey] Hey,
that is a lovely broach!

986
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,424
Could you break a 20?

987
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,035
There's kids in the hall selling peanut
brittle, and I got a thing for P britty.

988
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,821
- Peanuts? Ugh!
- Yeah.

989
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,214
Just down the hall.
Far as you can go!

990
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,651
She does not like peanuts.

991
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,918
Nice job.

992
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,747
I'll lift the intel...
stealth mode.

993
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,574
They'll never even know
we were here.

994
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,141
That would've sounded
so much cooler

995
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,013
if you weren't holding
a SpongeBob flash drive.

996
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:56,579
Shh.

997
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,016
- Working.
- [typing]

998
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,326
- [sighs]
- [sarcastically] Charming.

999
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,546
[groans]

1000
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,504
- [car door closes]
- Hello, good sir!

1001
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:10,376
How are you?

1002
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,422
I'm gonna guess that you're
either the superintendent

1003
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:17,470
or you're a part of the New York
Lantern Preservation Society. [laughs]

1004
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,602
- What do you want, smart aleck?
- Okay.

1005
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,996
I need some information on one
of your tenants, please.

1006
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,304
Well, if you think I'm gonna
divulge some confidential infor...

1007
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:26,827
There we are.

1008
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,873
- What do you need to know?
- Yes.

1009
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,484
If you could just let me know
if you've seen these beings.

1010
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:32,702
[Packard sighs]

1011
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:35,749
I knew I smelled a dog.

1012
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:36,881
[rattling]

1013
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,578
[light music playing]

1014
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:44,976
[sniffing]

1015
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,586
And one more, please.

1016
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:50,155
Thanks.

1017
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:52,374
[woman gasping]

1018
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:53,941
Stay! Stay, stay!

1019
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,682
Dog! [screams]

1020
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:56,857
[screaming]

1021
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,121
[man] Oh! What the heck?

1022
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,733
Hey, Food Stamp.

1023
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,300
Thought you
weren't here today.

1024
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:06,780
Hi, Florence.

1025
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,826
Oh, you know, if you need
extra food for home,

1026
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,176
I'm sure we could organize
a food drive or something.

1027
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,830
I'm kind of in a rush.

1028
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,443
[dramatic music playing]

1029
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,010
[students exclaiming]

1030
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:20,185
[sets tray down]

1031
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:24,754
Do you know
how much this blouse cost?

1032
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,452
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

1033
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,889
You're an accident!
You shouldn't even be here.

1034
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:32,284
Why do you get to come here for
free when everybody else has to pay?

1035
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,112
[students exclaiming]

1036
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,853
[Emily] Clifford!

1037
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:38,072
How'd you get in here?

1038
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,769
[Sid] That's the dog
all over Instagram!

1039
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,423
[girl 1] Is that Emily's dog?

1040
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,643
- [Emily] Come on, let's go.
- [Clifford whimpers]

1041
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,950
Clifford, what?

1042
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:48,648
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?

1043
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,171
Can we pet him?

1044
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:51,477
Um, sure.

1045
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,783
This is my dog, Clifford.

1046
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,395
- [Sid] How is he so big?
- He's so cute.

1047
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:58,092
I love him!

1048
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,529
Oh, this is perfect.

1049
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:02,183
The biggest nobody in school

1050
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,142
has the biggest freak
in the world.

1051
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:07,058
- I guess freaks of a feather...
- He's not a freak!

1052
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,669
- [students gasp]
- What did you say to me?

1053
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,544
You're just mad 'cause he stole
all the attention from you.

1054
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,155
[students laugh] Whoa!

1055
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,074
[Emily] Well,
that means he likes you.

1056
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,945
[laughs]

1057
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,120
Burn!

1058
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:29,602
[students laughing]

1059
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,474
[barks]

1060
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,215
Okay, time to go.

1061
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,217
Yes, definitely time to go.

1062
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,393
[light music playing]

1063
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,183
Okay. We can't risk Packard
seeing Clifford.

1064
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,750
Owen, you stay in the truck.

1065
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,317
Wait a minute. What...

1066
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:52,668
Oh, and maybe get Clifford some water.
Thanks.

1067
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:54,627
Okay, we plug
into your laptop,

1068
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,456
download the info on Bridwell,
and then get out of here.

1069
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,154
Oh, my God.

1070
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:02,243
- No.
- We're evicted?

1071
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,203
[Casey] This can't
be happening.

1072
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,161
[doorknob rattles]

1073
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:08,902
[sighs]

1074
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:11,383
Now I've really done it.

1075
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,343
[laughs]

1076
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:18,607
This looks very complicated,
Mr. Jarvis!

1077
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:23,134
I'm not even sure if you're on the
right step for what I was reading you.

1078
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,919
Did you even read the legal
disclaimer on self-installation?

1079
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,661
Certainly, Mrs. Jarvis!
In what world would I ever...

1080
00:49:28,835 --> 00:49:30,576
[both scream]

1081
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,839
- Somebody help! Somebody help him, please!
- [Mr. Jarvis screams]

1082
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,972
Somebody help!

1083
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,582
[Owen] Clifford!
What are you doing?

1084
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:38,758
- Priscilla!
- Jeron, please!

1085
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:41,413
- [Mrs. Jarvis] Somebody grab a ladder!
- [Mr. Jarvis] Somebody!

1086
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,024
- Clifford!
- [screams] He's slipping!

1087
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,200
- [Mr. Jarvis screams]
- [Mrs. Jarvis] Jeron, please!

1088
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:47,723
Hold on, man!

1089
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,378
[woman] Help, please!

1090
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:51,640
[screams]

1091
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:52,902
Jeron!

1092
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,079
[Mr. Jarvis panting]

1093
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:56,645
[crowd gasping]

1094
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:02,521
You just got fetched
by a big red dog!

1095
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:03,870
[crowd applauding]

1096
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:06,699
[woman] That was incredible!

1097
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:09,484
Thank you.

1098
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:11,660
Whose giant dog is this?

1099
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,359
It's Emily's!
It's Emily's dog.

1100
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:17,231
Emily! Your dog
just saved my life!

1101
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:18,885
[crowd cheering]

1102
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:20,669
Clifford?

1103
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,977
[Alonso] Hey, Emily,
did you see that?

1104
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:25,631
It was the greatest
Frisbee catch ever!

1105
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,025
Clifford, good boy. Good boy.

1106
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,765
Thank goodness.

1107
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:32,812
This is my dog, Clifford,
and that's my Uncle Casey.

1108
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:36,468
Wait, Packard
lets you have this dog?

1109
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:40,124
Um, not exactly.
But we're trying to figure it out.

1110
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:44,345
Oh, Owen, we couldn't get the computer.
We were completely locked out.

1111
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,652
- [Owen] Really?
- Yeah.

1112
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:48,741
All right, I'll try
to figure something out.

1113
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:49,959
Thanks.

1114
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,614
[Clifford whimpers]

1115
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,834
[indistinct chatter]

1116
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,228
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

1117
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:58,751
Can me and Emily
borrow your computer?

1118
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:00,100
Of course you may.

1119
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:01,493
[man 1] Let me take
some action shots

1120
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,798
- as I'm walking with him.
- [man 2] Yeah?

1121
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,713
It's not your fault.

1122
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,238
Oh, it is my specialty.

1123
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,197
Screwing stuff up
for your mom.

1124
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,852
I bet you didn't know your mom
got a scholarship to Oxford.

1125
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,115
- She did?
- Yeah.

1126
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:19,380
Wanted to go back to England
for college.

1127
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:22,514
And then our mom died,
Dad went to pieces.

1128
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:26,344
So she stayed here
to help raise me.

1129
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,304
She sacrificed everything.

1130
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:34,569
This is how I repay her:
"Surprise! You're homeless."

1131
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,878
That's why no one
ever believes in me, Em.

1132
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,143
Holy cow!

1133
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:44,884
Guys! I got into the file!

1134
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,191
I found a letter that Bridwell
sent to the school.

1135
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:50,324
But check this out: One of the days he
said he wasn't available is tomorrow.

1136
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:54,154
Because he's gonna be at St. Benedict's
Hospital for a prior appointment.

1137
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,243
- So we can find Bridwell tomorrow!
- Exactly.

1138
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,810
- [Owen] I'll be right back.
- [dramatic music playing]

1139
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:59,507
[security]
<i>We've got eyes on her.</i>

1140
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,118
- [Owen] Mrs. Jarvis!
- What? No.

1141
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,424
Have you not listened
to a word that I've said?

1142
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:06,645
- Emily, we're not playing this game anymore. This is over.
- No.

1143
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,474
We're calling Animal Control,
a zoo, a carnival, whatever.

1144
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,389
Oh! Hello!

1145
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:12,912
You must be Emily Elizabeth.

1146
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:14,348
Who are you?

1147
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,307
I'm Zac Tieran, from Lyfegro.

1148
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:19,092
It is so nice to meet you.

1149
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:21,355
Here's my card.

1150
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:23,662
You are a lifesaver,
young lady.

1151
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,707
I cannot thank you enough
for finding our dog.

1152
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:28,928
- Your dog?
- One of our clumsy janitors left the gate open

1153
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,278
and this large fella
slipped away from the lab,

1154
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:32,714
- didn't ya, big guy? [laughs]
- [barks]

1155
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,107
Okay.

1156
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,587
So,

1157
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:38,590
I'm sure he has been
a huge inconvenience,

1158
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,592
so if I may,

1159
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:43,116
I would like
to offer you this.

1160
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,118
I'm really coming around
to this guy.

1161
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,467
- [Emily] Hold on.
- All right.

1162
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,861
Well, don't hold on. We...

1163
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,516
- Can I have a minute?
- Sure.

1164
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,171
- [Casey] What are you doing?
- Ugh, I hate children.

1165
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,738
[tires screech]

1166
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,352
This fixes everything.
Clifford goes home,

1167
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:02,701
we bribe our way back
into the apartment,

1168
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,920
no one knows any of this
ever happened,

1169
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:08,881
and, well, I will take a very
small babysitting fee off the top.

1170
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,449
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1171
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,972
You're lying.

1172
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:15,366
- Excuse me? What?
- Ah, that's a little strong.

1173
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,542
You said when Clifford escaped
he was big.

1174
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,500
I found him when he was small.

1175
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:20,719
Oh. That's weird.

1176
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:22,373
Everything okay, Emily?

1177
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,202
- Hold your roll.
- I was talking to Emily, my friend.

1178
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,856
- Everything's fine.
- Well, good. I'm Alonso with the Neighborhood Watch.

1179
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,729
- We're watching you! But we're not seeing much.
- [Tieran] Oh.

1180
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:33,427
- I tried to be nice. Albert!
- [dramatic music rises]

1181
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,994
- Sorry.
- [Clifford whimpers]

1182
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,083
- [barks]
- Thank you.

1183
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,171
Clifford, run!

1184
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:40,260
- No. No, no, no!
- Emily!

1185
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,609
Get him! Get him!

1186
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:43,307
[security] We need backup,
now!

1187
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:47,136
- Clifford! Come here, boy!
- [Tieran] Come on!

1188
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,922
- [Raul] Come, everybody!
- [Tieran] What do I pay you people for?

1189
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,707
[clattering]

1190
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,629
In there! Go!

1191
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:04,023
- Oh, no.
- [Casey] Get into the truck! Go!

1192
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:05,590
- Okay.
- [Owen] Hurry, let's go!

1193
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,071
Clifford, come on,
we got to get to the truck!

1194
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,683
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

1195
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,119
[Casey] Help me block the door.

1196
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,602
That'll hold them.

1197
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:18,951
[chuckling]

1198
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,042

[vocalizing]

1202
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,317
- [groans]
- Chips!

1203
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,672
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Alonso!

1204
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,982

1205
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,158
- [screams]
- Raul!

1206
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,942
Oh, my bad.

[screams]

1208
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,253
[security] There!

1209
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,037
- [engine starts]
- What are you doing?

1210
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,213
- I'm getting Clifford out of here.
- You know how to drive?

1211
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,041
If Casey can do it,
how hard can it be?

1212
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:07,216
Oh, Lord.

1213
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,696
[engine revving]

1214
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:12,439
Try that stick thingamabobber.
My dad uses it sometimes.

1215
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:15,486
[screaming]

1216
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,009
Whoa, whoa!

1217
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:19,968
[Owen yells]

1218
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,582
Whoa!

1219
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,105
Okay, not "R".

1220
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,628
This is both unsafe
and illegal!

1221
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:29,021
That's two firsts for me.

1222
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:33,939
Oh.

1223
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,897
- Ow!
- Sorry.

1224
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,116
[both grunting]

1225
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:45,777
[clangs]

1226
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,040
Whew.

1227
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:49,737
[panting]

1228
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,483
- [Emily] I... I am sure we're fine.
- [Owen] No, we're not fine.

1229
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:58,442
We're not fine!
We're not fine!

1230
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,096
Her mother is literally
gonna kill me.

1231
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,663
[Owen] This truck
doesn't have airbags.

1232
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,970
Please keep that in mind
while we're crashing.

1233
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:06,972
Cops! Be cool.

1234
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,017
[breathing heavily]

1235
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,889
What are you doing?
Two hands on the wheel!

1236
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,107
Two hands! Even I know that!

1237
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,718
Two hands!

1238
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,592
- [Emily] They're coming!
- Uh, take a left! Take a left!

1239
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:20,464
- [both screaming]
- [groans, gulps]

1240
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:21,639
[Owen] Whoa!

1241
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,033
That's my building up ahead!

1242
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,644
Garage is open.
Turn left right here!

1243
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,950
The garage is right there!
Turn now!

1244
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:30,212
[both] Whoa!

1245
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,347
[both grunt]

1246
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,700
[Owen] Okay. Let's never
do that again.

1247
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,835
[Steve] You have
the toxicity reports, right?

1248
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,924
- [Maggie] Yes, I do.
- [cell phone ringing]

1249
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,493
It's Emily's school.
Just one...

1250
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's fine.

1251
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,321
Oh, hi, Mrs. McKinley.

1252
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,846
Hi, Maggie. I just wanted
to check on Emily,

1253
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,761
see how she's feeling

1254
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,067
- since she wasn't in school today.
- What?

1255
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,287
[elevator dings]

1256
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,984
[gasps]
Oh, for the love of Mike!

1257
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,290
Siobhan, he's with us.

1258
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,161
Put the Swiffer down.

1259
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,729
Are you insane?
You're driving now?

1260
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,339
What are you upset about?

1261
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,341
I still can't get
my butt cheeks to unclench!

1262
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,605
Where are we?
Is this a museum?

1263
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:16,302
It's just a pied-à-terre.

1264
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:17,912
You live here?

1265
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:20,045
- Yeah.
- [cell phone rings]

1266
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:21,873
Oh, geez.

1267
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:26,355
- Your turn.
- What? I don't know what to say!

1268
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,227
I'd go with anything
but the truth.

1269
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,449
Hey, girl!

1270
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:34,538
Emily, I just got a call
from the school,

1271
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,322
and they said
that you weren't there today.

1272
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,195
What? That's crazy talk, girl!
Of course I was at school.

1273
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,371
- Okay.
- You know what? Casey can explain.

1274
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,549
You're a better liar than me.

1275
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:51,816
Hey! There must have been
some confusion at the office.

1276
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,295
I heard they had
a peanut scare today.

1277
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,384
<i>But I will straighten
it out Monday.</i>

1278
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,082
- No problemo.
- [barking]

1279
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:00,215
Brutus! No!

1280
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,914
- Is that a dog?
- A dog?

1281
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:06,047
What? No. No. No.

1282
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,135
It's the, uh,

1283
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:08,615
dishwasher.

1284
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,313
Just try kicking it.

1285
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,751
I think he wants
to smell Clifford's...

1286
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,188
you know.

1287
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:19,104
Okay. Hey, Brutus.

1288
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,236
Look, there. It stopped.

1289
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,152
You know...

1290
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:27,808
[sniffing]

1291
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,201
[Owen] He done?

1292
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,985
Good boy.

1293
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,987
By the way, have you thought
about finding a new apartment?

1294
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,423
It might be time for a change.

1295
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,774
- [kids exclaiming]
- [screams]

1296
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:38,166
Uh, sorry.

1297
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:40,560
Just checked my phone battery.

1298
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,344
It's on, like, 1%
if you lose me.

1299
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:44,738
[Brutus yelping]

1300
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,741
- [Clifford grunts]
- [Owen] Whoa! Brutus!

1301
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,352
Well, you don't
see that every day.

1302
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,571
[Owen] Brutus.

1303
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:52,659
[sighs]

1304
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,184
He's okay. He's okay.

1305
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:58,099
- Really?
- [Clifford burps]

1306
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,188
Maybe it's time to feed him.

1307
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,235
[Tieran] Okay, first of all,
thank you so much for seeing us, Captain.

1308
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,063
- Chief.
- Sure, of course.

1309
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:07,282
- You telling me this dog is yours?
- Absolutely.

1310
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:10,068
We were in the middle of an
experimental trial when it escaped.

1311
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,897
This creature
is a medical mutant.

1312
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:14,986
- Medical mutant?
- That's right.

1313
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,596
And I'm worried
that this mutation

1314
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,817
could potentially
jump species.

1315
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:20,905
Jump species?

1316
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,471
We need to capture this animal

1317
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,473
and return it to my lab
as soon as possible

1318
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,259
or the consequences
could be catastrophic.

1319
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,391
Picture this, okay?
You're going outside.

1320
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,089
- Cockroaches that size...
- Ugh!

1321
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,830
...flying around
the air! Okay?

1322
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,397
Rats that size walking around
the grocery store with you.

1323
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,660
[Colette] Flying rats.

1324
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,183
- Flying rats!
- Fl...

1325
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,577
- Let me make a call.
- [Tieran] Great, make a call.

1326
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:42,448
[chomping]

1327
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,975
He eats like an animal.

1328
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,064
Well, he is an animal.

1329
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,675
I'm talking about him.

1330
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,590
What?

1331
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:56,114
[indistinct TV chatter]

1332
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,943
- [newsreader on TV] <i>We take you to breaking news.</i>
- Hey, guys. Look!

<i>Please, if you see something,

1342

- <i>Any questions?</i>

1343
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:23,271
Dad!

1344

Hey! [chuckles]

1345
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:28,146
Who are you?

1346
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,670
Um, this is Casey
and that's Emily.

1347
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:32,890
- [Mr. Yu] Emily?
- Yeah.

1348
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:34,456
- As in the Emily?
- Dad!

1349
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,720
Sorry.

1350
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:38,635
He's never mentioned you.
Ever.

1351
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,725
Not once.

1352
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:44,510
So, can they spend the night?
They've got a problem.

1353
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:45,903
- What's the problem?
- [glasses shatter]

1354
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,208
[Brutus barking]

1355
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:48,383
[light music playing]

1356
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,785
I withdraw the question.

1357
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,831
[Emily] Your dad
owns this place?

1358
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,746
[Owen] Yeah, it's, um,
500 acres.

1359
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,965
A lot of space, tons of animals.

1360
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:07,751
- It's perfect for Clifford.
- And it's thousands of miles away.

1361
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,317
[Casey] Em,
the cops are after us.

1362
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:11,276
[speaking Mandarin]

1363
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,279
[in English] Okay, bye.

1364
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:16,194
Okay, so things are falling
into place.

1365
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,631
My shipping company has a
freighter docked in Newark.

1366
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,154
Leaves for Hong Kong
tomorrow night.

1367
01:01:20,328 --> 01:01:22,243
Owen showed you our place
outside Shanghai.

1368
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,289
It's fully staffed.
Clifford would be safe.

1369
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,073
We're not gonna
send Clifford away.

1370
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:27,901
- Emily.
- We're not doing that!

1371
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:29,294
[Casey] Thank you, Mr. Yu.

1372
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:31,165
Would you mind
if I spoke with Emily alone?

1373
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:33,254
Of course. Come on, Owen,
I'll tuck you in.

1374
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:35,126
Dad!

1375
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,259
I never tuck him in. Ever.

1376
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,218
Let's go, big man.

1377
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:42,002
- Good night.
- [Owen] Bye, guys.

1378
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,439
We're having words
about that debacle.

1379
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,139
Debacle?

1380
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:50,794
- China's not that far away.
- Really?

1381
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:53,971
Okay, that's a terrible lie.
It is very far away.

1382
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:56,843
But this is definitely
what's best for him.

1383
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:57,931
I don't care.

1384
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,193
Clifford came to me

1385
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:01,979
when I was alone
and had no friends.

1386
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:05,199
He's the best part of my life.
I'm not gonna abandon him.

1387
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:06,810
We don't have a choice.

1388
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:08,115
We've been evicted.

1389
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:09,595
And now,
according to the news,

1390
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:10,988
we're, like, actual fugitives.

1391
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:12,816
Bridwell could help us!

1392
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,079
You heard Lucille at the vet's office.
He can do it!

1393
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,297
We just need to find him.

1394
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,082
- Emily...
- Casey,

1395
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:21,041
what if you found someone
who was so full of love

1396
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:23,478
they made you feel
like you could do anything?

1397
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,003
How would you feel
if you had to let that go?

1398
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:27,482
[melancholy music playing]

1399
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:29,310
[sighs]

1400
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:32,139
Okay.

1401
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,315
We'll go to the hospital,
look for Bridwell.

1402
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:37,666
But if we can't find him,
or he can't help,

1403
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:40,408
Clifford's got to get
on that boat tomorrow night.

1404
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,152
Deal?

1405
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,546
Deal.

1406
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,908
Looks like we're on the couch,
T-bone.

1407
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:10,830
Whoa. This place
is $27 mil on Zillow?

1408
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,615
Hey, T-bone,

1409
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,400
does Owen
have an older sister?

1410
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:16,880
- [snarls]
- Okay.

1411
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,882
Just asking for a friend.
Understood.

1412
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:21,580
- [snarls]
- Dude. Forget I asked.

1413
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:24,801
[upbeat pop music playing]

1414
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,376
[Casey] Okay.

1415
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,465
Owen, you stay with Clifford.
We'll go find Bridwell.

1416
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:38,989
Why do you always
leave me behind?

1417
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:40,512
Because it's the
kind of education

1418
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:41,818
you can't get
in a classroom.

1419
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,429
[Casey whispering] Act natural.

1420
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,563
[Owen] Clifford,
you sense things.

1421
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:50,827
You sense any chemistry
between me and Emily?

1422
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:51,915
Because I sense...

1423
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:53,090
[Clifford farts]

1424
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,354
[groans] Clifford, gross!

1425
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:59,009
This is what killed
the dinosaurs!

1426
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,445
There are rules!

1427
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,839
You can't let one rip
in confined space!

1428
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,362
[groans]

1429
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:07,844
[groans] Okay, Clifford,
that was really uncool.

1430
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,671
[people clamoring]

1431
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:15,286
Clifford! Get in the truck.

1432
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,507
Are you looking for someone?

1433
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:21,640
[Casey] Yeah.
Um, older guy, silver hair.

1434
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:24,904
Tall. Kinda speaks in riddles.

1435
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:28,342
That... That's his tie!
He wears a polka-dot bow tie.

1436
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,344
- Oh.
- What?

1437
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,304
The man with that tie?
Your friend?

1438
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:35,219
[melancholy music playing]

1439
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,698
He passed away this morning.

1440
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:39,223
No.

1441
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:41,007
That's impossible.

1442
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,313
[Freddy] I'm sorry.

1443
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:47,666
[sniffles]

1444
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,365
He was so kind and magical.

1445
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:52,758
How could he die?

1446
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:57,502
If there's a memorial,
I could email or something.

1447
01:04:57,676 --> 01:04:59,852
Yeah, thanks.

1448
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,943
Uh, here you go.

1449
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:05,684
What about Clifford?

1450
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:08,426
I can't believe it.

1451
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,255
Bridwell was our only hope.

1452
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:12,517
[police sirens blaring]

01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,562
[dramatic music playing]

1454
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,480
[Casey sighs]
I bet that's for us.

1455
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:22,005
It'll be fine. Come on.

1456
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:23,441
[engine revving]

1457
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,884
I just can't believe
that Bridwell is,

1458
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,538
you know.

1459
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:35,757
[police siren blaring]

1460
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,934
We can go back
to my apartment and hide.

1461
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:40,719
Owen, the New York City
Police force is after us.

1462
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,677
There's no more hiding.

1463
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,637
If they find us, they're gonna
hand Clifford over to Tieran.

1464
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,422
So what do we do?

1465
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:52,209
- No.
- Em.

1466
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,688
I'm not gonna give him up!

1467
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:54,863
We've got to do
what's best for him.

1468
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,648
I'm what's best for him.

1469
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:59,651
Not if you can't
keep him safe.

1470
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:01,087
[melancholy music playing]

1471
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,622
Call your father.

1472

[melancholy music continues]

1473
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,282
[Mr. Yu] All right,
everything's been arranged.

1474
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:25,764
Colin will stay with Clifford from the tug to
the freighter, then all the way to Shanghai.

1475
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:27,418
He'll be met at the port
by my staff,

1476
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,985
and they'll bring
him to the house.

1477
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,987
[Colin] Come on, guys,
we got to get going! [claps]

1478
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:33,206
Mr. Yu, we can't
thank you enough.

1479
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,381
You're welcome.

1480
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:38,429
Bye, Clifford.

1481
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:40,518
I hope to see you
again someday.

[Clifford whimpers]

1483
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:44,174
Okay, go wait in the car.

1484
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:48,482
- I'm sorry it worked out like this, Emily.
- Thank you.

01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,052
Hey.

01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,839
I know you don't
understand, Clifford.

1488
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,538
It's just...
It's not safe for you here.

1489
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:03,193
You're just too big.

1490
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,892
And if they find you,
they'll do really bad things to you.

1491
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,633
I can't let that happen.

[Clifford whines]

1493
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,986
There are no other dogs
like you.

1494

And people, they just...

1495
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:20,079
They don't like things
that are different.

1497
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:32,831
What's the matter?
What's he doing?

1498
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:35,268
I think he's trying
to be small.

- [Clifford whines]
- [voice breaks] I'm sorry I let you down, Clifford.

and I couldn't.

[sobs]

1502
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,373
We have to be big and strong.

Remember?

1504
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,769
So that the world
can't hurt us.

1505
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:03,557
You have to go
with these men now.

1506

- It'll be okay.

1552
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:36,232
So if that's not Bridwell,
that means...

1553
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,190
[both] Bridwell's alive!

1554
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:40,453
This guy's dead, which is
tragic, but Bridwell's alive.

1555
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:41,672
- Bridwell is alive!
- Yeah!

1556
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,456
Feels weird high-fiving
the dead!

1557
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,153
- There's still hope for Clifford!
- Let's focus on that.

1558
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,720
- Yes.
- R.I.P. Hamilton Wilder.

1559
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:49,027
- [Both] Long live Bridwell!
- Yes!

1560
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:50,985
- Guys!
- Owen, Bridwell's alive!

1561
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:52,639
[sighs]

1562
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:54,685
Online... I researched...

1563
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,340
I found... Bridwell...
the park.

1564
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:59,733
- Okay. Again. With sentences.
- [Owen inhales deeply]

1565
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:02,649
Bridwell is alive,
and his tent is in Manhattan Bridge Park

1566
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:04,695
- at the Freedom Festival.
- [sighs]

1567
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,087
[Raul] Emily!

1568
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,176
Emily! Come quick!

1569
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:13,878
<i>The giant crimson dog was
stopped earlier this morning</i>

1570
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,707
- <i>by the authorities on a freighter.</i>
- [Raul] Can you believe this?

1571
01:11:16,881 --> 01:11:19,884
- What?
- <i>No one is certain how or why he got aboard,</i>

1572
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:21,625
<i>but it seems an effort
was being made</i>

1573
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,627
<i>to transport him
out of the country.</i>

1574
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,193
<i>The enormous dog
is being returned</i>

1575
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,239
<i>to his home at Lyfegro labs,</i>

1576
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:28,762
<i>the biotech firm
that created him.</i>

1577
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:31,025
No! No, we have
to help Clifford.

1578
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,811
Uncle Casey, we have to save him.
They'll hurt him!

1579
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:39,730
Yeah. We do.

1580
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:42,820
I guess we're paying Lyfegro
a visit.

1581
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,778
I'm in. I'll go get the van.

1582
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:45,866
[uplifting music playing]

1583
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,433
[both] We're in.

1584
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:51,785
Looks like Harlem wants
its big red dog back.

1585
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:55,136
[cell phone ringing]

1586
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,966
- Guess who.
- Let me talk to her.

1587
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,187
- Hi, Mom!
- [Maggie] <i>Emily, what on earth is going on?</i>

1588
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:05,146
- Clifford's in trouble.
- I'm in the taxi on the way from JFK.

1589
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,540
- There's no time to explain.
- [Alonso] Everybody, get in!

1590
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:09,803
- [Maggie] <i>I am an hour away...</i>
- Mom, I can handle this.

1591
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,415
- [Maggie] <i>Handle what? You're twelve years old.</i>
- I got this.

1592
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:15,331
- And besides, Uncle Casey's with me.
- [Maggie] <i>And I am so sorry,</i>

1593
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:17,376
- but, my darling, you... Emily?
- [line disconnects]

1594
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,988
I'm grounded for life,
aren't I?

1595
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:22,599
[chuckles] You and me both.

1596
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,385
It's in Brooklyn Yards,
off Vanderbilt.

1597
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,778
Okay, I'll meet you
over there.

1598
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,170
[Mrs. Crullerman] Hey!

1599
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,737
Get out of my way.

1600
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,523
They should have left
that dog alone.

1601
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,568
Ooh. Now they're in trouble.

1602
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,964
All right, let's start
sequencing its DNA.

1603
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:41,792
[Albert] Yeah, okay, sir.

1604
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:43,489
Hello! How are you?

1605
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:44,925
[Albert] Who's a good boy?
It's okay.

1606
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,797
[Tieran] Good morning.

1607
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,321
I got a speech, but what I have
to say comes from the heart,

1608
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,410
and I apologize
if I get emotional.

1609
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:53,630
We here at Lyfegro,
we've got one mission.

1610
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:55,545
It's to feed the world.

1611
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,068
Hey, Mark, I like your tie.

1612
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:58,983
[dramatic music playing]

1613
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:01,072
[Tieran] We have an illustrious
team of scientists...

1614
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:02,116
[Tieran continues
indistinctly]

1615
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,291
[Casey] Okay.

1616
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,381
Whoa! You carry bolt cutters?

1617
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:06,730
Never leave the house
without 'em.

1618
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,166
You live in a truck.

1619
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,254
Zip it, Owen.

1620
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,516
And to prove that,

1621
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:13,432
I'm sure you saw
that beautiful,

1622
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:16,348
magnificent creature
walking by, who... [chuckles]

1623
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,959
playfully escaped
from our lab two days ago.

1624
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,526
And I tell ya,

1625
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,529
we are very, very thankful
for that big red dog.

1626
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,838
Okay. Now we just need
a diversion.

1627
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:31,450
- We can handle that. Right, Mr. Jarvis?
- Yes, we can, Mrs. Jarvis.

1628
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:33,496
[Casey] We'll head around back.

1629
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,323
[Mr. Jarvis] We'll go make some
trouble at the press conference.

1630
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:37,369
You have an opportunity

1631
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:41,808
to make a sizeable return
on Lyfegro's investment.

1632
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:43,636
- Thank you so much.
- [Mrs. Jarvis] Uh, Mr. Tieran.

1633
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,769
- Mr. Tieran!
- Yes.

1634
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:48,815
Will you please address the lawsuit
that's being filed against you?

1635
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:49,947
Lawsuit? I don't...

1636
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,339
[dramatic music continues]

1637
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:53,994
[doorknob rattles]

1638
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,083
It's locked. Don't worry.
I got a solution.

1639
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:58,869
- We learned how to pick locks in magic class.
- I bet you did.

1640
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:02,176
[Mr. Jarvis] We'll be filing a
class-action lawsuit against Mr. Tieran,

1641
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,656
Lyfegro Research Facilities,

1642
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,049
- and any and all...
- Guys, we've got bogies.

1643
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:07,268
Yeah, I don't speak legalese.

1644
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,228
We've already named Emily Elizabeth
Howard as head class representative,

1645
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:13,927
and we've attached an assault and battery
claim, inclusive of ethical violations.

1646
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:16,843
- [Mr. Jarvis] Hey, let me go. Get your hands off her!
- [Tieran] This is unfortunate.

1647
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,193
This is way too focused on me.
Look at that!

1648
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:20,586
What is the matter with you?

1649
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,153
You're gonna set off
the fire alarm!

1650
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,241
There's another one. Just...

1651
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:25,417
[alarm blaring]

1652
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,637
- Security inside the building, what's going on?
- [guard 1] Go, go, go.

1653
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:30,727
- Check all the doors!
- [guard 2] Yes, sir! On it. Doing it now.

1654
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,642
[bleating]

1655
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,254
[alarm continues blaring]

1656
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:41,564
- What's going on?
- [clamoring]

1657
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:43,087
[chuckling]

1658
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,352
Ah, look. It's a cute sheep.

1659
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:49,049
[bleating]

1660
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,355
Look.

1661
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:52,836
- [growls]
- [screaming]

1662
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,446
Holy sheep.

1663
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,752
[screaming]

1664
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,102
- I'm out.
- Step aside. I know sheep.

1665
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:01,540
Come here, <i>mamachka.</i> Come to mama.
Yeah, come here, come here.

1666

[singing in Russian]

1668
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:18,644
You see? Everybody likes
condensed milk.

1669
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,254
Go get it. [laughs]

1670
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:23,214
Yes, even the can tastes good,
doesn't it?

1671
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,216
[guard 1] Sectors three
through five clear.

1672
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,479
[guard 2] It's a false alarm
at the loading dock.

1673
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:28,654
Copy that.

1674
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:30,177
False alarm
at the loading dock.

1675
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:32,179
<i>Resetting all systems.</i>

1676
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:35,226
- [man] Whoa!
- [Emily] Clifford!

1677
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,184
Sorry, my friends,
we're taking the dog.

1678
01:15:37,358 --> 01:15:39,796
I've got 30,000 volts
that says you're not.

1679
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,145
- [crackling]
- [grunts]

1680
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:44,931
- I've got a plastic hand.
- But I have a real one.

1681
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:46,542
[grunting]

1682
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:49,719
[Mrs. Crullerman] No!

1683
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:52,417
- Oh!
- It's heavy because it's condensed, <i>tovarishch.</i>

1684
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:53,940
Okay, anyone in a lab coat...

1685
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:55,246
- [crackles]
- ...take a hike.

1686
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,856
Okay.

1687
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,076
Huh.

1688
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,381
[Emily] Clifford!

1689
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,340
Are you okay?

1690
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:03,863
Clifford.

1691
01:16:04,037 --> 01:16:05,386
[soft music playing]

1692
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:14,265
Clifford?

1693
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:16,572
Clifford!

1694
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:18,312
You're okay!

[uplifting music playing]

1696
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:21,794
Clifford, buddy.

1697
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:23,187
I know, I know.

[Emily chuckles]

1701
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,629
- Aw!
- [yips]

1702
01:16:30,803 --> 01:16:33,893
- Hey, buddy. I'm happy, too.
- [Casey] I don't want to break this up

1703
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,330
because it is, like,
the most adorable thing

1704
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:39,856
I've ever seen, but how are we gonna get
him to Bridwell in Manhattan Bridge Park?

1705
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,598
Listen, you guys take off without me.
Maybe I can distract security.

1706
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:44,774
I am a magician, after all.

1707
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:47,603
- What?
- We got to get him to the truck.

1708
01:16:47,777 --> 01:16:49,953
Uh, no, no, no,
they'll grab him.

1709
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,391
We're not taking the truck.

1710
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:55,219

01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:01,442
[Emily] Come on, jump!

1714
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:03,749
Whoa!

1715
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:07,100
Oh, come on! Get my car!

1718
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:15,718
Head to the park.
I'll meet you there.

1719
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:17,197
[Chief Watkins]
We need backup, now!

1720
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:18,721
[Emily] Go, Clifford!
Come on, boy!

1721

[men grunting]

1723
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:26,163
Hey. What are you doing?

1724
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:27,947
You like magic?

1725
01:17:28,121 --> 01:17:29,688
- [laughs] Watch me disappear!
- Hey! Get back!

1726
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:31,559
- We're here at Lyfegro...
- Can I borrow this?

1727
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:34,214
- Hey!
- That dog was stolen by Lyfegro.

1728
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:35,825

[helicopter reporter]
<i>It looks like the big red dog</i>

1735

the Lyfegro facility</i>

1736
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:56,106
<i>in the strangest chase
I have ever seen.</i>

1737
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,893
[Tieran] Whoa! Easy!
Come on, come on! Yeah!

1738
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,939
[laughs]

1739
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:04,941
I see red.

1740
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:06,203
[Emily] Turn!

1741
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:07,987
[Tieran] No, no, no, no, no!
Come on!

1742
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,772
- [Emily] Go, go!
- [police siren chirps]

1743
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,295
He belongs to my niece, Emily.

1744
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,732
She rescued him
when he was just a tiny puppy.

1745
01:18:14,994 --> 01:18:16,387
If her mom is watching,

1746
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:18,432
I'd like it on record
that I told her not to.

1747
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:20,608
- Casey?
- <i>But she didn't listen.</i>

1748
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,567
<i>Because she knew,
right from the beginning,</i>

1749
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,003
that that dog

1750
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,091
was her dog.

1751
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,180
<i>And now, a big corporation</i>

1752
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:30,357
<i>is trying to steal a puppy
from a little girl.</i>

1753
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:32,229
Are we gonna do
anything about it?

1754
01:18:32,403 --> 01:18:35,972
And finally, to my ninth-grade
math teacher, Mr. Beamus,

1755
01:18:36,146 --> 01:18:38,452
who told me that I would
never amount to anything,

1756
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:39,845
<i>I would like to point out</i>

1757
01:18:40,019 --> 01:18:42,369
<i>that only one of us
is on TV right now.</i>

1758
01:18:42,543 --> 01:18:45,503
<i>So, Mr. Beamus,
you can kiss my...</i>

1759
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,679
Oh, snap.

1760
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:48,985

<i>Sir, where is that dog going?</i>

1761
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,073
<i>Manhattan Bridge Park.</i>

1762
01:18:50,247 --> 01:18:51,509
Can we go faster?

1763
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,250
- [woman] Over here.
- I'm gonna need a ride.

1764
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:55,600
[man] Look!
That dog right there!

1765
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,776
[Raul] At the end of the tunnel,
the park should be really close.

1766
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,909
- [Mr. Jarvis] Just step on it.
- I'm stepping! I'm stepping!

1767
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,389
- Guys! Emily! She's on TV!
- What?

1768
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:03,913
Careful!
Two hands on the wheel!

1769
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:05,349
- Everybody calm down!
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:19:05,523 --> 01:19:06,959
[police sirens blaring]

1771
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,483
[Emily] Watch out!

1772
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,357

- I mean, this is crazy!

1783

Doesn't she understand

- Oh, perfect.
- [man] Wow.

- [kid 1] Look at that dog!

1796
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:14,635
[kid 2] Look at the dog.

[Emily] Mr. Bridwell!

1800

Mr. Bridwell!

1801
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,734
My goodness!

1802
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:29,563
Someone's been eating
their spinach. [laughs]

1803
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:31,827
You are hot! You need a drink.

1804
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:34,220
Go over there to that big blue
dunk tank over there.

1805
01:20:34,394 --> 01:20:37,441
- [Emily] Mr. Bridwell!
- Emily!

1806
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,138
[siren wails]

1807
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:41,488
We were looking for you,
and we thought you were dead.

1808
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,969
Well, I hope not.
I just booked a safari.

1809
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:46,232
But at the hospital,
we saw your bow tie.

1810
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,495
Oh, I understand.

1811
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,628
Well, I went there to spend
time with an old friend.

1812
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:52,717
A very sick old friend.

1813
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:55,111
And he'd always
loved that bow tie,

1814
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:56,939
so I gave it to him

1815
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:59,767
so that he could stand out
from the crowd up there.

1816
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:02,074
[sirens blaring]

1817
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:04,903
Mr. Bridwell, you have to make Clifford
small again or they're gonna hurt him.

1818
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:08,515
Small? But it was your love
that made him so big.

1819
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:10,169
Nobody can take that away.

1820
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:11,649
But will he be okay?

1821
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:13,912
Your love is all he needs.

1822
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,174
[Chief Watkins]
Create a perimeter!

1823
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:17,916
Do not let that dog
leave this park.

1824
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,483
[over PA] Emily
Elizabeth Howard,

1825
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:20,701
for your own safety,

1826
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,573
please step away
from the animal.

1827
01:21:22,747 --> 01:21:24,531
- He's dangerous.
- He's just a puppy!

1828
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:27,447
That creature is the property
of Lyfegro

1829
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:28,971
and is a threat to our city!

1830
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:31,190
No, he's not!
He never hurt anyone, I swear.

1831
01:21:31,364 --> 01:21:32,539
- [man] Lock him in a cage.
- [barks]

1832
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:34,324
Whoa, you see that?
He's violent!

1833
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,891
- [Emily] No, he's just scared.
- [Clifford whines]

1834
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:38,937
You would be, too.
Please, leave him alone.

1835
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:42,985
Mr. Bridwell,
you've got to do something.

1836
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,596
I can't do this on my own.
They're not listening!

1837
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,338
Really?
Well, why have they come?

1838
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,733
[cop] Back off, back off.

1839
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,779
And you thought you didn't
have any friends, huh?

1840
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:58,261
[Chief Watkins] All right, ladies
and gentlemen, disperse immediately.

1841
01:21:58,435 --> 01:22:01,177
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1842
01:22:02,308 --> 01:22:04,745
See what happens
when people break the rules?

1843
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,704
Emily, if you want them
to listen,

1844
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:07,923
you'd better speak.

1845
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:12,666
Hmm?

1846
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:16,583
- Let's go get that dog.
- No, please, stop!

1847
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:20,413
No, I have something
I have to say.

1848
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:23,025
[Clifford whimpers]

1849
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:30,119
There's a lot
of people here.

1850
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:32,382
You got this.

1851
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:35,124
My name is Emily Elizabeth,

1852
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:37,430
and this is my dog, Clifford.

1853
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:39,911
I know he's bigger
than most dogs,

1854
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,957
but he's also the kindest,

1855
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,002
most loving dog
in the whole wide world.

1856
01:22:44,176 --> 01:22:46,135
- [man] He's a freak!
- [people clamoring]

1857
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:49,921
- It's dangerous!
- No, he's not dangerous! He's just different.

1858
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,314
- That's all.
- [Clifford whines]

1859
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,751
I know how he feels,

1860
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:56,536
because I know
what it's like to not fit in.

1861
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,148
Just because you're different,

1862
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:02,020
it doesn't mean that it's okay
to be teased or bullied.

1863
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:05,502
And I'm gonna guess that many
of you know how much that hurts.

1864
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:07,286
[panting] Emily Elizabeth!

1865
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,374
[uplifting music playing]

1866
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:09,636
Someone once told me

1867
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,203
it's the people
who are unique,

1868
01:23:11,377 --> 01:23:13,945
they're the ones
who change the world.

1869
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:17,122
If Clifford was just a regular
dog, we wouldn't all be here.

1870
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,516
We've got to stand up for him!

1871
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,040
- Emily's right!
- Yeah, that's right!

1872
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:23,433
That dog saved my life!

1873
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,565
- [yips]
- [Emily] He doesn't hurt anyone.

1874
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,785
He just...
He loves.

1875
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:29,656
[woman] Yeah!

1876
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,617
And if we can
love each other like this,

1877
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,229
none of us would have to feel
small and all alone again.

1878
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:39,753
- Right, Clifford?
- [yips]

1879
01:23:39,927 --> 01:23:41,364
It's not right
to take him away

1880
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:43,061
just because he's big and red.

1881
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:46,021
So, please.
Please let me keep my dog.

1882
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:47,761
[people cheering]

1883
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:49,633
Who's with me?

1884
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:51,678
- [cheering]
- [uplifting music rises]

1885
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:56,509
[chuckles]

1886
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,384
[Tieran] Oh! Oh!

1887
01:24:01,558 --> 01:24:02,950
Bravo!

1888
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,563
- Bravo! Bravo!
- [growls]

1889
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,610
That was so inspiring, Emily.

1890
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,743
I've got chills.

1891
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:14,223
[chuckles] Oh, my goodness.

1892
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:16,268
Man, I hate to ruin
this beautiful moment,

1893
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:17,878
but I've got to reclaim
my property.

1894
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,533
Because we all know this dog
you call Clifford

1895
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,579
belongs to...
[clicks tongue] Lyfegro.

1896
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:24,537
- [crowd protests]
- No, he doesn't.

1897
01:24:24,711 --> 01:24:27,105
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Please do not take my word for it.

1898
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,630
You see, he was microchipped
at birth.

1899
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:32,545
- [crowd groans]
- Yeah.

1900
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:34,939
[whines softly]

1901
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:37,289
Officer, could you
please do the honors?

1902
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:39,683
- [Raul] Go home!
- He converted her property!

1903
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:41,989
- [Albert] It's in his left neck.
- That's right, left neck.

1904
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,687
Oh, my gosh, this is glorious.

1905
01:24:44,601 --> 01:24:46,168
Excuse me, young lady.

1906
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:47,343
[dramatic music playing]

1907
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:49,475
[Tieran] Isn't this fun?

1908
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:54,872
- [beeping]
- [sighs]

1909
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:56,830
- [beeping rapidly]
- [Tieran chuckles]

1910
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,964
- This dog belongs to...
- Yeah.

1911
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:07,885
...Emily Elizabeth Howard.

1912
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:09,278
- [Clifford barks]
- [cheering]

1913
01:25:09,452 --> 01:25:10,366
[triumphant music playing]

1914
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:13,151
What? That's impossible.

1915
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,287
- Good for you, Emily!
- That's bonkers!

1916
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:21,768
This is a mistake. Nah-ah. It's a mistake!
It's got to be a mistake.

1917
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:24,902
[Chief Watkins] We need to have a talk about
the bill the city will be sending you.

1918
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:26,730
Please escort this gentleman
to my vehicle.

1919
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:28,123
[Tieran] Get your hands off me.

1920
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:29,385
Come on.
Colette, where's my attorney?

1921
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:32,170
- I quit.
- What? Colette!

1922
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:33,476
I'll never leave you, sir.

1923
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,738
I don't care about you.
Colette!

1924
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:35,826
- Ouch.
- Colette, come back here.

1925
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,221
Isn't technology amazing?

1926
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:41,048
People say
it's quite like magic.

1927
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,268
- [laughs]
- So, if you'll excuse me,

1928
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,140
I have some other people
I need to help.

1929
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:47,403
After all, you're not
the only person in the world

1930
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:50,188
who isn't looking for a pet.

1931
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:52,147
[chuckles]

1932
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:55,062
[Bridwell whistling]

1933
01:25:55,802 --> 01:25:57,326
[Chief Watkins] Officers!

1934
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:00,807
- Stand down!
- [crowd cheering]

1935
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:02,548
- [Clifford barks]
- [man] Make way!

1936
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,550
- Come here, Clifford!
- Way to go!

1937
01:26:05,899 --> 01:26:07,423
Come, come.

1938
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:09,033
- [Maggie] Hey, girl.
- Mom!

1939
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:14,343
My bold and brave little girl.

1940
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:15,822
Just like you taught me.

1941
01:26:15,996 --> 01:26:17,955
Oh, by the way, Mom...
we got a dog.

1942
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,044
Yeah, I noticed.

1943
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:22,438
As for you,
I have no words to...

1944
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:23,613
"I love you. I forgive you.

1945
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,005
You are
the responsible brother

1946
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,833
that I always dreamed
of having."

1947
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:28,661
Okay, we'll go with that
for now.

1948
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:32,709
Well, you did it, Em.

1949
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:35,015
You saved him,
just like you said you would.

1950
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,888
Well, I couldn't have done it without
my mature and super-dependable uncle.

1951
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:39,933
You have another uncle?

1952
01:26:40,107 --> 01:26:42,632
You know how you said
no one believes in you?

1953
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:43,981
I believe in you.

1954
01:26:44,155 --> 01:26:46,201
You just need to believe
in yourself.

1955
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:51,467
- How do you know so much stuff for a fourth grader?
- Sixth.

1956
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,164
I was doing air quotes
behind your back.

1957
01:26:54,034 --> 01:26:55,210
- [Clifford whines]
- Okay.

1958
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:57,342
[laughing]

1959
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,344
We love you, too, Clifford.

1960
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:00,606
[Owen] Guys!

1961
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,086
Let's take a picture
of Clifford.

1962
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,392
A group photo.

1963
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,350
Everybody scooch in.
Get in, get in.

1964
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:08,440
Uh, Casey, you know what?
Casey, just get on the dog.

1965
01:27:08,614 --> 01:27:11,095
- No. No!
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be neat.

1966
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:14,011
- Get on the dog, it's fun!
- I'm not getting on the dog.

1967
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:16,056
If you don't get on the dog,
I'll tell Mom about...

1968
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,362
Okay, let's get on the dog.

1969
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:18,972
[indistinct chatter]

1970
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,236
- [Mr. Jarvis] There he goes.
- Yeah, get up there.

1971
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,367
Come on, Casey.

1972
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,542
Get up there.

1973
01:27:23,716 --> 01:27:25,849
- [Casey grunts]
- [crowd exclaiming]

1974
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,633
- There you go.
- [Casey grunts]

1975
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:30,245
[Owen] All right.
That's perfect. Perfect.

1976
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:31,594
- [upbeat pop music playing]
- Oh, no.

1977
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:33,030
[barking]

1978
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:36,076
- [Emily] Clifford. No fetch.
- Oh, no.

1979
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,035
- No fetch!
- No. [screams]

1980
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,082
Clifford! [screaming]

[Bridwell] <i>And so the pure,</i>

1984
01:27:58,403 --> 01:28:01,754
<i>simple love
between a girl and her dog</i>

1985
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:04,104
<i>changed everything.</i>

1986
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,890
<i>Emily and her mother

1987
01:28:07,064 --> 01:28:12,635

<i>Other people matured.</i>

1989
01:28:14,985 --> 01:28:18,423

moved out of his van</i>

1991
