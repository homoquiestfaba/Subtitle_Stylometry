1
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,789
Hey, I like your knee socks.

2
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,823
They're not knee socks.
They're fashion tights.

3
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,423
It's all one...

4
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,156
whatever.
You wouldn't get it.

5
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:46,656
Yeah, I do. You mean they're
opaque black up to the thigh,

6
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,889
sheer black up top.

7
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,689
Yeah, that's...

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,989
that's exactly right.

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,489
Yeah, I like it.
I think it's hot.

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,756
Yeah, I like it too.
I've just been really into, like,

11
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,423
wearing my thighs out lately.
I feel like it's

12
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,789
sexualish and superpowery.

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,989
Mmm, you like that
superpower sex, huh?

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,423
Yeah!

15
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:12,423
Yes, I see why
you think that's funny.

16
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:15,423
Like in your world, that's
probably really clever wordplay.

17
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,923
Could you guys buzz off?
I'm trying to focus.

18
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,656
Focus on what?
The wall?

19
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:22,056
"Focus on what? The wall?"

20
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:23,556
That's what you sound like.

21
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:25,756
No, I'm shooting
a special here for HBO.

22
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:28,690
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's kind of a big deal.

23
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,691
At Largo?
That's, like, barely 300 seats.

24
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:37,556
Well, I'm actually
doing it in the...

25
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:38,790
the littler room.

26
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,423
The little room?

27
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,291
That's like 50 seats.

28
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,156
39 with the fire marshal code.

29
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,790
Whatever!

30
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,723
Hey, you need
to call your agent.

31
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:55,423
Can't be doing no HBO special
for 39 people!

32
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:57,423
That's like super tiny.

33
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:59,857
It's called intimate, fuckface!

34
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,090
What's that, pot?

35
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,857
Mmm mmm.
It's a bunch of stuff.

36
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:09,091
Hey, tell us a joke.

37
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:13,556
What do you call
a car full of Mexicans?

38
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:14,891
What?

39
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,524
Pains in my ass...

40
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:21,591
...hole.

41
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,323
Please put your hands together
for Miss Sarah Silverman.

42
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,256
Tell me I'm great.

43
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:31,023
What? Tell me I'm great!
Tell me I'm great!

44
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,591
You're crazy-8.

45
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,366
Crazy great.

46
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,479
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

47
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,924
Oh.

48
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:16,523
I very rarely,

49
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,691
occasionally,

50
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,745
obsessively watch porn

51
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,778
on my phone.

52
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:29,455
And when I do, I integrate it
into my nighttime rituals.

53
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,888
I wash my face.

54
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,488
I floss.
I take a puff.

55
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,723
Then I brush.

56
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:40,956
Then I do my stretches.

57
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,923
Then I type in my search words.

58
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:49,152
Let me just say,
my search words

59
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:53,085
are not anything I would want
to happen in real life.

60
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:56,385
I don't know why they're
my search words, but they are.

61
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,752
A great man once said,

62
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:01,320
"The heart wants
what it wants."

63
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,452
So my search words are:

64
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,085
gangbang...

65
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:12,120
would not want that
to happen in real life;

66
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,652
um, amateur...

67
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,252
'cause I don't like seeing,
like, piercings and tattoos...

68
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,119
it takes me out of it;

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,019
cum...

70
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,053
which I would not have
thought you had to put "cum."

71
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:29,152
I thought that was
a given in pornography.

72
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:31,552
You have to put "cum."

73
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:34,953
If you don't,
you might not get cum.

74
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,085
If anything, I would think
you'd put non-cum

75
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,786
if you don't want cum.

76
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:46,052
And then there's one more.
Oh, high-fives.

77
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,286
So...

78
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:54,252
I put my iPhone... I lean it
against my water on my nightstand.

79
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,685
And...

80
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,920
I think I'm maybe the only person
that watched this video

81
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,677
all the way
till the end end end,

82
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,145
like when the video freezes.

83
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:07,611
It's, of course, a gangbang

84
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:10,277
and, you know,
basically ends with

85
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,211
all the guys coming
on the lady's face.

86
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,977
And...

87
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:17,145
I don't know why face
was the quiet word there.

88
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:20,812
All the men come on the lady's

89
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,922
face.

90
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:30,821
And then right before
the video freezes,

91
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,854
I heard a guy say to her,

92
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,488
"Hey, great job.
I know you were sick."

93
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,422
You find humanity...

94
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:52,622
in the oddest of places.

95
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,354
So my mom was in the hospital
and I visited her.

96
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,587
I don't need segues.

97
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,954
The brain doesn't work that way.

98
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,487
A train of thought bounces
around from thing to thing.

99
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:08,221
But anyway, speaking of a whole
bunch of men coming on a lady's face,

100
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:10,522
my mother's been sick.

101
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,987
And I visited her
in the hospital

102
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:16,421
and she said,
"It's weird, you know?"

103
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:19,654
There was this Jewish
volunteer service that came by

104
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,854
and they were visiting
the Jewish patients, which is nice,

105
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:24,821
but isn't that so,
like, elitist?

106
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:28,154
Like what, do they, like, banana around
the non-Jewish patients?

107
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,221
Like, "None for you."

108
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:33,421
But my mother's
last name is O'Hara.

109
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,921
She married a John O'Hara.

110
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:39,254
And she said, "They visited me.
Like, how they did know I was Jewish?"

111
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:42,321
And we looked into it
and it turns out

112
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:46,122
they count how many times
you press the call button.

113
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:56,987
I had a, um...
you ever have a memory

114
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,587
and you... that you haven't had
since the event happened?

115
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,621
You know what I mean?
It's so crazy.

116
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,187
I had this memory
of being like three

117
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:08,787
and I would shower
with my mother.

118
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,621
And, like, my mom's...

119
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:15,587
okay, my mom got her water
from the showerhead,

120
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:18,187
like that's where
she would get her water

121
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,788
with which to cleanse herself.

122
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,254
That water would then

123
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,254
cascade down her ample bosom

124
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:28,621
and, like,

125
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,455
pike off of her
'70s Jew bush...

126
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,788
that was my water.

127
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:44,422
And that's the thing,
it was a happy memory.

128
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:48,122
I associate it with happy.

129
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:53,054
I don't know why.
Like, it was my very own curly shower

130
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,088
or something.

131
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,421
Maybe because
we didn't need words.

132
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:01,987
You know, it wasn't like she was like, "You
get your water from my pubes," you know.

133
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,921
We didn't need any of that.
It was like I was...

134
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,487
I was like a native

135
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:10,254
that knew you could get water
from this leaf or something.

136
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,454
It was very...

137
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,488
animalistic.

138
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:18,954
I was a bedwetter
well into my teens.

139
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,087
And when you're a bedwetter,

140
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,921
there's only one group of people
you can feel better than:

141
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,122
bedshitters.

142
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:32,721
And unfortunately
they're hard to come by.

143
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,487
You know?

144
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:38,222
I love this...
The HBO 39.

145
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,187
But I grew up in New Hampshire,

146
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:48,287
and there are not
many Jews in New Hampshire.

147
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:51,021
And we... we weren't really
raised with any religion.

148
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:55,254
We were just Jewish in that
it oozed out of our pores, you know.

149
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,721
Um, but I didn't feel
so different

150
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:00,187
until maybe like
around third grade.

151
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,187
Kids started blaming me

152
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,087
for my people killing Jesus.

153
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:08,287
I remember even then thinking,

154
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,054
"It's not like
we killed baby Jesus."

155
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,822
I mean, the man, like...

156
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,622
He had quite a run.

157
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:19,954
He was 33.

158
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,221
33 is young. If someone
dies now at 33, it's terrible.

159
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:26,354
But I mean, back then,
in the olden oldie-timey times...

160
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:29,154
33 was like elderly.

161
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:33,188
33... dying at 33 was like
he had a full life, you know.

162
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,021
And by the way, you're welcome.

163
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:40,222
If we had not killed him,
he wouldn't even be famous.

164
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:50,455
You know, and nothing seems
crazy when you're used to it.

165
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,887
There's so much
crazy shit everywhere.

166
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:57,154
We're used to it. And everything seems
crazy when you're not used to it.

167
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,787
That's why so many comics
make fun of Scientology, right?

168
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:03,587
Because like... well, because
it's a batshit crazy religion,

169
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,987
but it's no more batshit crazy

170
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:10,154
than, like,
every single religion.

171
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,454
It's just new, you know.

172
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,621
Christianity is super old,
but it's fucking crazy.

173
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:18,988
I mean, it's...
you're born a sinner.

174
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,787
By being born, you are a sinner

175
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,221
and you're going to hell.

176
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:28,454
But you can just apologize
and then you can go to heaven.

177
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,487
No big deal.

178
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:33,054
If you're a murderer...

179
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,987
same thing, it's just
apologize and go to heaven.

180
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:38,187
You can be Hitler

181
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,654
and go to confession and say,
"Forgive me, Father,

182
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,387
I killed six million Jews."
And the priest would just be like,

183
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:46,988
"No problem.
Say 10 'Heil' Marys."

184
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,255
And Hitler goes to heaven.

185
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,455
Hitler goes to heaven...

186
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,955
is the name of my band.

187
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,754
Scientology is weird
because it's new.

188
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:05,654
It's... it feels weird
in our ear holes

189
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:08,988
to hear people worshipping
a guy named Ron.

190
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,488
We know Rons in our life.

191
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,621
He had to change
his name to "L. Ron"

192
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,587
because there was another Ron Hubbard
in the Writer's Guild.

193
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:24,255
That's how recent
a religion it is.

194
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:29,621
And people who follow their religion
to the letter of the law

195
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,421
are just silly.

196
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,387
I mean, I want
to tell Hasidic Jews,

197
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:37,087
"I promise you,
God will not mind

198
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:40,055
if you wear a nice cotton blend
in the summer.

199
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:45,555
You're being
fucking ridiculous!"

200
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:52,921
But we live in the greatest
country in the world.

201
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,421
A country where we have
freedom of religion

202
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,921
and separation
of church and state,

203
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:01,321
only we dont at all
and nobody says anything

204
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,387
'cause we're used to it.

205
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,721
It says, "In God we trust"
on our money.

206
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:07,454
It says, "In God we trust"

207
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:10,187
above the judge's bench
in a courtroom,

208
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,487
in a court of law where you have
to put your hand on a Bible...

209
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,954
the Christian Bible.
It's not my Bible.

210
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:18,454
I mean, if...
if I tell the truth,

211
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:21,021
it's because I tell the truth,

212
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,421
not because I put my hand
on a book and made a wish.

213
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,155
It's fucking crazy.

214
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,788
That's craziness.

215
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:36,421
And stop telling girls they can be
anything they want when they grow up.

216
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,221
I think...

217
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:41,221
I think it's a mistake.

218
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,621
Not because they can't,
but because

219
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,488
it would've never occurred
to them they couldn't.

220
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:52,421
You're planting
that seed in their heads.

221
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:55,354
It's like saying,
"Hey, when you get in the shower,

222
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:57,522
I'm not gonna
read your diary."

223
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:05,988
"Hold on.
Are you gonna read my diary?"

224
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,054
"What? Are you crazy?
I just said

225
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,687
I'm not gonna read your diary.

226
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,555
Get in the shower."

227
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:19,454
Girls grow up so fast.

228
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:21,754
It's like they don't have
childhoods anymore.

229
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:23,954
They're sexualized
so early, you know.

230
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,654
I... a girlfriend of mine
has a little baby girl

231
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,221
and I babysat her.

232
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,287
I changed her diaper...

233
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,988
totally shaved.

234
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,822
Six months old.

235
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,687
What a country.

236
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,354
That's my new catchphrase. I know
that Yakov Smirnoff said it in the '80s,

237
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,288
but I'm repurposing it
with a malaise.

238
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:58,587
I just wanna shake girls.
All the girls here,

239
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,987
I wanna just tell you you
don't need a vaginal deodorant, okay?

240
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:05,121
I know it seems
like a real thing

241
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:08,921
because there's real commercials
and for some reason we trust that...

242
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:11,287
that commercials mean
it's real, you know?

243
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,754
And there's real products
on shelves.

244
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,054
No, it's a made-up need

245
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,421
made by greedy,
money-addicted,

246
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:21,354
faceless corporations

247
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,554
preying on a woman's
greatest insecurity...

248
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,788
smelly vagina.

249
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:32,887
If you use regular
soap and water in the show...

250
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:36,587
use whatever you wash your asshole with.
How about that?

251
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,854
Surely that's strong enough

252
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,788
for your disgusting vagina.

253
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:48,754
Rinse,

254
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,221
and if when you
get out of the shower,

255
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,687
there's still like something,

256
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:57,087
like a rancidishness coming,

257
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,688
um, go to the doctor.

258
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:04,721
Don't spray perfume on it.
That's fucking crazy.

259
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:07,887
That's what a crazy person would do.
Do you see now?

260
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:11,055
Are your eyes open?
Are you living a conscious life?

261
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,654
I'm lucky I don't have
to worry about that because...

262
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,287
I've been with a few men
who have told me that my vagina

263
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,655
smells like a, um,

264
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,321
a peach...

265
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,687
a peach tree.

266
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:27,921
A...

267
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,588
a peach tree dish.
Is that a thing?

268
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,855
That joke took real acting.
Real-life acting.

269
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,654
You had the craziest reaction.

270
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,722
He just... his arms were folded
and he just went like...

271
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,821
Like, "Oh, Sarah!

272
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,188
You're incorrigible."

273
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,488
Oh, I'm corrigible.

274
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:08,787
It's not all "The Man."
It isn't.

275
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:11,154
It's not all corporate America.
It's us too.

276
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:14,522
We have to take responsibility too.
We shit on ourselves.

277
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,554
We-we scrutinize ourselves.

278
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:18,654
We-we-we...

279
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:21,521
we think that
self-deprecation is modesty.

280
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,721
It's not.
It's self-obsession,

281
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,554
and there's no room
for anything else.

282
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,854
You think... you think
Mother Theresa walked around

283
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:30,822
complaining that the tops
of her thighs touched?

284
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:35,555
I mean, they didn't.
She was stick thin, the fucking bitch.

285
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:43,621
But she wasn't like,
"Okay, this is fine, okay?

286
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,587
But it's like then I clench
and it's all oatmeal."

287
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,055
No, she was busy.

288
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,987
She had things to do.

289
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,887
You know one thing I've noticed,
people who say the phrase,

290
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:58,287
"Threw me under the bus,"

291
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,955
um, say it lot.

292
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,654
You know?

293
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:09,054
And I don't think it's because they get
thrown under the bus a lot.

294
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:12,587
I think it's because they...
they deflect blame a lot.

295
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:16,254
I think it's because
they look inward not a lot.

296
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:19,254
And I... you know,
Jesus had a great quote...

297
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:24,221
and I know all his quotes are great.
There's no Jesus B-sides.

298
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,421
But...

299
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:30,054
and I'm paraphrasing...
but it's basically like,

300
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:33,721
"If you don't deal
with your shit, your shit deals with you."

301
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,754
You know, but it had
like "doth" in it.

302
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,354
And... it's so true.

303
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:43,454
And I made a short list
that I think can help

304
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,187
people who don't
look inward ever.

305
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,421
Um, one:

306
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,454
if you quit being cunty,

307
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:54,355
the whole world will
stop being against you.

308
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:01,854
If you have terrible luck
with roommates,

309
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,222
you're the terrible roommate.

310
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:07,322
It's you, doll.

311
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,987
If you feel like
the whole world is judging you

312
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,721
all the time,

313
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,655
you're an alcoholic.

314
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,888
I don't know why,
but specifically alcohol.

315
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,287
Dear sirs,

316
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,554
your middle-aged pierced ear

317
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,555
tells a different story
than you think it does.

318
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,721
To women of a certain age:

319
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:38,287
your heartbreaking
and drastic attempts to look younger

320
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:39,987
are the reason your daughter

321
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,422
doesn't dream about her future.

322
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:50,721
Insecurity burbles up

323
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,221
in all corners of us, you know.

324
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:55,121
Either you have a chip
on your shoulder,

325
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,754
you feel like people are
disrespecting you all the time,

326
00:18:57,755 --> 00:19:00,554
or you get really braggy.

327
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,521
You want people
to know who you know,

328
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:04,687
but you, like, hide it
by shitting on them.

329
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:08,354
Like, "How many fucking videos

330
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,754
of a monkey
smelling his assy fingers

331
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,287
and falling out of a tree
can Helen Mirren send me?

332
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:16,355
It's like ridic."

333
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:22,422
Look at my space work there.

334
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,454
It's impressive, isn't it?

335
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,421
What does that tell you?
BlackBerry.

336
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,987
Guess what?
Guess what?

337
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:31,821
I don't even own a BlackBerry.

338
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,121
I shadowed someone who does

339
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,255
for months...

340
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,622
to do that bit.

341
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,954
There are people that...
it's their survival.

342
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:46,854
It's the way they
deal with life,

343
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,554
to see themselves differently

344
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,654
than the way the rest
of the world sees them, you know.

345
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,687
You get the idea
if these people were

346
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,587
one or two degrees
more onto themselves,

347
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,921
they'd fucking kill themselves.

348
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:01,787
I consider myself one of them.

349
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,887
I get out of the shower
and I'm like,

350
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:08,155
"Nice try, mirror.
Those are obviously my mom's boobs."

351
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,921
Sometimes insecurity
proves you right.

352
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,487
I mean, I...

353
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:21,754
when I moved to L.A.,
I had an eyebrow.

354
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:25,987
And my roommate
at the time was like,

355
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,921
"Hey, let's go
make this into two.

356
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:32,388
Like, each eye
can have one."

357
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:35,921
And so I went
to her waxing lady.

358
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:38,187
I had never been
to like a waxing lady

359
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:41,487
and the lady called me in
and I'm like following her into a room

360
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,187
and she turns around
and she goes,

361
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:45,622
"What are we doing today?
Just the mustache?"

362
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:55,387
I don't have a mustache.

363
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,221
What?
I bleach my mustache.

364
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,755
That means it's invisible.

365
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,288
Bright yellow means
you can't see it.

366
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:13,254
But she did, she waxed it,
and I remember walking out of the door

367
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:17,055
and being like...
I could feel the wind on it, you know?

368
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,055
What about this one?

369
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:24,354
"Yeah, whatever."

370
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:26,087
That, like,
jerk-off thing.

371
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,787
I believe
that's from insecurity.

372
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,321
"Yeah, whatever.

373
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,021
Pfftt."

374
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,187
What is a guy saying
when he does that?

375
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:36,987
He's saying, "Whatever it is
we're talking about here,

376
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:39,454
I don't give a shit."

377
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:41,754
Really?

378
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,021
I think you do give a shit.

379
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:46,822
If he didn't give a shit,
wouldn't he be just be like...

380
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,555
I think you do
give a shit, sir.

381
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:01,687
What is he saying? He's saying,
"Whatever it is we're talking about here,

382
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,921
please don't think I care.

383
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,854
Oh my God, I would die
if you thought I cared.

384
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,621
In exchange,

385
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:12,755
feel free to know
my personal jerking-off style.

386
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,721
It is so important to me

387
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:22,421
that you think I don't care about whatever
it is we're talking about here,

388
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:26,021
I'm willing to exchange that
for you knowing

389
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:29,721
that my masturbation style
is that, like,

390
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:31,887
I don't...
I don't move my hand.

391
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:35,022
My hand is still
and I, like, fuck my hand.

392
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,421
My hand is locked.
And then, like,

393
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:44,288
I fuck... I pretend
it's a vagina. I'm not a faggot.

394
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:47,787
And I fuck my hand.

395
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,654
I make it like
she's shorter than me.

396
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:52,554
Like it's lower and I have
to like scoop it in.

397
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:54,887
Oh, fuck you.

398
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:57,087
Sometimes I say it.
I go, 'Scoop.

399
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:59,421
Scoop.

400
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,622
Scoop.'

401
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:07,454
But please don't think
I care. Oh my God.

402
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:09,322
I would die."

403
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,787
Traumatic things
happened to that guy.

404
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:17,121
Traumatic things happened
to all of you, by the way.

405
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,087
Traumatic things
happened to all of us.

406
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:21,054
We just don't
realize it because

407
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:24,454
there's no music
informing us how to feel

408
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:27,221
or what's gonna come up.
There's no slow motion.

409
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:31,187
It just happens in real time and then
the next moment and the next moment.

410
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,987
My sister used to babysit me
when I was three.

411
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:36,821
And she would... she would...

412
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:40,887
okay, I used to think this was
a heartbreaking story about me.

413
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,987
It's a heartbreaking story
about my sister Susie,

414
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,254
because she was so, um...

415
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,821
she was so starved for love,

416
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:50,987
she was so needy for love.

417
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:54,454
And she would come out
and she'd say,

418
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:57,187
"Sarah, if I drink
this orange juice,

419
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,422
I'm gonna turn
into a monster."

420
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:05,654
And I was so scared.
I wish I had the foresight to say,

421
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:09,221
"Hey, how about don't even
pour the orange juice?"

422
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:12,954
But I didn't. I didn't think
that far ahead. I was three.

423
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,721
And I'd go...
"Susie, no no!"

424
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,455
She'd go...

425
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:22,354
whip open the laundry nook

426
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:25,087
and put on this brown
leather ski mask...

427
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,087
which why the Silverman family
needed a brown leather ski mask

428
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:31,321
I still do not know.

429
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:34,421
She puts it on and she like...

430
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:37,087
I mean I thought
I was going to die.

431
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:40,255
I felt the feeling of I'm going
to die when I was three.

432
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:44,387
And then this is what's
so heartbreaking, she'd go...

433
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,154
"I will only turn back
into Susie

434
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,222
if you hug me."

435
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,187
Like, I wish I had
the wherewithal to be like,

436
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:58,154
"Suse, you want a hug?
I'd love to hug you.

437
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:01,988
Let's cut out the middleman
where I shit my pants."

438
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:09,187
But instead I'm inching towards

439
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:13,688
this monster
I'm terrified of to hug it.

440
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:20,754
Oh God, I'm sorry. That's every
relationship I've ever been in.

441
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:24,622
There you go.
Breakthrough on stage, HBO Special.

442
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,754
She would take the...
that threw me for a loop.

443
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,521
She'd take the biggest knife
out of the kitchen drawer

444
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:36,822
and be like, "It's so funny.
Like, I could kill you right now.

445
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:39,822
Isn't that funny?"

446
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:43,587
She gets so upset
when I bring this up.

447
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:45,421
No, she's so sweet now.
And she...

448
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,087
it literally makes her cry
when I bring this up,

449
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,154
but thank God, umm...

450
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:52,187
she doesn't have HBO.

451
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:55,121
But she's like this

452
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,854
liberal, hippy, feminist rabbi

453
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:00,854
that lives in Israel now
and she's got five kids

454
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:04,054
and her oldest daughter is
going to Brandeis next year,

455
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:08,554
which is... only from Israel
can going to Brandeis

456
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,721
be a step down
in Jewy-ness.

457
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:12,754
I don't know if you're familiar

458
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,387
with Brandeis.
It's not technically a Jewish school,

459
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:19,021
but I think the team mascot
is a nose.

460
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:21,122
If that helps you at all.

461
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:31,387
Okay, this would be terrible
if I had just made it up.

462
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,922
I didn't.
This is really upsetting.

463
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:36,954
But the University
of North Carolina

464
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:39,754
did a study and what
they found was that

465
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:42,954
9/11 widows
give great handjobs.

466
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,288
And I...

467
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:49,388
Don't shoot the messenger.

468
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,721
I wish it wasn't true, but...

469
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:55,387
or I am happy for them
and their new...

470
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:57,522
boyfriends.

471
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:10,787
I made that up.
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:13,021
I made that up.

473
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,987
I thought of it
and it made me giggle,

474
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,654
and then I got really sad,

475
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,321
and then I still needed
to say it to you.

476
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:23,621
I don't know what part of me

477
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,321
needs to say to you

478
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,721
that 9/11 widows
give great handjobs.

479
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:29,821
That's dark.

480
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:33,322
That's something I'm gonna
talk about in therapy.

481
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:38,121
But I wanted to say it.

482
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:41,621
I needed to say it to you,
and so I built a frame around it

483
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:44,388
that forced you to not be able
to blame me for saying it.

484
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:48,454
And... but you know what?

485
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:51,388
I feel like you should
take some of the blame.

486
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,487
Honestly, because you decided

487
00:27:56,488 --> 00:28:01,087
to believe that
the University of North Carolina

488
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:05,521
would spend money
on a study of, what?

489
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:09,121
Trauma-based handjobs?
That's crazy.

490
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:13,288
You're crazy.
You're being crazy right now.

491
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:19,122
Hmm, I need more rape jokes.

492
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:25,221
I do. I... rape jokes are
a hidden gem in comedy.

493
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:28,021
Let me explain.
Rape, obviously

494
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,754
the most heinous
crime imaginable.

495
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:33,221
Rape jokes

496
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:35,021
are great.

497
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:36,954
No, because they make a comic

498
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:39,921
seem so edgy and so dangerous.

499
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,221
And the truth is
it's like the safest area

500
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,021
to talk about in comedy,

501
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,354
because who is gonna complain
about a rape joke?

502
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,821
I mean,
I would say rape victims,

503
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:51,522
but they're traditionally
not complainers.

504
00:28:57,622 --> 00:28:59,687
I know.
That's a tasteless joke

505
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,554
about the fact
that rape victims

506
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,888
often don't report rape.

507
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:12,021
I mean, the worst thing that could
happen really is someone comes up to you

508
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,854
after a show
and is like, "Look,

509
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:17,021
I'm a victim of rape
and I just wanna say

510
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:20,321
I thought that joke was insensitive
and inappropriate

511
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:24,088
and totally my fault
and I am so sorry."

512
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:27,554
Yeah! Right?

513
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:30,655
Let's take back the night back.

514
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:36,454
Oh God. I hope I don't
have to say that,

515
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,988
you know, no woman
is asking to be raped.

516
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,987
I actually do think
there are some women

517
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:46,388
who are asking
to be motorboated.

518
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,021
I have a dog

519
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:57,354
who is 19 years old

520
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,087
and that's true.

521
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,954
And he... you know,
sometimes the audience claps

522
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:03,687
because they're
really happy for me

523
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,354
that I took care
of a 19-year-old...

524
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,154
No, forget it now!

525
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:08,822
Don't. Stop.

526
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,987
He has got these
beautiful big blue eyes

527
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:20,855
floating over his
big brown eyes and he, um...

528
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:27,654
His breath, um...

529
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,887
I've really really
thought about this.

530
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:33,954
His breath smells like

531
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:36,354
if all the farts

532
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:38,554
from all the different,
like, cultures

533
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:42,555
and nations in the world
combine together...

534
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:47,022
and then passed through
my grandpa's teeth.

535
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:55,221
And he was constipated
and it's so heartbreaking.

536
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,487
You know, when a dog gets
constipated and they...

537
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,887
you can tell because
their little knees like quiver.

538
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,721
They quiver.

539
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:05,087
And he's pushing so hard
and then, like,

540
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,121
something broke through

541
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:09,987
and his mouth made a shape

542
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:12,821
I've never seen on a dog.

543
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:16,854
I didn't know it was possible.
It was like a perfect circle.

544
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,755
Like, "Ohh!"

545
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:28,787
And his little tiny rectum
was bleeding...

546
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:29,887
Awww.

547
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,154
...and I went to take
a picture and I...

548
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,855
for the vet.

549
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:40,887
"The vet"...

550
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:42,954
is what I call Twitter.

551
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:45,421
And...

552
00:31:45,422 --> 00:31:47,154
You know, when you
take a picture,

553
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,354
but it's video
and you don't realize it?

554
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:52,487
It was basically a picture,
but it was like a second and a half

555
00:31:52,488 --> 00:31:54,387
and it had breath,

556
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:57,522
ended with me
going like, "Urg."

557
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:02,755
He's great now.
He shits like crazy.

558
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,354
Only thing that keeps him
from shitting in his pants

559
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:08,754
is he... he...
he doesn't wear pants.

560
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,588
That's a terrible joke.

561
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:15,454
If you do have a dog,
here's a great game.

562
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:18,287
You're gonna love this.
When you're having sex,

563
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:21,055
lock eyes with your dog.

564
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:32,987
And then you see
who looks away first.

565
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:35,088
It's a fun game.

566
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:44,521
Pussy.
"Pussy" is a word...

567
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,354
it used to have
so much power over me.

568
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:49,654
When I was in high school,
the word "pussy,"

569
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:52,621
it was so...
it grossed me out

570
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,221
and yet it was titillating
and I just had...

571
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,421
I felt like I had
Christmas lights inside me.

572
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,521
It just affected me so much.

573
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:01,254
I don't even understand how,

574
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:04,587
but when I was young it was
like if somebody said it

575
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:06,654
or if I read it somewhere

576
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,755
or sometimes I would write it
down and look at it...

577
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,821
Now I'm just dead inside.

578
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:16,455
Pussy, pussy.
Who cares?

579
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,287
I found a way to make "pussy"

580
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:23,654
gross again.
It's so simple.

581
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:27,321
All you have to do is puff out
your cheeks when you say it.

582
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:30,322
Like, "Puhssy."

583
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:39,522
Puhssy. Puhssy.

584
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,621
Now say that becomes old hat,

585
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,387
you can add some elements:

586
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:50,821
um, a deadness in the eyes,

587
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,854
a lisp.

588
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:56,155
"Puthy."

589
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:05,787
"Hey, man, you wanna go out
and look for some puthy?"

590
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:07,688
Puthy. Puthy.

591
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:17,188
You look so confused.

592
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:21,154
You don't know how to feel.
Just like me

593
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:24,588
when I first heard "puthy."

594
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:31,521
If you're drunk and throw up

595
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:35,021
on a man's penis
mid-blowjob,

596
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:39,522
you can save the moment
if you can muster a "ta-da."

597
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,854
I love you guys.

598
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,187
This is embarrassing.
This is a...

599
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:54,354
this is a confession, okay?

600
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,254
Uh.

601
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:59,787
Sometimes I get an orgasm

602
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:01,854
from giving a blowjob.

603
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:04,854
Is that normal?
Is that, like...

604
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,254
to get an orgasm
from giving a...

605
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:10,588
oh, not giving a blowjob,
taking a shit.

606
00:35:16,788 --> 00:35:18,787
Ohh.

607
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:22,154
I... you don't understand.
I'm at a show too.

608
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,887
You're my show and that joke...

609
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:28,087
is so fun to tell
because, like,

610
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:31,254
at the first juncture,
the guys are like this,

611
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:34,355
and the girls are like this.

612
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:38,322
And then it just goes whoo!

613
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:41,355
It's like the wave.

614
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,687
Don't forget God
can see you masturbating.

615
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:51,188
But don't stop.
He's almost there.

616
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,088
I'm just kidding.
There's no God.

617
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,887
I believe in miracles though.

618
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:07,321
I really do.
I mean, they're obviously science-based.

619
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:09,154
But...

620
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,921
they're beyond
my comprehension,

621
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:13,554
so to me they're miracles.
That's what miracles are.

622
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:16,587
And we are miracles.

623
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,887
Think about this:
every single person

624
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:21,187
in this room tonight, all 39...

625
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,387
including me, 40 of us,

626
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:25,754
there was a time in history...

627
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:28,687
a blip ago in the scope
of history...

628
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:32,988
where we were all
microscopic specks.

629
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:42,055
That was far out, right?
Everybody got deep.

630
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:46,287
There was a time where you
could fit a million of me

631
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,121
on the head of a pin.

632
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,354
There was a time where
I lived in my dad's balls.

633
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:54,055
That's the only life I knew.

634
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,087
There was a time
where I literally

635
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:01,122
was choking on my dad's cum.

636
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,688
I was five.
No, I'm just kidding.

637
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:10,722
That's disgusting.

638
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:13,154
Erase.

639
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:15,922
That's not part
of that joke. I...

640
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,587
It's just it went
in my head and then I...

641
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,855
I couldn't be alone with it.

642
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:29,221
There was a time... my dad,
Donny "Schleppy" Silverman,

643
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:33,787
who does my taxes,
who I Skype with every Saturday...

644
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:36,021
there was a time

645
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:39,155
where I literally exploded...

646
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:44,954
out of the-guy-who-
taught-me-to-ski's

647
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:46,855
penis hole.

648
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,688
I can't believe
I was ever that thin.

649
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,388
I'm an Obama person.

650
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,622
Yeah?

651
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,754
I like him.
I've liked Obama

652
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:12,821
since before he ran
for president the first time,

653
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,254
when he was a senator
in Chicago.

654
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:17,521
Not like I'm so smart
or hoity-toity.

655
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:20,388
I just... he was on Letterman
and I thought he was cool.

656
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:25,687
And I remember when he decided
to run for president,

657
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:28,154
I was like, "I'm gonna
work on that campaign."

658
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:31,254
And I did. And because
I live in Los Angeles,

659
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:34,054
I could go
to this fundraiser out here

660
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:37,221
that was just star-studded,
like a who's-who.

661
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:40,454
And you could walk... you know,
he was just a senator at the time,

662
00:38:40,455 --> 00:38:43,154
so you could walk right up
to him and pet him

663
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,988
and I did.

664
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,321
I wanted to think
of something smart to say

665
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:52,521
or a question to ask and I was
like...

666
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:56,887
"Senator Obama, when you were
a student in Boston,

667
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:59,754
did you ever encounter
any racism?"

668
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,387
And I'll never forget
what he said. He said...

669
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:05,988
he said, "I'm Kanye West."

670
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:21,354
And I was like, "Totally.

671
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:24,187
I'm Kanye West too.
We all are.

672
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:26,955
I get it. I get it."

673
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:33,421
We're so divided.
We live in a very divided country.

674
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:36,187
Like, it's crazy, you know?

675
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,687
It's not even about

676
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:40,254
ideas anymore.

677
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,321
It's not even
about ideals anymore.

678
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:45,087
It's just teams.
It's just the Red Sox and the Yankees.

679
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,187
It's just hatred, you know?

680
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:49,487
And I think whether
you're liberal

681
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:52,121
or you're conservative,
it's so important to remember

682
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:56,154
that we, all of us,
love our families,

683
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:58,221
love our country,

684
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:01,987
believe what
we're doing is right.

685
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:04,921
You know, maybe liberals
are a little more open-minded,

686
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,721
a little more progressive.

687
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:10,621
You know, maybe conservatives
are a little less progressive,

688
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,055
a little more faggotish.

689
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:17,022
But I pray for them.

690
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:19,821
I do.

691
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,954
I was just literally praying

692
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:26,787
for the billions of teeny,
tiny Republicans

693
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:30,822
that die every single year
in hookers' assholes.

694
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:39,287
I know what some
of you are thinking,

695
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:40,954
and you're right, you're right.

696
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,921
"Really? That's what you're gonna
pick on, the Republican Party?

697
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:46,454
That's what you're pick...
choosing to pick on?

698
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:49,487
You know, I mean,
surely there are Democrats

699
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,821
that have butt sex with prostitutes."
You're right.

700
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:55,021
You're 100% right.
There are.

701
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:59,954
But Democrats aren't trying
to take my rights away.

702
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:02,087
So when a Democrat

703
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:05,421
gives a hooker anal warts,

704
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:10,155
she can then go to a clinic
and get that shit zapped.

705
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:21,354
It's just bewildering
to me that a party

706
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,587
that is so about having
big government

707
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:27,487
out of their backyard
is so intent

708
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,855
on legislating my "puthy,"

709
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:34,287
my pussy.

710
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:37,122
My pu... my pussy.

711
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:44,287
People don't make
the simplest connections, you know?

712
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,287
Hmm, I feel like
I have shit here.

713
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:48,187
I don't?

714
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:49,922
That'd be my biggest fear.

715
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:54,387
Okay. Do I have
anything in my teeth?

716
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:55,688
I ate blueberries.

717
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:05,121
Yeah, people don't make
the simplest connections.

718
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,321
I think because we're
so close to our own lives,

719
00:42:08,322 --> 00:42:11,254
you know, but even in deep ways,
but even in not deep...

720
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,354
like I used to work
at a club...

721
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:15,254
like a music club
kinda like this.

722
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,287
It had tables and I was...

723
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:19,687
you know, I lit the candles
at the tables

724
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:22,021
and put the fliers
out and stuff.

725
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,487
And the band that was playing
had sound check.

726
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:27,087
And they did
their sound check and left.

727
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:29,054
But the drummer stayed
and she was just

728
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:31,487
sitting at her drums,
watching me set up.

729
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:33,987
And I was talking to her
and I made some stupid joke

730
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:36,555
and she goes,
"Ba-dum-bump."

731
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:48,155
I was like, "You know that
comes from drums, right?

732
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:53,222
You're sitting at drums."

733
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:57,387
It's like people who go,

734
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,287
"Don't get your dog
from a breeder!

735
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:02,854
Get your dog from a shelter.
You're a fucking asshole

736
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,654
if you get your dog
from a breeder."

737
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:06,887
Okay, I agree.
I got my dog from a shelter.

738
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,354
But it's always coming
from a woman who's like

739
00:43:09,355 --> 00:43:11,921
nursing a baby
with four other kids

740
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,721
and I just wanna say like,

741
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:16,155
"Get your people
from a shelter.

742
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:26,155
You know there are human
puppies in shelters, right?"

743
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:31,987
But people don't like people
as much as they like dogs

744
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:35,121
'cause they don't... they don't
see what they hate in themselves

745
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:38,254
looking back
in a dog's eyes, you know?

746
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:41,354
If Africa was just
all Labradoodles

747
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,088
dying of AIDS...

748
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:48,588
we would take care of it
in one day.

749
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:54,887
But I wanna have kids.

750
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:57,387
I'm great with kids.
I am.

751
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,321
I have a lot of bits.

752
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:03,154
Like little girls between,
like, two and six-ish,

753
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:05,888
I like to go like this, I go...

754
00:44:06,922 --> 00:44:09,387
"I'm gonna tell you a secret.

755
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,488
You cannot tell anybody.

756
00:44:15,088 --> 00:44:17,288
I'm a princess.

757
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:23,688
But I dress regular
so people treat me normal."

758
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:28,921
And their brains
fucking explode.

759
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:30,387
It's so funny.

760
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:32,854
And then the rest of the day,
they're spying me

761
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:35,454
like I'm a celebrity,
which I know I am,

762
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,854
but a lot of toddlers
don't know that.

763
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:40,755
And it does,
it levels the playing field.

764
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:45,787
Or boys or girls like toddler age,
like two-year-olds,

765
00:44:45,788 --> 00:44:47,721
if their parents, like,
introduce me,

766
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:50,822
I like to go,
"I'm your new mommy."

767
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:55,287
They're so into
their mommies at that age.

768
00:44:55,288 --> 00:44:58,188
- They're always like...
- "No, you're not."

769
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:04,187
And then I go,
"I'm just kidding."

770
00:45:04,188 --> 00:45:06,754
And then just
as they start to relax,

771
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:09,788
I go,
"I'm your real mommy."

772
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:13,855
That's more just fun for me.

773
00:45:15,188 --> 00:45:17,821
But I do, I want a baby.

774
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:20,487
The thing with me is,
like, the caveat is

775
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:23,721
I don't want like
a 10-year-old in 10 years.

776
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,887
You know what I mean?
I want a baby.

777
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:28,821
I figured out a solution
I think works for me.

778
00:45:28,822 --> 00:45:31,754
I'm not preaching it
to anybody, but, um,

779
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:34,521
like, I think
I'm gonna adopt, like,

780
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:36,655
terminally-ill babies...

781
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:45,355
every six months
to two years-ish or...

782
00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:52,287
I feel like there is
a blanket of judgment

783
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:54,788
in this area.

784
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:58,154
Why?

785
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,121
Are you thinking,
"What kind of person would look

786
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:03,754
to adopt a dying baby?"
I mean,

787
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:07,288
I think an amazing person.

788
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,488
I'm amazing.

789
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:13,921
I have a hu...
my heart is too big.

790
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:15,954
Like, I can't take it.

791
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:19,587
My heart can't take...
I don't like being made to feel.

792
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:22,587
Like Pixar movies?
No fucking way.

793
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:25,587
"Wall-E"?
Like the idea to me

794
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:28,955
of a lonely robot
in space breaks me.

795
00:46:32,888 --> 00:46:35,554
Good, bad...
I don't wanna feel.

796
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:38,087
I don't like it. Like, my mother
sent me an email that said,

797
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:41,621
"Elephants reunite
after 20 years!"

798
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:43,887
Delete.

799
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:46,387
I am not even gonna read that.

800
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,387
That will kill me.
I'm afraid it will kill me.

801
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:53,454
Those commercials
with a starving kid in Africa

802
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:56,421
with flies buzzing around him?
I have to remind myself, like,

803
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:58,888
"It's just an actor.
It's just an actor."

804
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,721
I love being able
to see all 39 of you.

805
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:14,387
Like, it's so cool.

806
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:17,221
But you know who's amazing
is the Make-a-Wish Foundation.

807
00:47:17,222 --> 00:47:20,521
Just to... you know, they...
if you're not familiar with what they do,

808
00:47:20,522 --> 00:47:23,987
they work with terminally-ill
children and young adults.

809
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:27,254
And what they will do
is they will grant these kids

810
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:29,821
any wish they dream up,

811
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:31,854
except for not dying.

812
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:34,787
Which I feel like
I'm being nitpicky,

813
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:37,354
'cause what they do
is amazing, but like,

814
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,421
I feel like that's gonna
be maybe even like 60%

815
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,387
of their #1 wishes.

816
00:47:42,388 --> 00:47:44,587
I just feel like

817
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:47,121
if there was a suggestion box
or something,

818
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:50,755
I'd say, "Maybe call it
Make-another-Wish."

819
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:05,255
You guys did a great job.

820
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:09,155
I'm gonna reward you
with an incredible song.

821
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,455
Oh oh.

822
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,322
Is this in tune?

823
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,087
Are you a musician?

824
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:25,821
Oh, you should get a haircut.

825
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:27,488
All right.

826
00:48:32,888 --> 00:48:35,155
Let's make this
real hot and sexy.

827
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:41,255

Good night!

860
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:54,954
Hey, how did it go?

861
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,754
Oh, it was, uh...

862
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:58,387
you know, it's hard to say

863
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,054
'cause it's me and it's...

864
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:02,121
comedy is so subjective,
you know.

865
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:04,554
But I guess if I had
to say in one word,

866
00:51:04,555 --> 00:51:08,154
I'd describe it as,
like, "game changer."

867
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:10,521
Oh, that's two words,
what am I saying?

868
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,254
Um...

869
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,554
"mind blowing."

870
00:51:13,555 --> 00:51:15,487
That's two words again, God!

871
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:17,754
Okay, I'm gonna have
to describe it in two words.

872
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:20,688
Uh, "great job, Sarah."

873
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:25,255
Hey!

874
00:51:59,745 --> 00:53:12,237
